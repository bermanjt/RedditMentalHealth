0,"So I (16F) stopped talking to this person (16M) two years ago but a month ago we started texting and lately he's been wanting to hang out again. 

The reason why I distanced myself away from him was because he admitted that he was in love with me and asked me to the 8th grade prom thing. The thing is that I'm a lesbian and not attracted to him at all. I didn't tell him at first because I was in the closet back then, plus his family is religious and I didn't know how he would react. He was very understanding, accepting and still wanted to be friends. I agreed but things weren't the same after that. He never did anything but I still started feel really uncomfortable around him and eventually we drifted apart. 

We started texting again earlier this month and now he's been asking if I want to hang out again. I do and don't at the same time. I want to because I've been kinda lonely lately and had a huge falling out with another friend recently but I don't want because I still feel uneasy about everything, especially since he doesn't have a gf and I'm worried he still feels the same about me.

Is this normal or am I being paranoid?",01Oct2020,1

8,"Hi all,

I'm in a bit of a weird situation and I've never had to deal with it before so I'm hoping that I've posted this to right place for some advice.

So, some backstory:

Me (30F) and DH(35M) have been living together for just over a year, he has been living in an apartment complex for over 10 years with no issues and he's one of the sweetest people you'd ever meet and I'm not really a confrontational person. I moved in with him and his neighbour(50+F) very quickly introduced herself to me. Everything was great with her for the first 6-8 months, she would come over to eat with us, we helped her out a lot with things in her apartment (my partner would be over there at least once a week, most of the time I went with him) and we would go shopping for her every other week or so. I honestly thought that she and I were becoming friends, as we would talk nearly everyday about pretty things you would normally talk about with someone you liked. Only thing that I noticed that isn't so good was her drinking habit, she is basically an alcoholic which only became more noticeable in the latter months.

So, the issue and the title:

DH was at work, after work he goes to visit his dad and then comes home. Monday to Friday. So a month or so ago he came in a little earlier than normal and shouted ""we are never helping HER again!"" and pointed to the side of our good neighbour, I began asking why and what happened but he was fuming, he loudly said that ""she told people that I raped her!"", I got angry and asked who. He said he didn't know her but she verbally assaulted him as he was walking home told him to never go near her (the neighbour) again and other threats.

Our neighbour knocked on our door and basically tried to down play the whole thing, she said that the person who told DH this was crazy and she knows he didn't do that to her. I was then angry at the person who verbally assaulted DH and I was on a mission to find her, to which I did - we had a conversation with not only her but our neighbours sister and showed us the messages that our neighbour sent to them, neither saying the exact same thing but both saying that DH sexually assaulted her. Our neighbours sister warned us to stay away from her sister because this wasn't the first time she has done this and she has lied constantly her whole life. I asked about a couple of things that the neighbour had told me - none of which were true and I felt so betrayed. Our neighbour actually thought that I was an idiot, that he was coming to her because I couldn't satisfy him and couple of other things that weren't remotely true but to prove it he would have to take his pants off.

SO! We decided that we were never helping her again, I suggested to DH that he should file a police report and make a formal complaint about her false allegations to the company that owns the properties but he didn't want the police involved so we notified the property management company - nothing was done. Since then she has been knocking on the door every week telling us that we needed to help her with things in her apartment, we would take it in turns to turn her away with the excuse of ""sorry, we are busy"". I've answered the door the few times she has this look of annoyance and hatred plus she has been standing very close to our front door (it opens outwards) and I honestly think that she is trying to get hit with our door so she'd have something on us. 

I don't want her to knock on our door anymore. DH's patience is wearing thin and I'm worried that if we turn her away anymore that she'll end up attacking me. Nobody else in the building will talk to her because of what she's done. I want to tell her to politely FO but I don't know how - any help on this?",01Oct2020,1

He never used to be like this but now he barks crazily when he sees another dog and if he goes up to it he will chase it and try biting it. I no longer take him anywhere because of this, I only take him on short walks around the neighbourhood and avoid any other dogs although he will bark and pull if he sees one.

10,"I feel like I can't tell my therapist certain things because of how biased they are. I told my mom that I wanted to get a different person or just not go at all and she brushed it off. 

I would rather get a different therapist instead because I really can't deal with this myself but others are expensive and may not work either. 

I feel like my current lady doesn't always understand me. She originaly was supposed to meet at school and I told her I didn't want to because it makes school feel like a doctor's office and she still recommended meeting there. My mom knew I never wanted to meet at school when we talked about started the therapy process.

So any advice for what I should do? Things are starting to get worse.",01Oct2020,1
11,"I'll get straight to the point. I'm in love with a guy who might or might not love me. We both know that we more than ""like"" each other. We text each other everyday and always want to be together. We can't because of Covid-19 and because we go to different schools.

Like I said I am in love with him, but I am thinking about telling him he deserves better and that he should forget about me and be with someone else that could possibly make him more happy than I was able to for him. I'll admit I'm getting more insecure each day and feeling like I don't deserve anything or anyone. School has been stressing me out more due to the fact there's a lot of school work and the fact I have no motivation to do any of my work not even a little of me caring about the fact I can fail.

Back to the main point, is it bad of me to just let him go and hope for him to be happier. All I want is for him to be happy that's all i care about whether if it's me making him happy or someone else I want him to be happy after all he's going through right now. But I don't want to make him sad.

I have brought up the fact telling him I don't feel like i deserve him and then he tells me that I do deserve him. I feel like something is taking over my emotions which is causing me to think these sorts of things. I don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR please tell me what you guys think I'm sorry if this was very long. If you need me to answer something I'll answer it. I just want someone's advice and what they think I should do even though it's my choice I would like to hear someone else's response.",01Oct2020,1
12,"I haven't been myself mentally for months. I lost my waitress job back in March and I've been stuck at home for the last 6+ months. I can't even move back to college because this entire year is gonna be online. My anxiety became unbareble from April-beginning of September. It still isn't great, but I'm only anxious like 60% of the time. I couldn't even find the energy to watch TV/read or anything, all I could do was think and Google my worries. I had panic attacks for the first time in my life and became consumed with this feeling of hopelessness, like ""what's the point, this virus will never end, my 20s will be wasted hiding from this virus and 20s are supposed to be your best years, everything is crap, there's gonna be a recession etc."". I was losing sleep and started comfort eating again. These feelings extended to possibly the best thing is my life- my BF of almost 2 years. 

I spent months thinking about my BF's flaws over and over. I kept coming up with all these reasons we wouldn't work in my head and frantically looked for red flags. There might be a few, but he's a sweet guy who adores me, there's no abuse or cheating. We did fight a lot during June &amp; July, maybe everyday, mostly over video call?. Our mental issues don't mix. It didn't help that I didn't see him for all of April  &amp; May (thanks lockdown) and since then I've been seeing him like 2 days a week. We saw each other almost daily, thanks to college and him not working, for 18 months, so this was a huge change. About 6 weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that I need to end this, it isn't fair, I don't ever want to marry him now with all his flaws. I felt sick with guilt, cried over losing him a few times, but started imaging meeting someone more compatible someday. I kept debating what to do, when to do it etc but I haven't gone through. Thing is, I still love this man, even if I don't feel in love much anymore. I want to give this one last shot. I can't imagine leaving him, let alone never hearing about him again. I wanna know how he is. I still love him, but I want to BE in love with him again. It takes me a few days to miss him and I have barely any interest in sex. I wanna fix it, what can I do?",01Oct2020,1

14,"Long story short an ex of mine posted revenge porn of me on a porn site along with a few other girls he dated. Someone sent me screen shots of it and when I told him about it he wanted to see them so I reluctantly showed him. 

Now he is very upset, he keeps saying things like ‚ÄúI thought he was small‚Äù or ‚Äúi thought he was out of shape‚Äù etc. I know he‚Äôs very hurt by seeing those images. To make matters worse it looks like this may go to court since I was underage at the time and the video was not filmed with my consent. There are also multiple other girls involved and some of which were underage at the time the explicit content was created while he was of legal age. 

This may become a lengthy and painful process for the both of us. What can I do to make him feel secure again? Is there anything I can do to help him during this time? If the process does proceed should I let him be in ‚Äúthe know‚Äù of everything?

15,"I can't sleep so I thought I would make a post about what has been on my mind. This has been weighing on me since my dad told me a week or so ago. 

Me and my dad were arguing about something, I think I was mad because he didn't tell me my nana and auntie were coming over until literally 5 minutes before they did meaning I didn't have a shower and my hair was greasy and I didn't feel presentable. I was asking him (almost yelling, I was angry and I regret it now) to tell me at least an hour before so I could be ready. 

My dad then laughed (but like a humourless kind of laugh) and said he's sick of how I act and how I am ""putting a strain on an already strained household"". I left after he said that. 

I thought about it all week and I feel terrible. I know my parents are going through things, I am too but my problems pale in the face of theirs. They have to deal with work and health. I am stressed over uni and in general just being a bit down, but I keep that all to myself. 

I can't tell my friends about how I feel because I am not good with talking about these feelings and stuff. I felt stupid last time I cried on call to my friends. 

I don't want to be a burden to my family, how do I fix myself?

16,"Sorry for the formatting as this is mobile and I‚Äôm relatively new to posting discussions.

So some background information. My uncle is... well not what most people would find to be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù.  I mostly think of him as a toddler. He whines when things don‚Äôt go his way, swears in front of his two children( both are super young and one is starting to drop F bombs at 2nd grade.), has a terrible job ( the only reason why they get by is because of my aunt), and he basically never helps out or wants to take care of the kids. There‚Äôs more but the important thing is no one in my family really likes him due to how he acts. The word I think is tolerate. They tolerate him.

My aunt is super nice and she‚Äôs pretty alright, not much to say on her that would help the story.

So the story is and I don‚Äôt know exactly all the details, that my uncle heard about some car and wanted to buy it, but didn‚Äôt think to tell his wife or think it important. The car was around full price, ( I don‚Äôt know what type or age), but that was pretty much a year of his salary. He called my father telling him this, on his way to buy the car and even though my father kept saying to not do it and to tell his wife, he just didn‚Äôt do it. 

Keep this in mine they both have cars. His car is only two years old. Two years old.

I‚Äôm not sure exactly why he did not buy it, as I felt it wasn‚Äôt in my place. But the important thing is my aunt still had no idea about any of this. Everyone else knows except her but no one is saying anything to her as they feel that it‚Äôs not their thing to say. 

My aunt is super nice and caring and I feel like she should know that he was even thinking this. I hate conflict and I don‚Äôt want to be the cause of a divorce or relationship problems but I feel like she has a right to know.

What should I do?

17,"So if you need the full story there‚Äôs two relating to this on my profile that give the full details. I‚Äôm trying to keep this as short as possible however, and have a lot to say so long story short my father committed suicide March 28, 2020. I was completely lost and at the absolute darkest place of my life for about 2 months until I started seeing this girl I had known for a long time. She made me feel light when all I could see was darkness and helped me find myself again. The issue is she broke up with me recently and I feel myself falling back into that darkness but it feels so much worse.

My personal theory is as much as she helped me deal with everything I was feeling. I equally used it as a means to hide my emotions and how I really feel, and just feel good when I‚Äôm with her or taking to her. Just not deal with everything and hide it away because she made me feel good enough to do so and I‚Äôd much rather feel good than bad.

This alone wouldn‚Äôt be that bad, I‚Äôve dealt with heartbreak before and understand the trauma of my father is something that will affect me for a long time and I‚Äôm ready to deal with that. The issue comes with the fact that I‚Äôve been feeling certain feelings I‚Äôve never felt before and only been described by past girlfriends/old friends.

Essentially how I‚Äôm feeling lately is I have absolutely no willpower to get out of bed or leave my room unless I work and the only reason I go to work is because I don‚Äôt want to be homeless because that would make all my problems infinitely worse. I don‚Äôt have the energy to clean, cook, even play video game‚Äôs I literally spend my weekends sitting in my bed on my phone scrolling through stuff until I‚Äôm so hungry I think I might die, get shitty fast food, barely eat, then repeat until I work.

I eat well when I work because I have a very physically demanding job and if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll actually drop on the job. But other than that my diet is currently garbage. I used to love cooking..

On top of the lack of energy to do basically anything except go to work and come home, I find myself extremely tired. However I don‚Äôt sleep, I average maybe 2 hours a night for the last few weeks and am in a constant state of I need to pass out right now but no matter what I do all that happens is restless tossing and turning.

The cherry on top? I used to be extremely social, I loved going and and seeing people, talking with strangers, just doing anything that involved other people. However lately I get a spike of anxiety when my roommates, who are my best friends since grade 7, so much as open their door because I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôre gonna come and talk to me.

I don‚Äôt know why this is the second they are back in their room I‚Äôm like wtf why don‚Äôt I want them to come see me I love talking to them. But I still get that anxiety when I‚Äôm around a lot of people and a handful of other triggers I haven‚Äôt fully identified.

So yeah I‚Äôm not sure what the fucks happening to me but I do not approve and it‚Äôs really starting to fuck with me in every aspect of my life.

Anyone know what is going on and how to stop it? I‚Äôd greatly appreciate any advice",01Oct2020,1
18,"I recently moved to college and started rooming with two strangers and an acquaintance. I had no experience with the two strangers, let's call them Sabrina and Robbin, but knew their friend, Emma (23F) as an acquaintance. Emma has been really sweet and accepting of me since I've been here. I immediately knew upon meeting Robbin and Sabrina that we didn't have much in common, but being roommates doesn't mean we need to be the best of friends.

Since I just moved to this college town, I don't know many people and have made an attempt to befriend them anyway. This didn't seem to work out as I noticed they spent less time making an effort and more time gossiping about me. I stopped approaching them and focused more on preventing conflict. I try to leave no trace behind when I cook or use the shared living spaces. I've even moved towards staying in my room all day to prevent being a burden on them.

This is where the advice is needed. My bedroom walls are thin. The house is all wood floors. I can hear *any* word spoken in the living room adjacent to my own. Over the past month of my living with them, I continue to hear Robbin and Sabrina gossiping about me and being overly negative. I've now resorted to staying in my room unless I hear them leave the house. I can talk to Sabrina face-to-face perfectly well and she disguises her dislike, but Robbin does little to acknowledge my existence.

I wouldn't sense their negativity if it weren't for the fact I can hear them talking about me through my wall. If I bring it up to them, I'm afraid they'll see it as eavesdropping, despite my inability to drown out voices through any means. 

I'm not a confrontational person and don't know how to approach this if I wanted to have a discussion with them. Where should I start? Should I ignore them? I'm going back home for a bit because not feeling comfortable in my own home as taken a toll on my mental health.

She recently  told the doctor that she would be leaving November 30th a little over 2 months. To say he wasn't  happy is an understatement, my wife probably sees 80 % of the patients if not more, so without her hes SOL.

 I'm 39yr old woman. I'm stuck living with parents thanks to a really bad illness which left me in the hospital for all of February of 2020. Just when I was OK to go back to work I was laid off thank to Covid-19. 

But this issue with my mom has been ongoing for years. Even when she was a kid her (definitely dysfunctional) parents called her a space cadet and stupid. When she gets upset she accuses me, my dad, my brother, of calling that even though we never have.

Sorry, back to the point. She has never been able to hold a long conversation that involves any respectful debate. She gets frustrated and starts yelling and shuts everything down, eventually devolving into making grunting noises so she doesn't have to hear you. This is serious, because we're talking about basic stuff you'd have no problem discussing with a roommate. 

She's 72 now, and half deaf. And always had a hearing delay disorder. While she's never had a great attention span, her increasing frustration has become a problem. For the last couple years it's always walking on eggshells with her with me and my dad. She doesn't seem to have dementia, just normal older forgetfulness.

So, the advice I'm asking for is how do you get an obstinate older parent to at least get a test for ADD? She's under medicare, so cost isn't an issue. It's just that the few tunes I've brought it up she vacillates between ""Yeah, I think I might be,"" and ""How dare you!""

31,"I have shin splints according to my trainer who I've consulted about 10 times and each time says the same thing ; ice it and stretch ( which I do ) I played through the pain last season and all our 3 months of practice + our first game. 

I sat out last game since they were killing me more than usual. Every step I took would feel uncomfortable and felt like someone was stabbing my shins ( whatever that feels like ) 

Today I got to practice after stretching and icing it last night again and the pain is too much. So there I go to tell him that I can't take it anymore and he just recommends strength training which id have to look up myself and do at home( no problem with that ) 

I go back to practice since he didn't tell me to sit out and do what he said or anything like taking a break until my shin splints get better which is what I'm hoping for. So we continue to do a drill to train our midfield and forwards ( im a midfielder ) The drill was 90% running and the pain was unbearable but im good with holding back my tears and so I did for 25 minutes before going to wait for my mom and letting out some tears. Also note that now walking was painful and it used to be only running. 

My dad always says that when he was my age that his calves would hurt and it was because of improper conditioning ( I have had 3 months of conditioning and practice,  im sure thats not it ) My mom just thinks it's an excuse but would totally take me if it wasn't.  

Please what do I do ? :( Everyone is making me feel like its not a big deal while I cry myself to sleep from practice every once in a while as they get worse. Am I making a big deal or should I really push the idea of going to get it checked out ?

My parents are good people btw ! Its just in pretty sure they're brushing this off because they know I dislike soccer and recently told them i wanted to quit as im a senior in high school taking advanced classes and online learning caught me off guard this first quarter and so im behind a bit :( I also have been stressed with not knowing what to do with my life except I know I want to go to college but its just all too much and quiting soccer would definitely make me less stressed.

Hello all,

My girlfriend (26) of 3 months (me 28) recently asked for a few days of space. We just spent a weekend together which was fun, and there were no signs of anything wrong. 

Yesterday, she texted me saying if she can have a few days of space to figure things out. She said she feels overwhelmed with things happening, which could be from her personal and professional life outside of our relationship. 

Of course I respected her request, but did ask if I did anything wrong or offended her, which she reassured that I didn‚Äôt. She said she would talk to me after the weekend.

But recently due to covid, im stuck inside all the time by myself. Its just me, my sister, and my mother. They both have jobs so im home with the dogs most of everyday. My mother told me recently that I need to take one of the dogs on a walk because hes super active and i need to get out. But even the idea of doing that, terrifies me. Im not completely sure why but I think its because I was assaulted at 14/15 by a 19 year old on the bus that took me home from school for 2 weeks and that he followed me to my home a few times, thus knows where I live. He was practically obsessed with me and claimed I looked like an ex of his constantly. I thought we were friends but I was wrong. Im scared of him and the idea of seeing him again (since he lives somewhat close to my neighborhood) makes me even more scared. My mother is aware of what happened. I came out about the incident when I was 16. We tried to get the police to help but nothings come of it. Ive given up in that regard. My mother loves me I know but sometimes she says things that hurt me. She told me today that I use my anxiety to get out of things. I have issues expressing my emotions sometimes so I just shut down. I just wish she'd understand that I can't just stop being afraid. That her telling me that ""im letting him win"" doesn't help even though I know she's trying. I dont know how to tell her that what im feeling is real without her flipping out or getting annoyed. I was supposed to get evaluated months ago, before covid happened. I was actually excited because I was hoping for an answer to why im so scared and paranoid, among other things. That day never came. My therapist apprently told my mother that she thinks I might be schizophrenic. My mother told me that I shouldnt be looking for those kinds of answers. I shouldnt use that as a way to define myself. I dont want that define me. I just want help from people who understand. I dont know what to do. I feel so fucking torn. I love my mother so much. She's my best friend.

Hi, everyone.

I‚Äôm a 25yr old male, I have been straight my entire life and even have a child from a previous relationship. My little girl is a big part of my life of course and am a single dad to the best of my abilities. Anyway, the reason for the post is an event that‚Äôs happened a little while ago and I need help with processing it all.

God this is hard to explain, but basically at a house party, a friend of a friend, who I knew a little already, was vibing with me as mates, having a great time and laughs, the night goes on and everyone is going and he was like ‚Äúyou can always stay here?‚Äù I said I‚Äôd get a taxi and shoot off home, just the way he said it I was like that‚Äôs kind of odd. But didn‚Äôt really question it, in the way home he‚Äôs messaging me and hinting so hard for me to come back and this is turning me on. I‚Äôm confused but I tell the drive to go back, I tell him I‚Äôm on the way and he says ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm not dressed and in bed‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI know, you gonna let me in still?‚Äù He said yeah and think that was his way of checking I knew he was coming onto me.

I get there and he‚Äôs left the door slightly open and told me he‚Äôs waiting upstairs,  and to lock it when I‚Äôm in. I go up and get into my boxers and get in bed, tiny but awkward at first but then we start kissing and like really kissing, hands all over each other. I‚Äôm so turned on and confused but I‚Äôm fairly intoxicated so much more willing to go with the flow. Ends up with me sucking dick for the first time and getting sucked off by a guy for the first time.

After which I have a panic attack, gravity hits at what‚Äôs gone on, all consensual but just felt like I was gonna pass out, he comforts me and says I can stay or sleep in another bed whatever I like. I go and sleep in another room, and leave in the morning after a brief chat.

Since then I‚Äôve watched gay porn and masturbated a few times and we‚Äôve spoken more, and said it‚Äôs our secret etc. But more recently I feel like I kind of want to see him again and explore more. I‚Äôm just so scared that by doing all this just goes against everything I thought I knew about myself. Terrifies me. A younger brother of mine is gay and me and my family have known since he was so young and all love him and it‚Äôs never been an issue. But I‚Äôm straight, have been and been in only straight relationships, but there is this part of me there and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I wanted to learn 3d modeling so I can design video games. Nope, didn't happen. I wanted to learn coding, and learn hacking, and build my own PC, and join a gaming clan, and so much more. Even my simple in-game hopes have disappeared, like achieving this goal or earning an amount of game money or winning this level. None of it happened. I've stopped trying. I don't know why. I just... can't really describe it.  
I realized my friends aren't real friends. None of them talked to me or even texted me since Covid started. It's been over half a year now. I've gotten scammed more than my ""friends"" had done anything relating to me.

69,"So out of the blue a couple days ago my roommate texts me and says ‚Äúfrom this point forward if my mom tries to contact you tell her you haven‚Äôt seen or heard from me‚Äù

And then I asked why mom would contact me

And roommate said ‚Äúit‚Äôs because I told her something, just you haven‚Äôt heard or seen from me after tomorrow‚Äù

So I was confused where this was coming from.

Well I started thinking after tomorrow would be after we get off work and she has the next two days off.

So we leave and she has her duffle bag and a giant stuffed animal. So I‚Äôm thinking oh she‚Äôs just going to spend the night at a family she babysat for all her life and is giving them a birthday present.

But then my thoughts lead back to why was she telling me that her mom might contact me.

Roommate is also pregnant but she‚Äôs told me she wants to be the only one raising the kid.

So my only thoughts are what did she tell the mom to where she thought she would have to warn me that her mom might try to reach out and ask about her.

I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs running away from here because she left like everything and work hasn‚Äôt talked about her leaving. So is she just trying to ghost the mom? Why bring the change of clothes and disappear for a couple days though. I feel like it could be hooking up with the baby daddy but why would she tell the mom that and I was never involved in that story so why would the mom contact me. Also i don‚Äôt think she would commit suicide, but the thought did cross my mind.

Would I be out of place just sending a ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù Text or a ‚Äúyou good?‚Äù text? She didn‚Äôt want to tell me what she told the mom but telling me to tell her mom I haven‚Äôt seen her after tomorrow and then actually disappearing is concerning.

What do you think she‚Äôs doing and what do you think I should do?",01Oct2020,1
70," I need a creative outlet to help cope with the world going to shit, and with my ADD (not saying that to exaggerate, I have a legit diagnosis) I‚Äôve barely started about four projects (learning to code video games, writing a script for a YouTube video, writing a script for a podcast, and learning to draw).

76,"So my best friend (23F) is dating her boss/CEO/founder (mid-late 40s M, divorced - she wouldn't tell me his exact age). It's a complicated story and I'll try my best to explain this.  
She started working for the company in January as an intern and got a full-time offer once she graduates so she is currently working as a full-time employee as an entry-level associate. She has been in a relationship with a guy (23M) for about 2.5 years. They broke up 2 weeks ago because he had to move to a different state. And now she is dating her boss. She wouldn't tell me but the timeline adds up that they started dating a day or two after she broke up, lol. While she was working, her boss, now her boyfriend, has been showing that she is his ""favorite."" He texted and called her during ungodly hours for both ""work"" and his personal life and invited her to private lunch, dinner, long walks after work, driving her to the beach, and teaching her how to drive, showing up at her apartment, etc.

When she first told me, I thought he was gay, because of the industry they are in and the snippets of conversations they have that she shared with me, but she told me he's not and I knew something was up. She denied it and said that she is just his ""favorite"" because she's so good at what she does... I asked her if she had any feelings for him before they started ""officially dating"" but she said no. Soooo she's saying she developed feelings for him within 1-2 days after her break-up. At work, even before they started dating, she noticed her coworkers also noticed that they are too close. In work settings, she, an associate, doesn't have a manager and her direct report is him, the founder, which I think is absurd. She has other associates in the same department and managers and directors, which made it seem even more suspicious. She's so delusional that what she's doing at work isn't a disgusting product of favoritism. I doubt her coworkers are just blind to all this. She told me that she would be getting a promotion/raise soon because of her remarkable work, lol. Let's be honest, as a fresh grad, you're not making groundbreaking changes at work. She continues to diminish her coworkers' role, which really bothers me. The fact that she knows how much they are getting paid also feels like is deeply wrong.

They are obviously keeping this a secret for many reasons. I tried to get her out of it because it puts her in so many difficult situations. She's talking to him 24/7 about every single thing and he just simply doesn't let her be alone. I think it's a manipulation tactic. He ""jokes"" about marrying her and getting her a graduate degree spot at Ivy League School, also unethical.

I had a sit-down talk with her and explained every single situation that screams this is wrong:

\-that she has more ""connection"" with a 15-year-old than with him.

\-that despite her saying ""I don't feel the age gap,"" and him saying ""you're so mature,"" doesn't mean they should continue this relationship

\-that when the company finds out, it wouldn't be just him who will have consequences. She believes even it the company finds out or they simply don't work out, she will have nothing to worry about. Like, how are you going to explain to your next company why you left your previous job? Who would hire you if you have reputation for sleeping with your boss? She really thinks she can stay at the job.

etc.

I think she was emotionally cheating on her ex-boyfriend if she's moving on within a day or two speed to the next person. I also believe she's leaving some details to me because she knows it doesn't sound good. She denies that she is being manipulated and says that he has more to lose than her and she's not worried at all because she feels safe at her current job.

I've told her so many things that were so wrong in this, but she says she can't/won't do anything because she is truly happy. Aren't you supposed to be in some sort of post-break-up period at all?? I'm so sick of her saying she is independent and LOVES being alone when it's obviously not the case. She found her next man in a place where she shouldn't have because she can't stand the fact that she is alone.

I don't know what more I can tell her at this point, but please leave what you would do in this situation. I need to get her out of this relationship.",01Oct2020,1

i like florida better because, I'm used to just being asian american verses a well know minority group in a small city.

anyway, for this 2 week get away, am i spending too much time with my sister in law and brother? do you think its kinda weird for a 30 year old male to spend that much amount of time over at my married sister's house? should i be doing something else with my life?  


i'm not where I thought I would be now that im 30. i thought i'd have a job, a house, a wife, kids, or be single and flourishing and enjoying life, fun active social life and friends and have good weekends out life out on the town. instead, i'm stuck living with my family, unhealthy relationships, not making enough money to live independently, to have the cool things that I want. nice car, nice house, nice life, flourshing. instead i'm just struggling to get the things I want, no abundance.

I recently turned seventeen, and with that I expected to have some more freedom as I am almost an adult, but that‚Äôs apparently not the case with my family. 
My mother monitors everything I do. She checks through my phone whenever she wants to, constantly goes through my room and sets up limits and such with parental controls and screentime. 

It really seems like my mom just doesn‚Äôt  trust me. I‚Äôm not a bad kid. I do well in school, I‚Äôve never done anything illegal, I respect the rules in our house, I‚Äôm honest with my parents and I believe I am quite responsible despite having some mental health issues that make daily tasks feel difficult or impossible to do. 

One of the things that bothers me the most is how many limitations my mother puts on my phone. I am allowed an hour a day (automatically shuts everything off after an hour,) and have a downtime from 9pm to 7am. I also have many content filters enabled. 
I use my phone to stay connected with friends and also for entertainment but I‚Äôm not addicted. I can put it down when I‚Äôm going to bed, I put it away in class when I need to focus, I know that it‚Äôs rude to be on it when I‚Äôm being spoken to and all the other generic stuff that involves a phone. Yet, my mother still feels the need to set up all these boundaries. I don‚Äôt intend on doing anything bad with my phone, I barely use social media and I can put it down when I need to and not feel tempted to get back on it. As a teen my phone is fairly important to me, I can‚Äôt really describe it but I know others can relate. 

I want to talk to her about it. I want her to trust me more with this. I‚Äôm almost an adult and I think I should be given more freedom. I believe I am trustworthy and I want to prove to her that I am, but she is very stubborn and I‚Äôm not sure how to approach her about this since her trust in me seems almost nonexistent. 
I understand that she probably believes this is the best for me and she wants to protect me but I wish she could see it from my perspective and how frustrating it can be to still be treated like an eight year old. 

I just need some advice as to how I should approach her about this. What should I say to try and ‚Äúpersuade‚Äù her? Any specific points I should bring up? Maybe I am overreacting? Any tips/advice is appreciated. Thank you!",01Oct2020,1

The problem comes about when my boss insists we work off the clock. We are expected to come in half hour early and work until it is time to clock in, and the same at night. We clock out at eight, and then sometimes work almost forty minutes past that to get things done, picking up day shifts slack, pushing us way behind. The clocking in/out early wouldn't be so bothersome if it wasn't a daily occurrence! This is every single day I work, and the same goes for my co workers. We also have to clock out everyday for a mandated break that we typically cannot take, because we have so much stuff to cram into these seven hour shifts (with only two people).

91,"Hello everyone. I apologize to burden you with this information, but I just need some honest outside perspective on a very important decision I‚Äôm about to make. 

I‚Äôm currently a sophomore in college in the US taking online courses - fully remote learning like a lot of people are. I made this decision thinking that there was a very good chance my university would be sent back. Fast forward to October now, it still hasn‚Äôt, but regardless everyone will be staying home after thanksgiving break until the spring semester begins.

I currently live in a pretty mentally and emotionally abusive home, mostly due to my bipolar alcoholic father and my younger brother in high school who has gone down a bad path of daily drinking and experimenting with drugs due to the death of our grandfather. Due to all of this, I find it very hard to focus on my online classes and find myself becoming increasingly depressed as the year moves on.

Long story short, I took it upon myself to survey my options last month and decided to sign on to a 12 month long lease at a relatively expensive apartment complex about an hour away from my home. I‚Äôm supposed to move in tomorrow, but I keep having serious second thoughts about how  I could spend all of the money I‚Äôd be contributing towards rent and living expenses (upwards of $1500 a month) on much better things, specifically renting an air b&amp;b somewhere nice for a month or so at a fraction of the cost to just get away. My mind is in so many different places right now and to be completely honest, I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from the apartment agency to see if I‚Äôm able to break my lease due to my mental health. I‚Äôm thinking that if they offer me the option of removing myself from the lease at the cost of the security deposit and a month‚Äôs rent or so - I‚Äôll cut my losses and do it. But, on the likely chance that they‚Äôre going to make me pay for 6 months rent or so minimum, I think I just need to buckle down and follow through with my plan.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, I truly appreciate you hearing what I have to say. These are difficult times and I wish that I would‚Äôve thought this all over a month ago in a better mental state before I signed anything.",01Oct2020,1

96,"Would just like to preface this by saying thank you. A little about me, I'm a Librarian and what you should know is that there aren't many libraries or jobs around me and the profession is sort of a small knit community.

Okay so  I accepted Job A and gave them a start date. It's for a Young Adult Librarian which I don't mind however they seemed to have sneaked in that I will he doing children's storytimes as well (this involves reading/singing to children and their parents once a week). This was not on the job application but was casually mentioned in the last interview.

Job A is closer. It's like 10 mins from my house. It's a nice building, and the ppl seem nice. The building has a lot of natural light which I'm drawn too. I've feel like I will he given a lot of leeway to improve the library and collection. It doesn't seem to be frequented very often which I actually like. It's also 7 hour work days. This library is also part of the library system (my local county) I wanted to be apart of. It's a small staff which I also like. 

Cons for Job A is that I don't really want to do storytimes. I'm scared and kinda nervous. I just don't want to do it, nor do I have in interest in it. I accepted the job because at the time I had no other offer. I would like to work with young adults as that was the initial job posting but I can't read and sing to children and their parents. Job A also has a terrible website so I can't really flex on improving some of the library offerings. Also to move up on Civil Service list to ""Librarian 2"" and qualify for ""Librarian 2"" positions (which is more compensation) one has to serve as Adult Librarian for one year. At job A I would not be doing that and would probably have to find another job as an Adult Librarian sooner rather than later. 

Then off course comes Job B, which I was offered just recently.

Pros is that Job B is Adult Librarianship so I would get that one year out of the way and I prefer working with adults and they want me to work on the website and with social media which I greatly prefer and am suited for. I have a passion for those things. 

Cons is that it's 40 mins away. So longer commute, getting home later, and waking up earlier. They are also the traditional 8 hour work day. Job is busier and in not the best of neighborhoods. The building itself is very outdated. However, they will be getting a new building next year and it looks amazing in the mock pictures.

Another big con is that I would be burning the bridge at job A and again I would love to work there if not for the weekly storytimes. 

Also because Job b is in another state and their laws require I live there and have to move within a year or I get axed.

97,"So I work in the construction management business for a general contractor. I am a recent graduate and just started my job last month. Recently, my boss made a comment to me explaining in a hypothetical situation that he would want me to do something that I find unethical, and quite frankly probably illegal.

We work on resurfacing and milling of roadways, and part of the job is to set inlet filters to catch millings (asphalt debris) from being sucked into storm drains. My boss told me the other day that if a storm drain starts to flood with water because the millings are too many to allow water to pass through the filter, then that i should poke a hole in the filter to essentially drain it. I asked if we would then replace the filter. He said no, and that it would be kept a secret from the inslectors and town engineer.

Obviously I feel very conflicted about this and would like to hear other peoples opinions. If he ever asked me this, I would refuse, saying I am not comfortable with that.",01Oct2020,1

104," Hi all,

I am originally from Montreal, and moved to New Jersey in April 2019 for better career opportunities and to become more independent. I got my own place and have a good job being a Recruiter for a top staffing firm here in NJ.

The thing that I hate is that I'm pretty much alone in NJ and all my close friends and family are back home in Canada (Montreal/Toronto). I'm 28 and single, and with COVID-19 it is definitely tough to meet a girl and/or make friends.

My mind is so unstable at times when it comes to should I move back and be near family and friends again in Canada (I'd probably move to Toronto where my brother is) or should I stick it out, and maybe move closer to the city where there are more young people? I can definitely say that career growth and opportunity is in NJ/NY so that is a pro, but I would like to have that balance with work and fam/friends.

What should I do? Any advice would be appreciated.",01Oct2020,1

106,"  Made a throwaway since I normally post on video game reddits.

I'm a 25 year Bi male. A few years ago I came out to a friend of mine (23) and he came out too. We wanted to see what it was like to be in a same sex relationship and started dating. This lasted for about a year and a half. I admit I was in love and possibly still have feelings for him. It was a sexual relationship as well, around 3 times a week. Unfortunately we started to get exhausted of each other and started to fight alot. We broke up and didn't even contact each other for around 9 months. I had a mental breakdown and made a post on social media to friends for help and he contacted me. He helped me a lot with my anxiety problem that sparked up and we caught up after many months. He was in a relationship with a girl that he was happy with and I was talking to a girl I had a huge crush on. We started playing video games together again and just hung out as friends and everything was fine. Fast forward a few months. He meets a girl he has had a crush on for year's. He leaves his GF at the time for this new one cause she hinted at liking him back. They start dating. I thought he was low for leaving his gf for this new one. Over the course of the last several months the way this new girl is treating him was cruel. She would tell him to his face that she thinks he has darkness in his heart. That he's only using her. She lied to him several times about being a virgin and lied about how many guys she's slept with. She started talking to one of her exes again. She out right ignored him on his Bday. Several of our friends have told him to leave her and move on. He's even contemplated suicide a few times when she tells him some really cruel things. There's a lot more she has said to him.

2 weeks ago she nearly reduced him to tears when she told him that if they get married, she expecting him to kill himself. I've been doing what I can to make him feel better and give him advice since she started doing this type of shit for the last few months. I think this girl is bad for him and he should've dumped her a long time ago and moved on. In the last few days he's been randomly looking at jewelry. Rings to be exact. He told me that him and her are talking about getting engaged. If you read everything above you're probably scratching your head too like me.

She told him that if he asked her to marry him she would say yes. He's already bought a ring and is planning to propose to her very soon. I think this is gonna end horribly. They haven't kissed. They haven't slept together. She hasn't even said ""I love you"" to him. Me and several others are concerned about this blowing up in his face and we have a bad feeling this gonna end very ugly.

He's already told me that it's gonna be a few years before an actual wedding. That I'm gonna be the best man. As much as I want to be happy for him. I'm very very concerned. I met her one time and she was cold towards me. One worded answers and not making eye contact. I think she's very bad for him and that something is very wrong. It might be the feelings I have him that are talking but, the evidence of her being cruel to him then suddenly wanting to marry has me and others concerned. A couple of our friends aren't worried cause they firmly believe it won't last and I'm leaning on that side too. He's my best friend and I love him like a brother. I'll always be there to catch him when he falls.

My question for everyone is what do I do? How should approach him? Should I wait it out and see what happens? What would you do in my position? Lastly, do you think my feelings for him is clouding my view in any way?",01Oct2020,1

109," So i have 2 and only 2 consistent friends one of which I'll refer to as Sarah and the other I'll refer to as George. So Sarah, George and I are the best of friends and post acid trip with Sarah (just me and her) our friendship circle is amazing, of course it has it's flaws and highs and lows but in retrospective it's great. So first of all a bit of context, Sarah and George aren't dating, but they're definitely a thing, friends with benefits just before a relationship type of thing. And every weekend we all hangout, and that's the only time they have together, cause George is living with his parents and his Dad is some what of a cock block coming the room and being all ""keep this door open"". So the problem i have is that I've been told by Sarah they tend to have a bit of sexy time (not sex but definitely more than a make out session) whenever i step out of the room, and even in 2 instances where I've been asleep, on the same fucking bed. Also to add, we only hangout at 2 different locations, my house and Georges house. Now obviously you can see the problem, or at least one that stems from the main one. Now for me personally if I were to have a SO or friends with benefits and we were hanging out with someone who is 3rd wheeling and they were to step outta the room sure getting pretty cuddly and some making out is fine that's cool, but I would never go the extra mile (sexually that is) if someone is present, even if they're just out the room for a minute or two. To me that is just very disrespectful and ya know ""get a room"" type thing. It just makes me so uncomfortable, at first when she told me that they had done this the first like 2 times i was like ""yessir niceee"", but then actually thinking about it just makes me really uncomfortable and to be honest I don't wanna hangout with them as much as I do if that's how it's gonna be. And I've talked to Sarah about this, and I've blatantly said ""hey, this makes me uncomfortable, I don't like that you guys do this when we're all hanging out, even if I'm outta the room for a minute or two pissing or something"" and her response that she has used more than once is her justifying them doing it by saying ""but you're out of the room, it doesn't affect you"". But now that I've said something along the lines of ""do this when you guys are hanging out alone and shit, it makes me very uncomfortable that you do this when the 3 of us are hanging out"" it hasn't changed anything. Sarah is still open to doing it when the 3 of us are hanging out just now she's not gonna tell me cause she knows it makes me uncomfortable. I'm just not the type of guy who's cool with his friend getting it on with someone while we're together, and that goes for both of them. Makes me feel like I'm being used, like a third wheel cuck boy place holder so they can do the do, and I've mentioned that to Sarah but her response was ""You act like we wouldn't all hangout if that wasn't the situation, we all talk we're all friends your not being used"" which is a very valid point and it's true we are all friend's and we all talk of course and shit, but that's just not my point. So to wrap it up, I woke up and texted Sarah saying ""I want to apologize for bitching about all that, I don't agree with it at all, but you do you so I guess it's whatever, I understand you're points but I just see it as disrespectful on my end. But i can't change that if you don't see it as a problem. I will say tho at least keep it at Georges house, I don't like the thought/idea of you guys doing shit on my bed but you can do whatever at Georges, I don't wanna be controlling but at least save it for his house and hopefully that's understandable, if not the I don't know then"" and that's where this all leaves off. Last but not least the reason I've turned to Reddit is because I have no clue where to go from here, they're my best best best friend's and I wouldn't drop them over this but this does make me want to distance myself, at least physically like hanging out and shit. Anyone who is open to giving advice, go for it I'm all ears/eyes, I don't care how long you make it long reads are most definitely fine with me. Thanks you very much in advance.",01Oct2020,1
110,"Hi Reddit! 

I need some advice. I'm just going to rant about my problems and hopefully someone can make sense of it. TW!!

I (14F) am part of the LGBTQ+ community with very conservative and religious parents. They have made it clear they are homophobic and ALM. The thing is I love my family to death and it's making me tempted to go to conversion camp to just be normal and keep in contact with them.

Also, school sucks. I'm a sophomore and the stress is making me want to harm myself more than i already do. I am very quick to invalidate anything I'm feeling but validate everyone else. Plus, going to get myself diagnosed with anything would be too expensive and probably would just result in money wasted with no diagnosis. I'm not suicidal but I do harm myself with some glass I keep in my drawer.

He said that was okay. I then proceeded to tell my brother about the situation and how it‚Äôs really really weird. I told him to tell nothing to no one. A few weeks later, another friend of mine asks me if it‚Äôs true that A said that he could legally have sexual intercourse with C‚Äôs sister. I blurted out yes and walked away. Later that day, I told B what happened and he was really suprised because he hadn‚Äôt told anyone. He asked me if I told anyone and that‚Äôs when I understood that when he texted me about A‚Äôs situation, we weren‚Äôt talking about the same thing. I said no. Tonight, he asked me about the situation by text and I told him that I had told my brother but that he was supposed to keep it a secret. B got understandibly upset and told me I wasn‚Äôt supposed to tell and that I had lied to his face. I contacted the people that I knew knew the secret and told them not to tell, I asked my brother not to spread the rumors and not to tell anyone. I know I messe up real bad, no, I fucked up.

112,"I'm awful at making decisions which is probably why I'm asking Reddit to help decide for me. I started my first job as a sales assistant at a small supermarket on Tuesday. I am definitely more of a social person and more suited towards checkouts where my social side can blossom which is why I applied for the job. When I arrived, I was stuck straight into the warehouse and spent all shift collecting stock from deliveries and packing shelves. Met a few customers but I walked out that night feeling depressed and disappointed that it wasn't what I thought it was.

I applied for the job imagining sales assistant meant that I would be on the shop floor, assisting customers and being social, not stuck in warehousing all day and stocking shelves on the shop floor away from customers. Nothing in the job description mentioned this except for one bullet point that said they **could** get me to perform duties not listed in my job description. 

Been umming and ahhing the past while about whether to call my HR manager tomorrow morning and thank her for the opportunity and realising after working a shift that it isn't for me or put up with it and just do it solely for the money.

Any ideas, Reddit? I'm edging more towards calling tomorrow morning but I assume I'm not seeing too logically right now so want outsiders' point of views.

113,"Today went down as the fastest day of my life, I couldn‚Äôt tell you one memorable moment. I woke up already bummed out still dwelling on the day before and that‚Äôs how the rest of the day went.
My grandma woke me up at 8:00am because my cousin had to call me through her because the night before I was so depressed I didn‚Äôt even bother to charge my phone. He calls me every single morning to play call of duty but normally I set an alarm for 7:00am.
Before I turned my game on my mother and me got into a small argument over something stupid about cat litter.
I got on the game which I typically live stream on YouTube but this time I didn‚Äôt. We played a couple games and my cousin could tell I was bummed out and angry.
After a hour or so of playing the game, my entire computer crashed. Then I turned it back on and began to set up my livestream. I started the stream and got back on call of duty, my cousin was no longer on the game which bummed me out. After charging my phone it showed that he tried to call me but couldn‚Äôt get a hold of me so I let him down.
Then I played call of duty until 1pm, nothing but terrible games and not a single win so I stopped the live stream. I then proceeded to head to the refrigerator and got a bag of chips and some dip, I watched some dumb videos I couldn‚Äôt even recall back to you and then after a hour my dad came home from work.
Him and my grandma talked about the presidential debate and family stuff and I told him sorry for the argument the day before. My little brother got back from school around this time and we went outside and threw acorns at each other and stuff like that.
Then I got on my computer with the intentions of making a YouTube video but instead I got frustrated and confused so I got back on my game and played it for another 3 hours and I finally won a game at the end. I turned the game off when my mom got back home with our cats who had surgery.
I spent time with everyone for a while, no one really talked about anything and we didn‚Äôt even watch anything on tv. So I went back to my room and watched shows while eating macaroni. 
Now I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôm so depressed and sad that I just want some one to help me get out of this darkness because it always comes back every couple months and it hits hard. I get very sad thoughts about how fast life goes by and how quickly are days vanish. I get sad thinking of how all of this will be over and I may never see my family again. I get sad over how much of a failure I will be and how I waste my time because I don‚Äôt know what I want from life. I get sad over thinking about how in a years time from now one of my pets will probably be dead. I get sad over contemplating what will happen when life is over and how there is so many crazy possibilities. I am so twisted in my head that I think heaven could get boring sometimes I wonder what the purpose of heaven would be, would we not grow old of it, their is no challenges in heaven and your always happy there so what is the point of all of this.
The night before today I typed into YouTube that I was sad and watched some videos where they actually wanted to motivate you and tell you that it‚Äôs normal to be sad sometimes and hearing that made me want to click off. It‚Äôs like I want to be sad, I feel like my sadness is on a different level than others who get sad over their girl friends dumping them or losing a family member.
I have constant sadness, I could be rich and have everything I ever wanted but it would still be there aching at me. I know it because I‚Äôm approaching 1000 subs on YouTube but instead of feeling happy about my achievement I get depressed and I don‚Äôt even think it matters.
I hate that I think this way, none of what you guys so will even help me most likely. I‚Äôm fucked up in my head and I‚Äôm a broken ship that‚Äôs sinking into a terrible deep ocean filled with nothing but sadness. I am far from normal and I don‚Äôt see any possible way out of my mind. I‚Äôve tried before, I woke up for months early in the morning making my bed, taking cold showers, running to challenge my self. I did ab work outs every day, I ate healthy and lost a lot of weight. It didn‚Äôt matter though, I can change my physical appearance and gain mental toughness all I want but I can‚Äôt conquer my sadness it always comes back.

About 2 years ago the man I was dating, the love of my life and my healthiest relationship came to the conclusion he did not want to have more kids and we broke up.  I decided long before we broke up that if that conclusion was the one we came to i would leave where I grew up to go to where I always wanted to be. 

Now I'm living in Arizona and I hike all the time, I live in a decent area and I get to see some of the most beautiful places.  I'm over all not unhappy but I'm constantly asking myself if I'm wasting my time. 

The people here are not really personable and I'm not the tall skinny type so I'm also not what people are attracted to. I feel pretty confident in my appearance but the only people that talk to me seem to have some sort of fetish with thicker girls and only want to hook up even when I'm up front about my wants for an LTR.

117,"Got a small inheritance when my mom passed of about $800 a few weeks back. I was going to spend it on getting beehives for Spring next year as this is something I have wanted to do for several years. I've been slowly but surely getting beekeeping supplies over time. 

When my dad gave me the money he told me to spend it on something that brings me Joy (My moms name was Joy so he was being silly but also serious). I was told ultimately the money is mine and to do with that what I please, but my dad wants me to do something new with it. I always sock away cash I may get or other monetary things to keep myself afloat when things get rough. 

Because of Covid, I've lost my main income, and have burned up through my savings and unemployment paying for everything that goes with living - mortgage, car insurance, phone bill, internet, the roof deciding to fall in (literally. Thank fck for home insurance)

Just found out the mortgage company miscalculated my loan so I'm short $900 in my escrow account because of their mess up. (Apparently this is incredibly common and there is nothing I can do to refute it). Because of this, starting next month for the next 12 months my mortgage amount will be going up by $89 a month. Doesn't sound like a lot to those with money. It is a lot when you don't have it. 

Found out I can refinance the mortgage entirely for the cost of 2 months of the loan. About $3100. Refinancing will lower my mortgage by almost $280 a month and I'll get my APR to 2.65% vs the 4% it currently stands at.  

It would absolutely be a worthwhile investment to put the money to it. I know that. But I am caught up on if it would bring me joy. I can always find money. I work several jobs and do a lot of side work. So I'm confidant that I'll be able to find most of the money to refinance in the next 60 days. It is a lot, but it would be well worth it.  

I don't know. Maybe I should wait until I get closer to the date and if I haven't gotten the cash yet to refinance then I can dip into it.

I work out, but I probably look like a ""do you even lift"" after years of lifting. I can't stay consistent with the workout.

I think I am attractive, and yet sometimes I look like a potato farmer. Whatever that means.

People say I am funny, but I couldn't actually tell you a joke on the spot, let alone write a stand-up routine. If a talent can't be harnessed to use at will, is it even considered a talent?

I make music. Like, I put in time and effort into my songs. I write every note, every line, I produce the whole thing, verses, chorus, bridge, the whole shebang. I never get more than like, 10 views. Nobody gives me encouragement, except maybe a ""like"" from my mom and my little brother. I feel like I am the only one who likes my own songs.

I tried acting for a bit. I started out okay, like everything else. After a while though, I realized I was shit. I know it takes some practice to grasp, but I also am shit at consistency. I don't have enough faith in myself to keep at it, especially since I spend all day at my 9-5 job.

Oh and my job? I suck at it. I work at a place where I just sit and open accounts for people that walk in, but I am also supposed to cold call people in the area to get them to come in. They even give me leads and profiles and everything. I don't do it. I just sit there all day, wasting away. Barely anybody comes in. Why am I still employed? Probably because 1) my boss likes me, and 2) the company is required to keep branches open in shitty ghetto neighborhoods to comply with policies. Yeah, the place where I work is a ghetto, that's how much I suck. 

I got an apartment that's out of my price range because I wanted to feel posh, and now I can barely save a nickel. I split the rent with my girlfriend, who I am not even crazy about. You know, because I suck. 

I never had the balls as a kid to ask out the girls I really liked, and now that I have balls, I live with this girl so I can't even ask girls out. We fight all the time anyway and her presence makes me lazier and impedes my music, acting, and school.

I recently went back to school to get a degree (because you know, I don't have the balls to rough it out and be a real actor or a musician) and I took way too many classes than someone with a full time job should take. (because I suck). I'm considering dropping Intro to Accounting because it's difficult and I basically have to teach it to myself. And just now I got a 50 on an economics quiz. I actually studied for this for a couple of hours. Wasted time.

I consider myself likable, and yet I pretty much alienated and lost contact with quite literally all my friends because of grudges, pettiness, pride, and my holier-than-thou attitude. So I can't even say I'm likeable.

Considering 2020 has been plagued by COVID, it is natural for things to have slowed down and since I live away from my family and friends for work (in the same city as my GF for work) it has obviously been a very isolating and slow year for me. She does not get that pov despite me explaining it several times. 

My options are to either:

1. Give her what she wants (engage within 6 months and married 6 months after) because I do really want to be with her 
2. Stand my ground with my own timeline (additional 2 years from today before marriage is considered) - note this option means she may likely breakup with me 
3. Breakup with her right now as ultimatums and putting that sort of stress on someone in a year like this is not right 

I am conflicted because I do not want to regret losing her and at the same time I do not want to regret throwing away life plans I had made prior to meeting her. She is not open to much compromise. 

Any advice please, open to suggestions and possibly being in the wrong :)",01Oct2020,1

By all paid I just mean the one way round trip ticket, the hotel fees and food for when I'm there, my dad mentioned how its a 5 star hotel in a touristy place and to just not go beyond the hotel after dark.

123,"I (14M) am not new to football itself, but I'm fairly not experienced. My first season started in 7th grade, I played Linebacker and receiver. (not many people were on our team.) Our team wasnt as tall, big, or strong as the schools where kids were 5'8. Most of my team were about 5'1. When I played Linebacker, I wasn't necessarily scared to tackle, I just for some reason couldn't tackle the way I should. I pushed people in games and went higher. I missed a lot of tackles due to this problem and had a bad season. I am in 8th grade now but due to COVID, I'm not playing this season. Do any of you have any tips on what could break my tackling habit and make a hit? I want to play again freshman year of high-school.

FYI: I wear glasses under my helmet at games but I'm not sure if that plays a factor in it. I was overall never very physical but always wanted to be.

She's passed out, thrown up, collasped, laid in bed for days crying because of how much pain she's in. This from the same woman who once broke her ankle and didn't bat an eye. It's a lot more blood than I remember my exgirlfreinds' being. She bleeds A LOT on the sheets every month and leaks even with maxipads.

She's gone to her doctor and gynecologist about this multiple times, but they just prescribed birth control which honestly didn't help much. We went to the emergency room once night because she was in so much pain and she looked really sick, but they were useless too. I did some research on what might be causing it and I don't think it's pcos because she's so skinny and thought it might be endometriosis, but wouldn't her doctor be more concerned if there was a possibility of it being that?

I don't know how to help her. She uses heating pads, motrin, we tried the orgasm thing, and just being supportive in general, but it doesn't seem to help much.

132,"Id like to say this of the bat that I'm not a legal adult yet, and that this post is to vent out my emotions and ask for help as my parents will probably get divorced. I'm not sure if I'm in the right sub-reddit and I apologize so much if my post isn't appropriate. Also my parents are Mexican, they only speak Spanish and I'm not really a strong Spanish speaker, but I could understand everything. So some of the things i say may not make total since and I apologize for that.

I don't know what to do, money and supposed cheating lingers when any one of them brings their marriage into question. Today my father spoke to me about him thinking of separating with my mother. The talk of divorce first came last year, when my mother discovered my father was supposedly  talking to another woman in Facebook. This made her take away his phone and credit card. Family from her side came in, and that bothered me so much. I remember thinking ""How dare you get into our business. This about my mom and dad no about you"" To this date I have a dislike towards my aunt, who I used too see as another mom. To this day I refuse to visit her or interact with her. My fathers excuse was that she was just a friend. One of the messages that led to the cheating accusation was that the woman publicly said ""I love you (dad's name""

I don't know what to think about that. On one hand my dad said it was her nephews name but supposedly that post was fresh (at that time) and that it couldn't have been have been meant for her nephew. My mom took my sister to her sisters house where she proceeded to get my aunt involved. That was the day when my dad told me everything and that supposedly my mom was cheating As well and sending pics to other men on Facebook. I've seen her text other men so that made since. At this point I feel like they both cheated on each other and that know they wanted to get the children (My sister and I) on their sides.

A couple of days ago my mother revealed to me that my dad used to have a different lover in their old village in Mexico, and he left her to be with my mom because my mom could have children, and his ex couldn't. I'm a female so I apologize for feeling so mad about this, my mother already tried telling me that things in Mexico are different from here in the USA. I just don't like the idea of being given life for a man who only wants children. Of course I'm not a mature adult and i certainty don't want children, but I just cant shake that out of my head. She also told me that my dad would disappear when I was younger and that she believed he slept with other woman and went to bars to drink. She told me that shed make dinner for my dad and herself to take to work, but he would take everything and feed it to the girl on face book and that he'd bring back her scraps and tell my mom to eat it. My mom also told me that  she got upset with my dad because he wouldn't even waste a dollar on my sister and I. He would berate my mother for buying us clothes in the flea-market and that he promised us to buy us ""good clothes"". He never did. My mother promised me that shed never divorce him. Imagine how I felt when my dad told me he's thinking about divorce.

(Id like to say that abuse is present in the marriage. Its nothing that I've seen as this happen when I was an infant. My dad would only get like this when he'd get drunk. This now lingers when ever I see him with a can of beer. He would never put a finger on me so I've been in-between them at times. I've only included this so that perhaps you can convince me that a Divorce is needed)

At this point i self diagnosed myself with depression. I know that this is such a dangerous thing to do as I'm still technically a child. But I've felt sad, tired, and moody for as long as I can remember, Hell, 3 years years ago I began to have thoughts about ending my chapter of life. I'm worried that if they get divorced and they take me to a doctor to get my mental health in check, they'll just have more hospital bills. I'm already going blind, I have spontaneous tumors, and parts of my bones are de-formed. Why should I give them anymore problems to worry about. 

My mother has has back problems and she can only find work as a labor worker. Today I asked my dad about what would happen when the time of divorce came. He told me that he would move out and that he'd visit us once a week. He never mentions money and he obviously wants my mom to stay. Im worried already because she cant afford to get her back checked out at a doctors office, she hasn't been working because covid and field working don't mix well, and she already pays for our clothes, food, bills, ect. 

By this point it might seem that I hate my dad and that I'm happy for them to split. There's more to my mom that I'm not sure how to explain. I just don't want them to split, in fact I feel for my Dad. I've taught about harming myself so that I wont have to be here when they do separate, but I don't want to be a burden. At this point divorce seems like the only thing that could help us. To me its like pulling a Band-Aid, obviously other kids suffered far worse than me when it came for divorce but I'm a coward. I just cant except that someone is tugging at the flap, getting ready to yoink the band-aid off completely. I love both my parents, but it seems the longer they  are together in a unhappy relationship, the worse its going to get for us. If anyone has any advice Id appreciate it so much. This whole post wasn't meant for you to decide whos side your on, I love both of them so much, I just needed to vent out how I felt. Tomorrow we plan to talk as a family and i hope that ill be able to bring them both to their senses, and I have a small sliver of hope that maybe something good will happen and they'll be able to feel true love again, without having having to divorce.

Again I want to apologize if this isn't the right place to post this. I apologize if it seems like I'm somehow bashing men, which Isn't my intention at all. I also want to apologize for being selfish, they should both be happy but I'm just here thinking about myself.",01Oct2020,1
133,"Hiya- I (20f) am in my second year of college a few hours from home.  I'm living in dorms (taking 3/4 of my classes online but still on campus), and my parents are paying tuition and dorm/mealplan fees, and plan on doing so for my brother as well, which is a big help. I have two younger brothers, one is 17 and one is a lot younger, he's not important here (as of right now). Our parents have always been on the stricter side- not so much super insane noticeable stuff, we had a midnight curfew and played sports and stuff, but they're really nitpicky about certain things and have high standards for school and no tolerance for slip ups. This has caused a lot of stress for myself and my middle brother over the years, and he's the reason I'm asking for help. While my stress reaction is to bury myself in work and reshape my entire personality to avoid getting yelled at, my brother rightfully gets really upset and shuts down after a lecture, which only leads to whatever they're mad about getting worse. Historically they've always treated him worse than me, why it started I don't know. Recently they've been berating him about quitting a job that had terrible management, even though they told me not to get a job besides babysitting occasionally when I was his age, and while he's struggling with a few school subjects they yell about him not being able to get into college and that he should get excited to go to community college and live at home for the rest of his life because when they yell they tell him he's worthless. He's been accepted into three universities already, all of them above community college level (nothing wrong with cc, that's just not what he wants), and is looking at two more reach schools that he has a shot at. They've also apparently been searching his room and phone regularly in the middle of the night since he was eight, something they never did to me. I've tried to intervene a little in the past but it always just makes it worse for my brother. How can I help him survive the last year at home? We both know that getting tuition covered and relationships with the rest of our family, including the youngest brother, is too much to risk by doing anything of a super large magnitude, and when I'm home things always seem a bit calmer because I can distract from a tense situation between him and my parents, but I don't know what to do when I'm gone for long periods of time like right now. He's genuinely a good kid, he never gets into actual trouble, he's smart and hardworking when the odds are more in his favor, and I know he's going to be just fine once he's out of the house.

Just to clarify both members expressed interest in doing so and one of the members owns all of the James Bond's. I've seen most of them and told them so but it really hurt my feelings that they did this without me, we do everything together as a film club and while we aren't friends it still hurt me.

141,"Hi. I recently purchased a new townhouse in a neighborhood with lots of families and kids. As soon as we moved in, my daughter who is 4 and a half, met another little girl who is 7. They immediately bonded and became good friends and have been constantly playing together since we moved in. However, there are some issues I need advice with.

I'll start with the one that bugs me the most. It seems apparent the little girl is somewhat neglected. She is out ALL evening from the moment she gets home from school until around 8:30pm when she has to go back home. She always appears to be wearing the same couple of outfits which are always dirty and unkempt. Typically I wouldn't care but she is constantly wanting to come into the house, seems to make herself quite comfortable and will spend all evening rolling around and making a mess in our new home with new furniture. She also requires us to feed her everyday. She will do something I don't like where she will be playing with my daughter and she will tell my daughter that she is hungry and that she should come and ask us, the parents, to make them food. Even if my daughter has already had her meal she will lie and tell us shes hungry so that her friend can get food. I am not greedy, I have fed the girl on several occasions but this is becoming an every day thing which I am not down for. 

Another thing is the negative influence she may have on my daughter. She is not a bad kid by any means, she plays nicely and is kind to my daughter. But, she is arbitrary, seems to have little manners, and likes to disobey our requests at staying within our boundaries when they play. My kid is only 4 and a half years old and I am not comfortable having her running around the neighborhood at that age. This girl will tell my daughter, ""its ok don't worry about what they say"" and because my daughter whom is an only child, worships this little girl, she listens. 

I have met her parents during a brief occasion, I don't like to label people but they seem very apathetic towards the duty of parenting or caring for their child. They appear to drink and smoke a lot which makes me feel bad because this could be a reason she never wants to be home. I would prefer not to approach them about any of this.

My concern is that this little girl is basically becoming our unwanted second child. She is at our house all evening with the expectation of getting cared for as if she were our own. I don't want to be an asshole and start telling her she can't come in the house, or can't come over as much, or that she needs to go to her own house and eat. What can I do to keep myself from hurting the little girls feelings? I also don't want to have her get hurt on my property or have something happen to her and then have to deal with the legal consequences. Its especially difficult because it is apparent she comes from a broken and neglectful home. What do I do?",01Oct2020,1

150,"*TW* Topics of depression, anxiety, bpd and suicide. Read at your own discretion.

I went through a very rough relationship over half a year ago where my boyfriend was constantly extremely suicidal and was undiagnosed for BPD but would never seek help from professionals; he would only reach out to me and his friends. He attempted twice in the span of time we were dating, he faked psychotic episodes to see how much I cared about him. I was always genuinely terrified that the next morning I would wake up and he would be dead. I would cry myself to sleep every night because I couldn't handle the fear. It spiralled into my own depression that hit harder than any other time in my life.

After that relationship, I find myself being super super anxious of those I love being depressed. If someone I care about shows ONE sign of being depressed, I find myself obsessing over it. I get sick to my stomach, I lose hair, I start feeling depressive, I stress.

How do I stop getting this overwhelming feeling? It's too much to handle, and I don't want to be scared of people dying all the time.

154,"My parents have just told us that they have been separated for a year.

So all in all, i'm not really surprised that this has happened, and it doesn't affect me all too much.  


We live on a farm, and my cat who is seven years old has lived on the farm all her life. She isn't the family cat, she is MY cat. I litter trained her, I feed her, and she always sleeps on my bed, so I love her very much. The farm is all she knows, and I really don't think she will do well in a town environment, so I am feeling inclined to try and leave her with whoever buys the farm. But on the other hand, I really don't want to leave her behind, I want her to live wherever I do. It seems either she stays on the farm and loses the only family she has ever had, or I take her with me and she becomes miserable because she is confined to a town house when she has spent all her life roaming around outside as much as she wants.  


I know it seems trivial that my parents are divorcing and I'm worried about what to do with my cat, but I'd really like some advice.",01Oct2020,1
155,"Hello Redditers!
I‚Äôve come to a dilemma. I take a high school chinese course, which is part of an immersion program. I took elementary school and learned 90% of elementary subjects in chinese. Well ever since (about) 7th grade I have really grown disinterested in the language and the way its taught. I might even go as far as to say i‚Äôve hated it at times. Well Language Arts and Social Studies are usually taught in chinese as part of the program, except in 7th grade my Social Studies teacher accused me of being a school shooter (a story for another time) and I immediately dropped Social Studies and only took language arts in chinese. Every class I take in english has always consistently been an A or B, but every class in chinese is always a C or D. Many other kids drop out because of the way its taught. So basically from whats been said here, should I stick with a class that I dislike and lowers my GPA? If yall have any further questions dont be afraid to ask.",01Oct2020,1

158,"Hello everyone, not sure who's going to see this one but here goes, I'm looking for some advise on something that's been happening to me quiet a lot over the last few years but its been going on for as long as I can remember. I'm going to try explain it the best I can.

So the best way I can describe this is I think about thinking? Weird right? One example is, I can be doing one thing and the next minute I am in this sort of 'day dream' thinking about something that might not have even have happened? And then when I have done thinking about that thing I'll then straight away think about thinking of it but I'm still in the same 'day dream' ? It's not like I came out of the 'day dream' and then thought about it, I usually forget about what I thought about. Another case is for example, say I had a conversation with one of my friends maybe a month ago, I am on the train going somewhere I go into this 'day dream' and I am thinking about the conversation we had, but in my thought I sort of carry on the conversation even though in reality it didn't go any further? In fact I ask a different question? In my thought I sort of like say something that gathers more information? Does that make sense, I hope so lol.

It happens in all sorts of different situations, I could be at work just casually doing my work, listening to someone, watching tv etc... It's like my brain is constantly on and never switches off,  Its really exhausting, Its almost like I question everything I am doing like why am I doing this? what if I do it this way or that way? what am I getting out of this? and It works in the past sense too, what if I did this? etc... I am sorry everyone if this doesn't make sense I just need to get it out there and hope someone makes sense of It. I have spoken to very few people about this and I find it almost unexplainable and they don't seem to understand either lol I have lived with it so long its just normal to me  but when spoken about it recently the person cant relate or has never experienced it. I am wanting to know if its just me or does anyone else have this going on inside there head? If anyone happens to respond to this and you want any details from me to help with your advise feel free to ask I'll reply as soon as I can. I will just add this on the end, I don't panic in the 'day dream' nor do they go deep.

Thanks for reading.",01Oct2020,1
159,"I'm 24 years old and almost into my 4th year of marriage. I have always wanted to have children but wanted to be sure that I could provide for my family. The first year of marriage, I struggled a great deal with finding a career path and flip flopped a lot on what I was going to choose. In that year, I invested in some things that failed spectacularly when I either became overwhelmed by the enormity of the project or foolishly gave up because I grew to hate what I had started. I am not proud of that year as it was fraught with failure due entirely to my indecisiveness and lack of self motivation. Fortunately my wife's parents are wealthy and they bailed us out, which was a great blow to my pride but a relief non the less. Eventually I found myself as an apprentice agriculture mechanic, not out of a desire to become a mechanic but rather out of a need to make money and to settle on a career. I hated it. I pulled wrenches for two years, hating going to bed at night knowing that as soon as I went to sleep, I would have to wake up to go to work again the next day. I began to feel very depressed and felt that for the sake of our marriage and my sanity, I needed to make a change. I decided I wanted to be an architect and I began to research schools. I found that schools that offered architecture in Canada (which is where we were living) were limited in selection and so I decided to take advantage of my dual citizenship and go to school in the U.S. I took night classes and studied for my SAT and eventually got accepted into a university. I moved to the U.S. and took a year of classes in a semester to catch up. I did very well in my classes and loved every minute of it. During this time, my wife and I were separated by the border while we filed for her paperwork. Eventually she quit her job and came to stay with me with the plans of traveling back in forth between here and Canada while her paperwork is approved. I discovered that I could join the National Guard and have all my schooling paid for, receive cheaper health care and a plethora of other benefits, all of which seemed like an excellent way to get ahead in life. My wife was not in favor of me joining as it meant I would have to be gone for 6 months of training but I saw it as a small sacrifice in the grand scheme of things, so I joined anyways. Then Covid happened. The U.S./Canada border was shut down and my wife was no longer allowed to travel into the united states to see me. We were separated for two months until she found a loophole that allowed her to travel to see me. While she was here, we began filing for a ""change of status"" which is expensive but will allow her to remain in the U.S. until she is approved but will not allow her to work. Just tonight we learned that because of a massive backlog, due largely in part to Covid, her change of status will not be approved for at least 1-3 years. While she can live here while her status is pending, she cannot work and she cannot leave the United States. If I had not joined the Guard, we could pack up and go back to Canada but I did join and I cannot undo it and now we are stuck. To be honest I do not want to leave as it would feel like another failure to add to my ever growing list but my wife loathes me right now and I do not believe that my silly pride is worth sacrificing our marriage. I do not know what to do. I just want to do what is right for my wife and for our future family. The sheer weight of the pressure I feel is crushing me and my mental fortitude is waning and I am afraid. If you made it this far, I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read my lengthy post and I hope you have a wonderful day.",01Oct2020,1

163,"Hi, i‚Äôm so new to reddit (first post and that) and i‚Äôm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but i‚Äôm feeling super concerned and i need to get this off my chest. This is really long so apologies in advance.
 Tonight (around midnight) I got a call from my dad saying the police were driving to drop my mum off at my flat. He mentioned police and ambulances but i couldn‚Äôt really hear him clearly. My sister also called me crying, repeating what my dad told me and saying that my mum had been threatening to commit suicide for a couple weeks. About half an hour later my mum showed up in the police car, and the officers explained to me that my mum had been seen to by the police twice today. they said she had gotten a knife out and had been yelling at my dad and brother about getting bags for her. she told me she wanted to leave the country and go back to where she was born, due to some medical issues she feels will be easier to deal with in her home country.
my boyfriend made her a cup of coffee and some food while i was talking to the police, and when i came back into the flat, my mum seemed to be acting strange to a point i didn‚Äôt recognise the woman in my home. she was behaving so differently to who i‚Äôve grown up with for the past 20 years. 
she explained that she was leaving my dad and was happier alone and wanted to stay single, as she suspected my dad was cheating on her (i later called him, and the second i mentioned cheating he broke down, crying in a way i‚Äôve never seen. he worships the ground my mother walks on and i didn‚Äôt believe for a second that he would cheat on my mum, but i wanted to be sure).
she wanted me to book her a flight to her home country to see to her medical problems and stay with a friend for a while. my sister (27y/o) and i are very upset that she wants to leave england, but my sister is A LOT more worried than i am. i feel that if my mum wants to leave and it will make her happy, she should go. i think my sister is terrified about my mum going, she said that she‚Äôs scared my mum won‚Äôt come back. my sister (S) also told me that my mum has been prescribed anti-psychotic medication that she is refusing to take, and has been drinking alcohol regularly (which is unusual for her anyway). S and i were trying to explain our feeling to my mum but she just said we were being selfish and that we were trying to control her.
my mum then left my flat saying she wanted to go back to my dad and would walk the couple of miles to get home, and my boyfriend went after her. i phoned the police to update them and explain that she had ran off and i was very concerned. i gave a description of her and told them all of the information i knew/had been told by my sister/dad. i was calling back and forth between police, my boyfriend and dad to keep everyone in the loop and try to help my mum.
my boyfriend later told me that when he‚Äôd gone with my mum, she‚Äôd threatened to hit him, threatened to report him for raping her (to make it clear, my boyfriend would never have even thought about that, and i am disgusted that my mother would accuse him of such a horrific thing, but i know she is unwell at the moment), and had tried to walk in front of cars on the road. my boyfriend told me that he had tried to talk to my mum but she wasn‚Äôt listening and just kept making threats. she was found by the police and has been taken to hospital/been sectioned. i am so heartbroken that this is happening to my mother and that my boyfriend and the rest of my family have had to see what my mum is going through. i don‚Äôt know how to process it.
i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôve remembered everything correctly, it‚Äôs been a whirlwind of a night and my emotions are out of whack. i should mention that i am also on antidepressants for my own mental health problems and am trying to deal with everything that‚Äôs happening on top of my own issues. any advice?

164,"I have been employed by this company for 4.5 years. Right from my initial interview I was very clear with my ambitions (which were encouraged by the employers) and I took the job after being told I will be in line to get the next promotion I wanted within the next 3-4 years.

There were some teething issues when I first started working there but things got back on track fairly quickly and I‚Äôm now performing consistently at a high level and doing everything asked of me.

Late last year, they hired another person in the same position as me. The company had capacity as there was plenty of work after someone else had left. The new employee had previous experience in another town (10 years compared to my 8). 

I was told at the time that my future plans would not be impacted by them hiring the new employee and there was room for both of us at the next level. They just wanted to jump at the opportunity to hire someone with so much experience as it is very hard to find experienced staff in our town.

Fast forward 12 months, the new guy has been here 6 months. Seems to be ok. But the employers have just conducted my performance review and I was asking questions about my promotion prospects.

They went into great detail that they intend to promote the new employee first in 18 months time because that‚Äôs what they promised him when they hired him.

I would then have to wait at least another 12 months more after that before I could be promoted but even then that would be reliant on other things such as the businesses financial position, other retirements and other staffing considerations.

The new employee is more experienced in some areas but it has almost no bearing on our day to day work. I‚Äôm currently performing at a high level as I have an established client base and I am established in the community.

New employee is still getting started and is not yet working at a very high level ( at least that I am aware of).

While it‚Äôs probably easily dismissed as millennial entitlement, I fee absolutely shafted that they intend to promote this other guy ahead of me despite me working for the company for the past 4.5 years.

I feel the employers are constantly shifting the goal posts and not feeling particularly valued.

It also feels as though the reasons they told me for not promoting me do not apply to the new guy. I was told before they hired him that I needed to get more runs on the board, get more active in the community and take more leadership around the office. (At my performance review they said it is very noticeable that I have been doing all of those things) yet they still want to promote this other guy who won‚Äôt really have enough time to do any of the above.

I want to let my employers know how I am feeling but at the moment every time I try writing down my thoughts, it just sounds like a hit piece on the new employee.

i told him that this bothers me but he also has a lot going on family-wise and i don‚Äôt want to stress him out, but how long does it take to send a text? i know he cares about me and that he‚Äôs not experienced with relationships so i can‚Äôt expect him to know exactly what he‚Äôs doing. 

i didn‚Äôt want to make things official with him because i wasn‚Äôt sure the distance would work with our schedules, but if it weren‚Äôt for that i would.

**\[tw: mention of a suicide attempt\]**

Hello, I am a junior in high school, I struggle with a lot of mental health issues. Recently, due to many things including the stress of school starting up, this has resulted in a suicide attempt. I see a therapist, but it is not helping enough. 

I feel as though dropping out and getting a GED would be a good idea. I have looked into many alternatives for my current school, and this seems best. I have taken sample tests, looked into reviews left by those who have taken the test, and have looked into the differences between GED's and diplomas. Given what I know, I feel as though I could pass very easily. For me to get a GED, I would need to drop out and get my parents permission. 

I am asking for general advice, but there are some questions I feel would be helpful. *\[note: please do not tell me things like 'it gets better', although I appreciate the intent, it is useless and undermines the current state of my mental health.\]*  I am nervous about this, and I don't know if I posted this in the right place. \[its my first post\] 

Is getting a GED a good option? *\[I am not looking to immediately go into college, if I did, I would go to a community college.\]*

174,"So, I am 14 years old and my parents separated when I was about a year-two years old. They divorced when I was 4 or 5. They fought so often that my gra (grandma, moms side) practically raised me and my siblings. Then when I was 7, my dad remarried to my step mom. My mom lives with my gra, and we only got to see her 1-2 maybe three times a week. 

Throughout the years I have been hurt by my dad verbally, emotionally and physically. I am constantly in a state of anxiety and I have been diagnosed with PTSD. My step-mom was almost as bad as him but she never laid a hand on us. 

Then, in 2019, my gra died. I was heartbroken and crushed. She had started to decline but refused to go to the doctor because hospitals scared her and we had financial problems. See, she had passed out when she was driving out of a parking lot and her heart stopped beating, but she was revived. Ironic that there was an ambulence already in the parking lot though. The doctors told my gra to come back so they could run some tests on her liver as they had seen something worth investigating. 

She never went back and her health started declining. She could barely walk. One day, my mom was at work and we were home alone with her. The TV was in my moms room because we all hung out there. I was playing Fortnite, my sister was texting her friend and my other sister was playing Fortnite with me. We had a system when we played because we were knew. I did combat and she did building. We died a lot because we were always switching. While we were playing, we heard a crash and a yell. She fell and couldn't get up, we weren't strong enough to pick her up, so we called 911. She ended up going to the hospital and had tests done. As it turns out, she had colon cancer and it had spread to her hip and liver. She was due home in 2 weeks, but she didn't even make it through one. She had signed a DNR and she was taking a pill when she swallowed weird or something, the sudden movement had caused her lung to have a pulmonary embolism. 

My dad had always hated my gra and it didn't stop when she had died. 

My dad has had 10+ DCFS investigations against him, filed my teachers, coworkers, friends. They were for abuse and sexual assault. One of them landed me and my siblings with our mom for 4 months and we were happy and we had started to get better mentally. 

We were sent back, just like every time. This has happened for almost nine years for me.

We have started arguing more and more. At the beginning of quarantine we fought and he tried to give us up but our step mom stopped it. Recently, we fought again and he tried to kick my stepmom out for no reason. Yeah, I didn't like her but that was irrational and wrong. When he started screaming at her behind a locked door. My sister and I (my other sister is at college now) left the house. We ran to her friend house one street over. No answer. My friends house on the main street. No answer. We then took the back roads to the gas station and called our mom. We didn't know if she could get in trouble for picking us up, so we told her not to. We then tried to find my sister's new coworker's house. She knew where he lived generally but not exact. When we couldn't find it, we ran across the street to the lady who was outside with her dogs. She went inside and slammed the door. Then, my sister remembered another friend that was nearby. We went there and talked to her through the window and hung out in her garage. Then, my step mom found us and brought us to our moms neighbor, her friend, my moms ex-friend. We stayed there for two days. When we went back, I completely ignored my dad until I went to my moms the next day for the weekend.

He had planned with my mom a meeting and he came over were he got violent right in front of my mom and my step moms friend who had been brought over as a mediator. He threw me to the ground and had grabbed my neck. My sister and I went in the house, grabbed our phones and called 911. They showed up quicker than usual and talked to me and my sister.

They called DCFS. Then, my stepmoms friend, who has kids we are friends with, told her kids she watched my dad abuse us, so I don't know what side she is on. I have now been living at my moms for a few weeks and haven't recieved any of my stuff. I am happy and my dad is blaming my actions on my dead gra, tells me I am legally required to return to him, but he does NOT want my sister back.

176,"     Hey! When I was 7 years old, my father was diagnosed with APL leukemia. Although what I said may sound terrible, I genuinely love looking back at that time. 

     I remember when I was in the hospital (my mother and I both lived with him in the cancer ward), there was a family room. They had books, a tv, games, you get the point. I saw a bunch of children‚Äôs books on the shelves and it gave me an idea, what if I wrote a children‚Äôs book on cancer, grief and loss so that kids my age at that time could better understand and feel understood through a story (An example would be something like ‚ÄúSad Book‚Äù by Michael Rosen) and donate them to hospitals around the world.

     I know it sounds silly that I‚Äôm asking for advice on something that seems like such a good idea, but my concern was would it be too much for children? Could it upset parents if they saw their child read such a sad book? Would it take away the innocence of a kid? Of course it wouldn‚Äôt be horrendously graphic or pessimistic so I think it would be ok. Thoughts?

     Also, if you have any stories about Cancer or loss of a loved one, feel free to share them. It always helps to hear other people‚Äôs opinions on such a heartbreaking subject, especially with writing.

186,"A little backstory. A few months ago I was invited along with my roommate to go to this girl's house to play Beat saber. It took me a little to warm up to the group there, but once I did it was a lot of fun. We had decided that were worn out with beat saber so we decided to watch movies instead. To make a story short this girl starts to cuddle with me while watching this movie.

I saw her about a week later and exchanged contacts. We would do things so often. We would end up seeing each other about every week or so. Every time I would interact with her. She seemed to be opened. Sometimes there was physical contact, but nothing too intimate. Well, lockdown happened and we didn't see each other until about late summer. 

In summer I had posted on my Snapchat story that a local coffee shop that I went to was having a Harry Potter-themed month-long event. They were severing themed drinks from the movies, and the shop had decoration set up. She snaps me asking where was this I had told her it was at the said coffee shop. She asks if I would take her to it. Now note that I am not at school, and living back home about an hour and a half away. 

   We had agreed to meet later that week. When did I should around town, I should her were I was working that summer, and we had gone back to my home to watch the first Harry Potter. She had seemed to enjoyed herself and even had some talk about doing stuff in the future. So, trying to keep things going, I suggest that we should meet up again around where she lived. She didn't agree to anything right there, because she didn't have her scheduled for the month yet for work. She says that she would get back to me. She never did get back. 

I didn't think much of it, I had just thought maybe she forgotten, or she was really busy. I had other things going on that need more attention at the time myself.

A few weeks have past and I move back to start school. I would see her when school starts from time to time. She was still friendly and warm to me. One day I see her we would get talking. I end up asking if she was free for lunch. She said that her lunch break is dependent gets done in time with her appointment, she is in cosmetology, but it was usually about 12:30 to 1. She would text me when she got off. She never did, I had just assumed she had gotten busy, and just got lunch myself. She would text me later that evening apologizing, and saying she forgot about lunch. I told her that everything was fine. 

   At this point, I was a little annoyed but remained hopeful. I would not see her again until last week. She was with a friend, and we're talking for a bit when I asked her what was see doing this weekend. She said she had work. So, I had asked her when she was free, causing I was wanting to hang out. She claimed to be busy for the next month, and most of the things she does are impulsive when she had free time. I later get evidence that she was possibly lying to me. First later that day I get a text from a club group chat asking if anyone was going to be at an event that night. Someone said that She and one of her friends would be there, I found this odd, but thought she made prior plans. Then Sunday rolls around She posting things on Snapchat about her spiders at around 6 pm. Again this could before or after she had worked, but a little odd I had thought. Then Tuesday night I pull into my apartments to find her car parked there. She had other people she knew at my apartment building. I feel like she had lied to me at this point. I could be overreacting to everything. 

 So in the end this my question, is she into me or not? At this point, I figure not.

If she was now isn't, what would have made her turn?

 Nothing too serious between us yet. But still a lot of me and her hanging out alone, and with friends. I did mistake things being something more? 

If she is into me, should I confess how I feel?

If she is, is it worth trying to pursue anything with her?

187,"Teachers, college students, people who have been in a similar position, anyone who has any ideas: I need some guidance about going to college. Sorry about the length of this post.

I'm 23 and I got my GED in 2017 because I missed a lot of school my whole life. I was at a 4th grade level in math and other subjects when I started taking classes to get my GED when I was 18. I missed so much school I was homeschooled from the start but my parents were addicts, mentally ill and neglectful. 

My home life was chaotic and my mom ended up not keeping me on track with school, like pretty much didn't give me access to education. She kept me home every day and lied about me being in school if anyone asked. I was extremely isolated. I developed a lot of mental health issues myself at 11 and my dad passed away when I was 14, I couldn't focus on schoolwork even if I did have access to it because of the trauma I was dealing with. The neglect of not being given an education also traumatized me and affected my self esteem and development. 

I had to take daily, extensive classes to get my GED. I felt so dumb. I worked my way up from a 4th grade level over the course of two years. It was a hard road and really made me realize how much I missed out on. I had essentially never learned any math or social studies before that and found out I have mild learning disabilities. I pretty much cried every day because I didn't understand anything in my classes for a while. I did end up passing all my GED tests with average to above-average scores. 

I've been thinking about going to college since then but I'm just so afraid I'm too uneducated for it. I've never felt like I could handle it. Lately I've started having interests in some career paths that require degrees and I REALLY want to continue my education. But I feel like I'll have to take a lot of general remedial classes before even majoring in anything and even then I'm worried I won't pass those. 

I don't have any school experience to draw from. Don't colleges want to know about your academic achievements before they accept you? I've got nothing other than my GED. I really want to be a psychiatric nurse but I looked up the degree I'd need and you have to take precalculus for it. I've never learned any precalculus so would it go completely over my head? I really feel like I'm too stupid to get the degree I want. I feel like I'll just fail my classes or not be able to understand anything and drop out.  Will I be given less opportunities in college because of my lack of education? 

Any thoughts, ideas, advice about this would be so appreciated.",01Oct2020,1

My friend wants me to move into the city with her into an apartment that is within walking distance from the hospital we both work at. I have a great relationship with my parents and they help me a lot (home cooked meals, free food and toiletries, even help me with chores sometimes). However, they tend to be helicopter parents (*I‚Äôm lucky they care about me so much*) and I feel like I may be missing out on a lot of things because they tend to be overprotective about what I do.

190,"Hi reddit I want to see your opinions/advice about changing companies. Company names are not real.

So a little background. My husband started working as a call center agent since he was 18yrold now hes 22 in the same company SKY. We have a 3 yr old baby. We only finished 1st year in college.

He started working at SKy at 18yrs old as a non-voice agent at the back office (not talking to clients, an encoder) after 2 yrs the account closed/ended its contract with SKY. So this made him change his account to in-voice (they trained him with pay) so the account is Life Insurance, after 2 yrs the LI ended its contract with SKY. Now hes traing for the other account of SKY, Health Insurance and he's training for Assistant Manager maybe by next year he's already AM

So his salary a month as an agent is 18k plus incentives 14k so its about 32k. As for AM position, 26k-30k is the basic pay (I'm not sure how much the incentives are) and theres a 50k bonus by March if you finished/stayed with Health Insurance.

Now heres the [problem] remember the Life Insurance, they gave the contract to ELX for 15 yrs. A lot of SKY agents transferred to ELX since they are already trained in LI. I'm not boasting or whatever, but my husband was a top agent in LI. ELX is offering him AM position. The basic pay is 35k (not sure about incentives) and annual increase. Plus 50k signing bonus. But they required finished  at least 2nd year college 

My husband is torn between SKY and ELX. In case HI ended its contract, SKY has other accounts that he can go to or referred to. In ELX if LI ended its contract there are no other accounts that the have that my husbands is qualified to. And he'll have to return to college if he went to ELX. 

If he finishes his training with SKY he can't resign for 10 months to 1 yr. His bosses advised him to finish his training  so if he leaves SKY he can demand a higher salary.

However, they can‚Äôt even considerate hiring me until I‚Äôve shown them my degree, which I probably won‚Äôt have until the end of the year, since all that got delayed due to the pandemic. 
Today, I got a call from nursing school telling me I got in and online classes start on Monday. I talked to my mom about it and she suggested I enroll, since it‚Äôs very hard to get into that particular school. 
In all honesty I‚Äôve never been much interested in being a nurse, but it has always felt like the most natural thing for me to be since both my parents are healthcare workers. If I became a nurse I would have a greater income than working in media production (which is what I graduated in) but I‚Äôd probably end up unsatisfied, although media production isn‚Äôt really something I‚Äôm passionate about either. 
Going back to school for another 4 years is a scary thought too, at this point i feel really old and rusty, and thinking about starting a career as a nurse at nearly 30 years old is so sad to me.

200,"Long story made very short, my parents divorced when I was 10 and we had two dogs at the time. Let‚Äôs call them Monty and Susie, well after my parents divorced I spent a week at my dads and then I would go my moms, my mom was horribly abusive (drug addict, stole money and medication from our disabled sister) and my dad was a complicated sitch, not his fault. the only reason we stayed at my mothers house or continue to go despite CPS basically running up her ass every few months was that we didn‚Äôt want to abandon the dogs to her and also straight up feared the foster system. Well we finally stopped when she got a new boyfriend who was a serious drug dealer and felon, she just took a sharp downturn at this point. I left with the dogs and after she got out of the crazy bin, She threatened to call the police on us for taking her property a.k.a. the dogs. It has been several years now and I still think about them every day. I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed, over quarantine my sister and I were looking at adopting but it just ended in tears and frustration, we don‚Äôt want another dog we want our dogs, and it‚Äôs impossible to imagine having another pet when we feel responsible for leaving our babies with that demon witch. They would be a cheap replacement that would only remind us of our mother and our babies and that isn‚Äôt fair to anyone. However dogs are my favorite animals and I can‚Äôt imagine not being able to get over this eventually. (please don‚Äôt suggest a try therapy..I did, it was bad. The therapist basically kept questioning why I never left abusive situation, hey buddy? I didn‚Äôt realize because I was a fucking child, and being really confused that I was at a relatively prestigious university in my country) 

Sorry I really am not making it short. 

Well basically Monty and Susie have been living with her for the past two years and she never took care of them when I lived with her, it was always my responsibility and my labor. They don‚Äôt even like her! Monty would run away whenever my mom got close. I had to once call locksmith to unlock her house in order to feed and let them out and found them in a closet full of their own piss because she had been missing for three days on a bender. Monty one showed up with animal control because the only names on her tag was the old address after three days in their custody. Turns out my mother had let her run out the door and lied about how long she had been missing.
Well I have no idea how to get a hold of the dogs, and my plan is to possibly contact her, I‚Äôve been no contacts for a while, Meet her in a public place and offer her money to give me the dogs. There‚Äôs one thing she loves more in the world than torturing me and my fam...it‚Äôs money. I have about $5000 that I‚Äôm willing to part with from extra scholarship money and work money that I‚Äôm not using for university, and my older sister is willing to take the dogs in since I live at my father‚Äôs house. Am I being stupid? Does anyone have advice on how to get them? I can‚Äôt leave them with her anymore. The court itself deemed her too irresponsible to deal with her children, and even herself since now she has a conservatorship. I can leave them there.

And when I said I made it short, I promise you I can make this post about 30 times longer. I did my best to consolidate it.
(also couldn‚Äôt fit in anywhere, but there is a third dog named Mueller that is actually older than both of them but we have reason to believe that she has Passed away due to old age (And the neglect she probably suffered from our mother def didn‚Äôt extend her life) I don‚Äôt want the other two to die in a situation so awful.

I was a kid and I was  VERY scared so I pretended to be asleep and hid under the covers with intense fear until I just fell back asleep. Well, the next morning, I found out someone tried to break into the house. I think I was too scared to tell anyone what I‚Äôd saw because I don‚Äôt remember telling anyone. 

I kind of have a bunch of little ‚Äúquirks‚Äù I do. In high school, my dad lived in another state for work and my mom sometimes worked overnight. During these nights, I would ‚Äúcrash‚Äù on the couch in the living room so I could have a view of the door, even though we lived on the second floor. I have a lot of sibilings so I wasn‚Äôt even alone. But the idea of not having an adult home scared me and I had trouble falling asleep, even on the couch. 

It wasn‚Äôt even until fairly recently that I learned it‚Äôs not normal to want to sleep at night with your back against the wall. I just feel safer doing that. The first time I left a window in my apartment open at night was this year, and I ended up having a nightmare that night about someone climbing in. I lived on the second floor. I have nightmares about someone breaking in while I‚Äôm in my apartment every few weeks or so. 

Well, I just moved to a commune that‚Äôs on a farm, and I‚Äôve been asked to quarantine alone in a house for two weeks before I can interact with everyone. Tonight is my first night. Can you guess how terrified I am? 

I seriously don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to spend two weeks sleeping alone in a house, a freaking house, not a 2nd floor apartment, in a farm, all by myself. I‚Äôm terrified. 

Any suggestions. This is a very real &amp; obviously irrational fear of mine but I literally have trouble ignoring it. I can‚Äôt sleep. And worse, I don‚Äôt want to sleep and have a nightmare. I have the kind of nightmares that leave me shaken up with a pit in my stomach for hours. 

If anyone wants to talk to keep me distracted that would be nice to as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be up all night.",01Oct2020,1

216,"I am 23 male but look and behaves way younger base on my friends and people I interact with, currently still studying in university cause I dropped 2 years when I travel to another country to study. I have no idea what I want as a career even after countless personality test and experiences. My life goal is not to be very rich and famous, I just want to live a quiet, humble happy life however I am not sure whether I can even achieve that base on my current situation...

I do not have any skills/talent that I am proud of. The only skills I know is how to swim, play badminton and ride a bicycle. I didn't have the motivation to learn other important things like cooking/playing a musical instrument/coding/Web design that can earn abit of money. All I did in the past is wasting my time in video games... though I am no longer playing as much now since I am in University, I feel that I am so far behind my peers who seem to know so much more skills and is so much better than me. Not that I want to become as successful as them but I really feel that I am so far behind... video games likely also caused my chronic forgetfulness for certain things, eg I don't remember any companies names (besides the very big ones), food places, vegetable names, locations of things and how to get there, famous &amp; important people's names. I also dont watch netflix. These really kills a lot topics that I can talk about with others making me a really boring person. I am too busy to catch up on all these common knowledge now and when I do try none of them sticks =(

As lesser people talk to me and continue to talk to me, I slowly closed myself in and became an introvert that dont speak unless I am sure that it is relevant and interesting... Though I cant work well with new faces I really enjoy group work with people that I am familiar with as it gave me the drive to do things (it is really hard for me to push myself to do something if it is just for myself). The problem is I rare can bond in a deeper level with others as there is just not enough common topic to reach there. I am a good listener but not many people wants to share their experience with me since they don't know me well enough...

Is there anyway to escape this pit and improve myself?

221,"I need advice (obviously). 

I currently live by the beach in LA. I love my apartment, I‚Äôm comfortable at my job, and I love my team. I have my parents here but they plan on moving back to the East Coast in the next few years. I‚Äôve moved every single year for the last 7 years for some reason or another (3 different cities in SoCal, 4 in Minneapolis). 

As of today, I was offered the position to be promoted, run a project in New York City, and help start-up a new division of my company with a starting team of only a few other people. 

Obviously, I want to take it. Truthfully, I probably will. I‚Äôm very young to be given this opportunity, it would be absolutely stupid to turn it down, and I‚Äôve always wanted the opportunity to live and work in New York. 

However, after VOLUNTEERING myself up for this chance and then against all odds getting it, I find myself panicking. I guess where the need of advice from random strangers comes in is asking if there‚Äôs a reason why, even though I‚Äôm comfortable where I‚Äôm at, I can‚Äôt seem to leave well enough alone. I always have to insert myself into situations where I become likely to have to make massive life decisions year after year. Last year was taking the chance and leaving a long-time (for your 20s, at least) employer. The year before was moving back to LA. This year is moving across the country to a place I haven‚Äôt been back to since the 5th grade. 

Is there some payout at the end of all of this for volunteering myself for these giant life changes or am I just taking everything that comes my way without really thinking about it and ultimately will find myself no where at the end of it all?

222,"This post in some ways has spent years in the making. 

I‚Äôm a full time student and worker. This is gonna make me sound like a narcissistic ass but I think I‚Äôm a pretty nice person. I love throwing out compliments, genuinely enjoy hearing people talk about their passions, and give lots of small gifts. I even learned how to make goddamn origami so I could leave little paper birds for the people using my work station after me.

That being said, I‚Äôm utterly alone in any meaningful sense of the word. I have plenty of those ‚Äòpolite‚Äô conversation coworkers and classmates. I‚Äôll listen to their day get excited with them about the things they love but no one ever wants anything more from me. They all have people they‚Äôre close with. Friends they whisper to when I‚Äôm in the same room because I‚Äôm not close enough to hear certain things. 

I‚Äôve tried to dive into deeper conversation but they reflect back the ol nod and smile routine if it even seems like it‚Äôs going remotely into that direction. 

Whenever I ask anyone to do anything outside of our designated places there‚Äôs an awkward pause of shock or something. Then they‚Äôre busy, always. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck on the outside of everything all the time. Even the people who‚Äôve known me for years only want to hang around me when there‚Äôs someone they like more coming. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm defeated? angry? Feeling like I‚Äôm missing some key trait?

Is there such thing as being the kind of person people only want to be classmates or coworkers with? I‚Äôm stuck in this hellish purgatory where no one will tell me anything meaningful or if I even bothered to ask if they had a problem it would be ‚Äò nooo WE LOVE YOU...‚Äô I‚Äôm not even significant enough to warrant a truthful response.

224,"This situation has been on my mind alot lately. I'm hoping getting some feedback will give me some clarity as i can't openly discuss this situation with anyone. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and offer some advice. 


I'm in a long term relationship with a great guy. We have little to no issues and are very compatabile. However, for the past couple years i've developed a strong attraction towards one of our mutual friends. I haven't told anyone or acted on these feelings (and never will) but, i find myself thinking about him alot and not being able to help feeling excited when we talk. I really don't want to have these feelings, but i don't know how to stop them. I'm embarassed and confused about why i'm feeling this when i'm in a great relationship.


Right away when i met this friend, we clicked. Talking to him for hours was effortless and fun. We often found ourselves saying we felt we were on the same page. This type of instant deep connection isn't something i experience often so when he wanted to talk more online after we connected in person, i was happy to become better friends. I didnt initially feel attracted to him beyond a platonic level, but as our conversations got deeper, i developed feelings and realized i liked alot of things about his personality. Up until recently, we would reguarly talk for hours about different topics like games, philosophical coversations, his dating life and women he was interested in, our past relationships, and alot more. 


One night he got really drunk and messaged me. He was upset about finding out a woman he was interested in was taken, and i replied sympathizing with how that sucks. He then thanked me for being a good person, but it was clear he was extremely drunk so i didnt put much weight into it. The next day he let me know that he genuinely does think that about me even though he said it while drunk. I replied that i think the same about him. The next time we hung out in person the sexual tension felt more intense than ever to the point it felt difficult to be around him at times. It's very hard for me to tell if it's mostly on my end or if its mutual. Regardless, I decided after that night i had to distance myself from him. It was clear my attraction to him was getting too strong. This scared me because my relationship means alot to me and i know something like this could hurt that.


Since that night i've stopped initating contact and have done my best to minimize the amount of time we spend taking. It has been tough, but eventually we went from frequently messaging to only talking once in a while. This distance helped lessen my feelings but i recently found out that i will have to see him in person again soon, which is making me feel very anxious. I unfortunately have no way to avoid seeing him again.


I would really appreciate any advice on how to handle this and how to manage seeing him again. I'd also appreciate any other insight on this situation. It's all been very frustrating and confusing to go through especially since i can't talk to anyone about this. I also don't feel i can confess this attraction to my boyfriend even though we are very open with each other. I worry it would likely do alot of damage to our relationship.

The one thing that frustrates me the most is that whenever she is 100% in the wrong she either brings up two excuses, the first is that she is a Leo (Gemini sign) or she says ""its the burden of being the younger sibling."" I've always had to live in her shadow practically and whenever I try to talk to her it always ends up in her favor.

228,"The title basically encompasses everything, but I‚Äôll give a little backstory for clarity.

I (27F) quit my job in August. My boyfriend and I have been living together since March, and we discussed it and came to the agreement that it would be okay if I quit since he makes enough money to support us both and still be able to live comfortably. My job was not fulfilling at all to me and I was pretty unhappy so I thought it would be the right thing to do.

Obviously because of this, I have a LOT of free time and I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it. I struggle with depression and not working has made it worse. I just kind of feel directionless I think. I don‚Äôt have any kids or anything, so it‚Äôs hard to find a real reason to not sleep all day, but sleeping all day just makes the depression worse and it gives me severe anxiety because I feel guilty. I‚Äôve been cleaning the house and things like that, but you can only clean so much. I recently had my first ever virtual therapy appointment, and she told me that I would probably benefit greatly from setting a schedule for myself for each day. I just honestly have no idea what to do to fill the time.

229,"For as long as i can remember, my brother has been disobedient and just a complete a**hole. We both live at home with our mom and dad. For the last 8 years he‚Äôs been in and out of the legal system for various different things. He‚Äôs got a serious substance abuse problem which he has made very little progress on. And in the last month or so, his behavior and what I‚Äôd say is his whole mental state has gotten noticeable worse.

He‚Äôs incredibly aggressive towards everyone in the family (he always has been, but now more than ever). And he‚Äôs just getting kookier every day. I.e. he talks to himself constantly (and says some really weird stuff), when we‚Äôre trying to talk to him we can barely have a conversation because he just goes on tangents that go nowhere. 

I just graduated college and landed my first professional job... but i work from home, and he doesn‚Äôt work.

I‚Äôm just at my wits end with all this and i feel very powerless to the situation. My parents are just as fed up as i am, but my mom will not kick him out.

230,"I currently work at a supermarket where I make around $13.50 an hour, but because of union fees, taxes, SS, etc, I only make about $9-10 an hour. Today my friend and I went out to eat at a restaurant and our server asked if we would be interested in applying for a job there after asking how old we were. The salary they offer is $15 an hour for servers, and $8 plus tips for waiters. I would apply for the waitress role.

Would it be worth it to switch jobs, or at least go for an interview?

I am a minor, and next year I got to college, so I would only work at the restaurant until maybe early summer next year. I don't think the restaurant has a union, but it is somewhat of a chain, so it might. Going there would mean a new change of pace, which would be really nice, but I would also sever my connection with the grocery store chain I work for now. But, it would be a lot more money than I make now, which would be good to save for a car or college. Both jobs are customer service, so I really don't mind which one I take. I'm on my feet for hours anyway at the grocery store, lol. 

I'm definitely kind of interested. It's a pretty nice restaurant, and the money seems good. The employees seemed nice too. But would it be worth it?

Extra info:

 \- the restaurant is closer

\- kind of sick of the hour management at my current store

\- new job would definitely be more strict about days off for studying or relaxing

\- if my friend also worked there, I wouldn't mind leaving the coworkers at my current store

\- I would feel very guilty about leaving the people that like me and are friends with me at my current store

\- I would feel guilty about suddenly leaving in the middle of a pandemic and making my manager figure something out

\- I am 17, my friend is 20

231,"Background: I‚Äôm 22F living at home with my parents in the US. I work as a remote volunteer to help recently released inmates with employment, but that‚Äôs been essentially stand-still because my current clients are struggling to get accepted. I also am trying to remotely intern with this woman, but she hasn‚Äôt given me any tasks for the past month. I‚Äôve reached out, but get a response two weeks later. I just took my GRE, so now I‚Äôm pretty much doing nothing until something happens with the internship or the volunteering. 

My two best friends both moved away in August, one left for grad school in a different state and the other moved to England. My third best friend, I used to text him and FaceTime and play Xbox with him online and talk to him a lot. As I‚Äôve been working on being alone and working on myself, I‚Äôve been able to separate from him as he‚Äôs really toxic for reasons that I won‚Äôt get into. As a result of the toxicity I‚Äôve dealt with for 4 years, I finally cut him out of my life. I lastly have one other friend whom I consider a good friend and can always depend on him. We used to hook up before the pandemic and have a mutual level of openness with each other but now he‚Äôs talking to a girl he really likes and he doesn‚Äôt want to hang out as it may jeopardize his possible relationship. I completely understand that, I wish him the best of luck with it and he knows I‚Äôm always there if he needs to talk.

This entire pandemic, I‚Äôve been at home with my parents and haven‚Äôt seen any friends because then I‚Äôd be putting my parents at risk. While it‚Äôs been an excellent opportunity to work on myself (self-love and self-care, exercising, eating healthier, drinking less, journaling, etc.), I‚Äôm starting to feel how lonely my life has been for 7 months without getting to see anyone. I‚Äôve gotten to see my brother and his fianc√©, and they have been able to see their friends since they live together, but I haven‚Äôt been able to. 

In October, my parents are going out of town for a few weeks and I‚Äôm going to be able to hang out with friends, if I had any. My brother and his fianc√© are getting married then going on their honeymoon, so I don‚Äôt want to disrupt them by asking to hang out. 

I‚Äôm starting to feel really lonely and isolated as I feel I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to or hang out with. I feel I‚Äôm always the one to text my friends first, and it‚Äôs a half-assed conversation at best because they are busy with their lives in England (also time difference), studying for grad school, or working and talking to a girl. I‚Äôve reached out to some old friends to catch up, but they don‚Äôt tend to respond, my guess is that they‚Äôre busy with school or work. I don‚Äôt take any of it personally - I know my friends love me and I love them, but it‚Äôs just not the right time for them to catch up.

I‚Äôve already spent so much time with myself and I‚Äôm a firm believer that you can never stop improving yourself, but sometimes I‚Äôd like someone to hang out with instead of just my cat. 

When I get really really down, I give in to the unhealthy activity of either binge drinking for the night or getting too stoned to function properly. I haven‚Äôt done either in a while, but I feel like this may be one of the nights. I don‚Äôt want to give in to those impulses tonight.

Any advice on how to make friends during the pandemic, or advice from personal experience on how to deal with loneliness?


TL;DR: I‚Äôm hella lonely and don‚Äôt have many people beyond family that I can reach out to. Worked on myself for 7 months bc COVID (exercising, diet, self-care and self-love, less drinking, journaling, etc.), but I need advice to deal with the loneliness",01Oct2020,1

235,"Basically exactly what it says on the title. I'm the night manager at a hotel, and the family staying here is among the worst group of customers I've ever had- and I've had people arrested before, and habitually carry pepper spray. They're loud, obnoxious, demanding, they're up all hours of the night on all floors of the hotel waking up other customers, I just came downstairs from cleaning up their puke, the list goes on and on. The other employees and I are *fed up* with these idiots, and want them put on the banned customer list, but the boss won't do it. Is there a way to politely communicate the idea that we never want to see them again, while still being able to say ""No, they misunderstood me!"" when they inevitably complain to the owner?

As for RL friends, there either moved schools, have bad blood with them or just simply forgot about them. but before i left i informed my one close friend that i would be going off the grid from them for a week. He then told me it was a bad decision and that he once did that and it did not go well for him.

237,Okay so let me clarify first I have never and will never act on these thoughts. Now then I've gotten lots of these thoughts before but its happened quite frequently the last few days. Its really scary for me. I feel really bad for even thinking like this and its really tearing me apart. Sometimes I get thoughts about k!lling the people around me sometimes family sometimes pets. I feel horrible even typing that out. I know I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. Since I can feel emotions I know that. But I really don't know whats wrong with me. I just want to think like a normal human being. Even if I needed to get help how would I tell my mom about that? Or my dad? Or anybody? I feel so bad about this it makes me want to barricade myself in my room. I normally only get these thoughts when I'm tired. Anyways does anyone have any advice or has this ever happened to you?

238,"Hi reddit &amp; welcome back to my channel,

I recently moved into a new apartment complex and am not sure what to do about overhearing a likely emotionally (maybe physically?) abusive relationship. 

The male/female couple can be heard screaming at each other in the halls and through the wall between our apartment. They also have a 2yo son together and a dog in the 1 bedroom unit. I hear fighting around 3-4 times a week, sometimes as early as 3am.

Just a few of the things I‚Äôve overheard the male yelling at the woman are things like ‚Äúfuck you you ungrateful bitch‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a stupid bitch‚Äù, ‚Äúyou say i‚Äôm the one making our son cry but look he‚Äôs scared of you too‚Äù, etc. 

Recently they had a major fight as the male was taking the son away, and the woman chased after him screaming to not take him or she‚Äôd call the cops.

I‚Äôm coming to reddit because i‚Äôm worried for the safety and mental health of the woman, child, &amp; dog. I want to make sure they get the help they need, but i‚Äôm unsure of what the best steps to take would be. Would the police even be helpful to reach out too? Or is there a better service to contact?

Thanks,
The Nervous Neighbor",01Oct2020,1

242,"I (27) have one friend and my husband to lean on for support. Neither of them seem to be capable of caring about me. This feeling came to a head today.

For reference, today I told both of them about an important life changing decision I'm making about the future of my career. They both ignored me.

I think my friend might be a narcissist, my husband is probably just emotionally stunted. I usually keep things to myself because sharing with them usually leads to feeling like I'm wasting their time, unimportant, etc.

My friend never wants to listen to things about me, she seems fixated on herself to the point that if I say something about my life she brushes it off and steers the conversation back to her *about everything*. It makes me feel like she doesn't care so i just stopped bringing myself up at all and kind of smile and nod when she goes on about herself and her life constantly. Its to the point where all she can talk about is how other people view her, and all she does is argue online with her ""haters"". Its like my life doesn't exist.

My husband is just....emotionally stale. He doesn't know how to respond to things so sometimes he just won't. He responds with silence like completely ignoring me staring at his phone or the TV when I say things. Its upsetting and makes me feel like I'm wasting his time too, so I just try not to talk about things to him because I would rather avoid being ignored and then feeling bad about it. If I do try to initiate conversation like that I'm always going into it nervous that he's going to have zero reaction again. Its a lose lose cycle.

I have lots of things going on in my life and I just want people to talk to about it. I'm not bragging to them, I'm not being selfish or anything, I just want friends who I can talk to and share my life with. I'm autistic and never made other friends just them my whole life, and I'm terrible at meeting people now so I feel trapped. I'm not an antisocial autistic person either I love interacting so when I try to reach out and feel rejected like this, it hurts so much. I feel very alone.",01Oct2020,1
243,"I'm in my 30s and work in a fairly important job in STEM. I have autism and I don't develop relationships with people. I am pretty content with that but I haven't had sex and engaged in my fetishes and it's eating away at me.

I have somewhat non-standard sexual interests and I can't ejaculate without them being a theme in porn/fantasies. I effectively contain my impulses but at its core I'm a moderately strong sexual sadist. I always had somewhat violent/aggressive impulses in this area even before I knew what sex was(like 5-6 years old). Counselors will try to say this is because of some experience(maybe), but I think it's mostly genetic and probably runs up my paternal bloodline. 

Ignoring the legality of escorts, I also have a strong desire for the girl I am playing with to want to be on the receiving end of it from me. I'm not sure how sexually satisfied I can be through a purely economic transaction. It sounds bizarre but I want ""love"", just in a S&amp;M experience.  

I tried fetlife but I found it to be a worse than regular dating, mostly because the social expectations are even higher on the part of the male sadists/doms. 

I don't know what to do at this point but I am getting more and more depressed and it's impacting my work/career and general happiness. The best analogy I can think of is a vampire which has abstained from feeding for a very, very long time.",01Oct2020,1
244,"To put it bluntly, I dealt with physical and emotional abuse from my parents growing up on top of bullying from school. I was always told that I was never good enough, and that I was never going to be good enough. Even when I did really well, like get straight As, it still wasn't good enough. I was signed up for a lot of hobbies and extra circulars as a child specifically being told that it was for scholarships and recognition in the future, not because of my own interest in said things. When I hated an activity because of the constant stress and wanted to quit, I was told that it didn't matter what I wanted.

I could go on and on but the point is that years of this lead me to just have very poor self esteem and motivation now. Because I felt like I was never going to be good enough, it's hard for me to keep motivated at something or see any progress that I am potentially making. I constantly feel like nothing I do matters, and that my existence doesn't matter. I was never able to really find my passion because it was never about me finding something I enjoyed doing. Thus, I feel I have no passions. I have interests, but I can never seem to keep the motivation to get better.

Right now I am a college graduate (2019, communications and marketing) with  extreme difficulties trying to get that entry level job. I've tried so many things that both peers and professionals have recommended to me, but it never seems to make a difference, so that's also really destroyed my self worth. My mother also recently passed away and I've been dealing with feelings of extreme guilt, feeling like I didn't do enough for her and that I couldn't become the person she wanted me to be.

248,"Yes, I posted this on another reddit, but I think that this might be a better reddit. 

Warning: This maybe a bit controversial (I'm truly sorry, but this deals with a kind of political issue, but this is what I need advice on).

Background:

I am a Muslim male. I believe in peace (exactly what ""Islam"" means), I don't believe in Jihad (which means holy war, but many people misinterpreted it- it actually refers to self discipline), and I don't believe in what the media believes to be ""Shariya"" law (shariya just means path and almost every negative punishment mentioned in ""shariya"" law shows up in the bible too). I'm a kind person who runs an organization that has helped 50,000 people world wide and have been since 7th grade, I pray, I help all my peers with homework (I tutor and answer questions for 2+ hours each day and answer question up to 3:00 am at night). I am also a proud American citizen born in Texas and raised in Texas. I have never even visited a majority Muslim country.

Depression:

I think I started feeling depressed and have anxiety after I was called a ""terrorist"" for no reason. Then Trump started talking about how all Muslims are bad and I should go back to ""my country"" which is the USA. I just read an old article about how some Republicans want to kick out all Muslims and blame all Muslims as bad, horrible people who caused every issue there is on the planet. I don't know a single ""bad"" person who is a Muslim personally. Every Muslim I know goes out of his/her way to help people.

Help needed:

Any advice as to how to deal with the haters? Why do people think I'm bad? What did I do to them?",01Oct2020,1
249,"So I'm in college right now and I have this class that I wouldn't say is difficult, but the readings are hard to grasp (at least for me). I know that professors prefer that their students participate, but the problem is I really just can't do it. I have always had a hard time participating in class ever since I was in elementary school. I am pretty quiet person and I keep to myself a lot and I don't really like socializing with people if I don't have to. The thing is participation is a part of our grade and it's worth 25% which is just insane to me that this has to be a part of our grade. I can't bring myself to participate because of my anxiety. I get super scared, my heart starts beating super fast, and I start to shake real bad. Another thing is that I just don't feel smart at all compared to everyone else in that class. I feel really dumb mostly because of my responses in my post about the readings prior to going over it in class. Usually I'm way off with my interpretation which makes me feel dumb. Sometimes I don't even know how to answer the professors' questions in class because I just have no idea how to answer or because I just don't want to look stupid. Now I'm a good student and I get good grades, but I just always put myself down and I don't know how to stop. Plus, I'm just panicking about this participation thing. Like today I had class and I'm pretty sure everyone participated at least once except for me.

3. The woman who trained me, we were fine at first. We weren‚Äôt friends or anything but everyone told me she just had to warm up to me. We shared a few jokes and told stories and whatnot and everything was fine. However, after last weekend she‚Äôs been completely icing me out, won‚Äôt say more than 5 words to me.

In most arguments, my logic is deemed as irrational. In most games we play, my lack of skills gets mocked constantly and some of them justify it in saying that I am trash. The things I create also get mocked for the bugs it may exhibit.

I‚Äôve tried on multiple occasions for them to stop and when they continue, I explode and things get even worse. After I cool off, one explains to me why I went overboard, in a calm way, and I then understand and apologize.

284,"My coworker sucks ass

Hi reddit,
I work in public relations for a medical facility. 
My coworker / team member started in February right when the pandemic hit.

She‚Äôs a friendly, awkward girl. She picked up very quickly how to do a few aspects of the job, etc With the pandemic we had to take the training wheels off much quicker than normal, therefore performance reviews were pretty much not a thing during the surge of covid cases and she‚Äôs been here for about, 7 months?

I‚Äôve been working this job since November, going on 12 months, and at month 4 I was ready for more. My current coworker is not displaying the same growth (nor do I expect it 100%, I‚Äôm an incredibly hard worker).

It‚Äôs been 7 months and myself and the providers we work for have noticed she‚Äôs an oaf. She lazes around all day, talks manically to anyone who will engage with her, and ignores a lot of things that can get in the way of patient care that I end up doing myself at the end of the day. 

I‚Äôve been really overwhelmed recently because we‚Äôre in the get set stage of another surge of COVID cases and on top of that I‚Äôm training another person in the process of picking up her slack, a massive influx of things to do, and her being a lazy POS. 


If providers (DOCTORS, LITERAL DOCTORS), coworkers that aren‚Äôt just myself, and the pure statistics on the amount of work she does is poor, WHAT DO I DO TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR!?
I would love if it would be as simple as realizing this and correcting the behavior but I am NOT a supervisor. It is not my job to do that. However, I feel like a snitch if I were to run to management and say hey look at the statistics... she doesn‚Äôt do shit. Can you fix this please? And then rat her out for the 3 instances THIS WEEK where she was blatantly slacking off and ignoring her job. 


For example, 3 people calling at 4:49pm, she gets off at 5pm, and from 4:30 to 5pm she was slouching at her desk, talking to anyone who would engage with her about some stupid topic. For 30 whole minutes she could have taken a call, called a patient with an urgent reply or request, or dealt with faxes / etc but instead she just sat on her ass for 30 whole fucking minutes. 


I don‚Äôt know what to do. I need advice on what to do to help her help ME and our team and most importantly our patients! I can‚Äôt always be there to pick up her slack. Help me reddit!


TLDR: Do I talk to a shitty coworker candidly about how their performance isn‚Äôt appropriate? Like hey, I need more support? Or do I just run to management and rat out her shitty behavior and have them handle it?",01Oct2020,1
285,"It's hard to find meaning in life, I don't want to commit suicide or anything self harming, but I also don't see an option out. 

A little over a year ago, my mother came to me with a proposal. She asked me if I wanted to rent my childhood home that I'd lived in my entire life. I loved this home and have always been adamant about keeping it in the family. She wanted to sell it, but was willing to keep it if I agreed to take care of it and the expenses. I said yes without fully understanding the burden it is to take on the expenses of a mortgage and bills as a young man making $13 dollars an hour.

Even with 2 roommates I can barely afford the expenses, and COVID has caused my hours to go back, I have multiple pets, and a roommate recently decided they can't stay with me and their moving back with family. I'm now stressing daily on bringing in a new roommate and am afraid to allow in anyone who I can't fully trust to take care of the home. 

I have already received financial help from family and I cannot ask for more, it doesn't feel right. I don't want to leave this place, but I'm so tired of the burden.

I'm alone and emotionally drained, I don't have many friends and the ones I do aren't responsible people. I don't feel any motivation, I feel like life has become this monotony of working a boring job and stressing endlessly about problems that a kid like me shouldn't have to deal with.  

I made a post on my facebook a few weeks ago when I was drinking, about not wanting to keep up the fight, and was flooded with messages about not giving up and talking. It didn't do anything but leave me feeling embarrassed about my actions. I just want to give a shit again like when I was younger.

289,"Worried about my ex

It's a long story, but basically last year I started dating a married couple, I got quite mentally unwell and they took me in to take care of me while I got back on my feet. During this time we were all under a lot of stress, and eventually it was decided by his wife that I had to move out. I moved out and it was made clear that she was not interested in being with me, but was okay with him and I continuing our relationship. It was hard, I lived an hour away and he brought the kids and stayed for a night or two whenever he could. Then when covid started to lock down she insisted she needed him at home, and not with me, he was forced to make a decision, her or me. He chose her for the sake of the kids, but we continued to talk and sext. That evolved into us sleeping together occasionally, as we have always had an intense sexual connection. She found out, and tried to force us to stop talking at all. Again, we couldn't, he got an encoded app to talk to me and come visit in secret to fuck. It got to the point where I said he needed to make a decision because he was ruining any chance of friendship to have with his wife if they were to break up, and they would end up being increasingly bitter towards one another, which wouldn't be ideal for the kids. Again he chose her, for the sake of the kids. I said I understood, and asked if he come come visit one last time to say goodbye. That night, he decided he didn't want to go back. He said that he couldn't live without me, and that I made him happy, and that I understood him better than anyone ever had. He text her and told her he wasn't going home. Over the next couple weeks he started to move his stuff in, but his wife was messaging him constantly, text, Facebook, Instagram, email, bombarding him, telling him he was being selfish, stupid, that I was manipulative and violent and dangerous. She also told all their mutual friends these things, and his mother. She villainised me to everyone because I have mild BPD. She threatened to not let him see the children again, and said that if him and I lived together, the children would never stay in a house with me because of how violent and dangerous I am. I have never, ever, demonstrated any violent or dangerous behaviours. I helped them take care of their children for three months, I held their 1 year old while he slept in my arms many nights when they were at their wits ends with the crying and up arguing about whose turn it was to settle him. She is constantly undermining his behaviour, opinions and decisions, telling him everything he thinks and does is because of his disorders, and any time he has a contrary opinion she explodes and says that he is stepping on her boundaries, disrespecting her, and gaslighting her. It's at the point now where he literally cannot set any boundaries with her. Because of all of this, he left me, purely so that he could see his children and they wouldn't grow up seeing their parents having animosity towards one another. Yesterday we hung out for the day as friends, and even though he isn't with her, she went off at him, insisting that us even being friends was against her boundaries and disrespecting her... we and ended up getting an Airbnb for the night and talking about everything, he says he recognises that she does these things but when it came to him setting up a boundary and saying ""I want to remain friends with her"" he physically couldn't do it. He says he sees himself ending up back with her, and I'm really concerned it's because he doesn't realise how badly she treats him because he is used to it. They were together for thirteen years. I'm worried he has just been beaten down for so long he can't tell her that he wants to be single right now. She has convinced him that because he left her, he doesn't get to set up a boundary, and has to do everything that she wants to make her comfortable because he's the fuck up.

This is the girl that I thought was truly going to be my soulmate, but the huge issue was she could not tell her family about me. Her reasoning for this was she didn‚Äôt want her family to think bad about her because she always has a boyfriend. She always told me I was unexpected and she was happy that we met and were together, but just couldn‚Äôt tell her family about me. This caused a lot of arguments between us because I hated being a secret after a few months and having to hide going out all the time.

309,"So I was with this girl for about 4 months. It was really nice. When we first got together we knew we would have to inevitably split up because I'm still in highschool and she's moving to college. About a month and a half ago was her moving day, and a week before that I had asked if she was free to do something so we could say goodbye to eachother. I got this as a reply.

""I like being around you. But im going to college and I've mentally distanced myself from high school. And I can't mentally handle putting emotional energy into high school associated things. Which includes you right now. I'm sorry""

Now I understand not wanting to be stuck when you should be able to move on. That's where my mind initially turned to because of the kind of person she is, but this message was straight rude. At this point I was distraught and had no idea what to do so I stayed silent. Throughout the whole relationship I was the one worried about us not being friends anymore after we split and she kept reassuring me we could be. This message sounds like she's saying we can't be friends anymore, right?

Well a few days later she messaged me and said 'good luck with highschool', because my first day was the next day. I thanked her, and then I was confused because she had just told me she doesn't want anything to do with me or highschool. So I questioned her on it and I got this thick paragraph back.

""I dont want to be stuck in high school.  Its not that I dont think we can't be friends. Its that im leaving and I have been the person left behind. I had my closest friends graduate and go to college and I haven't seen or talked to them. And it hurts. I didn't want to leave you in a place thinking that our friendship isn't important but also knowing that I am not going to be able to put the same level of emotional energy into it as has been happening the last few months.  Even though we were very close over the summer and through this whole disaster, I am leaving i will be gone. I am going to be in a different life situation. Im not pushing you away, I'm getting ready for my life being in college.  Its nothing against you, it is just where I am.  I explained to you in June that this is what was going to happen. I told you that I wouldn't be able to be as involved when I got ready to leave.""

And that's the last I heard from her. I have been too fearful and prideful to actually say anything more. It's a big move in life and she has a lot of stressors and I don't want to make things worse, but at the same time I have also been caught in an attitude of 'she pushed me away, she should message me first' and I'm starting to question both mindsets. Should I stop being my own victim and just say something again, or should I keep waiting it out? I still miss her, even if I am super salty about it all.

310,"Hey reddit, hopefully I can get some insight in to what I should do here. I'm 24, I've been married for 5 years this April coming up. I've always loved her, yes we have our arguments at times but we never stay mad and we never go to bed angry with each other. the past 3 years I started to believe something wasn't right. Not with her, by any means, but with myself. I started to suspect think I was poly given how I always had a desire for more than one partner, and not like sister wives or something but more just a natural flowing relationship between more than two people. I wanted that and it started to eat at me horribly. Fast forward to 2020 and a few stupid mistakes and I eventually opened up about being poly, now my monogamous wife was hesitant but she loves me and wanted me to be happy so she gave it a shot. It was quite litterally the happiest I've ever been mentally. On the other side of the table she was mentally drained from it, she just wasnt okay with it and I completely understood her. So we stopped reaching out polyamourously and keep working on ourselves as couple. She told me that she wanted to know if I felt those feeling building up again because she wants to be able to step away when that happens so she doesn't get hurt... And well if I'm being honest those feelings never really went away, I just suppressed them so I could enjoy having her and spending time with her. It's getting worse though, I'm really struggling to enjoy this being monotonous anymore. But I can't stand to lose her, please for the love of all that is holy, someone throw me a bone.",01Oct2020,1

The reason I already don‚Äôt like it is because the club is something where you‚Äôre spending so much time for it. The club‚Äôs priorities doesn‚Äôt match up with mine and I thought it was going to be something where they teach you how to do stuff but instead they‚Äôre making you dive right into the topic of the club.

326,"Trigger Warning, this mentions attempted assult and falsified assult as well as rape.

I met a girl in college and she was amazing. We clicked instantly and had a lot of fun together. Her room was next to mine, so we saw eachother daily, did our makeup together, had movie nights, and in general hung out often. She would sometimes prank me and take things too far, but in general I was ok with this and it never caused any major lasting issues.

Fast forward a few months and something changed. She went deep into the hookup culture and I found i was constantly being ditched for Tinder one night stands. I tried to remain a good friend through it, but this marked the start of a slow burn decline in our relationship. I had no issues with her hooking up, but I did have an issue being ditched partway through a conversation cause someone booty called her or having her just not show up to a planned event with no warning. It hurt.

She also became a pathological liar. It was at the point of her falsifying assult for attention. I was never allowed to have an issue. When she wanted to go bar hopping after dark I said no. When she asked why I told her at work a group of men dragged me away and told me they were taking me somewhere nobody will ever see me or hear me again. They told me they intended to rape me, beat me, and leave me to die. I got extremely lucky. A security guard on the other side of the amusement park heard a voice in his head yelling get to this area, someone is going to be hurt if you don't. He left his post, ran five minutes across the park, and yelled at the guys as they were dragging me to put me down. If he did not hear that voice I don't even want to imagine what would have happened. My friend told me that was nothing, she was raped 24 hours straight with no stop and she got over it because life goes on and unlike me she can deal with trauma. She then told me it probably only happened because I was wearing red lipstick and looking for attention.

When I confronted her on her behavior she said it wasn't her fault. She has BPD, anxiety, and depression. She said anyone with those mental illnesses would treat me that way and I was discriminating against people with mental health issues if I didn't forgive her behavior. I told her my best friend in the entire world, the woman I refer to as my sister, also has BPD, anxiety, and depression. I told her I understand there are highs and lows. I told her that does not excuse her behavior. My best friend has medication she takes and goes to therapy on a regular basis. While she does make mistakes and does have her low points she always makes sure she apologizes for anything that may have hurt me and has never once used her mental health as an excuse or justification. I admire her courage and dedication to helping herself and putting her mental wellbeing first. I told my other friend that I was willing to help her through her mental health, I would never judge her for outbursts, I would defend her, but I needed to be treated with respect. I was ready to help her get whatever help and support she needed, but she needed to look into therapy first (her work fully covers any therapy or medications she needs with no limit on cost).

This lead to a full out argument which ended with her telling me she would be there when I found Jesus in my heart like she did and was willing to forgive (I am a Christian, but not ok being treated like trash with no end in sight). I ended up blocking her to prevent myself from telling her all the things I wanted to say but would make me 100% the asshole. I never unblocked her. She has been blocked for five months now. I am now confident I will not say anything to insult her or lash out. While I do not want the same relationship we had before, part of me feels keeping people blocked indefinitely is childish. I have this unrelenting feeling that I should unblock her then leave it be, I don't need to send her a friends request or follow her back.

In high school I left to another state and we didn't speak til last year (some 7 yrs after) they reached out to me and for about two years now we've been talking regularly again, calls, online games and such. Minor flirting here and there sometimes? But nothing serious. She's very reserved and independent (even back in middle school), more of tough love kind of person. What makes me ask this is that this person is very willing to make time for me and our calls and such whenever, they're attentive and caring (despite the whole tough love aspect), we got inside jokes, nicknames for each other and plans of meeting up after quarantine and all but no real way of telling if she likes me or not.

I've never been on ADD meds before, as my grades have always been good, and I don't have that much of a problem functioning.

I graduated from college last year with a degree in agriculture. I‚Äôm currently into my first year of my big girl job, which is in the field of, you guessed it, agriculture. Said big girl job pays me 43K AND pays for my car each month totally around 50K a year. It‚Äôs salary, but I only actually work full-time about 3 months of the year. It‚Äôs remote work, so I don‚Äôt ever see my co-workers and I basically have 4 months, March-June, of doing absolutely nothing and still getting paid. I could take a USA road trip for months, and I‚Äôm always interested in traveling. I make my own scheduled and it‚Äôs a solid job for someone my age.

So I was like, I‚Äôll audition for the musical theater schools in NYC because I‚Äôve always performed my whole life and that‚Äôs the only thing I ever got really complimented on and that I did really well. Anyways, I auditioned and I actually GOT INTO THE SCHOOL. It‚Äôs the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, which is currently rated as the #1 School for Musical Theater in the nation on Niche.com. Also, many other sites and articles say it‚Äôs one of the best too, with a 21% acceptance rate. It will cost me roughly $100,000 to go to this school for 1.5 years to get a certificate in musical theater. I also got a $16,000 scholarship for my audition. Their average scholarship is $11,000. Lots of famous Broadway stars went here included some cool guys from the original Hamilton cast, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson from Modern Family. 

I would be going in March of 2021 if I actually go to NYC. 

I also do not have any previous student loans from getting my bachelors. 

I literally don‚Äôt know what to do. I put a tuition and housing deposit down on the school months ago to hold my position. As time gets closer, I really think about if it‚Äôs worth it to go because I would then actually be in debt and also be in an unstable industry with COVID plus all the regular competition, but then, i could also say I actually went for my dream and even if it didn‚Äôt work out, i tried. Or do I just stay with this really cushy job and live my life in the small backwoods of PA?",01Oct2020,1

338,"greetings everyone. this may sound cliche but I need some weight loss advice. I'm 5'11 (male) weighing in at about 230 lbs, last time I check. probably more now. my problem is I just really, really like to eat. I don't know why but it infuriates me. I'm don't know if any of my mental disorders tie into that but I'm sure they do. I'm 19. in high school I weighted about 175 lbs and I looked really good. the only reason I weighed so much less was because I was on Vyvanse for my adhd and it killed my appetite so hard that I only ate one meal a day. I just feel like shit about myself, and I need someone's help. I know it's more than just a ""go to the gym"" kind of thing.

339,"So here's my life summary and plan I thought for my hopeless self. 

* Went to Japan for 4 year college

* Gave up learning Japanese and life in general due to huge depression

* Graduated and came back to my country

* Did nothing for 2 years. No money. Live with parents. Not a single friend. Never left the house. No knowledge. 
* Picked Japanese backup and self studying. This is my life now. I will not give up learning it. 

Goals: Get good at Japanese and move back there to work some how. 

Dont know if I should: 

* Focus on learning &gt; Get good in 1-1.5 years&gt; Pass tests &gt; Join Jap compnay in my country &gt; Then move/upgrade my work to Japan &gt; Start new life

Or

* Get a random office job right now &gt; While studying Jap &gt; Moveout to my own place (because my environment is extremely toxic and is triggering my BPO) &gt; Get good at jap at a much slower rate &gt; Quit random job and follow the above path. 

Eventually it's the same but I'm just so indecisive and overall a pussy in taking action and too scared to waste anymore time. All my friends are already financially established and Im here looking like a child.",01Oct2020,1

Hi I‚Äôm 16F and ever since March I‚Äôve been dating a guy he‚Äôs so nice and it was going really well but recently for the past two months he‚Äôs been studying so much that we haven‚Äôt talked one bit. We say good morning and good night that‚Äôs it. We‚Äôre online so that‚Äôs what makes this hard and we do call but he stopped calling because it was a distraction. I‚Äôve talked to him about this and I‚Äôve told him we aren‚Äôt close anymore and he started panicking and saying he couldn‚Äôt deal with this right now. So I said sorry and now everything‚Äôs back to how it was not talking and ignoring problems we have. We also don‚Äôt have much in common which makes it difficult to not disagree on a lot of stuff. 

Recently I‚Äôve began to miss my ex but he hurt me about a year ago and we haven‚Äôt spoke since then. I don‚Äôt think he wants to speak and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs moved on but something deep down keeps telling me to try message him. I miss him a lot he was a good friend to me, I could be honest to him and it was fun spending time together. I hurt him a lot when I told him I didn‚Äôt want to speak to him ever again and it‚Äôs been 10 months since we last spoke. I‚Äôll never message him too because I can‚Äôt hurt my boyfriend like that.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like such a shit person because I know it‚Äôs not my boyfriends fault for wanting A‚Äôs and not talking, I don‚Äôt love him anymore though. When I talked to a friend she said wait a week and see how it goes but it‚Äôs been a couple of days and it‚Äôs killing me. I care for my boyfriend and I‚Äôd never want to hurt him especially when he was exams but I also know that I don‚Äôt want to spend my life with him. 
I have no idea how to deal with these feelings right now. Do I message my ex? Or do I tell my boyfriend I miss my ex? Do I break up with my boyfriend?

342,"Not sure what to do with my life

Hi I‚Äôm 24 years old and about to graduate with a bachelors degree in psychology and a minor in criminal justice. I don‚Äôt really want to pursue a career in the psych field because I learned that I do not like it that much. However, I will try to get a job as a probation officer and have looked extensively into that career path, I feel like I can do the work but idk if I can do it forever.

For the most part I‚Äôm not sure what I want to do for a career, I‚Äôve looked into being a truck driver which would be at the lower end of the list, considering the long hours and time away from home. I also thought about going back to school for another degree but at the same time I‚Äôm older now and I wouldn‚Äôt even kno what to major in again. I thought about being a dental hygienist but there is a lot of schooling involved with that and it is pretty expensive, not to mention I would have to apply to get into the program. I understand in order to find a career, I would have to put the time in.

At this point in my life I‚Äôm lost and I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time. I am not sure what to do. I feel like i can‚Äôt choose on what to do. 

I am going to have to pay back these student loans eventually but I would like to have a well paying job so I‚Äôm not in constant debt for the rest of my life.

Anyway can some of you guys give me some tips as to what I should do, career wise? And what do you think would be the best direction I can turn my life onto in order to be successful. What are some programs or jobs that take around two years to become certified for and pay well?",01Oct2020,1
343,"My closest friend (f 16) tends to overthink everything, and it has come to a point where it‚Äôs too mentally draining to deal with her. 

Everyday feels like an test, if I say the wrong thing, act the wrong way. she‚Äôs going to start to overthink about it. I could tell a joke, and she would take it seriously. But I have to keep her mind occupied or else she will start her overthinking mode and if I leave her alone for awhile she‚Äôs going to start crying. But at some point I‚Äôll run out of things to say,the conversation becomes dry, and it‚Äôs hard to continue.

And because of this she is also a highly sensitive person, and even the smallest things I say could hurt her. We‚Äôve been friends for a decade, and somehow we still don‚Äôt trust each other.

In a way, it hurts me too. I hate it when she unintentionally hurts me, I‚Äôd hold my pain so it won‚Äôt trouble her. But when I do it to her, she hates it, she shows it, she says it and I‚Äôd feel guilty it hurts. It hurts when she says something that insults me, but I can‚Äôt say anything. It hurts when I‚Äôm trying so hard to hold in my problems,hold back my own pain for someone else.

I want to help her, care for her, but I can‚Äôt do much. I can‚Äôt tell what she‚Äôs thinking, and sometimes the way she talks to me makes me feel that she expects to know what she‚Äôs thinking and help her. I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know anything. I‚Äôm no therapist or counsellor, just another teenager who‚Äôs also struggles with life. 

I love her, but I hate this. I hate the fact that the thought of cutting her out from my life would make me happier. She‚Äôs a kind person, and I accept her for who she is, but this is too much for me. How do I stop her from overthinking, or how do I deal with this?",01Oct2020,1

Something I‚Äôve been struggling with for a while now is what to tell her about an experience I had in college. I had just broken up with my first girlfriend (she dumped me via text). I was so upset when a gay friend from home came to visit. I don‚Äôt know what it was or why I did it but I got really drunk and had sex with him. It never really got serious but we did continue to have sex over the course of the next several months and took a couple of trips together without anything more. It did result in my parents finding out about us and having a very homophobic reaction. My dad even tried to beat me up in the driveway. It was at that point I decided to lean into it because if I was gonna get assaulted and kicked out of the house, I better damn well be gay. Plus I wanted to support my friend, even if I didn‚Äôt have romantic feelings for him . I presented myself as bisexual for a little while but I‚Äôve since come to realize I‚Äôm actually (mostly) straight, I was just in a tough position that I wasn‚Äôt equipped to handle at that age. It‚Äôs been over six years and I‚Äôve regretted it all to this very day because it wasn‚Äôt fair to myself or to my friend who I permanently damaged our friendship with just one night of drunkenness and poor judgment. I basically have pretended like that whole 9 or so months never happened. Problem is, I‚Äôve never told my fianc√© any of this. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd be mad at me even if I was bisexual. But I do worry about her being angry that I hid this from her. On the other hand, part of me thinks it‚Äôs not really relevant to our current relationship.

355,"I'm an 18 year old girl. This year, I started studying at a University in Moscow (I live over 2000 miles away from Russia). However, because of COVID, I couldn't go. We were promised an answer, a solution, on the second Monday of September. We never got a solution. I'm one of the rare students who managed to get in contact with my classmates and teachers BY CALLING THEM ON THE GODDAMN PHONE. So I literally have nothing to do since online classes are nonexistent.

I love driving and I'm an amazing driver. Can't be wrong if I said I'm 10 times better than most drivers in my country. I asked my mom to get a job so I could have my own money instead of spending theirs, IF I get no info from my uni and if there won't be any online classes. She agreed and said it's a good idea since I could save up money for when I go to Russia. A week later, there was this amazing opportunity I found - a post express company was offering a driving job - I'd get my own van/car. I came out to my mom asking what I should do. Do I get a job? She said how I won't be rested enough to study if I got a job and that I can choose either to get a job or quit uni or to continue my uni work. WHAT UNI WORK? And why is this an ultimatum? So now I'm stuck in this house where both of my parents are fighting daily, where my anxiety levels rise day after day, where my trichotillomania is getting worse every day, and where I can't escape to go and earn money for my own sake. I have a monthly allowance of 67 euros, and I am obligated to give 20 for gas, which leaves me with 47 goddamn euros, out of which 5 would go to spotify. And if I have to travel to another city because of my/someone else's needs, I have to pay for the gas money there too. I can't do anything with that since I stream and play games and I would like to be able to buy new equipment or a new game every once in a while. I don't want to lose my parents since I know I still need them and they will need me, but I'm downright ready to snap and move away to my sister's.",01Oct2020,1

I have some concerns about some red flags demonstrated by the person who would be my new landlord. I'm supposed to be moving in with her daughter. The mom asked me if I would move in sooner and in leiu of charging me rent for this month, I would help them get the place ready since I already paid rent at my previous landlord/roommate's house for this month. She wanted a deposit on Tuesday that would go towards November's rent. When I looked at the place last week and we decided I'd pay the deposit for November, she called back later that day to say she wanted to use the deposit to pro-rate the days I'd be there in October. At first I agreed then realized that's not right - not only can I not afford to pay rent in two places, but she tried to go back on the verbal agreement we made. That's the first red flag. I called later that night and talked to her husband who said using the money and moving in in November would be fine. Then the wife called me and said she thought we were using it towards October. I told her I couldn't afford it and we got off the phone. The husband called back again and said using the money towards November would be fine. All of that was the second red flag. I paid her the money on Tuesday with a note that said it was for our November agreement. Today she sent the money back to me and told me to hold onto it. I asked her if they were backing out, as I was starting to get worried, and she said they were not backing out. Transferring the money back to me is the third red flag.

365,"Little bit of backstory/info. I started working at my current company in March of 2019, in a sanitation department on graveyard shift making a decent wage. In January of this year I switched to the maintenance department of the same company on day shift, then swing shift and made $2 more an hour than the previous job. I went to school for maintenance and want to do some aspect of it as a career in the future. Im currently considering applying for a senior lead position that would be replacing my old boss in the sanitation department as he quit and moved. This job pays $4 than what I started at and $2 more than my maintenance job. Should I apply even though it isn't exactly in my career path?",01Oct2020,1
366,"Long story short I(17m) got on my long board and skated to my girlfriend house around 11 o‚Äôclock last night and now it‚Äôs 4:00 in the morning, when I usually come home. Except the twist for tonight was after I left a flash flood warning kicked in and it started raining very very hard. My gf got me a Uber home but when I got home I threw my board out front like usual and hopped my back gate and came back in my house. My dad was downstairs on his computer drinking a water and immediately freaked tf out. 

I responded pretty fast I told him I just went for a skate ride because I had a nightmare and he said it has been raining for a while now. I told him it eased up outside for like 30-45 minuets, which I don‚Äôt think he bought tbh. He turned all the lights on and checked my eyes, which wasn‚Äôt a issue because I was stone cold sober and I emptied my pockets for him. He gave me a really really nasty look and said to just go up stairs. What should I say tomorrow? My problem here was I just snuck out tonight to see my gf because she had a super bad day, and I was supposed to actually sleep at her house later in the week but I don‚Äôt know if I blew my chance now...",01Oct2020,1
367,"Hi! About a year ago, I was kicked out of my moms house and I moved in with my dad. At my moms house, I was forced to pay for all of my own stuff, including clothes for work and food. My job didn't pay very well, so unless I was going out, I ate spaghetti and meat for most of the time because it was cheap. I would buy myself something sweet with the money I saved from my job and my mom would take it, so I started hoarding my food/items I used daily in my room out of fear she would use them and I couldn't afford to replace it. Doing this, I created a habit of being very upset when people touched my things or ate my food without asking. 

Recently, at my dads house, a family friend moved in with us. While we have normal ""hey I have to get up early for school"" issues, nothing has been too bad. But one day, she took some icing I had gotten and it made me really, really upset. I didnt say anything to her, but I asked my dad for advice. I explained to him that the only issue is that I wish she would have asked me and that I didnt care about her eating it other than she didnt ask. My dad told me that I just sounded ""nitpicky"" (in not so nice terms) and that I was right to want that but that isn't how it works and I kept asking him why I couldnt say anything to her to the point where I started crying because it bugged me so bad. My dad doesn't understand that it is issues with my mom. I tried to explain it to him but he just said ""it shouldn't"". I try to let it go, but today my brother came to visit and my dad brought it up and both he and my dad told me that I was being over dramatic and now I feel like it was even more stupid than before and like now I don't know how to feel about it at all because it really did bug me but I can't make it not bug me. I feel like something is wrong with me for feeling upset about it.

Does anyone have any advice to make help me get over it or at least understand what I mean? I just feel like no one understands that it isn't about me being right and it's more ""I'm dealing with things and it just makes me upset still"" and I'm not sure what to do. Thank you.",01Oct2020,1
368,"my little sister (9) has a teacher. She told me about something that happened in class: Her teacher had made a password that was, in my eyes, quite racist. But it's the kind that not everyone sees. I started to feel responsible for letting her teacher, we'll call her Sally, know that it was not okay and that she should not only change the password but also explain the children about racism. 

&amp;#x200B;

I emailed her. I explained what i heard, why i cared so much, that i thought she should change the password AND that she should elaborate on the topic in class so that the children wouldn't think it was funny anymore but that they would take it seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took about two weeks for her to reply, so i emailed again, asking if she had received my email. She replied (roughly translated): 

&amp;#x200B;

'Hey (me),

&amp;#x200B;

thank you for your email. I understand that the password upset you. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was not my intention to hurt anyone. The password has been changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

best wishes, Sally.'

&amp;#x200B;

I read it and got furious. Changing the password was the very least she could do. It wasn't about changing it. It is all about understanding and explaining the children. They STILL think it is funny, because of the lack of information and explanation that Sally should have given them.

&amp;#x200B;

If they don't learn, they will not understand. Sally will be part of raising them with racist thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now i don't know what to do. Of course i want Sally to do more about this. But i don't want there to be bad blood. For me, it absolutely isn't about blaming anyone. It is about her taking her responsibility and to right her wrongs.

Now don't get me wrong I don't hate any of them I quite like them. My issue is they lack any care and are very very lazy. This seems to affect me, I like to work as hard and fast as I can, but these lazy co-workers are really bringing me down and ruining my attitude. Yes, I have spoken to management about it and nothing has been done.

377,"My family are very attached. I'm 21 and for 2.5 years I've lived 1,500 miles away from them. I really love and ,in particular, care for my grandmother who is 80 and has many health issues. It hurts me being away from them and I think about it all the time. The fact that I'm wasting her final years by not being next to her. 

Recently I visited for what was supposed to be a 2 week stay; I ended up staying 9 days. As soon as I arrived I wanted to come across as a learned person, due to my job, and deal with her health issues and supervise her medication. That lasted for about a day or 2. The following 2 or 3 days I went out shopping with my mother at her insistance. After that I spent the remaining time in bed. I slept all day, every day. I didn't say a word to anyone. I didn't the room. I didn't want to go anywhere or greet anyone who visited. 

I ended up changing my return flight and didn't say anything until less than 12 hours prior to it's departure. Now, I have this conscious feeling that any day my grandmother can pass and the last time I saw her was under these shitty circumstances and I'll be truly devastated, thus I feel very guilty. We talked about it; I told her that I wasn't angry at anyone, I just missed home and was unhappy being there. To add on top of that, the day prior to me leaving was my mother's 50th birthday. 

During the 2 days leading up to my departure I was doubting myself; maybe I shouldn't leave as my mother had a weekend family gathering at the beach planned. When I changed my flight I wanted to go home to be able to study, as I'm also in the middle of a lot of school and things that need to be done. 

Now that I left I feel absolutely terrible. I doubt I'll be able to focus on school or get anything done. The feeling is eating at me. Yet, knowing myself I almost feel that I did it on purpose, not to hurt them but to hurt myself. It wouldn't be the first time that I do something truly hurtful to myself being completely capable of not doing it. 

I just don't know what to think if myself at this point. I completely recognize that there's some sort of masochistic aspect of my character that leads me to do things like these but I don't know why. I try to analyze my own personality, almost in a Freudian sort of way but I can't some to a conclusion. I recognize also, that these things are far from normal and I just wish to be a normal person thus I'm curious to hear another person's perspective.

380,"The pandemic derailed me HARDCORE. I even took unpaid medical leave for almost 2 months, because my fiance and I were in such poor mental and physical health. (I lost almost 20 lbs in 3 weeks and WE NAMED OUR CEILING FANS). My mom and sister drove 6 hrs to pick us up and 6 hrs back to her home in one day. We live in the densest part of a major city and heard helicopters day and night, with a max of 30 min relief. My fiance literally had helicopter-noise PTSD to the point that we were mostly asleep on the couch watching tv at my mom's and the air compressor for the fridge turned on he immediately sat bolt upright in a panic.

We came back to our home mid-June, well recuperated. It took me a while to reacquaint myself with where I was in terms of the data I was using and the paper I'm writing - that's normal, and my advisor was very understanding (of course, legally, he doesn't know what medical issue I took leave for).

In the past 2 months, though, I havent been able to get anything done. I TRY to work, I put in the hours, but in my apartment building there's a kid who just SCREAMS and his parents ignore him. Another guy paces to and from his open window on business calls all afternoon. My fiance is still really struggling.

We have been in a 1 bedroom apt, no backyard, no where else to go (other than the store) since mid-June. 

I basically have made no progress on my paper since August; my postdoc ends mid-November. 

This is a dream come true position with... some spaceship people... that I have completely fucked up and I am terrified to admit that I have nothing to show for the past 2 months. I requested a 1 on 1 meeting tomorrow (Thursday) because I can't just answer questions about my work in front of my colleagues on Friday's group meeting. I'm too ashamed.

382,"Hi. I live in Maryland (Baltimore County if that makes any difference.) My family's car has been parked in front of our house for awhile. That car won't start so we had been thinking about going to our dealer service center and getting it fixed. But bc of all the things going on right now, we haven't repaired it yet. I have another car so we've been using that one only for awhile.
Then this happened. Yesterday we found out the police towed the car. FYI: townhouse; no driveway; all street parking but the car was street-parked right in front of our house.

I called the towing company and was told that the police officer requested towing for a flat tire. He (towing company guy) said the police officer put a sticker on the windshield in August asking for repair and came back to check a month later (yesterday.) But it was still not fixed so he towed the car. 

The thing is we didn't think it had a flat tire. We just thought there might be a problem¬†with the car key or engine or whatever. Also, I never noticed the sticker. If we saw it we would have got it repaired sooner. Anyway, when I went to the towing¬†company to pay for the fees I checked what the sticker looks like. It says Abandoned Auto Notice but all the information was left blank. No date/vehicle/police officer info. How do I even know if it really was put in August? Also, the towing invoice/receipt that the towing company gave me says ""requested by BCPD; abandon auto."" Flatbed/ramp is also checked. But there's no police officer's¬†name on it. Aren't they legally required to provide that information?If it really is a flat tire, how can it be considered as an abandonment for parking right in front of our house all this time? And I still don't think it had a flat tire. I think it's the key. The car has been sent to the dealer service center. The tech will figure out the problem and fix it later today. So I don't know if it really was a flat tire YET.¬†
I had to pay $540 to the towing company to be released. I just feel like this is such an unreasonable decision by the police officer; and the fee is just ridiculous. It is much much more expensive than getting a speeding ticket or any other traffic ticket. For parking a lil problematic car in front of your own house? Do you guys think this is fair? Is it what people normally get for parking a car with a flat tire (IF it is)? I had no idea.
Since the towing company charges extra for additional days they store the car, we just paid the day we found out. It doesn't mean we agree with the amount. I'd like to dispute the amount by submitting an appeal or something. To the police officer? To the towing company? That I'm not sure. In these cases, what's the right step to get the fee waived/get a refund/reimbursement? The car insurance said the maximum amount they can reimburse for towing is $50; I checked the policy and it does say $50. So that doesn't help much.
Should I call the police station that towed my car and ask? email? Any other way to appeal? Do people really just pay this much whenever the police tow their cars for petty reasons? Do you guys hire lawyers for this type of issue?And do the police officers or police stations get some type of bribe/referral fee from the towing company for every car they tow? As I type this post, I found news articles about police officers getting bribes from¬†towing companies. So it does happen. I wonder if that's also true in my local¬†police station. I feel like there's so much injustice going on. I'm so pissed. Has anyone experienced the same thing? Any helpful advice would be appreciated.¬†",01Oct2020,1

Mid quarantine I decided to maybe start changing myself like exercising, studying, and eating healthier. I haven't done any of these even after months of trying. Because every time I endeavor to do so I have this suffocating feeling in my chest that makes me feel like Im anxious. It's like something is telling me to just stop whatever I am doing which is what I do.


This happens whenever I try to do something good or sometimes even just randomly or when I'm out on the streets. Even if I continue what I'm doing it just lingers. To get rid of it I usually just go to bed and watch youtube or play a game for hours on end.

385,"It's getting to a point where sometimes I'm worried I'm actually dead and a ghost or I don't actually exist.

I'm an introvert and keep to myself most of the time, when I'm talkative or being ""myself"" I've found out people felt uncomfortable/embarrassed/annoyed with me.

For example if I played a game, I'd get really into it. Cheering, commentating on other rounds, asking questions. I never acted negatively, however I found later someone there was really embarrassed by me and I should ""reign it in"" (I don't doubt her at all, I can only truly give how I saw my behaviour)

I've noticed whenever I do step in with my opinion (I don't have any extremist views, most of the time I'm even agreeing with someone) people will just go silent and move on as if I said nothing

In conversations, if I try to say something people speak over me, sometimes I ask a question and it's complete silence, sometimes someone will later ask the same question in the same group chat and they will immediately get help and advice

When I'm in a group of people, sometimes when I part ways with them but I've had to come back, they'll have started a personal conversation as if they wanted to get rid of me before they actually have a conversation

It's getting to a point where I hate socialising now. My family have a conversation and I can rarely get a word in and when they do ask me a question, I'll be answering then it turned out to be a gateway to them going to a new subject... Not including me

In group chats, if I send a response or a question it will go radio silent until they change the subject or outright ignore it and carry on talking.

One of the group chats is actually work involved and I feel like I can't even ask questions on there or annoy them with my presence.

It's like I constantly feel ashamed of who I am, I read self help books, do meditation, watch videos and read books on human relations to learn how to talk to people.

Sometimes ill make a new friend but I can tell within a few weeks they're sick of me and I know it's my fault.

389,"Hi guys, ive come here to share abit of my experience the past month or so and to reach out to other people who have maybe been in a similar situation and how they dealt with the matter.

My Boyfriend (19) and I broke up a month ago. It feels scary saying it because time has flown since ive been in probably the worst depression ive experienced in my life. Ive been diagnosed with BPP (borderline personality disorder) my relationship with my ex was toxic, from both parties. I absolutely adore him still, his actions towards the end were not very nice and i have alot of hurt, however truely love him. Ive realised though he doesn't want me. I have alot of trust issues now he promised me a future, we were looking at our own place together and he promised to never give up on me. I now need to move on in life. I dont know how to pick up the pieces and put them back together. 

I find it extremely hard to be myself around other people and honestly a major energy drain due to the fear of not 'being' a certain way or being straight up rejected a common thing with BPD. Ive taken positive steps which i definitely feel are the right ones, such as trying to get back into the gym, going to a mental health facility in 4 weeks that specializes in DBT, eating 3 meals a day because im barely eating and very very skinny ive also created resumes and im starting my own youtube. I recognise that doing these things will ensure i have a better future because i cant go get life, if i dont go out and get it. I also recognise Ive come a really really long way and probably would not have accomplished these things whilst i was with my ex.  The issue now is, im in a very small town, ive shut everyone around me out apart from my family and have no friends. I find it so extremely hard to talk to people and feel this overwhelming feeling that life has no purpose. How do I find my purpose i don't feel worthy of happiness because i dont feel worthy as a person. Like i said eariler i want life however, what is going out and getting it.  I see all the kids nowadays my age going out and partying and with groups of friends which is one of the reasons im taking a major break from social media but it hurts I envy that and it raises the question within me, why cant i be like that? Does heartbreak go away, does this feeling of feeling life isnt worth it go away, is social anxiety curable? Will I ever be normal? Because I certainly don't feel it.",01Oct2020,1

391,"Everytime I meet my brother, I realise more and more than we are very different and too different to feel connected in each other's lives. He is the kind to have superficial relationships with others just to fit in and I am more of someone that values deep connection. He told me about his plans to move to UK for college because he wants to be away from my parents (yet he doesn't want to move and deal with that independence) and I asked why UK he said it's the most ""strategic"" as we have cousins there whom he can stay with during the holidays. Cousins he doesn't even like and are toxic. He also keeps telling me toxic things my parents say about me. Today it was that my dad said no one would want to marry him because I have the body of a child (1. Why is he even sexualising the body of his daughter? 2. What kind of a dad says such stuff about his child that are not uplifting and are intended to tear 3. It isn't even true but it still hurt) and anyway, if he says it, either 1. he is not emotionally intelligent or considerate of my feelings and/ or 2. he must believe it or part of it. I am realising more and more than I don't want him in my life. I don't want to be ""fake"" or socialise for the sake of it and not get anything I need in return. I want things to be real, genuine and meaningful. Is this childish of me? Today he said that my dad said I am childish for moving as well (although this I have heard before and in my head it's really the most mature thing I have done and indeed my parents are more childish than me with the way they deal with things and us but I didn't even think that at first). Part of me thinks that my brother believes it that's why he says it as he doesn't deny it or defend me. And if so and I am childish, I want to grow and become more mature. Right now, I don't see this as me looking or acting like a 6th grader (childishly) (what was told to me).

I recently did a 180¬∞ and went from working in the aerospace industry to working in the video-game industry. Everything is great except for one thing.

For example if we watch TV together there's no place on the couch for me, neither for my brother. We just have to squeeze in. We don't have much to say about the channel we're watching (not that we bother too much, we both despise TV but it's one of the only activities our parents do) or the food we're going to eat. If I sit with my mom it's hard to begin a conversation because she's very occupied with her phone mostly. If we talk we both don't feel like she has actually listened to us.
 Can't really talk to my dad without provoking an argument or only recite the news..

397,"I‚Äôve been in a 18-month long distance relationship with my exgf. I‚Äôm in Europe and she‚Äôs in California. The relationship was always rocky and on/off with breaks initiated on her end.

Prior to her, I never had a girlfriend but I did have friends with benefits, as well as one night stands. My ex lost her virginity to me at age 24 (she had been Christian, then deconverted and met me around the same time). She always felt resentful of my ‚Äúpromiscuous‚Äù and ‚Äúcolorful‚Äù past, while she had been holding out for her future husband, and felt ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù that I had not waited for her.

When we first met in person, the sex was mind blowing because there was such an emotional connection. She was the first woman I‚Äôve ever loved, and the first time I‚Äôve made love to someone, not just fucked. It was bonding and unforgettable.

I know during that first trip, however, she felt dissatisfied with the lack of physical affection, especially in public. It‚Äôs embarrassing but she‚Äôs actually the first woman I ever held hands with in public at age 29.. the first woman I‚Äôve gone on true dates with, etc. I‚Äôm not naturally good with physical affection like that, especially since I never had a gf or truly dated someone. I did do my best to please her but I could tell she wasn‚Äôt fully satisfied.

After I went back home, the relationship got a bit rocky for several reasons, but I never stopped loving her.

A few months after the first trip, I went back to California to visit her for 9 days. During that second trip she was more vocal about her complaints about me.. especially the lack of physical affection. I‚Äôm new at a relationship so I did do my best but some things don‚Äôt come naturally to me, like holding hands all the time.

I felt unappreciated and taken for granted, so sometimes I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for sex. I think she initiated like 2-3 times but I turned her down gently. But one time she actually broke down crying, asking if I didn‚Äôt find her attractive or desirable, which wasn‚Äôt the case. I was physically attracted to my exgf, but I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood because we had been arguing and I felt like she treated me poorly.. I felt unloved.

When I returned home again, that‚Äôs when shit hit the fan. She started digging in my past if i desired my previous fwbs more than her, that I couldn‚Äôt satisfy her sexually, that I was selfish in bed, etc.

Ultimately she broke up with me. During that breakup, I really missed her and didn‚Äôt even think about being with anyone else. I was trying to move on but I couldn‚Äôt. About 3 weeks after, I reached out to her again, only to find out she had actually fucked another guy and they were casually dating.

We sort of mended things, she broke things off with that guy. The next months were brutal. She kept digging in my past again and started hurling abusive words towards me, comparing me to this recent guy. How he was a ‚Äúsex machine‚Äù and how he made her cum every time, how he was generous in bed and how I was lazy. How they had multiple sessions while I rejected her. How he was all over her and made her feel beautiful and desired.

Eventually she broke up with me again... then fucked a new guy. I found this out when again, I reached out to her hoping to mend things, and then she told me what she did. During all this time, even during the breaks, I have never been with anyone else.

Tldr: exgf blames me for breaking up and fucking other guys because I didn‚Äôt please her enough with affection and intimacy, and she felt undesirable. Is what she said valid? Am I to blame for her breaking up with me and then fucking other dudes? Is it because I didn‚Äôt give her enough affection and intimacy?",01Oct2020,1

405,"Hi I am currently living with my sibling their house.  (moved here for a job since I don't have my license yet) and thought I was doing fine, but about a week ago an incident occurred where they were drinking and I (someone who really doesn't like drinking) was forced to drink, where I had shots shoved in my face after me repeatedly saying that I don't want to drink them, I was even physically picked up and held down while threatened when I tried to go into my room (which is currently the basement which has no lock) to avoid them, it came to a point where  I was sat in a corner miserable when their friend had to tell them to let me go. 


My other siblings says I should've been more forceful with them. Ever since then I've been miserable wanting to go back home with my mother, but since I have a job and drivers training, (which I don't even know when they start lessons) test is in November. So for now I'm stuck for a month. The living situation here isn't the greatest either, the place is filthy even after my attempts to clean it due to them having young kids and not cleaning too often enough, they don't have a washing machine so we've been using a friend's nearby, I have a little privacy but the walls/floors are paper thin (I can be heard from the third floor). I'm constantly watching screaming children when I don't like children. Compared to where I used to live, I had clean clothes with a washer and dryer clean house that was easy to clean (relievely speaking, was the one cleaning mostly due to not having a job at the time) my adorable cat that I am missing the most, the family dog my own proper room and space. 


The sole positive i can see where ik currently living is where I am getting out(as in with my sister) more but that has stopped since I got a job. The jobs fine for a minimum wage job. Idk what to do the biggest thing I'm feeling is wanting to go home and I am just miserable here. My mother just says suck it up and deal with it saying it's the joys of adulthood. But if this is what adulthood is like I'm considering whats the point of even living.

406,"So currently I‚Äôm studying for a business and management degree. I studied GCSE‚Äôs back in 2010 and got all A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs. I then moved onto A-Levels and finished with and A in Fine Art, C in Design Tech and D in Physics. Far from ideal but it is what it is. 

After working for a few years in Graphic Design, Marketing and Sales I decided it wasn‚Äôt really fitting me right - I had a nasty experience with an employer that was greatly underpaying me and the work conditions were horrible. Very oppressive, so when I told him I was going to quit he threatened to take me to court. 

I was so shaken by it that I decided to go back into education to study a bachelors in business and management. 

Over the 3 year course I experienced some difficult times with my parents divorcing and various episodes of anxiety and depression. 
This led me to eventually drop out and move to studying online at open university. 

Then the coronavirus situation came about and I found myself very much in a bad financial situation. 

As I‚Äôm studying 60 credits between now and January I figure I will have some spare time to work part time as well to maximise the amount of money coming in. 

I‚Äôm stuck at what to do now as I have little to no money and I am getting no responses from jobs nearby or in other cities, perhaps because I am still studying.

407,"Hi all, I am 23M and my gf is 21. We have known each other 8 years now and were friends but during lockdown we started speaking and we have been dating 2 months now. 

I feel like my gf lies about her past as her parents always don‚Äôt believe anything she says and a lot of stories she has told me about guys always ends up being one thing, then turns out to be another. Little white lies that make a big difference to the story. 

She had about 2/3 talking stages during lockdown before me and that‚Äôs kind of got my head a bit messed up because some of these guys still ring her and ask for her etc cos they miss her and want her. She does however shrug off their advances and she says she loves me and wants to marry me/have kids in the future etc. 

I am not an insecure guy at all and I have a game face when it comes to her even mentioning this stuff. But she does also seem to mention guys to me 24/7 as if she‚Äôs trying to make me jealous, but like I say, I ignore it and I don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it.

409,"So tonight at about 8pm I went to get groceries from the store that‚Äôs located on a street that‚Äôs considered the center of the city. On the way back, I turned the corner to get into the yard of my building (typical commieblock but smaller) and around the corner I got ambushed by some kid asking for a cigarette

The corner is right next to a bus stop but there didn‚Äôt seem to be many people and same with the street in general. The younger kid was very short and had short hair but could have been anywhere from 16 to like 20 and he had a friend with him that was shorter and had darker hair but was most likely around the same age

He started by asking me if I had a cigarette and following me to the my entrance of the buildings (most buildings have 3-4 or more) 

I answered no, then he asked me if I was a sportsman (I‚Äôm tall and fairly built, I speak Russian near fluently but with a possible slight accent due to not rolling my Rs and not living here my whole life)

He asks again ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a sportsman?‚Äù I say no, then he says ‚ÄúWell what if I call someone rich and he has you killed?‚Äù

At this point I was shocked so I just said ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù And he repeated himself. I thought he would leave me alone when I came to my entrance but he was already there and blocking the place you can put the key in and wouldn‚Äôt let me in even though I kept saying ‚Äúplease, excuse me, etc‚Äù while he kept asking me for money, cigarettes, etc 

The whole time, his friend was standing at the bottom of the stairs to the entrance, maybe to keep an eye on the bus stop or maybe he just didn‚Äôt want to get involved and at this point he says something like ‚Äúcome on leave him alone, let‚Äôs go‚Äù

The first one asked me if I had 100 rubles for a bus ride and I said no (I obviously did, and I had several thousand rubles on me) then his friend asked ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even have any change?‚Äù And again I said no but it might have been pretty obvious I was lying 

The kid near me then asked ‚Äúwhat if I checked and you do‚Äù and at this point I really started panicking and asking him to move and leave me alone but he didn‚Äôt give in so with one hand that I had on my keys I started pushing the kid lightly away but he was resisting a little so I used more force and finally got the door to open 

At this point I was scared they would follow me in because the door is difficult to shut to my building and it stays open for about 30 seconds depending on how wide you open it and I ran to the other side and forced it shut but it seemed like there wasn‚Äôt anything holding it back on the other side 

The entrances to these Russian buildings only have about 20-30 people per entrance and I‚Äôm the only person I know who‚Äôs young and fairly tall and the rest of the people that live here are elderly babushkas or couples in their 30s-40s so if I came out of the building and they showed up say tomorrow during the day or at night it would be pretty obvious it was me. This time I was wearing a mask (which almost no one in Russia does) and a black bomber jacket with the Russian flag which might be associated with some gopnik/sports culture that I didn‚Äôt know about

I‚Äôm pretty freaked out about this but I know it‚Äôs most likely just an empty threat I just have no idea what to do since my heart has been beating really fast ever since it happened. If I called the police they would show up and it‚Äôs possible these kids wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere in sight so I don‚Äôt want to waste their time or get in trouble

426," One of my friends is going back to her home city in a couple months and I wanted to give her a gift to remember our time together. One thing we did a lot was skating during the winter, so I was thinking of getting her a t-shirt with a drawing on it of us skating at the skating rink with a purple sky, based on some pictures I have.

The only problem is that I can't draw for the life of me, so I'm not sure how I could get this done. Do those companies that make custom t-shirts also design them if I were to give them details of how I want it to look like? Or do they only make a t-shirt given an image? If it's the latter, is there some place that I could get an artist to design the image for me, and then give to those custom t-shirt making companies? Perhaps even somewhere on reddit?

For reference I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Not sure if anyone from Toronto knows of any specific places that would be relevantly useful for me.

430,"Hey long story short 

I had an ex who used to manipulate me into doing stuff by saying you're the man you should do it. It was both financially and emotionally, we ended up breaking up in a bad way

Now. Seeing someone new, we've spent 3nights and a day together, as petty as it sounds those days I paid for the hotel and food. Which I didn't mind, infact was happy to do it because I wanted to be around her

We are suppose to meet this weekend and my money is running a bit low, so I can get it again except it put me in a bad position.

So I asked her if she can get it and if it's troublesome I'll pay her back when payday comes round. Which is reasonable in my eyes 

She said in her exact words ""tbh i don‚Äôt want to go to a hotel of that‚Äôs the case and i am kinda offended you asked me. i think we‚Äôre too early in this to ask for favours like that. you‚Äôre the man and actually i expect you to do that. i won‚Äôt lie and act like the cool relaxed girl cos later i won‚Äôt get what i want. if you can‚Äôt date me then pls don‚Äôt""

I said to her fair enough I won't ask you again 

To which she replied I'm just joking, send the locations

I believe I can read people well, she just copped out but anyways because of what she wrote I'm starting to see her in a less respectful way than before if you know what I mean. She lost something from me

438,"A couple of weeks ago while I was sick (not COVID), I got into a fight with Tina (not real name), who I had once considered one of my best friends. The fight started over a comment that she made about how I‚Äôm currently living with my parents by choice due to the pandemic. She said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to be independent?‚Äù  
I replied, ‚ÄúI can be independent while living with my family. I‚Äôm living with them because I want the company.‚Äù  
Now here‚Äôs the thing, Tina and I were roommates for about 2 years. The short version of why our co-living situation ended at the end of January on strained terms is because she changed her mind on multiple occasions about what her plans were for the future of our roommateship. When she finally made up her mind at the last minute, it left me scrambling to find new housing. On top of that, she was cold towards me, focusing on finding a condo that her parents would buy for her and then later changing her mind and renting a studio apartment. When I did find a place to live, she kept trying to get me to agree with her that living alone will be great even after I indicated that I wasn‚Äôt entirely happy about the situation. Then my cat and her dog died in a week of each other. She did offer me support for the first night, but when I offered her support she refused and went to her room. I know she is not obligated to accept help, but still, that is a time when it is good to have friends. Our roommateship ended with Tina moving out on the first of February, although we talked briefly about why she made her choices at the beginning, we never discussed how that choice hurt me emotionally and financially. Before COVID hit, I was in the process of considering if I should have a deeper conversation with Tina about how her choice affected me.  
**-Long Story-**  
In October of last year, we got the renewal offer from the apartment building, our rent had gone up 11% which was more than the standard increase and we have until Dec. 20th to accept the new contract. Tina says no big deal she will negotiate it down. It is then that she tells me that she is thinking about moving our six months into the new lease because she wants to live on her own. I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs fine just give me two months‚Äô notice.  
A couple of weeks pass and then Tina tells me that she‚Äôs talked to her parents and they are thinking about buying a condo in the city that we live in and then having her be the tenant. Now the city that we live in is not cheap, so they weren‚Äôt going to do this unless she planned to live there for the next few years which she wasn‚Äôt sure about yet. So, she might move out after four months instead, which again is fine as long as I two months warning so that I can find a new roommate. I then asked her how the negotiations were going, she said slow, but don‚Äôt worry she has it. At this point, I should have known that I needed to take over, but I trusted her since she‚Äôs my friend.  
Over the next few weeks to the beginning of December, I have offered to help with the negotiations by researching standard rent increases for the area and tenant rights. Tina says hey you know a lot about this stuff you should take over negotiations, which I do.  
On Dec. 17th, three days until the deadline and when I am leaving town to visit my family, I‚Äôm doing great. I have been doing a good job of negotiating the price down when Tina sends me a text message while I am at work to say she won‚Äôt be signing the new lease. After talking to her dada, she has decided that she is going to move out once the lease ends because her parents are going to buy her a condo. Tina says that she has wanted to live on her own for a while because she wants to be independent. With my permission, she wants to email the realtors to take her name off the lease, if that is okay with me?  
Of course, I‚Äôm livid. Like what the hell, how am I going to find someone to take your spot in three days! I want to yell, but I am at work, so I choose to keep calm. I ask her, ‚ÄúWhen did you decide this?‚Äù She replies just now! I say okay, we should talk about this later tonight. And then she says, ‚ÄúCan I email the realtors?‚Äù. My stomach sinks, at this point I know that even if I had pictures of the apartment for an advertisement, three days is not enough time. I‚Äôm screwed. I have to agree and I‚Äôm going to lose the apartment that I had considered my home. Predictably the realtor emails us back to raise the rent to way more than I can afford even if I found someone that day.  
Tina and I talk later that night. She does most of the talking about how this is for the best and how she is so excited to live by herself. I‚Äôm feeling numb and my anger is still simmering. I say ‚ÄúI am happy for you and that you deserve this. But please note that I am currently mad not because I will have to move, but because you changed your mind three times after we had an agreement.‚Äù She says I told you as soon as I made my choice and don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll love living by yourself.  
My problem with this is even if she told me as soon as she made her choice, I have to wonder how long it took her to make that choice because choosing to live in a condo that your parents buy is not a split-second decision. She had to had have been in discussion with them for at least a day if not more.  
The next three days are a blur. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what kind of housing I can afford and different ways that I can find either a roommate or group housing. It's awful. I‚Äôm stressed and can barely concentrate on my work because although I technically have two months to find a place to live, I‚Äôm going to be gone for two weeks and many realtors in my area want to have people lined up a month ahead of time for move-in. So, when I get back from vacation, I have two weeks to tour and sign a lease.  
Those two weeks are some of the most stressful of my life. I‚Äôm barely sleeping. I‚Äôm basically going to work, scheduling tours, and then doing two tours after work for multiple nights a week. What‚Äôs most frustrating is that half of the tours are getting canceled before I can even see the place because affordable housing is really competitive. When I am home, Tina acts very distant and gives me the cold shoulder. At some point, she does tell me that she has found an apartment and she is so excited that it has a balcony. That‚Äôs right an apartment, not a condo.   
I do think that Tina felt bad that her decision affected me negatively because she tried to get me to sign up for this millennial housing app that was in the vein of WeWork. I did look at them, but ultimately decided that it didn‚Äôt look like a stable situation. Eventually, I did find an apartment with the help of another friend. It was small and at the very top end of my budget, but it was clean and the building was safe.  
One of my issues is that during this time Tina keeps asking me if I‚Äôm excited to move. Keeps saying things like you‚Äôre going to love living on your own. She is so excited to finally be independent. She keeps trying to get me to agree with her and she keeps assigning her own feeling to me without asking. I do try to push back a little, but I don‚Äôt have the energy and really don‚Äôt want to argue. I also don‚Äôt feel safe discussing her behavior along with how the situation made me feel.   
It is around this time that my cat dies. I dissolve into a sobbing mess on the couch and almost drink an entire bottle of wine by myself (I usually never do this). Tina is kind enough to hug me, get my tissues, and hand me a glass of water. Then I don‚Äôt see her for the rest of the night. I‚Äôm a barely functioning wreck for the next while and she doesn‚Äôt provide any comfort outside of the first night.  
The week of Tina‚Äôs move comes, and she tells me that her family is going to put down her dog the day that she moves. I hug her and say I‚Äôm so sorry. I then offer her ice cream and/or alcohol and my company to either talk about it or distract her from it. She says no. She wants to be alone. I also offer to help her on the day of her move which she says no to as well. On February 1st, the day of her move, I offer to come over after and help her unpack, she says no to this too.  
My move comes mid-February and with the help of some good friends it goes off without a hitch (seriously whenever I can see them again, I‚Äôm going to cook them dinner). I unpack and get my life in order again and then COVID hits and I didn‚Äôt get the chance to have a serious talk with Tina. The reason I wanted to have this discussion was so we could clear the air. I wouldn‚Äôt even ask for an apology because I understand that she was only thinking about herself and that she needed a change of scenery after she and her boyfriend of 6 years broke up. I tried to be as supportive and understanding as I could, it's just the way she went about it really hurt me emotionally and financially.  
**-End long story-**  
Now that you have the relevant background information, I‚Äôll talk about what we fought about. I‚Äôve only gone back briefly to reread the conversation because frankly, it's painful to read. What‚Äôs worse is that I was coming down something (not COVID) and I didn‚Äôt know that I had a fever until much later.  
It started with a comment that I made on the group chat about how the pandemic makes me feel like a car stuck in the mud. She is the first to reply and says if that‚Äôs how you feel why don‚Äôt you come back to the city. I say no, its better for my mental health to be home. Which she then replies to by saying, ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt you want to be independent?‚Äù  
This comes off as really insulting because it makes me think back to when she would imply that the only way to be truly independent is to live on your own. Never mind that she was very independent when we lived together. I reply I don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt be independent and live with your family. For me having that support makes me feel safer and having regular human contact is good for my mental health. One of our other mutual friends says, ‚ÄúWoah wait I don‚Äôt think Tina meant to insult you, you are overreacting.‚Äù  
I exit the group chat and text Tina directly to say sorry that I overreacted, it was because I am feeling a lot of anxiety over the current state of the world as well as some other factors that I don‚Äôt want to talk about right now. She says no problem, what other things. I text back that I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. She says I think that we better or we not as good friends as I thought.  
This takes me back. I don‚Äôt want to talk about this, but I don‚Äôt see a way out of this. I believe in being honest with my friends, so it doesn‚Äôt occur to me to lie or find another way to dodge the conversation. I say let‚Äôs talk after work. Tina insists on talking now and by text (I should have insisted phone or facetime).   
I explained the gist of it, in less detail than what I laid out here, and to say the least, she didn‚Äôt react well. She said that I had no right to feel the way that I do since we talked about it. She also insists that I am remembering things wrong and she found my apartment for me. I respond that we didn‚Äôt really talk about it in depth since what she remembers is her talking about how great everything is going to be and she didn‚Äôt really allow me much room to talk besides to say I‚Äôm not happy. We argue some more, but when I feel like we‚Äôre just beating a dead horse, I put my anger aside and say that she has made some good points and that our friendship is not worth a fight. We should keep this fight between us and her therapist because it is private, and we shouldn‚Äôt drag other people into it. I add that my only intension was to clear the air.  
She doesn‚Äôt reply for a little while and then she says that I am a bad friend and a toxic person. That I have never supported her and that I am the least empathic person she has ever met. And then she brings up my cat. She says that I didn‚Äôt support her when her dog died as she did me when my cat died. She is also going to tell all HER friends whatever she wants. If fact I have never been the friend that she deserves.   
I‚Äôm shocked I don‚Äôt see where this is coming from. I try to text her to get her to explain. I even call her to apologize because this is my fault, I shouldn‚Äôt have lost my cool in the first place. But I get nothing, and I‚Äôve heard nothing for weeks. At the time, I told each of our mutual friends what in general happened, but I don‚Äôt go into detail because the situation is between Tina and me. I also add that I am taking a step back from the group chat and if they want to talk to me, they can text me. I later find out that it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if I tried to use the group chat, since Tina kicked me out of it. Except for the friend who helped me find my housing, I haven‚Äôt heard from the others since then.  
I know that I am not blameless, in fact, I blame myself. I shouldn‚Äôt have argued back. I shouldn‚Äôt have tried to talk about my issues. I should have tried to avoid the conversation since I knew this would happen. I knew Tina would react exactly like this and then kick me out of our friend group because of it. But I couldn‚Äôt find a way to avoid it, so it is my fault.  
With this in mind, dear people of Reddit, please tell me if there is anything that I can do to salvage the situation. Should I try to save my friendship with Tina? Or should I just move on? If I try to save the friendship, then for her October birthday should I send her a card or something?

444,"TLDR: Issues when connecting with girls, just get attached to them to quickly and overthink a lot of things. want help sorting it out cause it's very unattractive. Issue 2 I'm an idiot

Hey all,

I Just would like to get some things that I really don't like about myself and I just would like some advice on how to fix my issue. I know other people have much more serious issues but thank you for taking your time.

Ok so I've never had a girl as a friend before, all my friends in school were male and college it was male, I did have a female friend in college but the issue I had came up and ruined it for me. I need help sorting it out cause I'm 21 and I hate being like this everytime.

Every time a girl gets close to me I always get feelings for them really quick, like I need to protect them or something, I want to be there for them all the time and if they ever get hurt I wish I can help them, this problem always pushing them away and it makes me very upset about myself. I've tried to change who I am and all but that reaction I do comes so naturally. I don't want to change me though that's the thing. people always say love finds you but it sure as hell does not. I need something to stop myself being a fool and turning girls away, I get jealous as hell for no reason and I just feel hurt when a girl I chat to is chatting to other guys, I don't get mad at her and I just get upset, I'm really expressive and a girl knows when I'm upset so they always asks what's wrong but I'm like nothing to do with you it's my brains fault etc. I say you're your own person you do whatever you want just don't care about me go live your life how you want.

I just don't want to be me but I can not change me.

I always open up really quick that's another thing, We could meet at a bus stop and we start chatting I could go from telling you about work to my sex life in a heart beat. I can say whatever and it sucks cause people can use my opening up as a weakness. I'm really expressive and I say what I want without thinking much. 

Sorry for the random points everywhere in this, I'm just really mad and upset with myself cause I always lose people and I'm sick of it. A girl just ghosted me for the reasons I've posted and its just awful.",01Oct2020,1
445," My SO and I sometimes have arguments about money and today is one of those days where I‚Äôm really getting annoyed with it, so I‚Äôd like to hear your opinion if maybe I am too pretentious in this relationship.

So we usually split everything 50-50. Both of us work and we have a similar (good) income. We live together, so we split the and bills 50-50, when we buy groceries we split also exactly 50-50 (even though he buys and consumes more stuff than me), even when we go out for a date each of us pays for their own consumption.

The main problem started with this month when I had a miscarriage and was hospitalized ‚Äì I paid all the expenses for hospitalization + blood tests which is half of my salary. He agreed to pay this month the bills to be in balance with my spending. Yesterday he only paid half the bills and demanded that I go pay the remaining half, which meant that I spent now all my remaining money after hospitalization and now have nothing left. Now I am moneyless + with bleedings after helping him carry his furniture downstarts, because he thinks that I am only playing the victim here.

Beside the split, I am the only one who takes care of the house chores (cleaning, feeding the animals, cooking, laundry etc). All he does when he comes home is watch tv and drink + argues with me when the does not find food ready in time on table (when he arrives from work)- I usually arrive only 1h earlier and it is very hard for me to finish both shower, laundry and food at same time.

He demanded I pay the expenses for his car which I only use when we both go grocery shopping once a week. Everytime he must take me somewhere with his car I pay for the gas and car wash. He demands his money back even when I ask him to buy me a cheap chocolate‚Ä¶

Am I being too extreme? I never ask him for anything extra that I need to buy in the house, I really don‚Äôt count every single penny that should be split, but he does want everything to be 50-50 when he buys any small thing.",01Oct2020,1
446,"We live together, so it's pretty awkward for me to say anything and he doesn't take it well anyway. But last night he took a call from his friend in front of me while I was cooking us dinner, I couldn't hear what she was saying, just her voice talking. I could tell she asked about  me because he referred to me directly, then things got weird, he got really nervous and kept trying to move the conversation along. He then started replying more frankly and was saying pretty rude stuff about me and us living together. I stood there in shock at what was coming out of his mouth, and knew what was coming out of his friend's mouth was likely way worse.

447,I am not allowed to date but I am anyways. I am dating this guy I really like and yesterday when I was home alone I invited him over. We did quite a lot. We made out and other things among that group. I thought we could avoid the cameras outside but it is possible my mom could see what happened on her phone. She is out of the country but if she were to check the cameras in the moment that everything happened then she would be able to see. The camera has no SD card so it cannot be played back.

448,"This is my first time on Reddit. I'm unsure of these posts work but I came to ask for advice.

I struggle a lot with understanding day to day life. I often feel like I'm living every day just so that the next day comes and goes. This cycle is always on repeat for me. I struggle with expressing my emotions. I don't find much passion for anything either. I also struggle with motivation. I feel like my life is just dull. Nothing ever happens, and when events do occur in my life, they are often displeasing. I also find it difficult to be happy. It is a bit frustrating at times for me because I want to be happy but something just doesn't click and I can't express it the right way. I can't tell really anyone how I truly feel. I keep everything to myself. I know this isn't healthy mentally and emotionally, but I can't help but think that no one else will understand.

I feel like maybe living isn't right for me. That maybe I was given my life as a burden. Although I do enjoy my friends, and where I live...I just can't help but feel that living life just isn't for me. I would really appreciate anything that will help me get past this :)",01Oct2020,1

I live on the hill, and share an upstairs floor/bathroom with a guy who omits an insanely bad/very noticeable smell at almost all times. Now, it used to just be contained to his room but as time has progressed, the smell has gotten stronger (and worse) somehow, and now makes the entire top floor smell really bad unfortunately.

I have tried my best to stay quiet because he may have a genetic condition or something else going on that I am not aware of, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where simply exiting my room to walk to the bathroom (and often being in the bathroom) had made me throw up. I also know that all other members of our house have noticed the same smell, and that other people have previously mentioned the smell to him including his sister.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, why I always do this to myself. I acknowledge my mistakes and promise myself ill do better next time and then continue making the same mistakes. 

I started uni straight out of highschool. I wasnt sure what I wanted to do. I‚Äôve always been interested in medicine, but wish someone stopped me after first year bc I was stubborn enough not to admit that I might not be capable of even being smart enough to go to medicine. 

I was in Life Science, coming from a south asian household. I was raised by strict parents Education first, relationship after. But guess what I was in a relationship already, still I‚Äôm like it‚Äôs okay I have my shit together. Starting uni, nope I don‚Äôt.

I barely got through first year with 1.14 gpa lol. I was stressed and i guess thats where I really started doubting anything moving forward. I was scared to tell my parents or even talk to anybody about it because I did not know that I can withdraw from courses if i needed to or taking a break from school re-evaluating my entire life was even going to be allowed.

Im like okay maybe its just the transition, i continued really putting myself through hell and worked my ass off to pull it off just enough so I am not put on academic probation lol finished with a 1.5 gpa 

Again medicine was still the goal I honestly do not know what I was trying so hard. My cousins are all doctors, my parents are strict, people will judge. I am constantly blaming other ppl and what they will think of me. Still in my relationship that was prob the only good thing I had going on.

Then I found out about this school in a different province, their medschool admissions were just for people in their province. As long as I make the cutt off. So i decided to drop everything i had home and move there bc im stupid i thought maybe a change of environment will help me focus more get my grades up figure my shit and get into med

I hate my life it‚Äôs been 2 years since i moved there. Transfered into lol BSc Kinesiology to get better grades. Got better grades but didn‚Äôt realize how stupid i was for thinking my avg will change drastically it only went up like 2.3. I was literally so stressed and depressed and angry with myself living there with a roommate. I always complained why shit never works out to my with my bf who i made things long distance with. Now my relationship was going shit too. I was straining it everyday by complaining more than loving him more. I‚Äôm suppose to apply next year but here I am knowing i made a huge mistake moving out here but cant back out now bc everyone is going to know what kind of dumbass i am for blindly moving hopes to have like 1/3 chances of getting into ONE med school with my trash grades üò≠üò≠üò≠

I am literally struggling mental break downs and not knowing who to talk. I took all my frustration out on my bf. Whom i expected him to understand everything but how could he he wasnt stupid like me. Yet he was supportive and took all my shit. Until he really just realized damn ive spent majority of my life with a dumbass she doesnt even know what she wants to do with her life. She‚Äôs not even going to make it alive and if i stay longer im going to die with her. So he broke up with me. Lol and there i went to complete shit. I hit rock bottom, i am searching for reasons why I am like this. Spent the entire summer heartbroken and crying everyday about what I have done with my life. I am worthless to the bone. No one is going to respect me no one is going to look at me. The one person I who thought of me as the world after 5 years broke up with me he knew there was no fixing me. He can‚Äôt fix me, I was broken all along and then longer he got to know me the more he witnessned my deepest darkest secrets and fears. I realized i literally fucked up my entire life don‚Äôt have the grades, wasted so much money, ruined relationships, can‚Äôt talk to my parents tell them their eldest daughter is literally suffering.

I‚Äôm in my last year of uni lol idk why i always set my bar up so high to failure. I enrolled into 5 courses and research thinking its going to be online, i can handle how hard can it be. FUCK MY LIFE MAN. Im balls deep behind in all of them. I feel so alone in this world like why do i suck so much in life. I was finally pulling an upward trend of 3.6-3.8 now im going to tank it all again in my final year. 

Literally cannot even apply to med if i wanted to. All the people im surrounded by me are moving forward achieving their goals. How did i end up in this position. How? Bc i couldnt stop comparing myself to everyone. I compare compare compare instead of focusin on my shit. Now i have worthless grades, worthless degree, have no idea how im going to finish this year in sold peace. I am constantly so worried. Now i know i fucked up big time cause i wasted 3 years of my life making my life harder than it already was. Shitty grades cant even get myself into a masters if i wanted to. All the people i complain about, i was really just envious why everything comes easy to them. I am such a horrible person man. I legit want to just drop out. But drop out and do what??? Why am I like this. 
My anxiety itself is going to kill me soon. 

Now I can‚Äôt apply to medicine, everyone is going to be like then why did u go there in the first olace including my parents. I was trying to escape and using school as an escape was a mistake. I need serious help. 

I can‚Äôt talk to my friends, my cousins, my family because I am going to get so wrecked and judged. My family pride and dignity is all ruined cause they raised a dumbass daughter who doesnt know how to make proper choices and wasted her early 20s fucking up the rest of her life.

477,"I've had a lifelong struggle with my last name: ""Kluk"" *(pronounced ""Cluck"" or ""Klook"", depending on who says it in my family. I say ""Cluck"").*

I'm a white dude with blonde hair and blue eyes. It's a Polish name with no negative connotations or historical connections (that I'm aware of). However, it's also just one letter away from ""Klux"", as in, the ""KKK"".

This, in combination with my demographic, has made me hyper-aware and I avoid saying it at all costs, opting to spell it instead. Whenever I say it over the phone, I get long pauses. I've become even more self-conscious lately given the recent movement for racial equality. I'm worried someone will think I'm associated with the KKK and take offense.

Less important, but it's also the sound a chicken makes (lol). I've received far more ridicule and jokes and bullying for this growing up; sometimes even now at 30. I've learned to deal with it, but I don't want my kids to experience the same thing when they grow up. My wife did not take my name, nor did I expect or care for her to.

Parents divorced when I was 2, mom raised me (saw my dad every other weekend). Her maiden name is **much** nicer and I want to switch to it. She also doesn't have much family because she was adopted. I never got along with my dad, but the relationship has improved a lot in my adult years. I also don't associate with my grandfather (now deceased), as he's been accused of sexual assault. Allegations are unconfirmed, but I believe them. My dad's side of the family doesn't. I don't want to carry his name.

I'd much rather honor my mom and her work in raising me (despite her own faults), but I don't want to destroy my relationship with my father and his side of the family who are of a more conservative mindset and may take offense. My dad certainly would. There are already open wounds from another direct family member leaving the family. I do not think he is capable of having a rational conversation about it without emotions getting involved.

I don't want to hurt him or that side of my family -- who despite their misguided political leanings are still good-intentioned people -- but I don't want to live the rest of my life with a last name that I'm embarrassed about and make my kids do the same.

479,"I need advice on something and I don't know who to turn to so I did what any sane person does and turn to reddit of course. So my parents are divorced but always lived around the same area in the US. I enjoyed living with my mom much more, mostly due to my abusive stepmother and the fact that my mom's family is rather wealthy and my dad is dirt poor. Around New Year's, my stepdad was offered a pretty big job in Ottawa, Canada so they decided that they were leaving for Canada. All of my siblings had to go to Canada with them, but I'm much older then them and was given the choice on whether or not I were to go to Canada or stay here. To most people, the choice was obvious. Any normal person would choose to live in a 2 million dollar house in Canada rather than a trailer in rural Pennsylvania. I chose to stay with my dad. Now, why would I do that? Two things: 1. I was rather popular and had lots of friends. 2. I had a girlfriend. Now, I may seem stupid for staying here for a girl, but this was different. We were a very VERY strong relationship for two 15 year olds. We had been friends for years before hand. We had been dating for two 2 years, and almost everyone I knew, whether it was friend or family was 100% sure that we were going to get married. So, I wanted to stay here for her. For a chance of being happy with her. And the rolled in dumb bitch Lauren. (That's not her real name) About a year ago my now ex-girlfriend had met her and became best friends with her. When they met, Lauren was dating this one boy. To be honest, I hated Lauren ever since the start. But, never said anything to keep my girlfriend happy. My girlfriend and I had never gone through a rough patch through our whole 2-years but out of nowhere, as soon a Lauren had broken up with her boyfriend things were different. About a month after all that started, my girlfriend of 2 long years dumped me over text. I asked her why and she just said ""idk"". As the weeks went on, I noticed that less and less people began talking to me. It was finally to the point that I was only talking to like 2 people. One of them, has absolutely 0 social life and literally only talks to me. The other one I guess is just very loyal. So, the loyal one finally told me what was going on. Lauren and my ex had told just about everyone that I was friends with that I had hit her. This is absolutely false. Lauren had always also hated me and everyone knew that the only reason that Lauren kept my ex around is because Lauren thought that she was better than her in every way possible. I believe that Lauren thought that if she didn't have a boyfriend and her ""best friend"" did, then people would think less of her somehow. I had always battled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since 5th grade. About 2 months after everybody turned their backs on me I had planned on killing myself. I had texted several people, but no one responded, or they just told me to leave them alone. I had finally gotten to my last resort, I texted my ex. Bad news, she was actually with Lauren when I texted her. So Lauren went on to text me, tell me how awful I am and then said ""You know, maybe you should go kill yourself."" So that said it, I had full intentions on doing it when my my one friend from earlier who I said was very loyal had called me. I told her everything and then I stayed at her house that night. She saved me. So, last week I had heard some lovely news. My ex and Lauren had a falling out. I do not know over what. She had also apparently began to tell people that I never hit her. People have began to apologize to me and talk to me. I went to text my ex about it, but there I was confused. I texted her and only then had she blocked me on everything. Not before, NOW. Now, throughout all of this, my home life has been terrible. I don't talk to my dad even though I live with him. My step mom has continued to be abusive. I am barely eating enough. Also, due to me talking to barely anyone for about 6 months, my social skills have PLUMMETED. My mom has been paying for me to see a therapist recently and my therapist wants me to go live in Canada. Well, I was going to go through with it, but then one of my exes good friends had texted. She had apologized to me and then told me that my ex had blocked me because she was ""scared, embarrassed, and ashamed."" She did say that she does want to talk to me though. I've decided that I'm giving it till New Year's to make my final decision on moving. One of the problems is that my ex doesn't know about this whole moving situation and I'm afraid that when she'll want to talk, it will be too late. So, that is where I come to you r/advice.

484,"So I'd been friends with this girl for a couple of years and she's lived in the area for a while now. She moved in with her partner and they asked me whether I could move in with them as the area is expensive. I've always got along with them both well so I was happy to find somewhere with them. It's all been fine for about 7 months and we've just signed somewhere new together. However I have noticed a very different side to my friend now that I live with her. She can be the most lovely, generous and energetic person 80% of the time but I've seen her in arguments with her partner and she can suddenly snap/be terrifying when he doesn't do anything wrong. I had noticed she could be cold to other people before but only if she really disliked them and I'd always been close with her so it was never an issue.

However, my dad became unwell and was hospitalised so I started having to leave the flat a lot - my mood dropped quite a lot and I'm aware that I probably stopped contributing to the house chores etcs as much as I should have when this was going on (she was aware of the situation with my family). I noticed that she started becoming colder with me and I cancelled one of our meetings last minute as I was with family - she became very angry and sent me some long messages about my disrespectful behaviour. I asked to speak to her face to face and we had a massive heart to heart - I apologised and admitted that I'd definitely not been contributing enough to the house, hadn't been considering their feelings as much and promised that I'd make much more effort from now on. She asked me to be honest too so I let her know that it had bothered me slightly that I had looked after their dog for 2 weeks while they were on holiday and they didn't thank me. I also mentioned that I'd prefer if they included me when considering things for the flat (e.g. they bought a new table without telling me and then asked me to pay towards it). We were all very honest and we hugged it out before making dinner together so I thought it would be fine from then on.

However, it's been 4 weeks since the talk and she has been completely cold/passive-aggressive with me since. I've made a very conscious effort to contribute and be friendly to her, but she started the passive-aggressive behaviour the next morning after our talk. She'll ignore me or snap at me when I ask her something, e.g. I asked her ""Did you have fun last night"" and she just went ""Obviously"" before raising her eyes and walking off. I can't think of one normal nice conversation that we have had since. I then went to visit family on my birthday - her partner sent me a message in our group wishing me a happy birthday but my friend totally ignored me and didn't contact me? She was also in the group and saw his message but didn't say anything. I wouldn't care if this was a random housemate, but we've been friends for years so I found this pretty upsetting. On her birthday, I had thrown her a party and tried to make it special for her.

How would you approach it? I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells and she will communicate with me if she needs to know something about our new property, but otherwise she is completely cold. I spoke to a mutual friend who stated that basically if she starts disliking you then she won't be friendly. We've already had the talk and hugged it out so I don't understand what to do? I'm honestly really scared about moving in with this for another year? Any advice would be really appreciated!",01Oct2020,1

486,"Buckle up, this is going to be long.
Also, I am on mobile and englisch is not my first language so please be kind.

Protagonists with current ages
Me - 25 f
Mum  - 59
""Dad""/E - 52
D - ""step"" mom, 54
J - Ds first daughter, 31
L - half-sister, 17
David - ex-boyfriend, 27

So my parents had me shortly after their marriage when they both were in their 30s. I was an accident and my mum honestly never wanted kids but as soon as they found out about me, they just decided to keep me.
I lived with my parents and grandparents (moms side) in a relatively big house with a family owned restaurant.

My parents got divorced when I was around 7 years old. My dad got his (second!) affair pregnant with my half-sister (D threw away the unused condom and practically asked him to go for it so it was kinda intentionally) and I was asked if I wanted to live with them (20km away) or with my mum and grandma. I decided to stay with my mum bc I didnt  want to move and my dad never really expressed that he wanted to have me there anyways so I did not see that as an option anyways.

I have to say that until that point my dad was honestly a great father. He wasn't home much bc he had to work another job as we closed up the restaurant when I was 4 but he still took me on father-daughter trips, bought me toys and often took some time off just to play videogames with me . I was an absolute ""daddys girl"" until he left. My first word even was ""Papa"". (Germany)

As soon as my half-sister was born, he dropped all of that completely. He still paid (some, less than he agreed to) child support but that was it. At the beginning I was visiting them at their new house every two weeks but I quickly didn't feel welcome there as everything was about the baby and I felt more like a visitor. J and D were always nice to me, tho. It just didn't feel like I was still part of the family and kinda like I emotionally lost my Dad to them. 

My Mum was struggeling financially to keep our house for the first years after that and she had a lot of unpaid debts. I have a very strong memory of 8y/o me giving her 20‚Ç¨ I found on the street to help her because even If she never told me directly about our problems, I could see she was sad and worried all the time and that it had to do something with money and the divorce.
My grandparents (her parents) also lived with us in a seperate apartment in the house so she had to work full time while gandma looked after me. 

Over the next years my dad turned into a big narcisst. He always went on rants about my mum, grandma etc., made me feel guilty if I wanted to go home to my mum, made me eat food I didn't like, made me look bad next to J because she bonded really well with L and I obviously struggeled because I was only with them on some weekends. We never made trips again just for the two of us, someone from the new family always had to come along. When we tried to watch a movie he was sleeping or doing something else. I grew emotionally distant over time but he was still my dad to me.

I was a kid so I could not understand the whole situation yet and  kind of projected my anger and hate on my half-sister. Until she was 13 or 14 we had little to no connection and I just kinda tolerated her. I have always been nice to her, I never bullied her or something, we just did not know how to handle each other. I also dont really like kids in general.

When I finished school, he got me a decent job at the company he worked, so we became coworkers for the next 4 years. My mom and I were now much closer and I knew, who paid and cared for me since he left while he was busy with his new happy family. This is when I started thinking about him as a ""bad dad"" but still I was okay with the overall situation while seeing him as some kind of ""big man child with teenager hormones"" because he acted just like that. (Cheating again several times on his new wife, anger issues, starting a side carrer as a musician/entertainer and thinking way too much of himself)

When L was about 9 or 10 he cheated on his new wife again and she found out. They got a divorce, got back together, then she cheated on him and they parted again, leaving emotional scars on L that she's still trying to overcome.

My sisters and I eventually bonded over the years and especially my half-sister L became aware of what my dad did to me over all that time and some of it also to her as she got older. He never treated her as bad as me, though but she got her own slice of the cake.
We talked alot about his toxic behavior and she forgave me long ago for not knowing how to handle her when she was a kid and  therefore not developing a relationship until now.

Two years ago he married another affair of him but got a vasectomy so no more half-siblings.

Little side note: my mum never talked bad about him when I was around until I started asking questions about him myself. She wanted me to make my own decisions and was under the impression that having a connection with my biological father would be best. She knew about my struggle but hoped for the best and that all will eventually turn out good for me when I grow older and see things with a more adult view. 

Notice, this is all very shortened. I am talking about years of this, along to misogynistic, homophobic, sexist or just plain dumb comments that I will not repeat at this point because they were not even ""dark humour funny"". He'd never shown interest - instead occasionally made fun of any of my hobbies, life decisions, friends, my moms side of my family, my apperance. He even made a cruel joke about making a stuffed animal of my dead hamster when I discovered his dead body on my birthday when I was 12 just to name an example. By now I feel like we live in differents worlds and if we met as strangers, he wouldnt even like me as a person and vice versa. 

When I turned 22 I moved a few hundred kilometers across the country to live with my then-boyfriend (David).
We kept in contact through texts or occasional visits from me in my hometown. 
He never visited or even thought about doing so. 
Whenever he texted me he started by making me feel guilty like ""message me"". ""Why dont you like your father?"". ""Sorry about worrying"". ""Kids in your age just think their dad is not cool"" (Again, I was already 23)
I kept contact short because It felt forced and his messages had such an agressive undertone, that I felt uncomfortable even reading it. If I messaged him first, he either replied very shortly or not at all.

After one year of me living relatively far away from him I started to realize that I dislike him for the first time in my life, as his behavior towars me became more and more disrespectful and entiteled. 
He didn't care that I couldn't respond to texts or calls, when I was working, telling me as a father, he doesnt need an ""appointment"" to talk to his daughter. That I ""Have to"" have him included, because he was family and he deserves that. That blood is always thicker than water and I can't get rid of my own father.
Still, I was seeing him as my dad and was still willing to find a way, we can still at least in contact. 

Last year everything exploded when he texted me and L in our group chat.
He texted us at 6am on a sunday
""Hey, Its me, annoying dad, caring about you. Are you okay??""
And when we didn't respond (because we were obviously sleeping) he sent a passive-agressive voice message along the lines of ""SORRY I am disturbing you with my care for my daughters""
I woke up, read the text and was too sleepy to snap at him right away so I asked him calmly to just ask uns in a non-sarcastic-way how we are doing (maybe during business hours ) and then this could have been a nice conversation. I even added a heart if that matters.
He immediately took this as a personal attack and went on a rant about how disrespectful we are and he just wanted to make sure, his daughters are safe and how sad we will be, when he is gone someday. He kept on telling us about how he forgave his father for what he did when he was still a teenager and how we should do the same.
(Note: his father was NOT a good person. homophobic towards his own son, my uncle, and most importantly a fecking nazi)

I eventually blocked his number out of rage and cut off contact without an explaination, my sister didn't. 

About three months later he wrote me a letter, basically stating the same stuff he always said about forgiving and family. I ignored it, so he tried to reach out to my mum, who happily blocked him too after asking me, what I want her to do with him.

A few weeks later he texted David about how he feels, that he doesnt sleep since I blocked him, that he just cares about his daughter and he refuses to just let me be. 
David told me and asked me, what I wanted to do.
Since I blocked his number, I wrote a pretty long text, still respectful and calm,  basically stating every reason I have to cut contact with him and told David to please send him that. He did and because he's a gentle soul, he put his own words after that, asking him to leave me alone because if he really wants me to feel better, thats all he can do for now.

My father blew off at David, telling him this is not how one should talk to adults (yes) and threatening him, that he hopes for him that he'd never stumble upon him in a dark area and then some insults about his appearance.
David blocked him after that and screenshotted everything just to make sure.

Since then he contacted my mum, grandma, begs my sister to give him my new adress and I had to block his wife and her kids from following me on social media because they tried to message me. He still knows where I work and by now I am honestly scared, that he'll just show up out of nowhere and make a big scene and gaslighting me into having contact again.

I grew as a person over the last year and realised, how toxic he is to me. I got angry when I read his name, wanted to have a father-daughter relationship despite all that happend and he still managed to push me to the point, where I just can't take it anymore.
My mental health suffered alot and in hindsight he is one (of a few)explanations for my teenage and early adult depression, eating disorders and my low self esteem.

I never had problems with cutting off people, that are no good for me or toxic but this is another level. Actually this post took me a good 3 weeks to write because I got angry and frustrated and needed to take breaks between paragraphs.

I dont really know what to do at that point. I haven't heard from him in awhile but the next letter will come around to someone sooner or later. It messes with my head that he could show up anytime. I dont want him in my life anymore after what he did, I know that now.

Any advice is welcome.

TL;DR: my father is a toxic human beeing and doesn't accept that I cut of contact even after I stated numerous reasons why and even told him, he is making everything worse by trying to contact me.

I know it‚Äôs J because I am on good terms with everyone except him. I am also on good terms with A, the one that they‚Äôre hanging out at. So I totally believe it‚Äôs J who told them not to invite me. I really hate it. I hate how he just wants me to be the outsider and cast me out of my own friend group, even though I am closer to them more than they‚Äôre close to him (J). How can he have such influence?! No one is speaking up for me to invite (maybe it happened and I don‚Äôt know about it). I mean if they invited me after I knew I wouldn‚Äôt go because I‚Äôm gonna be in a place where I am unwanted.

499,"Evening reddit, i come in the time of need. So i have been working for this consultancy firm in Dubai starting February 2020. I was originally taken in as a junior assistant with a promise of proper on the job training and a salary of 1400$. Since i am a student i was given just a job invitation letter that me and the CEO of the company have signed, no other contracts was signed. So when i have started i did not receive any training instead i was a bit pressured by the office admin and the company lawyer as i graduated from the British University which made them assume that they had the same program as a Russian one so i was yelled at for not being able to draft a contract from scratch or fill one up correctly. Then i was again told off due to my inability to work with the local Dubai laws as majority of them is in Arabic and I dont know any Arabic.

So for the first 2 months it was going good, then the pandemic hit. We moved to work from home and the ceo called me in saying that during the times of pandemic he is going to reduce my salary to 400$ to cut costs. I was given an option to either quit or stay, my family pressured me to stay. So i did, so for the next 3 months i worked from home and received my 400$. At first i believed i was making progress so i thought i could ask for the raise, suddenly in July company has hired 3 new people who are now working from the office with the admin. When i asked what about me, i was told that i could keep working from home but now i was an intern not a junior assistant as they were not satisfied with my performance.

Again i had admitted to my own wrong and kept working, now the scope of my work at the start was working with the documents and clients. Sure i made few mistakes with documents and clients, who wouldnt in their first year of proper work? Admin took a note of that and begun taking away document works from me, since the start of September i was mainly doing courier like tasks delivering documents and driving admins new assistant around and after my car broke down cause i had burned through the battery from driving over 1500 kilometers in a month. Me and ceo decided to have a talk.  


So Today we had the talk, apparently everyone is unsatisfied with my work; my document work is lackluster and doesnt match their standard of a lawyer which was again odd as they hired me with promise of training that i never got. Secondly i was told that i was too informal and unprofessional with clients as i offered them personal aid and my personal phone number (i dont have a company one and doubt ever getting one). And thirdly i was pinned down with an ultimatum; either i stay in the company as a driver, or i do a course that would train me to be a personal assistant to the ceo.  


On one hand it sounded like a healthier option and i was promised an immediate post course raise to 544$ but then i had a talk with my mother and the company lawyer. And oh boy it was not pretty, my mom released the most toxic blast on me essentially yelling that i now must go back to work from office to get back on the ceo's good side. The company lawyer called me a fool and that i will be effectively ending my legal carrier by doing those courses, but when i asked him for alternative he told me to find an internship in another law firm. Which again i swear to you was promised to me in here, i was told that their company lawyer would teach to which he responded that ""he has no need for me as my degree is from UK and he mainly works in the Russian legal system."" And apparently today our company was visited by the tv station and no one told me so i missed that out after i was talked down.  


So reddit please advise me, i dont know what to do and my mind is clouded with only thoughts of quitting this company immediately and looking for another job. But problem is the UAE job market aint that good at the moment so i could be stuck looking for a new job for a while, at the same time my mother is pressuring me to go back to the office which i really dont want to do as now i despise the men and his team for not appreciating  or even remembering any good things that i did.   


So what do i do? Do i quit and gamble on lookin for another job? Or do i try and make the best of what i got? Please someone help me ;-;",01Oct2020,1

505,"This might be a little confusing, i'm not a good at telling stories.

So here's the thing..

I'm the eldest daughter in an asian family. My dad runs multiple companies and he's really good at what he does. I, on the other hand, am far from business-minded. I just don't have the drive I guess or idk.

I was given the option to pursue medicine or work for my dad. 

A little insight, I am licensed professional in the medical field and have always wanted to take up medicine right after college. The plan was to practice my profession for a few years then eventually go back to school. But since covid hit, my line of work really hit a rough patch; I work with kids and since their safety is of utmost priority, the clinics I work for have opted for teletherapy but even with that option, not that many parents were willing to consider given that it was time consuming and required more work on their part.

My dad saw the struggle and offered me a PART-TIME job to train under his wing. How to run the business, auditing, finances, the works..

He knew from the start why I was never keen on handling the business. In my family, the 'sons' were always top priority when it came to handling money and business so I never worried about it cause I had a younger brother, but he and my dad never got along so hence my dilemma.

My dad's work ethic is amazing. He's constantly thinking of ways to improve and expand for the entire family (he's the eldest too). I have that drive in me just not towards business. 

My dad wants to retire early which is why he wanted to train me as soon as possible. He's not getting any younger and tbh I feel really guilty for not even thinking about what he's going through (he's a smoker and has a few health issues.) I don't want him to keep working so hard only to find out that all his life's work will end up being sold to another person or under the wrong hands (i.e. my ungrateful relatives who know nothing about his sacrifices but all the glory) So I stopped fighting it and tried to embrace the experience.

After a few months of working for my dad, I actually had fun and grew an interest with what I did. However, it also became evident that I am a follower and not a leader in terms of managing manpower of significant size. I'm a softie to say the least. 

I'm torn.

I don't want to disappoint my dad by not being good enough. I keep worrying about future problems, the people I'd have to take care of, the success of the company, if I'll ever feel contentment if I stay in this industry.

My dad doesn't know that this has been keeping me up at night. Actually, no one does. Not even my bf whom I sleep beside every night. I've tried bringing it up before but all I got was ""whatever makes you happy, do it"". 

I know what I want but maybe it's just not for me. My brother also wants to become a doctor so maybe just one of my dad's kids will be a doctor. It just sucks that it won't be me. 

Idk what to do. I don't want to regret not trying to go after my dreams but I don't want to break my dad's heart.

Any advice??",01Oct2020,1
506,"hi everyone. don't wanna expose the details since they are pretty pathetic...

i'm studying computer science (currently the last year) and i spent a lot of many on useless shit. i heard about fiver ecc.. to make money with little jobs as a programmer but a lot of people told me the competition is pretty hard with a lot of underpaid guys who solve pretty anything for little bucks. Do you have some advice for me to get some money (not much, 300 euros in a month would be GREAT) by doing something inherent to my faculty online?

507,"Hello folks.

I'm currently enrolled in a liberal arts college as an arts major, and I didn't understand what I was getting myself into when I enrolled in art school and I'm starting to think I was wrong. 

First off, my classes have a ridiculous amount of work. I can't go into specifics but the workload is so intense that it leaves me a very small amount of free time and I often lose sleep. I am in class almost all day long some days. On top of that I feel as though most of the content we are learning is things I already knew how to do/had done before. I am actually bored in class. I have to keep my GPA up to keep my scholarship but some of the critiques in class are very arbitrary and just dependant upon whether the teacher personally likes it or not. I find myself not enjoying many of the projects and work I have and feeling unfulfilled.

Second, the area my school is in is not super safe at the moment and the school is not likely to be open for the rest of the year at least. I want to physically be in college and get what I'm paying for (safely). My friend's aunt is in a ridiculous amount of debt for this school and thinks I should transfer.

Finally, I find myself thinking that I would probably get along better with students in a non liberal arts school. A lot of the people here are nice and I have made some friends but there are people I just don't mesh with and are very dramatic.

I reached out to 2 non-arts schools I was interested in transferring to, and they both told me that they don't give scholarship to transfer students (mid-year or yearly) and the schools I am interested in seem to rarely have an arts program so I am starting to think about changing my major to art history. 

At this point I'm even considering trade school or an apprenticeship, maybe even just dropping out entirely and freelancing because I've done some very profitable freelance work before, but my parents don't think this is a good idea and I really value their advice. I guess I'm mostly thinking of smaller art or art history programs within a non-arts school.

I did art classes all through my school career, took AP art in high school, was convinced for years that art school was the right choice for me, reached out to and had many art schools seek me out, and got accepted into 6 out of 7 college applications.

I had a great GPA in high school, and pretty good SAT scores as well, am also skilled in English, Science and History, but I mostly only enjoy Art and History. 

Is this a phase that I should wait out and see if my feelings change? Is it financially better to just continue as things are?

If it's not a phase, what are my options, and are there any schools I should look into attending?",01Oct2020,1
508,"I am writing to get some advice. Mostly, reassurance, because I am surrounded by a psychopathic, manipulative family that is trying to guilt-trip me and it's stressing me out. 

My dad uses the N-Word very frequently. He did stuff growing up like yelling ""Get that N-word off my tv"" when I watched the Proud Family or Fresh Prince of Bellaire. I NEVER felt the same way. Regardless of the fact that my parents were racist, I loved everyone no matter what and it never even crossed my mind. I went to a very diverse school and loved the differences. On top of this, my father beat me and verbally abused me my whole life. I'm not talking spanking or occasionally yelling. I'm talking continuous anger and hatred with attacking me. 

This has always been an issue, because I would argue with him everytime he said it. I got married a few years back and of course, my husband is equally outspoken and we don't tolerate it... ESPECIALLY around our new child. My biggest downfall is that I am very family-oriented, I wanted to have a relationship with my parents and brother. My mom has done a lot for me my whole life and I'm not discrediting this. She watched my son 15 months of his life up until this event, so we wouldn't have to put him in daycare.

 A few weeks ago, we were hanging out with my dad... Honestly, having one of the best times we have had. My husband and dad were having beers and I was sober since I was driving home. Typically, we call it a successful visit when he doesn't verbally abuse one of us or say racist things forcing us to leave.

He gets upset talking about politics and says, ""It's all these N-words running around screwing sh*&amp; up."" My Husband (let's call him Jim), Jim speaks up and says (honestly, kind of reserved way), ""Look, why do you have to use that word?"" and dad says, ""Why, they are N-Words, so I'm telling it how it is."" 
Jim gets upset and they beginning yelling at each other. 
*I'm paraphrasing since it's hard to remember the exact dialogue*
Jim: ""It's a very negative and hateful, racist term and we want you to stop saying it around us and our son."" 
Dad: ""What, it's not racist, they are n-words... There's a difference between back and n-words. I have a black friend, I would never call him that.""
Jim: ""It is historically negative and hateful, we don't want to hear it, do whatever the heck you want in your freetime, but we don't want it around us.""
*This argument continues until these phrases forced Jim to just get up and leave, because he's a lost cause -
Dad: ""They are all N-Words"" ""I am a racist and they are the downfall of this country""
Jim got up and said ""okay, we are leaving."" and went inside to get his stuff.
To which point, I stayed and said, ""What is wrong with you, why can't you just stop and be normal and not so hateful."" Etc...

Jim comes back and gets me to come over. I stand up and walk up to the patio to leave, they're yelling at each other from afar. Dad walks up to Jim and puts his hand on his throat (to the point where it left a mark) and yelled that he is a disgrace to his race!

Jim pushed him off and said ""okay, do you want to go?""
Dad ran up and (he's about 250 lbs and Jim is probably 160 lbs)
swung at him about 6 times, Jim backed up each time and finally Dad lunged forward and Jim hit him one time in the face with his key. Dad is covered in blood in the face and runs inside. I chase after him (it's my dad... I want to help him clean-up) and he is walking back with a gun and says ""I'm going to F*&amp;^ing kill him"" and cocks it. I run out the front door and scream, ""JIM, RUN!!!!""

I hear one gun shot.

I run to the backyard and dad shot again right at Jim. He runs behind the tree and Dad is screaming, ""I'M GOING TO F*%KING KILL YOU."" ""YOU'RE GOING TO DIE!"" ETC. ETC.

Jim is hiding behind a palm tree and I'm screaming to ""PLEASE STOP, NO, DAD..."" I see a paint can... Jim is screaming, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.. You're right, I'm wrong, Please just let us leave....""

I grab the paint can and walk over to hit him in the head. Every time Jim stuck his head out, Dad would lift the gun...

I finally got up to him about to hit him (I was terrified he would turn the gun on me...) and he finally put it down... said, ""I like your attitude now."" and went inside. 

I called the cops. My 18 M.O. son is inside in the crib. I run in and grab him, I'm on the phone with the cops and we finally get to leave. 

The cops come and my dad literally just went in and passed out. They arrested him and charged him with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a few others. We are pressing charges as well.

My mom and brother both claim, ""They weren't there, so they can't pick sides."" My father has a history of alcoholism, abuse (verbal and physical as well as racism and we have none of that). I don't have a record and neither does my husband, we are what people would generally call real Christian, good people without even a traffic tickets on our record... 

My mom watched my son, so we had to find a school in a weeks time while having pretty much PTSD. She actually came over to our house two days after and said, ""They were just warning shots"" ""You tried to blind him..."" Etc.

I told her, ""okay, you've made your decision and you will never see my son again."" She is literally defending and sticking with the man that almost left my son without a father... 

Now, my brother calls me and has the audacity to tell me that my mom is falling apart without seeing my son and that she's crying every time she finds his stuff, etc. And I am just sick of it. They're trying to guilt trip me when I am the victim. Again, my brother, ""He said they were just warning shots."" ""Where are the bullets?"" Etc. 

These people are insane and literally overlook everything my father does and I'm just tired of it. I have been the butt of every joke, they actually try to talk down on me, my dad beat and abused me my whole life while my mom just stayed with him...

My mom has actually done a lot for me and my son, but at this point, I just don't see how I can keep any of these people in my life. They are so toxic and making me feel horrible. I had a very close almost best friend relationship with my mom and she watched my son for 15 months... Full-time, but this feel unforgivable. 

Should I let her see my son since she wasn't directly involved? Even for an hour every once in a while on my terms? Are we right in removing ourselves? What are your opinions about all of this? Why are we (the victims) being attacked? 

I know the key busted my father's face completely open, but Jim couldn't have pulled that man off of him if he pinned him down and sure as heck couldn't have.

515,"I (f27) have been a smoker for a few years. I smoked a lot at my last job because it was stressful, and nearly all of my coworkers did. I'm very impressionable. I also smoked pretty heavily when with my boyfriend who is also a smoker. After breaking up with him, I did well for a while, and felt like I didn't even miss cigarettes.

Both of my parents lost their mothers to smoking related illnesses, so I never got to meet my grandmothers. My parents are aware of my habit and I know it breaks their hearts, but they've never been disparaging or asked me to quit.

I went nearly 2 months without, and I'm sure they noticed and were relieved that I quit. But recently I started up again. I bought a pack last month because I was making a long drive (something about driving makes me want to smoke. Idk if it's just because that's my biggest habit trigger, or if it's because I'm subconsciously stressed because of the tragic car accident I was part of several years ago.)

Since buying that pack I've relapsed into regular smoking. I know it makes me feel sick, causes uncomfortable congestion, and interferes with the effectiveness of my medications. (it's especially bad for my thyroid disorder.) But knowing I shouldn't, and that it makes me feel poorly doesn't prevent me from going outside to light up.

Can anyone offer advice to help me resist these urges? I want to be a non-smoker again. I was so proud of myself for those few months, but feel like I destroyed all that progress.",01Oct2020,1

we had a lot of arguments and tension last week (since saturday, the week before) and it sucked so much. we were torturing eachother in that week and there was no way to fix it...

then we broke up, it was a mutual agreement (meaning, we both decided it was the right thing to do) and it was one of the hardest decisions i had to make in that week. i didn't want to lose her at all since she was my first girlfriend, first kiss and all that, and it all felt so real and true to me. anyway, so we broke up (as previously mentioned)

we're trying to remain friends however. she sent me a snap on snapchat this morning (a streaks snap) and it mentioned this guy who i dont know. so i asked her about it and apparently she moved on already...

now that HURTS so much. our 8 months was only worth 1 week to get over with. it feels to me like I'll never get over her, but it was so darn easy for her to get over me...

I don‚Äôt usually do this and I don‚Äôt think many people will see this but I need some advice from strangers. 

I‚Äôm a Canadian who moved to Australia to go to uni for commerce but ended up getting switched to economics. I thought this was what I wanted to do (Cause shmoney) but it‚Äôs turns out studying for this shit is just giving me a headache. 

I realize now that I can‚Äôt really continue doing this and have a passion for it unless something about it changes. Maybe it‚Äôs the way I‚Äôm learning (with everything being online now) or the subject itself but it fuckin sucks and it‚Äôs boring.

I‚Äôm thinking of just dropping everything and just saying fuck it either staying in aus or moving back to Canada to become a proper fashion designer under my own label either straight up making handmade pieces or just up-cycling shit. I bet all of you have heard this pipe dream millions of times before. 

To be honest I have no idea how I would even get started, or even what I‚Äôm asking in this post. I guess I just need some direction. A lot of negatives have been in my life since I moved here just before covid and I just need to do something about my life. 

Also I‚Äôm getting a little depressed as moving to a new country isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be. It was tough adjusting and making friends even being a social butterfly. It‚Äôs hard to keep motivation and a will to live in the current state of the world and mind.

We took her speedily to a dog e.r. since it was so late and they told us likely it was some sort of poisoning, we assumed like mold or old processed cheese however this morning not more than 20 minutes ago i woke up to a call from my mom who ran to the vet saying Bridgette, another of our dogs a small mini pinscher, is now exhibiting the same shaking Liesle did about a month ago. 

I then went to look around the house to see what she could have gotten into. Then i noticed that she vomited multiple times in my room, like Liesle, and i. Couldn't find anything suspicious at all.

1) I used screen time to see which app I use the most, Safari and youtube were the most-used apps. So, I set screentime on them for 1 hour each day. 

It didn't work, I would keep on pressing ""15 minutes more"" again and again.

555,"Hello! 

I'm hoping for some outside perspectives on a problem I'm currently trying to navigate regarding my living situation and family life! 

**Here some background:**

 I moved into boarding school in my hometown during grade 12 as my mother and sister were moving 4000 km away. They lived there for two years while I continued to live on my own in uni residence and then, currently, in a sublet. I ended up moving in with my grandmother for 6 months when the pandemic first hit out of necessity but that is the only time I've lived with any family member in the last two years. Furthermore, my mother and I have an interesting relationship to say the least. As I referenced once in another post my father was an emotionally, mentally and on a handful of occasions physically abusive man, *basically he sucked*. We left him 8 months before I moved into boarding school and as such don't have much experience living with my mother now that she's in a better situation. However, back when I did live with her and my parents were still together we fought almost constantly. If my father wasn't going at me, my mother often was. This isn't to say there weren't good parts, but there was a considerable amount of snapping and yelling. While anything could set my father off, most of what set my mother off was simply that since I was about 14 we've been very different people with very different priorities. I've always prioritized work and school over things that are less important to me like an organized room. I never let it get to the point of being gross but it is often messy or disorganized because I have more important things to focus on such as my gpa. However, when I was a kid I would get yelled at probably weekly if not multiple times a week for having a messy room among other things. To clarify, I'm not excusing my behaviour, it was her house, her rules and I should have respected that as a teenager far more than I did. What I am getting at is that our relationship was strained at best, since then it has greatly improved to the point where we text a couple times a week and even talk on the phone about two to three times a month, which is a big improvement! Since moving out I've only been yelled at a handful of times (all by her) over the last two years, its been fantastic. Not only have I learned that I respond far better to positive motivation than berating (as most people do) but I've been able to get myself in therapy and make progress healing some of the deeply false convictions my father instilled in me and managing high levels of anxiety. However, even on my own there have been instances where my mother has still gone after me; one such example of this is this spring when I was concerned about an external issue and tried to go to her and she called me ""emotionally needy and exhausting"". While if that's true I completely accept it, I've learned those are not things you should ever tell someone and it cut me deeply. She's still incredibly nice, kind and supportive compared to my father and most people in this world. She can be nice and kind and a fantastic conversationalist as I've discovered living away from her, and about 80% of the time she's a nice person to be around and things can be great! But she can become incredibly (for me often unbearably) mean without warning the other 20% and is incredibly emotional, whereas I'm more even-keel and as such struggle with her frequent ups and downs.  

**So here comes the problem:**

My city is quickly turning into a hotspot as the second wave hits and my mother is increasingly suggestive that I should quit my job (Its a very nice job that I love and I recently received a promotion, taking on a supervisory position and I don't plan on quitting), or if my work closes down again that I should go move in with her so that she can ""take care of me"". A phrase I find insulting as it insinuates I can't take care of myself as I've been doing for the last two years (I've been doing very well, I've put a great deal of money into savings, I have a fantastic job, good friends, good gpa and hold an officer position within my sorority). As such the idea of someone ""taking care of me"" is both insulting and causes me to panic a bit as I'm afraid of being restricted or controlled with arbitrary rules as my father so loved to impose. While this is probably an irrational fear its been so long that I don't know anymore! My sister and my mother are incredibly close, always have been, and I've always felt like the third wheel, so living with them won't help that in the slightest either. On the one hand, I do miss my family as I haven't seen them since New Years because of lockdown, and perhaps it could be nice to see them again and it would be a huge help financially. On the other hand, not only would my anxiety get considerably worse but I have no idea if our relationship would survive. I'm afraid of moving in with her and not being able to move out again, of her yelling and going after me daily because we have such clashing ideals and priorities, and generally creating a toxic and conflict-filled environment for my sister if I move in with her. 

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

558,"I live in an apartment building that has lofts on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors and a restaurant and a sports bar on the first floor. First of all, I just want to say that when I moved in here two years ago I expect there to be noise. I expect there to be music from the bar. I knew there was going to be. And there was. You could hear the music. It was loud enough that you could mostly hear the lyrics and know what song is playing but for the most part it was very much in the background. So if your comment is going to be ‚Äúwell you chose to live above the bar what do you expect‚Äù, you can just move right along. 

The bar in question is a sports bar, not a club. I‚Äôve actually gone to this bar multiple times and the music has always served as ambient noise do whatever sporting event they had on the TV. The issue is over the last 2 to 3 months, something has changed. They‚Äôve started cranking up the music so loud it causes my windows to vibrate, my floor to vibrate, my bed to vibrate, and you can‚Äôt even hear my TV over it.   It‚Äôs so loud that I have to shout at my boyfriend when we‚Äôre trying to have conversations. If this was just on the weekends it would be annoying but still somewhat tolerable however it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs during the week too and even after the bar has closed.We never know when they‚Äôre going to crank the music up - either there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason to it.

I‚Äôve tried earplugs and a white noise machine and you can still here the music. I was told to call the cops by my property manager which I have, they turn the music down for a little bit after the cops arrive but then turn it right back up - sometimes even louder than it was. My property manager has addressed it with the building owner and he spoken with the bar owner with no change. This week my property manager, the building owner, and at the bar owner had a meeting to discuss this and a few other issues. The bar owner told the property manager and the building owner that he wasn‚Äôt going to bend to the whims of the residents. They would have to deal with it or move out.

I can‚Äôt move out. My lease renewed right before all this happened. My property manager is willing to let me break my lease and move to a different property however the only apartments that are available at this time are way out of my price range.I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for me to take on a financial hardship because the bar is no longer willing to be a good neighbor. My property manager has threatened to take away the free parking for the bar employees as well as some other amenities that have been afforded to those employees, but that didn‚Äôt seem to do anything. I guess the building owner doesn‚Äôt like conflict and is kind of spineless. 

So what can I do? She told me to keep calling the police. I just emailed the neighborhood inspection department in my city registering a noise complaint but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôll even work or how long it‚Äôll take. The one time I went down to the bar and just ask them if they could return the music to their normal level, the bartender told me to fuck off. 

I have an anxiety disorder and this is affecting not only that but my ability to do my job. I no longer know what to do.",01Oct2020,1
559,"So guys, here I am, making same mistakes over and over again. 

My wife saved me when I was down in a huge shithole and has never let me go since then. My parents were not fond of me, they did not supply my college expenses or anything, they did not want to feed me at any cost and without succeeding at any job found myself semi-homeless. Then, she came to me like an angel. She first got my psychology together and she even paid my college expenses. I did not want to disappoint her so I did pretty well in school. I have never felt love for her. Not the kind of love that you would feel for your beloved. No lust, no sexual drive but a tremendous amount of appreciation and compassion. When we have started our relationship I thought that I would not need lust and sexual drive, I could live with her forever and suppress these feelings. I didn't tell her that I had no feelings for her and I thought I could make it without the feelings. I was homeless for God's sake. But now, there is this girl I met at the College and she is  IRRESISTIBLE. She is intellectual, funny, lovely, kind (you may know what love is) and I have never felt like this before. I feel this ecstatic feeling when I think about her smile and all. Now I am at the crossroads. I have a small group of friends, for not to be suspected on the surface I show people like I am trying to make jokes for her and my other friend at the group being together. But secretly I am praying to God that something like that would never happen. In a short while, we have participated reunion of the college and we hadn't seen each other for 3-4 months, we talked for 10+ hours straight and everyone looked at us like they admired us. She tried to touch me in a different way then she used to do (She knew my wife as well.) And I have come to the conclusion that she feels the same irresistible feeling for me. She is a moral person, but I think she too now can't help her feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my wife has issues with her parents and she suffers from depression. She says that if I would leave her she would commit suicide and all. I can't do this to my lifesaver. She is in the worst condition of her that I have ever seen.  I did not do anything wrong YET. I can't help my feelings. Feelings of ecstasy won't stop. What should I do? How to get out of this situation? Is it even moral to have these feelings and not telling them to my wife and go forward, is it same as cheating? Is it already over? I need opinions. Feel free to comment on this post freely because I am the black sheep here. Thanks.",01Oct2020,1
560,"  

Ok, so this is going to be kind of long and I apologize in advance for that, but I really would like some advice for this situation.

So my best friend moved at the beginning of this year because her mother wanted to be closer to her aging mother (my friend‚Äôs grandma) and we would text pretty frequently during the first few initial months and the texting kind of fell off once Covid started shutting everything down. I‚Äôm in college so I got bogged down with a lot of schoolwork during this time, but I still tried to text her here and there to check in. It‚Äôs around this time that I noticed that she wasn‚Äôt initiating any conversations with me, so I asked if she was doing ok, she avoids the question and changes the subject. I figured she was mad at me, so I gave her some space and eventually she just refused to have conversations with me. I would send her a text with a question, and she‚Äôd give responses that wouldn‚Äôt move the convo forward at all. I‚Äôve video chatted with her once but she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing it since she doesn‚Äôt like looking at herself in the camera and I told her she can leave the camera off (I also don‚Äôt like looking at myself in the camera either but she wanted to see me so I left it on) and she didn‚Äôt want to do it again after that.

To give some backstory into my friend she suffers from depression and she‚Äôs been open about this with me because I shared with her my history with it, but she‚Äôs made it very clear she doesn‚Äôt want to seek help for it (she believes therapy works for others but it couldn‚Äôt work for her). On top of that when she and her mom moved I knew they were both out of work for a period of time (I don‚Äôt know now and I haven‚Äôt asked, it doesn‚Äôt seem appropriate) and she was obviously pretty upset about that and vented to me about it.

I also feel really guilty because I made plans to visit her over the summer but I ran into some financial issues and I didn‚Äôt feel safe traveling because of the virus, and now if I send her a text or a meme she‚Äôll leave it on seen for several days and maybe like the message. This situation is making me think of something she said to me a few years ago just when we were getting close; we we‚Äôre listening to some goofy song and I jokingly said I would play this at my wedding and she responded with ‚ÄúYeah, if we‚Äôre still friends then‚Äù. This upset me and asked her why she would say that and she responded with ‚ÄúNo one wants to be my friend that long, they always leave‚Äù. Ever since she said that I‚Äôve felt really anxious about bringing up certain topics and I feel like I might have triggered something with her. I‚Äôm worried about her, but she never fully opens up to me no matter what I say and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Any advice?

565,"I‚Äôm just screaming into the void because life sucks ass right now.

About a year ago, my mom got some phone call from a scam artist asking for money and she fell for it. She never made clear what the threat was but the amount owing was $300,000. She scrambled to find the money for it, and called every single one of our extended family to get a bit of money from each to pay it. My dad found out and was furious at how she never even consulted him. Her defence was that the scam artist told her not to tell anyone (they said that they were part of the government tax collection agency).

Flashback now and literally our finances are shit and my mom asks me for money every single week to pay off the family debt. Her mental health has tanked in the last year and she is suicidal. My dad works two jobs to try and hustle and pay off debt . I am a university student going to school full time and also working 20 hours a week to make ends meet. COVID isn‚Äôt making things better. 

If my moms mental health isn‚Äôt good, my dad must also be tanking a lot privately and I feel the burden of both my parents every single day. It‚Äôs stressful to be at home in my room doing online class and knowing this every single day. 

Since that financial disaster, my parents took out all savings they had for my education to save their own butts. Even given that, my dad predicts he will spend the remainder of his working life paying off this mistake. I have had to pay for school out of pocket/with loans. I have worked very hard to save money so that I can go on exchange and travel, but just as of last week I realized that I need to pull out all my savings to get an angry relative off our family‚Äôs back. I have considered dropping out of school, but I love my major and I just got accepted into an Honours Program with a scholarship. I feel defeated and frustrated.

I know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel but gosh, life feels so bleak. Every pay check is almost all given to my parents. I feel like my future is so uncertain and that I‚Äôm always going to be hauling the weight of my mom‚Äôs mistake, but I can‚Äôt tell her that or else it would break her. 

I feel like my parents are pulling away from each other and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. My mom doesn‚Äôt even sleep in the same room as my dad anymore. She has slept in the living room since quarantine started. Ôºàabout 9 months ago) I can‚Äôt invite my friends over to my house or do anything knowing that outside of my room is my moms bed setup in the living room because she can‚Äôt deal with her own guilt. I feel like they probably would have divorced already but realized that it won‚Äôt solve anyone‚Äôs problems.

I feel angry that my educational savings they had for me are now gone. I‚Äôm mad that they put my future at stake because of their mistake. I‚Äôm mad that my mom never told anyone about this fraud and when the hole got deeper, she decided to keep quiet. I‚Äôm mad that I feel that my life feels like I‚Äôm always digging people out of holes. I can‚Äôt even live my own life (buy an car, date, hang out with friends, exercise) because I spend so much time sitting at home doing work in my room to make extra money and then directly etranfering my cash away to someone else. (Likely my father feels the same way, so I feel inclined to share his burden) I am frustrated that I need to carry this burden and shelter my two younger siblings of this, who are too young to work and become victims of this.

Most of all I feel selfish for wanting to back away and run away from my parents as soon as I graduate with my undergrad. I feel like I‚Äôve never had the chance to truly live my life since it‚Äôs really been just work/school since I turned 18.

571,"I (F25) and my fianc√© (24M) have two cats. We got the our first cat in January 2020, we will call him Mr. Boy as that's one of his many nicknames. I was hesitant to get any pets but my fianc√© was struggling with some extreme anxiety and depression. I also was and had just had an anxiety attack so bad in December that I had to go to the emergency room (thought I was having a heartattack). 

We both ended up deciding that it would be a good idea to get a cat and it has been! I believe a good amount of both of our continuing recovery from our mental health issues have been due to both Mr. Boy and his little sister we got a couple months ago. His little sister was adopted so Mr. Boy could have a buddy and for me because Mr. Boy really took to my fianc√©. One could claim it was just coincidental timing but I do believe the cats have helped a lot. We do both still see our therapists.

The point is we are moving soon. I have no issue paying small pet rent or pet fees. The current place we rent is $25 per month per pet. No pet fee or ""deposit"". We are moving to get into a bigger place to live with some family members for a few reasons that dont relate to my post. While this will reduce our rent costs, it's not going to be a huge difference with the places that are available that fit our needs. We are in Nashville.

The standard of the places renting in my area have what I feel are outrageous pet policies when it comes to costs. Minimum I see is $300 non-refundable deposit/ fee per pet. 

I am totally onboard with ""if you cant take care of an animal, dont get one"" including financially. Mr. Boy and his sister are happy and healthy. These fees were not part of the equation until now. 

I find these type of fees ridiculous not only because of the cost alone but also because the reasoning is often ""well we've had pets in the past that destroyed stuff"". But at the same time, if either of my pets were to destroy anything, I'm pretty sure they would still take money from my deposit or charge me out right. I do also recognize that some people dont take responsibility for their pets. And that some do destroy places. But why is it now on me to pay non-refundable fees in the event that my pets MIGHT destroy something?

I happily will take responsibility for my animals and paying to repair anything they destroyed, clawed up, pissed on, and so forth. I'll note that we've had 0 issues with so far with both kitties. We did not declaw them per their adoption requirements. We have cat scratchers out in multiple rooms that they happily use. They also occasionally use our couch but that is a rare occasion. They dont piss/ crap outside their litter boxes. And we clean the litter x2 a day.

Our family members suggested making the cats emotional support animals as they dont get charged these fees (I verified this with each of the rental companies as well - this is for ESAs and Serive Animals). I honestly feel like both our therapists would have no issue with fulfilling this request for each of us &amp; each cat.

Claiming we dont have cats is not an option for me. And we aren't getting rid of our kitties either.

Should I just eat the fees? Is it fair of me to say the cats are ESAs based on our situation?",01Oct2020,1

579,"Okay so hear me out please. I joined Reddit this June because of my friends, so my friends knew which was my main account. I came across subreddits where I wanted to have discussions and post stuff that my Redditor friends would likely call 'normie' haha. Also because I am a very closed off person so I wanted to ask advice on some personal stuff anonymously. So I created my throwaway account. That one kinda took off lol so I started using it more frequently. Then, ahem, I discovered nsfw subreddits and found myself wanting to post and interact over there. Hence, a third throwaway was created which I kept deleting and remaking because of my mood-swings regarding my nsfw Reddit life. At present, I have 3 accounts, one main, one that my friends know of, and this throwaway for nsfw stuff.

So I started talking to this guy on an nsfw subreddit, and it evolved into a fwb sort of situation. We were talking almost everyday and he was a regular poster on nsfw subs. Now, up until now, I used to think Reddit vote manipulation meant using your accounts to upvote or downvote your own posts and comments. But today I had a lightbulb moment that I might have caused his account to be suspended because I used to like his posts from my accounts, just because I thought that would be a fun/nice thing to do and to show appreciation :) for his posts. So either his account has been suspended (he hasn't posted or commented anything for about 2 weeks now), or he has taken a break from Reddit, or he got tired of my shit and I have been ghosted finally

With the small number of friends I have I feel I can tell them anything. We are closer than family. The issues    and arguements we have are all about the same sort of thing. I am at the very least partly to blame for our    grievances with each other. But basically I feel like 2 of my friends are not honest with me about what they  think about me. and 1 other I just found out is also not honest. We will call the friends Z, C, and N. I'm M. I would be easier if I just name off events that have happened.  
*M joins Z's public discord server Z has been keeping to himself.  
*Z Looks threw all Ms computer files secretly, including pornography, and deletes files he knows are important to him  
*Z,N Get angry and cause a fight over Minecraft, A drawn out talk  occurs where past events are used as ammunition.  
*Z says something loud around M's family that he is in the closet about, something important. M yells at Z. Z Blames the entire event of M and offers no serious apology.  
*M gets drunk and brings up past grievances to Z, M,Z,C, and N get into an argument over it.  
*N thinks his mic is muted and talks shit about M, to someone he says he hates and talks shit about to M. M informs him that he can hear N and is... displeased. N becomes silent and leaves. M drops the issue.  
*C records secretly what is said about him behind his back and sends it to M. M feels conflicted because its Extremely negative towards him. but Z also says in private that he hopes M will do well.  
Most recently My friend C left himself logged into my computer, I read that he thinks my plan to sign my family and I up for cryonics is insane, He didn't say that when I asked him about it.
I decided to Read further his DMs, He basically takes my side and Zs at the same time. And never informs me.
As of righting this, I already sent him a message telling him I read his DMs and have apologized. He hasn't Responded. I have tried to make my point of view heard but they don't listen and blame me for everything. I end up apologizing, but it keeps being brought up either by me or them.

586,"Hi all,
Really sorry if this sounds like just bitchy teen stuff I just have to get this off my chest.
Recently I got into a short fight with my mum but things have been escalating for a while now.
I hate it when people talk about me behind my back or lie about me, my panic attacks and fear of judgement don't help this issue either.
My mum does have a tendency to get some info from me and tell my immediate family without my consent and even further family like my grandparents which is a Huge issue for me but I don't know how to bring this up without sounding like a twat.

For some background we recently brought two kittens home who have a sort of cat aviary downstairs and we have one dog that isn't too fond of cats.
Earlier that day my mum told me that I shouldn't let the dog even come near the cage so you can imagine that I was pretty confused when when I came home and told the dog off for walking up to the cage I got shouted at for ""making a big deal out of nothing"" and when I tried to Calmly Explain that she told me earlier to keep her away from the cage I got interrupted and yelled at.
She then told my dad that I had ""shouted at the dog for no reason"" and that I ""always make problems"" which I heard as I was going upstairs to clam myself down so I, once again, tried to explain that I was following her instructions to which she Full On Screamed that I ""need to know when to shut the hell up"" 
I had spoken more forcefully that time as I was stressed and pissed off and felt a Need to explain myself (which I still do but that's besides the point) and yes i shouldn't have raised my voice.

Once I had calmed myself down enough to be able to talk to her again I went downstairs and was hungry so I walked into the kitchen, which she was also in, went over to the fridge, opened it, and looked for soemthing to eat. She asked me what I was doing so I answered ""looking for soemthing to eat"" she asked me again so I turned around to face her and said ""I'm hungry, I'm looking for something to eat"" 
So she asked me again so I Shut the fridge, Turned around to face her fully, and said a bit louder as I figured she just didn't hear me (she had a cold at the time so it was plausible) ""I am hungry, I'm looking for something to eat, I don't see where the problem is?"" So she yelled at me for having attitude and sent me upstairs.

We haven't spoken about it and it's been a few days. Any thoughts or advice?
Please let me know if I am just being a cunt and fully deserve her yelling I just want to know why.

My sound proofing is pretty bad. In some spots I can hear what they're saying crystal clear. I'm sure they'll hear something. However, I don't hear much on the second floor.

I was studying for online school so I took a quick rest. Then I woke up and took my new earphones to listen to music then heard that the other earbud is not working. Because of it, I had a breakdown.

Context:
I live in one of the most remote locations in one of the worst cities in one of the poorest countries. And because of the quarantine, my family barely has enough money for food. One dollar is like fifty in our country, which is a whole lot of money for our country. The earphones cost 350. A cup of rice costs 10 for comparison.

I am a 14-year old male high school student who lives in a house with an insufficient signal for mobile data, which means I have to go to the neighbor with Wi-Fi and have to pay 40 every day to connect to their Wi-Fi. 40 EVERY DAY! We have classes using Google Meet and I only use my cracked Samsung phone to have classes, which gives me the need to use earphones.

Losing earphones meant a lot to me. I love music and I couldn't even listen to music properly now. And no, I can't listen to music with my overly religious parents because of the explicit lyrics. 

To add to the damage, I'm an extremely insecure person who has no lasting friendships, which means that I was lonely even before quarantine when I was in school, which worsed my breakdown because of hiding it for many months.

I could really need a therapist right now, but I can't even afford that, Along with the fact that there are no therapists in our city.

I didn't say my country and city or our unit of currency because I'm not sure if it's fine, but if you think so I can say it in the comments.

603,"I hate having people touch me, it makes me uncomfortable. My grandmother knows and never respected it until some months ago when I decided to assert myself. No touch is allowed but her touch is especially terrible: since childhood I hate having her kiss me, hug me and expressed it accordingly but no one took me seriously. 

When she has a chance, she'll touch me and I'm shy and feel awkward telling her no since it's always in public. She always makes herself the victim, though. For example: grandmother says the sky is green, I say no, the sky is blue and she replies with a No Need To Get Angry, Don't Fight With Me in a crying tone. (We'd be eating smth and she'd get really angry if I didn't want to share my eating utensils or use the ones she had used, it was bizarre. No one else ever had that reaction. I find it gross, am I not allowed to?)

I can only agree with her and wallow in everything she says because if I express a disagreement the conversation ends, so I have another problem: I have no idea what to say to her since she's not interested in what I like and her likes revolve around what other people are doing yet she demands my attention. 

Things always end with ""that's not in the bible/not what our religion believes"" or with her sharing everything I say to everyone and I'm a private person and I don't like to share and when I do everyone gets to know lmao. I ask: can you please don't tell anyone? She says yes but tells everyone and then act like nothing happened. 

Like, I don't know if I'm being irrational - I really hate how overbearing she is but I don't know how to assert myself because she'll either agree and then pretend it never happened OR do that crying tone bizarre Don't Fight Me We're Family and I can't cut ties rn and my mother isn't willing to stand up to her.

604,"So the title basically explains it. The problem I have is with my queer platonic partner (essentially my bf) he's absolutely amazing and I know that he wouldn't do anything if he didn't think it wasn't in my best interests. However, the way he's been treating me has been driving me crazy, especially recently

So I'm a pretty depressed bunny, it's no secret. Normally he's great in handling my moods and talking with me in a way that I don't get more mad/depressed etc but he's always babied me. I get it a lot from a lot of people because they think I'm just a kid that doesn't know what they're talking about and has no reason to feel how I do etc etc and it does my head in because I get it so often. My family treat me like a toddler when it comes to mental health so it normally goes unmentioned to them so he's been the one person I talk to about how I'm feeling on a regular basis but recently he's been babying me more and it's starting to do my head in


I've said I'm away for a few days so I get some time away from him but I just don't know how to talk to him about it. I care about him a lot and I don't want to make him feel awful about it but I really need to bring it up with him because it's driving me crazy and I can't keep putting up with it from someone I cares about so much

Any time I bring up my mental health or how I feel I get near enough the same response which is something along the lines of 'awwww poor baby needs a hug' my problem with this is that it never actually addresses how I feel. There's no regard for the fact that I'm mad or depressed and actually maybe they should offer a way to cool off or anything like that. It feels like just ""are you done yet?"" and that actually there isn't any thought of what I'd actually want or need. 

I'm not a huggy person and don't really like people touching me and anything like that and they're always pressing the idea of aww you need a hug aww you need a cuddle rather than actually thinking what I might want in that situation. I understand that is what he would want if he felt like that but when someone is sad you tend to do what they would want not what you want? 

I understand that he's trying to help but realistically he knows me well enough to know that isn't how I deal with things and that actually being babied really pisses me off but he does it anyway. 

I know I need to talk with him about it but he's a very emotional person, he's very easily upset and I ideally want to be able to talk with him about it without upsetting him too much but also conveying how I feel. I'm bad with words and just need help with figuring out how to word things and how to get across my point without coming across like I hate him

TLDR

609," 

First of all, this isn't that serious, but I still need some opinions or someone to tell me that I need to do

So context: On Halloween, my friends decided to do a party at my house so I'm technically hosting it, it's only going to be 8 of us and we all decided to go out as little as possible so we can all be fine for that day. Anyways that not the point. When we were deciding and planning the party my friend, let's call her Mary was not in the group chat or even contributing to the conversation of the party.

Mary was my only friend in middle school, which was when we were inseparable. it was always the two of us, everywhere we went and did. We were like sisters (i don't have a sibling, I'm an only child so it was the closest thing I had to it) Point is we were there for each other when we needed the other.

it all changed when we went to high school though. In high school, I joined a club and from there is where I met my now friends group. however, mary and my friend group don't really get along well. Not because they have some grudge against each other (well she does against one of them but il get to that in a bit) mary and my friends just don't have the same interest and to be quite frank its because mary doesn't try to and doesn't talk; she's an introvert.

I also have this other friend called Aiden he's cool and was in my friend's group in middle school. The two people I could rely the most on was Mary and Aiden. Then in the first couple of months into freshman year, they started dating, Aiden dated her for pitty, not wanting to reject her and to get his mind off his last relationship so he wasn't in the right mind. Mary grew attached to him, while Aiden was not emotionally invested. In the end, Mary got dumped on a few weeks later after she gave Aiden his birthday present. I know that hella shitty but he tried to apologize and reconcile but she didn't budge and that makes sense. Now it's the beginning of junior year and I am still friends with both of them. However, things have changed with Mary and me.

Mary is the type of person who I need to work on a lot, if I don't talk to her then she won't talk to me she doesn't have many friends because all of them are online and in irl she doesn't try to make friends she just does her own thing. Mary is also very infuriatingly stubborn to the point where I don't want to be friends with her anymore. we're still friends so that's that but recently we've been growing distant because I'm now spending time with my new friends that I have much more in common than I do with Mary.

this brings us back to the halloween party. I've been contemplating on whether or not I should invite her because **1. she doesn't get along with my friends she just doesn't try to do her part 2. shes still mad at Aiden for doing that to her.** and you know I get it, she got hurt of what he did, but their relationship didn't even last long only about less than a month and they didn't go on dates or act couple-ly. they were just really chill. so shouldn't she be over it?

My girl group friends are telling me not to invite her because she will dampen the mood, and if I do invite her then my guy friends won't come because Aiden cant so it's not even gonna be a party but only my 3 girl friends and Mary. my friends don't have anything against her and are okay with her coming but it will ruin the mood. One thing I need to do is tell her that we are having a party because if I don't tell her then ill just feel bad.

I texted her a while ago and what she told me if she saw him was cry first and then get angry and I know my best friend. She'll actually do that, and avoid him like death itself. it'll just not work out if she comes and it sucks because I want them to all get along but Mary won't try

she's been there for me when I need her and she's been my friends for so long so I feel bad for not inviting her. There are men things I hoped to do with Mary that I cant do with her because she's so stubborn but now I've found that with my new friends. **I just don't want her to be left behind.**

So should I invite her or not? should I tell her to not hurt her feeling or just leave her oblivious then she'll figure out on her own and be mad at me at a later time?",01Oct2020,1
610,"I‚Äôm going to try and keep this short but happy to answer questions to get more advice below.

Me (F32) and my bf (M45) have been living together and in a relationship for about three years. It has been turbulent at times. However since Covid I thought we had turned a corner and we were even looking to purchase a house, unfortunately my credit report wasn‚Äôt at the level it needed to be - which we both knew as I‚Äôve been open about my finances. So we decided to put it on hold for a year so I could boost my rating. A couple of weeks later all is fine, I get confirmation I start a new role at the company I work for, I‚Äôm in a good place mentally and he seems happy and supportive and loving. Cut to this week. Start new job on Monday, and for the first time in awhile he‚Äôs spending two days in the office. Monday he comes home and is happy he could socialise with co workers, and says he‚Äôs proud of me for a busy first day on my new role. Kisses cuddles etc as normal, he also says that a small group are heading out for socially distanced drinks the next day after work. So good so far. He gets back from work, heads out, and is home, drunk, when everything shuts at 10. He acts off, won‚Äôt kiss me and He in his drunken state says the following :

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry whatever happens from now it‚Äôs all my fault, I‚Äôve done it ‚Äòsomething I couldn‚Äôt understand‚Äô time and it‚Äôs not you to blame it‚Äôs all my fault.‚Äù

Then I asked him to explain and he said ‚Äúsorry I don‚Äôt know what to say, from here on it‚Äôs not your fault. Don‚Äôt blame yourself is what I mean‚Äù

It just came across strange and left me feeling pretty weird, so I slept next door and noted down what he said to ask him the next morning when he sobered up. 

Well that turned into a shit show. He went from being the supportive and loving partner too ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I love you and feel like I‚Äôve let you down and strung you along‚Äù. More iterations of the same and then I asked if he had feelings elsewhere or if anything happened cheating wise. He insists it hasn‚Äôt (he knows that‚Äôs my number one major no no). He then picked up his things, walked into the room crying and like he wanted to say something several times and left to go to his parents.

This was on my second day in my new job, I took a few hours in the morning to get myself together and try and limp through my afternoon meetings. He‚Äôs been gone since, and has said it might be a week or so before he comes back. He owns the property we live in. I‚Äôm confused. I feel like there‚Äôs foul play, but I‚Äôm also worried it‚Äôs a massive mental break down. He‚Äôs had them before and broken up with me only to change his mind. But it‚Äôs happened one to many times and this time there was zero confrontation between us. I just need some insights or advice. I do love this man, so much. He‚Äôs been bad with previous partners and I just don‚Äôt know what to say or do. I can‚Äôt afford to move straight away and I need at least coping mechanisms. So far I‚Äôve tried to focus on my new job, however I was hopeful some unbiased internet advice might help me. I‚Äôve worked so hard at this relationship and myself.

612,"I made some really shitty financial and life decisions coming out of high school, I took an excessive amount of student loans to go to an expensive college for a degree I should have never started then dropped out before graduating due to extreme depression. I spent a few years afterwards working as a waiter living in a junk apartment but mostly enjoying life, I was finally autonomous with plenty of free time to do what I enjoy, living cheap but had enough money to take some guitar lessons and learned that I actually want to start working towards a music career one day. 

Once my loan grace period ran out and I exhausted all of my deferments I was forced to find a better paying job working in an office for a help desk, I could no longer afford my music lessons and have been spending about half of my entire monthly income on loan payments alone. I've given up basically every bit of fun spending I ever had that helped keep me happy just to afford bills and loan payments now. My depression has been hitting me again so hard again due to the stresses of this that I've been sleeping for 14-16 hours per day with no mental energy to move most of the time. 2 weeks ago I had a severe enough mental breakdown that I had to call my boss and request a few sick days off. I guess it's obvious how bad I'm doing because he asked how my mental health was doing when I asked for time off. I've been waking up most days just thinking I'd rather die than deal with this for possibly another decade to pay these loans off. I don't even have the mental energy or financial resources to work on my music anymore which had become my reason to live after my last depressive episode.

I've tried calling Sallie Mae to work out a different loan repayment plan but they refuse to offer income based repayment and I'm out of deferral time. The only option they even offer me is just to call my cosigner and have them pay for it. Cosigners being my parents who were upset at me dropping out and will only help with payments if I go back to finish college as well as my recently deceased great grandparents who were the few people who I trusted to help me out of any bad spot I was in. 

I don't even have money to go to a therapist or a doctor to help with the depression at this point. I started drinking and smoking way more trying to relax then beat myself up over it because it's unhealthy and I should be buying groceries with the money instead. I've been applying for any internal job at my company trying to make more money and have been rejected for each one. No other jobs in this town that I'm qualified for even pay as much as I'm making now and it's still far from enough.

616,"So there has been way too much going on but I need advice on this particular incident that happened within the timespan of last few days. 

So I have this friend circle where I, F1(friend 1), F2 (Friend 2), F1S (Friend 1's younger sister) and few other people hang out together.

Now F1 and F2 are my closest friends but for some reasons F1S has taken a dislike for me. I have no idea why, she's 17 y/o and I (19) literally don't even remember interacting with her that much let alone trying to hurt her feelings. 

Now a month ago, F2 confronted me and told me that F1S feels threatened by my presence in their circle and she doesn't like me much, they even told me few stuff she has been doing that she shouldn't do but I shrugged it off thinking she's just a kid. 

For the last month I have put effort in every way possible to make her feel more comfortable around me. I talked to her a lot more, I gave her preference over my other friends, soon she added me on her social media, there would be instances when F1 would ask me to include her when we hanged out and I didn't think much of it because I would always ask and she would be usually studying or working or hanging with other friends, so I thought everything is going ok until yesterday. 

Yesterday they were talking about her social media post which I thought I couldn't see because so many people are added on my account, a quick search for her profile made it really clear that she had blocked me from all the social medias. I was hurt, and if I'm being honest, slightly pissed too. 

So F2 soon found it out because they probably sensed my discomfort when I didn't engage in their talk about her social media post. Soon the word travelled and F1 got to know about it. 

Im not sure what she told me about us hanging out because I've asked her on several occasions and she declined, when I asked F1 about it he said he feels like we don't include her in our group. 

Now F1 says she's been feeling low for last few weeks and that's why she did what she did and I must be mature and forget about it, maybe even talk to her about it but I don't want to. 

Seriously I'm going some stuff of my own and while I won't go as far as saying that I'm in depression, my workload has been taking a toll on me and I'm not really feeling my best these days. 

So yeah, that's the story, tell me people of Reddit, should I go talk to her because honestly I don't think she wouldve blocked me in the first place if she wanted to talk to me but I have the pressure of being the adult and sorting things out here. 

What should I do ?",01Oct2020,1
617,"So my ex wife is out of town for assigments a lot (like weeks or months) and my daughter is at her house with her grandmother a lot. I feel like she is being kept away from me (she's 17) and suffers from depression. Her grandmother calls her fat, won't let her call her boyfriend, and is basically a slave driver nutjob. It's killing her self esteem. I finally got to see my daughter for a bit last night and she told me she thinks about self harm.

So... I am worried. But if I try to talk to my ex, she gets all irritated and somehow makes everything my fault and always ends up with threatening me with a lawyer (for what, I don't know.. usually money issues that aren't in the decree). She's the one who cheated btw.

I also have anxiety and have actually ended up in the hospital for a panic attack that I thought was a heart attack due to the ex wife. My current relationship, and relationships between my daughter and stepdaughter are hurting because of my ex.

What should I do? Should I try to let my ex know that she's thinking of self harm and having esteem issues because of her environment and end up getting screamed at and made to feel inadequate as a father, or just try to deal with it on my own?",01Oct2020,1

619,"&amp;#x200B;

So over my teen years, since about the age of 13, when I fist started to masturbate, I developed a rather weird fetish. (I'm a 19 year old male btw)

Its like a foot fetish, but with shoes instead. Some types of shoes kinda turn me on. And people putting them on turns me on even more. Its called shoe play and apparently its an actual thing. I was beginning to think it was just me being weird, but apparently not. Videos of people putting shoes on, taking them off or moving their foot around in them turn me on so much. The same applies to football boots.

Nike trainers and football boots turn me on the most. Its very weird I know, but idk how to get rid of it. I've never been able to masturbate over normal stuff like straight porn. Instead its just trainers?

Videos of my friends wearing trainers turns me on even more, especially if they're a good friend or good looking. I'd like to think im not gay, as I do also get attractions towards women, just a little less intense than my friends.

Is there a cause to this, and how can I get rid of it? or even try to kinda reduce how much it turns me on because right now, its very intense!

620,"I (21f) live with my boyfriend (19m) who takes care of his mom and brother. We live in a trailer park that is ran by the worst people ever. When I moved in there was a cockroach problem. We contacted the owners of the park we rent from and they took care of it for about six months. Then they stopped because the people they hired claimed we were messy. My boyfriend says that the roach problem was a thing since they moved in. And I was there when the exterminators were there. They only had one guy come in once and that was on a day the house was clean minus a dirty dish or two in the sink. Other than that they never came in the house. We were dumbfounded. 

Then comes our bathroom. The bathtub was about to fall through the floor. We had them fix it after about six emails. The plumber and contractor they hired were shocked they even rented our trailer out to us in that condition. 

Then we had no water pressure for a good month before the owners decided to send out a plumber. The plumber said it was a city water issue and had it fixed a week after he came. But the fact it took a month to get them to even send someone after various emails and videos of our water is annoying. 

Now comes our current issue. The floor is falling apart. The wood is weak in certain places and is caving in. There is also water damage near our backdoor in the roof. This was also another issue that wasn't our fault but was from whoever rented the trailer before us. I am scared that there is mold growing there. We have been trying to get someone out to look at it but the owners are refusing to send anyone due to ""covid"". Our state (NC) isn't doing bad with covid cases. Our city only has 36 cases in total. And we were willing to leave or wear mask as described in our emails. Nothing. They still refuse. 

At this point I want to move out and find a new place but we live in a fairly expensive city. We found some affordable places but me and my boyfriend are still young and aren't sure how to go about it. We don't even know what to look for to make sure we won't have this issue again. Any tips?

624,"Hi Everyone, 

Today I had kind of a bad day, I was just feeling down in the dumps so I decided to meditate to help get my mind off it, and I felt so relaxed and great i decided to go down and let my mom know. She told me that it was great but I could feel my tears coming back up again and she saw i was still upset over something. She wanted to sit down with me and tell her why i was crying but after i told her it was nothing and that I was just upset and tired, she started to get worked up and told me i shouldn't be crying over stupid things like that and that people cry for real reasons like losing someone or losing a job. 

She then proceeds to tell me to not give her that millennial crap that every young adult goes through and then proceeds to tell me to do something with my life and that way I wouldn't be upset and wouldn't be crying. 

She just made me feel more awful about myself and once I told her how she was reacting wasn't helping, she just got more upset and yelled at me saying how she reacted is my fault and that i caused her to be like. She kept saying how I'm not doing with my life and that's why I'm like this and how I'm just causing her stress and after this, I went back to being upset and stressed out even more than before. She just makes me feel like i can't talk to her about anything without her dismissing it as nothing and that I'm overreacting.. Any advice?",01Oct2020,1

626,"first time using reddit ¬†(at least i think so) so excuse any mistakes or misspellings.

ps: my story is a bit long so it might seem i missed some details because it would take forever to write.

so basically story of my life goes as follows. currently I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and lost any kind of appreciation or enjoyment in my life. I'll tell my story from my childhood to the present day to serve as a context and for me to vent out as well.

so basically i grow up with strict parents, so strict i would get beat if i get involved in any issue even if I'm the victim (here beating your kids to discipline them is socially acceptable, and i also believe in certain circumstances at least the threat of being beaten can serve as a deterrent for kids to misbehave), i don't have any issue with the beating itself, matter of fact i deserved a lot of it for the stupid shit i did as a kid, but what actually had an impact was the unjust nature of some of the punishments. later in life as i entered middle school ¬†(don't know if middle school in my country and other countries is the same grades) my dad started punishing me for academic performance, despite being among the top few of the class it was never enough and i ""could achieve better"" (which was true doing to me not giving school that much mind) the punishment was most some harsh words and getting grounded. later on when i got my first computer after age of 15 the punishment become im taking the computer away for anything. i graduated high school and went to engineering school ¬†(which i didn't want, requires a ¬†lot of work and im not the dedicated kind) since my dad wanted me to go and couldn't find any better options. few weeks of engineering school and me and my dad started fighting daily, the stress got to me good and i kind became a maniac for few weeks where i explode at the stupidest shit, and since both me and my dad are both stone headed we clashed daily like 2 roman gladiators in the coliseum, and my dad couldn't manage me and had to ask my uncles to intervene in hopes of calming me down. that introduction was basically me telling why i don't trust my family in such subject, i don't exactly live in a country where those issues are taken seriously and you're looked down to if you go to therapy.

anyway to the main issue im here for. my mental problems started with stress from engineering school, i was not in an environment that i wanted to be in and the breakdown i had at the start of engineering school was the first culmination of that stress. i managed to pass my first year barely making it and started to find my piece of mind again only to have my first heart break in the middle of the second year (no details needed of how) that heartbreak caused me to have nerve problems in my stomach which makes me feel any extreme emotions in my stomach ¬†(good or bad) and i still live with that conditions to this day. i passed the second year of school after managing to get my head out of the emotions i was going through and got transfered to a new school to have a specialised degree in a field of engineering of my choice. the first year passed ok and the second year started ok, i started a relationship at the start of my second year and found what professional career i wanted to pursue and had everything sorted out, or so i thought. in the middle of the second year teachers in my uni decided to strike, for the whole fucking year, and did not provide any exams. so we ended up living the hellish stress of uncertain future. professeurs and education minister reached an agreement in the middle of the summer and i had to stay to pass my exams until the 20th of July, this caused me to miss a huge internship that would've been a great opportunity for me. needless to say how much stress that caused and i felt every last bit of it as stomach ache and severe one at that.

i thought everything passed and i was in my last year and close to graduation but life had to have the last laugh and the Saturday before passing the first set of exams i was in the ER for intestinal pain well into the am, that pain made me unable to walk and i spent a month unable to do anything because of it until some medicines reduce the pain enough for me to be able to do some certain functions that should've been easy to do. ever since that ER visit i lived practically as a disabled for a year without knowing what was causing the pain (every test i did came back normal) and i had to power through the pain to finish the year and graduate. after the nightmare experience with the intestinal and thigh pain started i had to redo my exams and pass the second exams then start a graduation internship in one of the most toxic work environments, co-workers basically ignored me except very few of them, one coworker provoked me and then reported me to the manager when i reacted and the manager was so fair to the point he made me apologize to the whole team or i would be terminated and he never asked for my side of the story, i was capable of changing internships but my parents are not educated and would not understand the situation and i didn't to put my mom through the stress of her fearing for her only son's future, so i swallowed my pride and apologized and after few weeks i managed to convince him to let me finish the project at home wish was a relief for me.

nearing the end of the project and almost a year after that ER visit i went to the beach and my back felt like i was being stabbed with a 100 knives (the pain of long hours of work on the project triggered by the physical strain of swimming and playing ball at the beach) few days later i was diagnosed with a herniated disc that was pressuring on the nerve controlling the left side of my lower body which was causing the pain all along. i took some pain killers and manager to finish my project and graduate. few days after graduation i had to had an eye surgery ¬†(was following the state of eye for 2 years and was putting the operation off because of my graduation project until the doctor said it is either now or i might as well consider my self lost an eye). the rehabilitation period after the surgery was supposed to be 3 days but i had some complications and it had to be isolated in my room for 3 weeks in complete darkness because i couldn't tolerate the light with what essentially was a hole in my eye. i would describe the pain and agony i went through but i doubt i could.

after the surgery i managed to get a job and everything seemed fine, until i was diagnosed with extreme sinusitis, just as this covid shit was starting, so yeah perfect timing. this shitty sinusitis made life unbearable, i was spitting all the time ¬†(im not talking regular spitting but the ugly kind with the ugly noises, basically me trying to clear my throat of all the shit that come down), sometimes my throat gets clogged and i can no longer breath and every time i think this is the moment i kick the bucket. the experience of almost suffocating to death every other day was mentally scarring. so i had to work through back pain and clogged throat for months to deliver results at worst. the start of July was the point i reached the edge, i had extreme allergic reaction to something that triggered my sinusitis even more and my back just gave in and basically i lived with a single leg and no lower back ever since. in july alone i almost took 7 or 8 days of paid sick leave ¬†(which was a nice gesture from the company to provide paid sick leave and they are in no shape or form required to do so by the law or the contract i signed with them). that amount of sick leave made me look like a liability more than an asset and i lived with the fear of losing my job ever since due to my inconsistency at work.

my sinusitis calmed down in august after going through some extreme medication that i was basically risking my liver and kidneys in the process ¬†(thankfully i came out ok).i also saw another doctor about my bad and started physical therapy. i thought i was over it all until few weeks ago when the family got the scare of our lives when my mom was falsely diagnosed with cancer, despite it not being cancer she had to go through surgery on the nerve of the right leg. my mom has been screaming in pain for 2 weeks and i can't even bring myself to go to check on her because i can't see her squirming in pain. at the start of the week she went to her doctor and he gave her some strong drugs and she has been out of her mind since and it is as much painful to see her go through let alone the fear she might get addicted to the medication (i live in a society where drugs and alcohol are not acceptable as in western cultures so it is actually very painful to see someone in that state for me let alone it being my mother). also after finishing my physical therapy and having some hope of recovery my back pain has returned only days after. all of this shit has made me very susceptible to angry bursts, if i get angry i basically forget what i say and whay i do and no longer can keep it in, even for the smallest things, i just lash out and i say the most hurtful shit you can imagine and no one is safe from and this causing me to lose family members, parents and my girlfriend.

I'm really at a loss and have no idea what to do, my girlfriend doesn't not seem to understand my situation despite her being supportive, i have no one i feel comfortable venting to and mental health isn't exactly viewed in high regards in my country and i double that we have good enough therapist here. i guess I'm here to vent out more than anything but any advice is appreciated because im on the edge of my mind and i don't want to lose it because that might cause me to lose anyone who means something to me (im not suicidal btw).

i know this might seem like i'm whining about stupid shit to some people, and that's the impression i get from everyone around me and i'd be told to man up like men supposed to be motionless psychopaths. i know this seem like minor things to other people, but i'm 6 years living in constant stress and had it affect my health so  i'm really in need of advice, help, input, even a kind word from someone who knows how this feels.

sorry for the long post, i guess i just needed to vent after all this time.",01Oct2020,1
627,"We‚Äôre all 17, my friend group has 5 people, 3 girls two boys. My friend, Sarah, and her boyfriend, Adam, have been dating for years now. I became friends with them 2 years ago while they were still dating. 

Everything is great in the group. We all love eachother and it‚Äôs nice. Last year Adam left school to go to a college. We invite him out everytime we go out so we still see him. Adam and Sarah have been having some issues though. Anytime we go out (due to where Adam lives) Adam always spends the night at Sarah‚Äôs afterward. He‚Äôs even been staying at her house for weeks now because it‚Äôs closer to his college. Adam has a lot of money, his family is well off, but when it comes to buying stuff he can be very cheap (which is fine, it‚Äôs never been an issue for anyone). 

Sometimes Sarah pays for his stuff a lot because he thinks it‚Äôs too expensive. And Sarah has a lot of work to do, school work, and her part time job so she hates having Adam at her home because she wouldn‚Äôt want to ignore him to focus on her work. She‚Äôs made this clear to him a lot that she doesn‚Äôt want him visiting as often because she needs to do her work. He always convinces her though. They‚Äôve managed well with this though so far. 

She also brought up (in a joking manner) about how she hates that Adam and I play videogames so much because he doesn‚Äôt speak to her a lot, since she was joking I never thought much of it. Turns out Adam goes as far as to ignore her for me and his other friends, sometimes while he waits for people to get on their PS4 he will call her only to tell her to shut up when his friends arrive. Based on what she told us today it seems like he gaslights her a lot, doesn‚Äôt take her into consideration a whole lot and also never seems to want to hang out when Sarah is finally free. 

Of course hearing this i thought ‚ÄúAdams a fucking dick.‚Äù But he‚Äôs always been so nice to me and the others. Always accepted me for who I am. I don‚Äôt want to cut off a friend without speaking to him about it but I know him and ik he wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable talking on it and ik Sarah may get mad at me for asking him. But I can‚Äôt just cut him off, he‚Äôs my friend and I love him but what he‚Äôs done is really hurting me. To know what he puts her through, the stuff he‚Äôs said to her, it‚Äôs disgusting but I know he struggles a lot (not an excuse though).

Sarah also pointed out (they have access to eachothers social media‚Äôs) that Adam always ignores the messages she sends him and the messages I send him. He always asked me to play online with him so I assumed that‚Äôs what he wanted so sometimes I text him, asking to play. Sometimes I text to see how he is as well. I notice he gets active but doesn‚Äôt reply and at first I didn‚Äôt think much of it but hearing that he replies to others so quickly and sees the texts but ignores them is rough. We‚Äôre supposed to all be friends but he doesn‚Äôt seem to care, instead he seems to care more about the same people who bullied him into a severe depression. The people who made him almost overdose and robbed him while he was passed out for hours. 

Really, I just want to hear his side but idk if he‚Äôd be up to tell me that and idk if Sarah will hate me for that or not. Idk what to do. Just cut off a friend (for good reasons) without speaking to him? Without getting his side of the break up? I trust Sarah, I do, but I also trust Adam. And I want the best for both of them. Idk what to do. My other friends have said they‚Äôre done with him based on what Sarah said. 

Would I be an asshole if I spoke to him? Should I even bother since it‚Äôs clear he might not even care about me? I hate this shit sm and I hate myself for caring sm for someone who has shown signs of not caring for me. Any advice would be helpful.",01Oct2020,2

630,My mom was pretty much fully functional about 18 months ago but with depression . Around Christmas last year she took a big drop and cooking any sort of a dinner wasn‚Äôt going to happen so went to a fairly expensive restaurant that no one can afford. Since then she dropped big time in summer this year to in and out of psych and being completely dependent and not doing anything but sitting on couch . She has started to get a little better in August able to get cereal in morning something pre made for lunch and taxis out 2 to groups in mental health places colouring and knitting other than that she is almost 100 percent dependent on her spouse. For thanks giving she wants to do the expensive restaurant which she can‚Äôt afford but offering to pay but when she gets the bill her tune changes and I obviously pay for me and my spouse . I have offered to cook instead and have cooked most family meals for last 2-3 years other than last Christmas. I think she wants to do restaurant as she feels she contributing but to be honest it‚Äôs putting her in more debt and restaurants just don‚Äôt feel like thanksgiving. I would like to cook and if she wants she can pay for the turkey or ham. I‚Äôm wondering if and would like to ask her to try and bake just 1 pie like she used to. It‚Äôs not a full meal and she can even use premise crusts. I am wanting to do this to challenge her. I think she is capable but just has no motivation to regain her independence .

636,"I went to primary school with this kid (elementary for the American people) and we were classmates for 6 years. We did become friends and had arguements very frequently and changed. He had moderate or severe Autism. Most kids bullied him and I did when we argued. The last few days of primary school, we were hatimg each other and I called him names. So we part ways in a bad way. A year or 2 later, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a more milder form of his condition. And when I started at a terrible school for the first 2 years, I was in his place. I was bullied for being different. I was bullied for not being like everyone. I was bullied for different interests. I was bullied cause of my religion (Islam). I felt as though this was God's punishment for me being a demon to that poor kid. I hated being in that spot and I became depressed at that time. I regretted everything I called him. Just recently, I found the guy on Instagram on my reccomeded, along with his twitter, PSN and YouTube channel in his bio alone. I wish to contact him and to apologise for everything I've done. I think an apology won't be another. Hell, I think buying him a car won't be enough. What do I say, I genuinely want to apologise otherwise I'd regret not doing it.

638,"Ok, so my sister has a 4yo daughter I will call N for niece. N is currently in the custody of my father because my sister is in jail for drugs. Her court is happening next week, but my dad has had temporary custody of N for just over a year now. I have been helping dad with N since then keeping her every other weekend or so. 

The issue started at Christmas last year. My family, since most of us kids are gown, does Christmas at dad‚Äôs as a late lunch and gift exchange. My wife and I went to her family that year so we were late getting to my dad‚Äôs and everyone else was already gone. We are there only a few minutes when a man and woman I don‚Äôt know pull up. I assumed they are friends of my dad and stepmom, but then they start unloading their truck and they end up having what I can only estimate as a minimum of $600 worth of gifts for N. I asked stepmom  who these people were and it turns out the woman works with stepmom and dude is just her husband. For whatever reason they can‚Äôt have children so they have been doting on N. I was pretty annoyed at the timing of this because I had come to spend time with N and to give her a few gifts and before she even finishes opening them, these strangers come in and over shadow my time. That is just my own selfishness, but it was also very strange and didn‚Äôt add up to me. The worst part was that the husband seemed to be far more into N than his wife was. I stayed there until they left so that I could have time with N. The entire time this dude didnt acknowledge me or my wife even once. Those 2 things combined gave me a bad feeling about him. I tried not to read too much into it and I went on with my life. 

I didn‚Äôt see these 2 for a while after that, I would keep N every other weekend and the 2 strangers never came back up when I was around. Then N‚Äôs 4th birthday comes around last month. All of her birthdays have been at a local park that has a splash pad that she loves. This year though it was to be at my dad‚Äôs house and they rented a big inflatable water slide gimmick. So the day of the party rolls around and here are these people again. While the kids are playing on this slide the man (Clay) is taking pictures constantly with this expensive looking camera. When all the adults lost interest in standing there watching them slide over and over and we all went to the carport to sit and talk in eyesight of the children. But not Clay, he stays there taking photos the whole time. Then we eat and have cake and then open presents. I realized that Clay wasn‚Äôt so interested in taking pictures once we were in the house. Then I noticed that N opened presents from everyone there except for Clay and his wife. This is odd because they had spent so much on her at Christmas.

The next day after hearing that my wife, my mom, and my aunt all got the same creepy vibe from Clay that I had, I decided it was time to bring this concern to my father. Like I said Clay‚Äôs wife is friends with my step mom so my father and Clay aren‚Äôt necessarily best pals. 

I first text dad asking if he thought it was weird that Clay took so many pictures. He explains that by sending me Clay‚Äôs YouTube channel where he reviews tools and cap mods. So because Clay makes YouTube videos he has an interest in video and photography so that‚Äôs not out of the ordinary according to my dad. 

But here is an extra little cherry on top. I didn‚Äôt know his last name until I saw his YouTube channel. It turns out Clay used to be a cop in my small town and one time when I was in college I was arrested for having a beer in a dry county and for having a small amount of pot. Clay didn‚Äôt arrest me, but when I was arrested he came to me as a Narco to get me to snitch about the weed. I was 20 at the time and didn‚Äôt know the penalty for having weed. He told me that if I snitched he could drop the charge, but if I didn‚Äôt do it then My life would be ruined by this charge. He said my community college would kick me out, my job at a locally owned restaurant would be in jeopardy because my boss would know, and my driver‚Äôs license would be suspended and I even have to go to the state penitentiary. All of this turned out to be a lie, it was just a fine. 

After scaring me with his lies he tells me not to tell my parents or anyone else. I couldn‚Äôt decide what to do, I didn‚Äôt want to have my life ruined but I couldn‚Äôt ruin someone else‚Äôs life over it so I kind of waffled and didn‚Äôt commit either way. This went on for a couple weeks and he was following me and calling me all the time hassling me to cooperate. I finally told my mom and she set me straight and answered when he called me and threatened to report him and whatever if he didn‚Äôt leave me alone. That was the last time I saw him. That was over 10 years ago so I didn‚Äôt recognize him when I saw him at my dad‚Äôs. 

I tried to explain this to my dad and he just stopped texting me back. We have not talked since. 

Since then I learned that Clay paid for the the water slide and it was his idea. He also bought another truck load of toys for her birthday but he gave them to her the day prior to the party when nobody else was there. He bought her a $200 12v Maserati car among several other big things. I also found out that the reason he is no longer a cop is because of some internal investigation that led to our cities board of aldermen firing him with 2 other cops, but the reason isn‚Äôt public because it was an incident that didn‚Äôt involve the public. I also found his Instagram where he posted some footage of N driving the car he bought and sliding down the slide. He edited it with music and some slow motion and it was really sickening to watch for me, maybe because I already had this idea in my head. 

I‚Äôm not sure what advice anyone can give me, but I at least had to vent all of this. This dude has been living rent free in my head for several weeks now and I feel powerless to look into this any further or to convince my dad to. This guy may not be a pedo. Maybe he avoided me because he recognized me and that‚Äôs why I got a bad vibe. I don‚Äôt know but it‚Äôs all I can think about.",01Oct2020,1
639,"HELP!! I (F22) live in small apartment complex with my sister (F25) and my boyfriend (M24). We moved in about 4 months ago and things have been pretty good. There are two little girls that live in the complex. One is 7 and one is 5. They live two doors down from each other. They are adorable, cheery, sweet, and bored out of their minds. They don‚Äôt attend school cause of the pandemic and their parents have them play outside in our courtyard pretty much all day from 12pm-8pm. 

When we first moved in I quickly befriended them bc they are so adorable and genuinely make me laugh at the crazy things they say. It‚Äôs also a very rough neighborhood (super high rate of sex trafficking, theft, catcalling, and overall just a crackhead mess) and i sympathize having parents that just leave you to your own devices all day so I want them to feel comfortable asking me for help if they ever run into stranger danger. But they don‚Äôt really have boundaries when it come to banging on my door. The biggest mistake I ever made  was telling them ‚ÄúIf you guys ever need anything, you can always knock on my door‚Äù. Oh my god, their eyes lit up like I just told them they won a million dollars. I also briefly told them in passing I‚Äôd make them cookies one day cause they randomly told me their favorite type of cookie. Another stupid mistake. 

They don‚Äôt really have boundaries when it comes to banging on my door. If they knock and I don‚Äôt answer then they KEEP KNOCKING or they‚Äôll sit outside my door and wait for me to come out and start playing with their barbies right on my doormat. If I do answer, they ask me for cookies or a flower (I always have a bouquet sitting on my table) or they slowly try to inch their way in my apartment (something about it literally fascinates them idk why) like it‚Äôs a museum or something. They stand there and converse with me about random things and if I didn‚Äôt give them some lame excuse about ‚Äúcan‚Äôt talk, i‚Äôm making dinner!‚Äù or ‚Äúgotta go, I have chicken in the oven!‚Äù they would seriously talk to me all day. I feel so uncomfortable bc I‚Äôm not too aquatinted with their parents (no bad blood, i just never see them) and i feel guilty when i‚Äôm too tired or too depressed to entertain them with a conversation. My boyfriend is getting more and more annoyed with the knocking and has been lashing out at me for telling them that they can knock if they need anything and I genuinely feel guilty that my roommates have to deal with the banging and knocking. It‚Äôs getting to the point that on my drive home from work I pray I won‚Äôt see them and won‚Äôt have to deal with them running up to me to give me a hug or not let me leave the conversation (partly due to my anxiety and depression) and it‚Äôs gives me so much guilt. 

Please can someone tell me a nice but effective way to let them know they can‚Äôt be badgering me and my roommates like this? I really really don‚Äôt want to be mean bc I don‚Äôt want their parents to feel some type of way about me and I don‚Äôt want the girls to feel like they can‚Äôt ask me for help but I can‚Äôt take the knocking and banging or them calling me ‚Äúqueen‚Äù anymore. I feel so guilty bc I started it but I do have anxiety and I literally won‚Äôt leave my house sometimes because of it lol. ANY help will be appreciated!!",01Oct2020,2

Maybe I shouldn't have tokd him I am depressed maybe it's my fault but he obviously sees me just as one girl and there are sea of others. Nothing special or important.

641,"my best friend (let's call her Zen) has been struggling with what can only be described as an overactive imagination since she was seven (she's now a teen)
the most important aspect in this world is what she describes as a force of evil (let's call it XY).
when she first started talking about this i tried to keep it casual and tried to make my best friend feel normal but this persona in her head is more than problematic. i know it may sound crazy but i don't know what to do anymore.i just want her to be safe.

__________________________

to over simplify what i know:

apparently this fantasy world in her head started as simple daydream but evolve into an overarching storyline with characters and worlds. 
she told me things started going really bad when she turned twelve.
XY is apparently the god of evil that choose her as a vessel to (as i understand) either collect energy from through suffering or somehow use as a sacrifice to bring XY into our plane of existence. XY is constantly trying to influence Zen to do things that are bad for her. like not eating, bottling up emotions ect. ect. 
Zen refuses to stop any self destructive behavior even after she acknowledges that it's bad for her.

it has always been bad but recently it's gotten horrible.
Zen has been imagining vivid scenarios in which XY tortures her. this is either to make Zen stronger, teach her discipline or to ""let off steam"".
Zen has been drawing for a while now and is quite good at it but recently she's been drawing gore (mostly people being impaled) something she's never really done before.

today she told me something that i couldn't just let go. she's was extremely stressed yesterday because she had to study for a test. she said she started feeling crazy/lucid and that her eyes were rolling.
she then took her scissors and started cutting at her neck until it bleed. she took off her scarf and i saw the marks clear as day.

(please keep in mind that i only discussed XY but there are other characters and and even eras in her fantasy world... although recently all she told me is about how she's being tortured in explicit detail)

_________________________

i know ever time she told me about XY was a cry for help so ofcourse i've tried to suggest and even push her to get help. but Zen and XY have decided that therapists are trying to ""ruin everything'"" and make Zens life worse. i could've told an adult already considering i've known about this for two years but i know i was the only one she'd ever told about her fantasy world to this extent. 

i wanted to help but in a way that was sensitive towards her feelings so that she wouldn't feel betrayed or worse, get hurt by untactful adults.
(i've witnessed how ignorant adults can be first hand. if they make a rash choice thinking it'd get rid all her problems so they can carry on with their lives, she would never forget and i doubt she would ever seek out help again [and let's make clear that her parents would absolutely do everything wrong])

today i finally convinced her to go to the guidance counselor. a nice woman but she doesn't seem to have ever studied psychology nor been trained to take on thr job of a phsyciatrist. but it's currently the best option and i knew i couldn't afford to wait anymore. Zen told her a bit about the current situation and we made an appointment so they could properly discuss how to help Zen. (we didn't tell her about the selfharm)

it was fine until an hour later when Zen said she wasn't going to meet with the guidance counselor again. she said that she felt weak and that XY was in a lot of control and that she had to keep ot that way.

now i don't know what to do anymore.
i might've messed up my chance to help her without having to go behind her back but what can i even do.
when it comes down to it, i'm just a kid like her.
i don't have the resources or knowledge to help her and i feel so powerless.
i'm so worried i can't think straight.
i'm painfully aware that her problems aren't mine but i love her.
i'm so lost and not even completely mentally stable myself.
please help me... i need guidance but i don't have anyone to turn to.

(sorry is i made any grammatical error or misspelled a word. i'm an idiot and currently crying)

642,"My friend is usually a decent guy. I met him at work, and I've known him for about two years. In the past month, he has sent me five memes which I think are unfunny and sexist. I don't know. Maybe I'm overreacting, but it just makes me annoyed. I don't like it. He only sends me these girls vs boys memes. That's it. He never asks how I am or whatever. He just sends these memes. 

For example, the other day he sent me this meme of a guy in an expensive car with sunglasses on and above it, it said ""When boys drive cars"" and below was a picture of a car accident with ""When girls drive cars."" Get it? Because girls can't drive? 

Another similar meme he sent me is a bunch of broken cars on top of each other with a heading that said ""Girls and cars""

All of these memes are similar. In another one, a girl is sitting in darkness because she can't change a lightbulb because, well, because she doesn't know how to change lightbulbs because she's a girl Hahahhaa!!! So funny!!

Anyway, I'm irritated with these stupid memes. I've told him to stop, but he keeps taunting me by saying that ""it's just a harmless joke"" and says that if I can't take a joke, I should get off the internet. Are these jokes harmless? What would you do in a situation like this?",01Oct2020,1

He stated comparing my struggles to his and using it to invalidate himself I felt like it was competition to him and it was scaring me.

Since I‚Äôve had to talk him out of suicide when he doesn‚Äôt reply with is few seconds I would start panicking thinking he is dead or something (someone I couldn‚Äôt stop ended up in the hospital so this makes me really guilty).

648,"Back 2 years ago I started working at a Dementia Facility as a residential aid. 6 months into this work i started feeling like I was losing my mind. I started forgetting everything. Prior to this, my memory was actually kind of annoying because I could remember EVERYTHING. To a point of remembering miscellaneous dates, what we ate weeks ago, right down to a specific time. It was ridiculous. My memory made me look like I wrote every single detail of my entire life down in a diary or something, even though I didnt.

Like I said, 6 months into working there I started forgetting everything. Everyone I worked with said that they experienced the same thing so I chalked it up to it just being the line of work I was in and the stress of working so much overtime on very little sleep. 

However, I have now been unemployed for a little over 4 months and my memory is now becoming worse and worse. I cant remember conversations that I am having while I am talking to the person. I cant remember what I ate for breakfast. I cant remember if I called the places I need to call or if I scheduled appointments. I cant even remember my ex's birthday (my children's father) who I was with for 9 years so I cant even have the kids call to wish him a happy birthday without feeling like a complete idiot and call on the wrong day or something. 

Now that I am out of that work and my sleep schedule is fine, I dont know what would cause it. Also, on top of this, I have been having insanely detailed and fucked up dreams. Half the time I think that these dreams are reality so I will ask my boyfriend about something thinking it actually happened and he looks at me like I'm completely insane.

655,"I just moved across the country into a city I had lived in previously. I left all my stuff behind except for a bag of clothes and my cat. I am paying 2 rents as I had a lease in the first city and now living in a house with a roommate. He‚Äôs charging me $800/month for a room and access to the rest of the apartment. He has never had a roommate and I haven‚Äôt had one in over 8 years (except for living with my previous partner) 

Here‚Äôs my issue. The apartment I moved into is an absolute dive! It is so disgusting I cannot believe I am living here. It is smelly, cold, damp and very loud. The roommate won‚Äôt show me proof that the apartment costs $1,600/month and says he has no way to prove it, despite the fact that he has a lease and definitely has bank statements. 

He is incredibly loud, his room is above my room. My room is located by the front door...it‚Äôs an unused dining room. It has no lights, no closet and is right next to a busy road. I can hear everything he does upstairs including playing guitar and music at blasting levels and ‚Äústomping‚Äù around with his girlfriend. The apartment is in a really horrible neighbourhood, with no amenities within a 20 min walk. The other day I noticed someone sitting on our doorstep but just let it go to avoid confrontation ... when I came out the next day there were used needles on our doorstep. Someone was shooting up 15 feet away from where I was sleeping. 

As I stated, I brought my cat. Before I had moved in I asked if there were multiple doors between outside and inside and he said yes, this was because my cat is young and hellbent on escaping the apartment when doors are open. There is in fact only one front door and he won‚Äôt let me install another door or a room divider or anything. He also leaves the doors open and unlocked quite often while I‚Äôm at work for 10hours a day. So I‚Äôm forced to keep my kitten locked in my bedroom while I‚Äôm out because he would surely be gone by now if I didn‚Äôt. 

I have no idea how to handle this situation, I suffer from really bad anxiety and depression and since covid it has been so bad. I only took the place because I needed somewhere to be quickly and he had the place. I am absolutely beside myself as to what I should do or how I should handle this situation. I need out immediately or at the very least, I need my cat to be somewhere safe because I feel a tremendous responsibility for him and I love him dearly. 

Please, if anyone has suggestions on what to say or do in this situation I would absolutely love some outside perspective. I am in a devastating place mentally and with this new stressful job, I don‚Äôt see a positive outcome in anyway.",01Oct2020,1
656,"Hello, long time lurker, first-time poster. Please forgive any formatting/grammar/tense issues, I don't really know what I'm doing.

So. I (18F) just started my freshman year at \[Redacted\] University. It's been weird with all the pandemic stuff happening, so most of the time, if we're hanging out, it's in someone's room or on a floor lounge. We don't always keep 6' of distance because we've all quarantined together, but if there's anyone else, or more than like 6 people, we wear masks.

For the presidential debate on Tuesday (yikes I know) 5 of us planned to meet in a mutual friend's room and play a drinking game. The mutual friend (18M)  (henceforth referred to as F) has a roommate (19M) (to be called R) who had plans with his friends to hang out in the lounge on their floor, so he didn't care that we were all there. I've met R maybe once before and he seemed friendly enough.

During the debate, we were drinking and it's fun (but also horrifying looking at the future of the country), and every so often R would come in and offer us some alc he had in his fridge. Every so often someone might disappear to the lounge and then come back a little later and a little drunker. All in all, it was a good time, and just about everyone ended up drinking a lot. I know I for one drank too much, and I didn't quite black out, but I started losing patches of time, and time was getting kinda fuzzy, so I was shitfaced. Somewhere during all of this, most of us ended up hanging out in the lounge.

At some point in the night, I couldn't tell you when, I went to the bathroom, and on my way back to everyone, I stopped off in F and R's room to look for my water bottle and ended up laying on F's bed for a minute to check my Snapchat. I was alone in the room, essentially almost passing out until R walked in. We were talking for a bit, and I don't remember most of the conversation (probably something about politics, but I do remember mentioning the Jonas Brothers?) and he ended up sitting on F's bed next to me (I was still laying down). I don't remember the exact progression after that, but I remember him slowly getting closer. I was a little uncomfortable but not about to make tea with him because I was drunk (could have been moving towards him idek) and I think had been drinking too (I don't know how much he had). I do remember saying something along the lines of ""I'm fucked up"" or ""Shit, I'm drunk"" to a response of ""No, You're fine""

After a little while, another friend (18M, now called P) came in looking for his phone and a snack. He hadn't been drinking as much as everyone else but knew how much I had because I had jokingly tried to fight him earlier in the night. He saw R and talked to him about some sports thing (again I don't really remember I think I was kinda half passed out during this), but P got his stuff and left. R and I started talking again, but I was again, in and out during this. I think I finally passed out sometime in the middle of a conversation about some class he was taking.

I don't think I was out for too long (longer than the previous times I had been in and out, but no more than a minute or two), and when I opened my eyes, R's nose was touching to my nose, and I could feel him getting closer. It kinda startled me so I kinda shimmied away and made some excuse about needing to go to the bathroom and left (again I had minimal motor control at this point so walking was not my friend). I go to the bathroom and then run down the hall towards the lounge where everyone else is. I went to bed shortly after this

I left my water bottle and my (empty) backpack in F &amp; R's room, but I don't know if I want to go back and get them. I think I might be overreacting, because if it really was any sort of deal P probably would have said something when he came in. I haven't seen or talked to R since, and I haven't mentioned anything to P or F or asked anyone else about it. Otherwise, it was a fun night, and I don't really want to be problematic.

So what do I do? What do I say? Do I say anything?

TLDR: I got drunk and passed out and don't know if my friend's roommate kissed me.",01Oct2020,1
657,"So last year at university I had this huge crush on this smart girl in my class. She was everything I dreamt my dream girl to be looks wise, she seemed like my type. But we didn‚Äôt talk very much. A couple of smiles and greetings here and there. I was gonna try and talk to her properly but then COVID-19 hit and we had to leave university. 

Months have gone by. And earlier this week we started our online sessions for this semester. We have new assignments which need to be done in a group. This girl was usually in groups with her friends and I was in groups with mine in the past. So it surprised me that during an online class I received a notification. She had followed me on Instagram and messaged me asking her if I would like to team up with her. I was surprised that she‚Äôd even knew my name lol. So I said I would team up with her, but I have a friend who also wants to team up with me. He‚Äôs not a close friend or anything, just an okay friend. He usually leaves things until last minute and spends most of his time playing video games before assignments are due. 

I talked to him about it and he said he doesn‚Äôt care if I pair up with her. He will find another group. But I still feel bad and don‚Äôt want to ditch him for a girl I barely know. But he told me he didn‚Äôt care haha.

I use a fan for white noise, but it isn't very helpful. For the 3 weeks before they arrived, I couldn't hear any music or TV noises from the neighbors above me, but that all changed when these new neighbors moved in.

Several weeks ago there was an incident where I had my TV at full volume and still had to turn on the subtitles to hear everything being said. I frequently can't hear YouTube videos on my laptop when I'm doing homework so I have to use headphones.  A few weeks ago, my wireless headphones died and I went upstairs to ask them to turn it down while I was studying. The guy who answered the door (Tom) agreed, turned down the music, and then after 5 or 10 minutes, started playing his electric guitar at an even higher volume.

Last week I had finally had enough. I went upstairs to talk to Tom and brought a male friend with me for support because I live alone and don't know who these guys are. We had a less than friendly conversation where Tom kept telling us he needed his music that loud because he is a full-time music producer, even sarcastically asking us if we were telling him to give up his career. We asked if he could just keep it at a reasonable level and he replied that volume is subjective, and it really isn't loud to him so he considers it reasonable. Tom said I should blame the old building for the poor sound insulation, and it isn't his fault. 

We asked if he could use headphones and he said that would not be possible. We asked if he could play in a different room (I live in a studio and they have a 2 bedroom with rooms that aren't above my unit) and he said no and claimed that the other two neighbors in our multiplex don't have a problem with it so I'm being unreasonable, especially because he never plays music at night and ""part of living in a multiplex is being tolerant of your neighbors"". He said he would be happy to give me his phone number so I could text him if ""I'm doing something"" so he can wait til I'm done to play his music at his preferred volume but I declined because I'm very private about my phone number and I don't think it's fair to play music THAT LOUD at any time. 

He said he was just trying to compromise, but his idea of compromise was to agree on specific times where he could blast his music, instead of agreeing to turn it down. I told him he is welcome to crank it up as loud as he wants when my car is gone, but I don't think it's fair to request to regularly play music above the noise level of a TV. I was getting very irritated and wasn't coming across well by this point, so my friend stepped in, gave Tom his number and we did a 'sound test'. Tom played his music and asked if the volume was okay. It was loud enough that I could hear the lyrics clearly, but I said it would be fine. Then he turned it up more and asked if that was still okay. I said fine even though it was beyond what I consider polite because I didn't want to fight with him. He then said he would mark the volume knob at that level and turn down his amp so 'hopefully you don't hear it as loud.'

I didn't have any problems until yesterday, when the guitar amp was obnoxiously loud again, so I emailed the landlord. She responded that she had talked with him and he felt like I went behind his back because I should have talked to him, either in person or through my friend's phone. (Again, I'm a female living alone and have had issues with crazy guys in the past. I also hate confrontation and things had gotten heated last time). The landlord brought up herself that she told me before I moved in that she likes to rent to quiet neighbors.  She also said 'to be fair' it wasn't her fault because neither of the tenants listed a company or position that has anything to do with music production as their occupation on the application. She told me that I should maintain communication with Tom and do my best to cohabitate.

So, what is my next move if the loud music continues? Is this something I just have to deal with?

TLDR: I was promised a quiet environment when I moved in but one of the tenants who moved in above me says he is a music producer who needs to play his music very loudly every day. The landlord says I should communicate with him directly but I am a female living alone and don't feel comfortable confronting the two male neighbors on my own.",01Oct2020,1
671,"Howdy, I've been looking for work on and off, but haven't been getting calls back. Today I'm going to call a couple stores and ask for an interview. Some context, I'm 19 have no real work experience besides volunteer work like, food not bombs. How do I ace an interview? I have a couple of common questions somewhat figured out, I'd love some feedback. Thanks

Q- Tell me about yourself?

A-  Well I'm 19, I've have been looking for work on and off since February, I have no real work experience besides volunteering at homeless shelters and food banks for the past 2ish years, some of the qualities that I have are that I'm hard working, have empathy and compassion, loyal, able to adapt in different environments, and ready and willing to learn and grow.

Q- Tell me a time when you showed...( Hardwork as an example)

A- A time I showed hard work is when I decided I wanted to be more In the community and help others, I researched for hours on how to help the less unfortunate besides giving them my change, and found volunteer work, and when working as a volunteer I learned how to deal with people from all walks of life, I worked together with people I've never met to get tasks done, like cleaning, cooking, understanding the person's needs and working at different paces, and working for long hours.

Q- Why should we hire you?

A- while I may not have experience and references, like I said in the beginning I have a willingness to work and grow, and I can adapt to different environments, not only that but I'm also a consumer, I go to coffee shops, movie theaters,  I go shopping ect ect, and in that time I've learned what good costumer service is, now what that might be exactly, well to me good customer service is being inviting, having good body language, smiling, asking how you are, it's also being knowledgeable about where things are and products so much so that you can even give recommendations.


Q- have any more questions?

A- yes, what other responsibilities will I be doing besides what's are required of me? And after the interview, when can I expect a call back?

I'd love your feedback I know it's not everything in the interview but just big points that I've noticed. Also I have another question, I've been doing some research on aceing an interview and all have said that afterwords to send a nice email thanking them for giving you the time. Is this normal? Seems kinda weird to me",01Oct2020,1
673,"Hi all,

I'm a little bit concerned about an online friend of sorts, a 16 year old girl who follows a fanfiction Tumblr blog I run- I'm a 21 year old woman. Basically, she first messaged me asking if she could join a Discord server I managed for people/other writers in the fandom. Unfortunately, since she said she was 17, I told her the server was for 18 and overs due to the NSFW content and she seemed understanding.  The age of consent in my country is 16, but I'm still uncomfortable with having under 18s there. A few days later, I posted a story dealing with the topic of mental illness, and she reached out again and told me that it was good, and she could identify with it because of her own experiences with depression.

We generally messaged back and forth about the story/mental health, and she mentioned that she was also a writer- I checked out her blog and read one of her stories, and was absolutely blown away by the maturity of her writing voice, and the accuracy with which she portrayed the subject matter (a suicide attempt)- being someone who myself, has attempted suicide. I was very moved and quite emotional, so I made sure to tell her how excellent her writing was. I'm generally open about mental health and my past issues, so I mentioned that as a suicide attempt survivor, I was very touched by her writing- I made sure to place the focus on her writing and clarified that I was in better health nowadays- I didn't want to burden a 17 year old, but was also very blown away with the quality of her writing.

We kept speaking, just about writing and fandom stuff in general, and she shared a bit more about her mental health problems- I told her I was always there as a friendly ear to listen. Eventually she told me her birthday was in a few weeks and felt very anxious- of course I assumed she was turning 18, so I just told her not to worry and that she'd still be the same person. Here's the issue- she then told me that she was actually 16 and turning 17, and was very sorry to mislead me. I told her I was glad that she'd been honest, and that no real harm was done as she was almost 17 anyway, but I had wished she'd been truthful from the beginning as it's not really fair on me.

She was very apologetic, and said she was worried I wouldn't want to speak to her if she was 16- I basically just clarified that I was an adult and while I was comfortable talking to her about writing and topics I felt she was mature enough to deal with, there were obviously going to be boundaries (e.g. NSFW stuff, very heavy stuff that a 16 year old shouldn't have to deal with)- in other words, I just told her that while she was very intelligent and mature, there are things a 16 year old shouldn't have to deal with. She seemed understanding again.

Now, I just feel a bit anxious about the whole situation? Very often she gets passive aggressive with me about not letting her into my server, and sends me a lot of selfies- they're just general selfies of her hair etc. and I sent one back once when we were talking about our hair; I see our friendship as very sisterlike. I am however wary of the general view towards talking to minors online and am not keen to get too friendly. I'm always there to listen to her and advise her about things, but she's a very sensitive girl and if anything I probably wouldn't have even been so forthcoming about my mental health history if I'd known she was a year younger. She's turning 17 very soon but the whole situation is just starting to kind of make me uncomfortable... especially when she comments on parts of my stories that are a bit suggestive like ""damn u got me thirsting."" I don't post NSFW content but occasionally my stories contain suggestive themes/implications. Before, I assumed she was nearly 18 anyway so it didn't bother me as much but it's started growing on me in the past few days.

I made a separate SFW Discord chat for her so that she feels included, as she feels like we're sort of a clique of adults which I do certainly understand- but at this point it's literally all I can do, and it's starting to stress me out. I don't want to just completely ghost her because it'd be harsh, but I could just do with some input really.",01Oct2020,1

679,"So recently I‚Äôve started feeling guilty about dating my BF, I‚Äôve been with him for a year already (I was 16 and he was 15 when we started dating).

I think these feelings started when my best friend called me a nonce (UK slang word for pedophile) when I told her that I had sex with him for the first time a month after his 16th birthday, so February 2020. (16 is the legal age for consent in UK)

She criticised me for doing it so soon after his birthday. She said it so seriously and her face showed disgust but I don‚Äôt know if she was actually serious??. After that she was telling our other friends that I‚Äôm a nonce and it was really embarrassing.

Another time she called me a nonce was when I was messaging my BF a few minutes before class was ending, he told me that he got let out early. I said ‚Äòwooow you‚Äôre such a bad boy‚Äô in a sarcastic way. Then he said ‚Äòatleast I‚Äôm not a good girl like you nerd ; )‚Äô.

My best friend was looking over my shoulder without me knowing and seen those messages, then she told me that I was acting noncy and it was weird to talk like that to my BF. My other friend looked at the messages as well and wasn‚Äôt bothered by it? ( later I asked if it was noncy and she said no). I told her that it wasn‚Äôt noncy and she said it was.

For the rest of the day my best friend was being really moody and weird with me and our other friends.

Everyday she‚Äôs friendly and normal? 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a pedophile and I‚Äôm really scared, or if I‚Äôm acting inappropriately? Could it just be that she has different morals or something?

698,"So here's a summary of the backstory:

It's been my dream to move to a particular country, and over the past 2 years I've been working hard to make it a reality. I finally got a job offer this year but things got postponed due to covid. During this time I've been feeling a lot of anxiety, excitement, bitterness towards covid, and a bunch of other things. I've been trying to distract myself and keep occupied with hobbies and talking to friends online, but one feeling that never went away was loneliness. One thing I was looking forward to doing after moving was getting back into the dating world, so having to put that on hold was kind of rough. 

I've been patient, but it has since worn thin, so I tried going on dating apps. My intentions were clear-- nothing serious because I don't want anything potentially getting in the way of me moving. Anyways, after a while I finally matched with a great girl, and we hit it off really well. I reiterated my intentions early in our conversations, and we seemed to be on the same page. However, things are going a little too well to quickly, and the question came up about potentially becoming more than friends. I said that that wasn't possible because I really need to focus on moving and settling in to my new life first. I want to establish myself in my new life-- find my social circles, get into the rhythm of my work life, etc.-- and then invite someone into that life (a.k.a. start dating). I'm afraid if I don't do it this way, I'm going to center my life around my relationship and avoid doing hobbies, joining social circles, resent my busy work schedule, etc. Then as a result, I might start resenting HER for changing what I had in mind for my new life, and that's not good for anyone.

My options are:

1. Just end things completely because it's moving too fast.
2. Proceed but slow things down, make sure that our understanding of our relationship is clear (nothing long-term yet).
3. Take a chance and dive into a long-term relationship (if it appears to continue in that direction).

I'd like to choose option 2, but I don't want her to get hurt (if she develops feelings and I have to reject them). So maybe option 1 is the best thing to do. I've only JUST started talking with her, so it's very very early. It might've been better to just deal with the loneliness for a while longer than to potentially get involved with someone and possibly hurt them.

Any advice/thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",01Oct2020,1

I had a huge crush on my best friend during middle school, it got really bad and unhealthy for me. At the time, my hormones were going wild and emotions were amplified to a great degree. At the time I really felt like I loved her or something like that. 

We used to be in a fake relationship, even going so far to pretend in private messages and we would text for hours on end. It formed as sort of an escape from reality, she was saying all these things ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô, that sort of stuff, but in the end I knew it was fake, and talking to her a few years later, she admitted she thought of it as a joke.

It got so bad to the point I got confused with fiction and reality. Stuff like ‚ÄòIs what she‚Äôs saying true?‚Äô, ‚ÄòDoes she actually like me back?‚Äô

Eventually her dad found out and we separated from each other. I didn‚Äôt take it so well and I got really depressed to the point of suicide. (There were other factors at the time but this was the most major one)

Eventually I got better, I got therapy, got meds, and I generally became more positive about myself and everything. I reconciled with her and we talk a lot now.

I would say she‚Äôs the person I talk to the most, I‚Äôve actually got to know her better the past few years it‚Äôs always nice to talk to her.

My best friend just sent me a long text about how she feels tired of constantly text me every day because she doesn't want me to get lonely. and that its time she focuses on her life and that she cant be on her phone all the time and that doesn't even text her other friends every day so .....

Obvs I read that and I was like wtf ?? Whats with the rudeness can't you just say you have a few crazy weeks and wont be active. Why bring up my possible loneliness ( I have never told her I'm lonely btw) as a matter fact I am usually the happy friend whos reserved and shes been getting me to open up more these years which I have. So now it's you're being too talkative or whatever like woow.

Background info: we have been friends for several years and rn I'm currently abroad and firstly I never even tripped over late replies and didn't even before when I was in the states as well. I am very aware that everybody has their own lives and I just reply when people reply back to me.

Also, I usually hit her up or reply back during my afternoons which is her mornings. and I am wondering where this is all coming from and why is she making seem like I'm such an inconvenience or if I'm holding a gun to her head to be my friend or chat with me.

She mentioned my loneliness like she pities me and was hitting me up all this time because she felt bad. And it sucks because I did go through a rough 2019 and did open up to her about it the only one out of all my friends that I did actually. I feel like we're both taking in uni and dealing with our own lives continents apart so how can she just say that ngl it was hurtful. Like I am also confused as to when she started feeling this way. I know shes transferring schools and I am always letting her know I can help with her essays, applications, or anything. and it was just this week when I edited her papers and answered her questions.

How do you just get up and decide the person who was soo keen to helping you and pushing to prioritize your studies is taking up too much of your time. We literally text minutes daily damn my bad for taking up sooooo much time looooool like I myself am not busy. I guess the way I was raised I make time for my people but that must not be how it is these days.  lmao I don't know about this friendship thing, I am actually over the whole concept human beings are just weird.

Which kinda stings because my boyfriend asked for a manager position and was told no, despite excellent attendance and genuinely being one of the best workers there (especially with their high turnover rate.) 

My boyfriend doesn't want to go to the district manager about it, and his coworkers feel the same because his GM has worked their and known the DM since she was 15. I asked him why not go higher than the DM, and he said he's worried they won't care even though she's breaking rules, and that she'll cut his hours or make his work life bad. 

We have a 7 month old daughter, I work third shift 11pm to 7am and he works 4pm to 10pm. Or so he's supposed to. Thankfully I'm off on Thursdays, but they recently, without telling him, put him on 12pm to 9:30pm shifts. No discussion at all with him about it because one of his other coworkers decided he needed that day off. My boyfriend is afraid it'll get worse if he tells on his GM. He wants to quit but my job alone won't cover our and our daughter's expenses while he tries to find a new one.

Everyone working there is uncomfortable, but they're too afraid to say anything. Is there anything at all to help this situation without it backfiring somehow? It's causing him a lot of stress.",01Oct2020,2

706,"He told me a few months ago that he used to like me. I always felt that he liked me by the way he treated me. However, I just never told him how I felt about him because I was scared of losing the friendship and by the time he told me he used to like me, he's already interested in my friend. He didn't say directly he used to like me. He said it indirectly. I have known him for a few years now and he's one of the greatest friends I ever met.

He is now dating my friend who he never really met in person before and liked her by looking at her profile picture on Facebook. I took him out one time to an event at my school and my friend happened to be at the event too and he was with me the whole time and not even having a conversation with her or introducing himself to her. He never hanged out with her  in person. He just started texting her around the beginning of the year /: My friend **knew** I liked him, but she just went for him without considering my feelings and I have been sucking up these feelings since the start of January 2020. She broke up with her previous relationship and started becoming interested in him 2-3 weeks later. I think he's the 6th person she's been in a relationship with in a matter of one year. It's taking time for me to accept all of this happening. She told me she's not dating him, but I saw the text messages she sent him and it clearly shows that she wants to date him now.

708,"So I have pretty bad social anxiety and my social skills aren't great. I also don't have friends and a pretty lonely sad life in general lol

Recently I [25M] joined a dating app that doesn't use pictures. I met a very sweet girl [21] there. We talked a lot, sent long messages to eachother and eventually exchanged phone numbers and pictures.

So now we're still talking to eachother regularly and it seems like she puts effort into the conversation so that makes me happy, we've been talking like this for about 2 weeks now.

I just don't know where to go from here. Honestly, I know I have to ask her out and I realize that I have to take my chance. But I feel like I can't. She's such a sweet and happy person and I feel like she would be disgusted with my awkward ways and quietness if we met in person. I also don't have the greatest outlook on life, so I feel like I don't want to tarnish her happiness with my shitty life. I don't have anything to offer Anyway and I don't even know why she's still putting up with me to be honest, I just know she will be disappointed and weirded out, if I actually somehow managed to ask her out...

I know maybe this would be better in a dating advice sub, but I feel like this is more of a mental health issue than a dating issue if that makes sense?

I don't know, maybe this whole post doesn't make any sense

709,"A little context-

I have worked less on this project, I agree. But I have the same group for other subjects as well. And I am weak/not as interested in this particular subject. So, I cut a deal with them, saying that I will do all the projects/assignments of another subject ALONE (and I did, though 1 group member helped me in one of the assignments) if they take the load off of me for this particular subject.

Fast forward, the workings of the final reports were completed by the other group members. They asked me to make the word doc for it. At first, I refused, but because they all had to leave college (on a trip/vacation) on the night when exams ended, I had to do it myself. I created the report as per their suggestions and sent it to them before leaving for my home. (I have a record of this)

A couple of days later, they message me saying that they had seen the report of one other group, and that group had done ""something extra"", and wanted me to do it as well. I refused. I was with my family after a long time and did not want to waste time on this as it would barely affect the final marks by maybe just 1 or 2 marks. Also, they were in a resort having fun swimming and stuff, enjoying themselves- that's the reason they gave me for ""not being able to do it themselves"". I refused saying that even I want to enjoy my time with my family, and they can do the ""improvements"" themselves if they want it desperately, or submit it as it is.

The guy who finally submitted the doc to the prof via mail also sent another mail saying that I did not help in the project AT ALL. I was not marked in this mail, and had no idea about this. The prof called me today to confirm this, and gave me time to sort it out with the team. What should I do now?",01Oct2020,1

711,"Hi, obligatory ""on-mobile"". Long time lurker here.

I have depression. I suspect that it's seasonal, except I feel most at peace during the fall, and some of winter. The weather where I live has started changing, and I am starting to feel a little better, and excited for fall. 

I have made a sort of... Agreement, with myself. October is going to be my self-improvement month, since I actually feel like I might have the energy and motivation to do so. I have agreed that I will not eat sweets this month, I will drink water, remember my meds, remember to take care of myself physically, and not randomly spend money on things I don't need (which is a bad habit of mine).  I know all of this is going to be extremely difficult, but I'm asking my boyfriend to keep me on it.

The depression makes it so that I often have no energy to do basic necessities, such as washing my hair or shaving when I need to. I usually have zero motivation or energy to do these, especially at the end of a long day. I'm hoping I can do better this month. And that's where you guys come in.

I need app recommendations that's like a To-Do app, but I'd really like to put a widget of it on my home screen, or at least have it stay in my taskbar. My biggest issue with the ToDo apps is just... Ignoring them. Or forgetting them. I basically want one where I can see my tasks without having to remember to open the app. I know that sounds stupid, but I hope there's one out there that has what I need.

Do any of you have any app recommendations?",01Oct2020,1
712,"As the title states, I accepted a job that I thought would be good for me and my family. A day later, I received emails about two different positions my dream job will be hiring for (I already interviewed for them and they will be pulling off of the list for a final interview or to hire.) This is the furthest I have made it in their process before.

 My issue is the job I accepted will require me to be gone for days at a time, sometimes up to 30. I can't just call out or get covereage as this is a fire job and you can't just leave in the middle of work, especially to interview somewhere else. I am afraid of the risk of missing out on this huge opportunity. I feel it would be less of a burden to let the new job know my decision now as opposed to later when time and money has been spent on me.

I am currently employed and do not hate my job. I make good money and enjoy my co workers. My only issue with my current position is there isn't much more room for growth, hence my accepting of the new position. No contract has been signed and no training or money has been spent on me up to this point by the new job. I do have some pressure from a family member who thinks I should just keep the new job. They already went and bragged to numerous extended family about my new job even though I myself have not made any announcements.

I'm pretty stressed about this whole thing. I know it's good to have these opportunities at my door but I do not want to look bad or make the wrong choice. Any input is appreciated.",01Oct2020,1

We met up one day to hang and they came along.

719,"My husband suffered from a pretty severe knee injury 2 years ago on the job. It put him out of work and he was put under the knife 3 times to fix the issue.

Now, I on the other hand ended up going from 40hrs a week as an RN to over 70 hours a week because I had to pick up a second job to afford living expenses and his medical bills. During this time his depression peaked from feeling lousy and like he was a terrible husband due to being unable to work. I never held it against him but he was just depressed regardless. His depression leads to lavishly spending money as if it is dispensable. Given that I was so overworked and exhausted 24/7, I didnt have the energy to tell him that he was spending too much all but twice throughout the ordeal. Both of which ended with him feeling even shittier about himself and me feeling like garbage for mentioning it. After all, as his wife, I felt responsible or obligated to make him as happy as possible and this made him happy. He did nothing for or with me during this time due to his depression. All he did was lounge around. Never made dinner. Never cleaned. Though he was home 24/7.

A month ago he was cleared to go back to work. He instantly started searching and within a week was offered a job in a warehouse building sheds. This job is 10x better than his last and thankfully I was able to go back to 40hrs a week. 

Well, life has a way of defying us and I lost my job due to the company relocating and me being unable to make the hour and a half commute to work. I have been searching for other employment and thankfully was able to get unemployment. Despite this, my husband now acts very entitled. As I said above, I never (all but twice) mentioned his spending habits when he was unemployed. However, whenever I buy anything I immediately get 21 questions of how much the item was or why I needed it. He also expects dinner to be on the table when he gets home and if it is not, he becomes frustrated. And to top it off.. this may be petty of me.. but every single night he wants me to rub his back and wait on him. He will sit on the couch and ask me to grab him miscellaneous items throughout the night until he finally goes to sleep. 

I brought this up to him and he says that he hasnt done anything differently than he was before and that i simply am feeling the same way he did whilst he was unemployed. Just lousy and depressed and its causing me to overthink. But the thing is, he literally did nothing for me while I was working 70+ hours. I mean, most nights I had to come home after a double and make my own food because he couldnt be bothered or i had to come home and dote on our small children's every need and desire because he checked out after I arrived home.

720,"I was sexually assaulted in April while looking for apartments. I'm a man. 

Initially, I thought I could just resume normal life and work through it in my own time, but I work a very stressful job, and don't have a lot of free time because of the schedule I'm forced into. 

I had a breakdown and ended up trying to kill myself. I went to ER, and the mental health professional there told me it would be best to take a LoA from work to sort this out. 

I tried that, and was referred to a group therapy for people who have been sexually assaulted. Little did I know, this group was not just men or just women.  It was mixed, but I was the only man. Multiple women took issue with this, and I was asked to leave. I tried finding a group for men, but found that none of them in my area had participants, so I decided to go to individual therapy. 
In individual therapy, I didn't mention that I was assaulted. I talked about depression, and isolation, and found that I wasn't ready to talk about it. 

I went back to work after four weeks, and after two weeks, had another episode. I had a panic attack that I couldn't control, and I ended up breaking down in my car. I couldn't move, couldn't stop crying, couldn't acknowledge anyone, and couldn't think clearly. I felt like I was shrinking into nothing. 

After my doctor and psychologist talked, they recommended I take another six weeks, go home to my family, and see a therapist that specifically deals with patients who have been sexually assaulted.

I didn't want to do this, but I knew that I could t continue to do my job like this. I'd be a wreck and end up ruining my opportunities there, and possibly endangering the people I help as a function of my job. 

What I need advice for is telling my Fiance√©. 
I don't know how to tell her that I was assaulted. I don't want to tell her. Our relationship has been the only thing that has stayed the same through this, and I've selfishly used that as an anchor in my life, when I should be using it as a way to heal. She deserves to know, but I'm scared she won't understand, or won't want to touch me or be with me anymore. 
Her family is very religious and very overbearing, and if they learn about this, they'll pressure her to break our engagement because I've technically had sex before marriage now.  
I am also afraid that she'll judge me. Say that men can't be sexually assaulted, and so on. I've heard that  multiple times already and Ive barely told anyone.

The other problem is that I've been lying to her for so long about this, that I'm afraid coming out about it will cause a rift in our relationship because she will see it as a violation of trust. Which it is, but it's also much more than that. It's fear, and confusion, and anger, and an inability to think clearly about what's happened to me. 

I wish this has never happened. I wish I could go back to April and never accept that offer to look at subletting that place. I wish I could get over this without so much drama.",01Oct2020,1

The reason I was always so anxious was because of my boss and even some of my colleagues. I‚Äôm not gonna go in to depth of that right now but it eventually calmed down after the pandemic.

750,"I am 30 years old and I have a boyfriend who is 36. We've been together for 7 years. 
He has a son from a previous relationship and I treat him like he's my own.
When I found out I was pregnant with my first child we were ecstatic, we bought a house and everything was good. Then on my son's first birthday, I found out I was pregnant again.

I was less than thrilled, but still excited and after a lot of talks we decided to keep the baby. I look at her little face and I don't regret it for a minute.

After my daughter, I got on birth control (pill) and have taken it religiously ever since, so I have no idea how this happened.
Am I really that .1%?

So I now have a 2 year old and a 10 month old.
I was late on my period and yesterday I took a pregnancy test confirming that I am pregnant.

I am terrified. We live in a small house that we barely fit in now, and we still owe so much on it. We live in a very expensive area (Bay Area, California) and even though we both make decent money, I would still consider us lower-middle-class.
How am I supposed to afford another child?

On the other hand, I don't think that I could put myself through the alternative (abortion/adoption). I imagine I'd think about my unborn child often and wonder if I did the right thing.
And how would my children feel if they knew they could've had another little sibling?
And I have always wanted 3 children. I just wanted to wait until my youngest was out of diapers.

Childcare, cribs, clothing, formula etc... everything seems like it'd be so much on my already full plate.

Not to mention trying not to neglect my other 2 babies. I may not be able to give them a lot financially, but I want to help them grow and be as attentive as I can to their needs. ¬†

758,"So I (33f) always imagined my relationship with my mom would be closer but we pretty much never talk. Its been 5 weeks since our last discussion. 

First off, my mom is a bit of a Karen. She isnt horrifically bad, her mom was Giga-Karen Maximus, but my mom (and I) clearly have the Karen-DNA. My mom, for example, always winds up talking to the manager when we go out. It isnt always negative and she doesn't always have a complaint, the manager somehow just winds up at our table doing pre-emptive damage control. 

The worst she ever did was move to Florida 7 years ago because neither my brother or I would beg her to stay. She originally said it was for the warm weather helping her joint pain, but last year she admitted she would have stayed if we made a big deal about it. 

Now, anyone who grew up with a Karen parent will recognize this. When my mom is upset she will start needling the subject of her discontent. Like a phlebotomist who can't find the vein, she will use that metaphorical needle to kind of dig around until she gets what she wants.

I, on the other hand, have really bad anxiety when it comes to phones, and my mom refuses to use text messages. If im having a depressive day and don't call her or don't get to the phone, she will give me the silent treatment until I call her again and berate me for not caring enough to call.

Admittedly, for a year after my wedding, I was avoiding her (her Karen gauge hit a 7 on my wedding plans), but that was before she moved. Anyway.

I know she won't cave in until I call her and that when I get over my own cowardice and call she will berate me for abandoning her. I also know that her passive aggressive sniping can persist for months even if I call every day. The result is that every night I lay awake wanting to hear from my mom but I never call, and I'm horrified by the state she will be in once the silence is broken.",01Oct2020,1

It feels like I'm going to explode sometimes, because of all the sexual tension I have built up. I struggle sleeping next to her as well, as I get aroused. It's become a real challenge for me.

760,"I used to get on very well with my cousin when we were kids. I'm a couple of years older than him, so we were like brothers. Also, We used to hang out a lot when we were teenagers.

One day there was a very serious quarrel between my father and Aunt (My cousin's mother). When I needed my cousin most to help me out to resolve peacefully the family problem, He refused and in addition, he sent me some very rude and unkind texts, which I never replied, that I will never forget.

Time went on, and after 5 years there was a reconciliation between our parents. Last Christmas we saw each other for the first time in nearly 6 years.

That Christmas night I talked to him a little just because I always try to be polite with everyone no matter who I'm talking to. Moreover, my granny had been very sad when we were all angry at each other, so I agreed to go to the dinner and act as if nothing happened just for her and my father.

When were about to end the dinner I hadn't the courage to refuse to share my phone with my cousin. He told me he would like to have some beers with me some day and I agreed because I didn't think he was going to do that.

Well, Today he has just sent me a couple of texts asking me how I'm doing and if I'd like to have some beers with him.

As I said, I can be polite to everyone but if someone betrays me, I cannot trust that person again.

I don't mind talking to him in a family dinner to make my granny happy again but having a beer as if we were friends again is too much. Even if he wants to hang out with me, so we can be friends again is something that I definitively won't do.

781,"OK I am going to preface this as saying im not trying to be edgy or cool. I have never told this sort of stuff to any one. I just want genuine advice on how I can deal with this shit, and if anyone has experienced anything similar. I dont want to be like this.

So I am a 22 year old female. I am quite liked, normal looking, and am soon graduating from a prestigious professional school. I have Bipolar type 1 that is well manages, and see a psychiatrist regularly. Ever since being a kid, I felt like I wasn't quite right so I just want to explain some of my issues and see if anyone relates to them (using a throw away for obvious reasons).

Flashback being in the Mcdonalds play centre- I see some kids walk in and I fantasize about torturing them and I feel turned on (I was maybe 7 years old, and I didnt know i was turned on but I had a tingly feeling down there). Things like this wasnt abnormal to me, however I knew it was bad so I never acted on it or mentioned it to any one.

I started masterbating at the age of 9, started watching porn at 11, started watching ""non consent porn"" at 12.

I had a love for horror movies as a young teen (normal), however some of these movies looking back are movies that I should have definitely not be watching at that age (Last house on the Left, I spit on your grave,120 days of sodom, Martyrs, human centipede, hostel- movies that had heavy rape and torture seasons). I fantasized to these movies, masterbated to these movies, and became almost obsessed with certain scenes. I have the feeling of being turned on by true rape victims (which is disgusting I know), and things like the tape from the ""Toy Box killer).

Intrusive thoughts of hurting myself and others has always been a norm for me. Hitting, slapping, breaking bones. Ever since I was young kid. I see visions of me snapping my fingers off, jumping out of moving cars, moving the steering wheel while in the passenger seat while a friend is driving on the high way. I fantasize about killing myself all the time as well. I fantasize about being raped, and hurting others as well.

I feel extremely self aware, and aware of peoples actions. I feel like I can manipulate people but I dont as I feel I have morals. However, sometimes I catch myself ""tricking people"", randomly lying, or attempting to control people I care for. I rarely do this though. But I feel as though I have this ability to harm people emotionally if I wanted to. I feel like I can seduce people for my own gain, and more or less fuck with people. I have done this in relationships, and can act in a way to cause them to ""fall in love with me"" but my feelings rarely mutual (I do really care for people though) and I have always ended my relationships. I currently have a boyfriend who is a VERY VERY nice guy and i am trying hard not to do this shit, but patterns sometimes happen before I realize soon enough to catch them.

I love BDSM (however this is more normal), I love non consent, blood play, knife play, and I want to do more but many of my partners are hesitant.

My friends see me as liking cliche spooky things, but I keep the fucked up stuff to myself. I have never told this sort of stuff to anyone, as it would obviously limit and harm my relationships. However, I have this feeling of not being satisfied in life. I want the feeling of intensity of the things I have mentioned. BUT I dont want to be like this, I feel guilty, I feel gross, and I want to suppress it. I feel like I am a fraud. I feel like people see me as this pretty young lady who is nice, but I more or less feel pretty much like a terrible person. I dont know how to go about changing?

783,"To start off, I'm Male. I live with my parents and sister, and I'd say we're an average family. 2 dogs, seemingly happy parents. Thing is, I'm depressed and anxious every single day. 

School is dragging me away from the only thing I love. My sister's been drugged, cuts herself, and I've watched them pick up a pair of scissors and almost stab their neck in their sleep. I haven't moved on from my first dog, who died 3 years ago while we had our second dog. We got our third in December.

I feel like I have no talents, since I have no motivation, skills, or anything that might make my life worth living. 
I had a falling out with the only friends I had about a month ago. One of those friends tried to commit suicide in January. I've only talked to one of them since.
I'm scared of growing up. When I was in third grade I wanted to grow up. Ever since then I've been depressed just thinking about growing up and how I want everything back to how it was in kindergarten. Responsibilities, a job, taxes, bills, the urge to start a family, free time, not having enough money, everything.

The world is crashing and burning. Covid, America's shit ass manchild president, racism, police brutality, homophobia, transphobia, general assholes, and religion.
I'm also pansexual atheist, and I live in Texas (which isn't too big on either!).

Honestly I just need help. I want to be a game developer but it's too hard. Everything's too hard.
I don't like working. Every ounce I have to work feels like a gallon. I procrastinate. Right now I should be working on school.

I used to be called ""gifted"" in school, and now I'm just some rando in advanced classes. Being gifted was my personality. It was me. 

Nobody at my school likes me. I had to move away from my hometown, where I had friends, and now I'm stuck being the lonely kid who gets mocked for being annoying. Quite frankly, there are less than 20 students who's faces I don't want to bash in. They're the ones who don't scream, shout, and swear at the teachers to be cool.

800,"I'm in my first year of university this year and I was super excited to make new friends, in high school I had been bullied, so I was happy to expand my friendship groups. I met a great group of girls, two new friends and one from my high school we all started hanging out and it was super fun. However, several weeks later I expressed my support for blm movement, one of them disagreed claiming that she was oppressed for being white. This upset me greatly, and ended with me crying. Eventually, we all sorted it out and we returned to campus for university, however over the coming few weeks my friends would continue to make remarks such as ""curry just smells so bad I don't know why people eat it"" and always diminishing my experiences and laughing when someone called me a terrorist. Whenever I called them out they would dismiss it or there would be an awkward silence. Two of them revealed they were voting for a conservative party which I didn't mind but every conversation was about how great this party was even when the part policy expressed harmful views about my race, and eventually I just went silent over it.

Weeks later a similar thing happened on a twitter group chat with other friends, I grew tired of this behaviour and on my twitter account I made a couple of tweets about my online friends saying things like ""I wish my friends weren't problematic"" and ""I hate how racist my friends are"" At the time I was incredibly frustrated, and I wanted to vent on twitter, while it directly wasn't about my IRL friends it definitely applied to them.

However, my IRL friends on my birthday they all turned up an hour late without apologies and seem disinterested the whole time, so eventually I just told them I felt sick and they needed to leave. This then flared up when I said I felt left out and they claimed they weren't leaving me out. I ended up apologising to all of them, two weeks later I receive a message on our group chat of screenshots of my tweets, while the tweets were not directly about them they insisted that they were. I told them that they tweets weren't about them, however they're insisting that they are about them. I can see the misunderstanding but they refuse to pick up my calls or listen to my side saying they're really hurt about the tweets, despite it not being about them with one claiming she ""saw my side before but i'm patronising her now"", I said I can't convince her to believe me, all I can do is say my truth and then I left the group chat.

I'm not sure how to feel, my best friend said it was the best thing to do to drop them, but I can't help feeling sad over loosing friends over this. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? and how to get over a friendship breakup?",01Oct2020,1
801,"Dear Reader,

I find myself in a tough spot. Like many I imagine. I'm currently in my last year of university having been there for 4 years with one more to go. I switched course to a slightly different less demanding course and had to repeat a year. As the last year is coming at me, I'm wondering what I'm going to do after I finish university. The degree I'm studying is not necessarily what I'm passionate about and has been a drag for the 4 years I have been at uni and will be drag this year. I'm not massively happy with it. I choose the degree based on what I liked the most at school.  But since I was young I have been told by teachers and parents that I have to go to uni to have a good life. My dad would go on about how you would be stupid not to have a degree as people with degrees make more money than people without a degree and such.  At every step it has been reinforced to me that you have to go to uni to be successful and I feel like I have been kind of forced into it. Never was I told about other options or that fact that you dont have to go to uni. Since being at uni I feel like its a bit of a scam. I pay so much and spend so much time to learn something that I could have learnt at home for significantly less. (I do see the value in it for when you want to become a doctor or lawyer or engineer, where the training is mandatory but for my field of study I do not feel like it is necessary)

I struggle finding things I am passionate about.  I make music in my spare time and love doing that. Ive been doing it for about 2 years now and have almost completely replaced my previous favourite pastime of gaming with it. I even released an EP recently just to prove to myself I could do it (it hasn't gone anywhere yet but it was more to prove to myself). I'm not the best at music production, but I do take the time to learn. Other than music production and playing the guitar occasionally I dont really have anything that I'm massively passionate about. I work out and swim but mostly just to keep fit and skateboard with my friends.

After holding it in for years I told my mum I dont know where I'm going and I dont know what I want to do.  I think I had known it for a while but I said to myself that this was the way it had to be. That I had to persevere through university and get a job at the end like my parents wanted for me (I'm not blaming them, I understand they just want to to give me the best shot). She understood and has tasked me with writing down what I am passionate about and what I want to do with my life. I'm passionate about my music production obviously, but it seems to have been ingrained into me by my dad that creative people dont make money and live poorly. I am aware of this, however it isnt so easy to get out things that have been ingrained into your brain from a young age. Other than music theres nothing else I can really say I'm passionate about and excited to do.

So I guess what I'm asking is how do I find out what I want to do? And maybe explore other options, I like making music but I'm aware that the music business is very competitive and I'm not sure I'm built for it. Other than that I have no idea where to start looking. How do you create a purpose or an end goal for what you would like to achieve?

I appreciate your time dear reader,

SB

TLDR; Your boi goes to uni and makes music. hes doesnt really like uni but felt like he had to go and he does like making music. admitted to himself and mum that he doesnt know where he is going and doesnt know what he wants to do. How find passions, purpose and direction in life?

Going to this university would be a dream come true, so I am trying to see if it would be possible to go there regardless of whether or not I get the grants I'm applying for. That would entail getting a part time job during my master's studies, so here are my questions:

1. With a part time job, will I be able to make enough money to support myself? I cannot get a full time job, because I would be getting a student visa, which does not allow full time jobs.

2. It seems like I need to show I can pay for everything before I go there, but if my plan for paying is getting a job, I can't do that. Is there anything I can do about this?

817,"Both of us live in South East Asia. Things are different down here. Most of them go through arranged marriage, just like how we did. Although, love marriages are not out of the norm, but very few of them go through that route.

Anyways, 5 years ago my parents setup a meeting with my future husband.

When we met, we instantly knew that we weren't compatible. We both had different goals in life. We both had a different thought process. We had little to nothing in common. We had a different way of living life.

So both of us told our parents about the outcome of the meeting, but they brushed it away saying everything will fall into place once we get married.

They literally forced us to get married, and both of us couldn't go against our parents because they would feel that we were disrespecting them. So, we got married.

That being said, first 3 years of marriage was beautiful. We understood each other, and we were pretty much happy with the outcome of the marriage which we both were against.

We also had a baby, and soon after that everything started to fall apart. He would spend most of the time at work. He would leave in the morning, and come home at night. I was home alone for months caring for the baby along with a nanny. He was emotionally detached. He was not the same person he once was. He would get irritated at small things. Every night when he comes home, we both get into a verbal fight where he asks me to end this marriage if I don't like it anymore. He was unavailable at best. He had no emotions whatsoever. I didn't matter to him anymore. He had severe anger management issues.

I hoped he would at least spend time with me and the baby on the weekends, but he figured his friends were more important to him than family.

I then tried to get our parents to straighten him out. He blamed everybody but himself.

He was falling apart, so was our marriage. I tried to save our marriage by asking him to attend therapy along with me, but he wouldn't.

He wouldn't tell me what his problem was. All I wanted him to do was be a good husband and a good father to our baby, was it too much to ask? He would work away till late midnight managing his dad's business which he hated. I thought maybe his work is messing with him, so I tried to get him to hand over the chair to his younger brother, but he wouldn't.

I couldn't handle it anymore, so I talked to my parents about ending our marriage, and my parents were very disappointed, but I made my decision. I told them this was their fault.

My parents said not to end the marriage, but wait until they talk to his parents and see if the marriage can be saved. As far as I am concerned, our marriage is done.

In our country everybody would look down on single mothers, and my parents are more worried about that. They are worried about the family image.

I am currently living with my parents until everything gets sorted out, while he is spending time with the baby at his parents.

Wake up - Work - Home - Workout - Video Games - Sleep. &lt;- This is me. Nothing else happens to me.

Gotta job that pays well. It's 9-5 job but not typical. No cubicles. No strict schedule. Bosses are very friendly. Work itself improves my skills but it's not always interesting. It feels like everything is going smoothly and ""Normally"". 

Soon, I'll be able to get a loan to buy a house and move out from my parents house(Where I come from, living with your parents in your 20s is a normal thing for cultural and financial reasons).

\- Finished University.

\- Got a job.

\- About to get a house

It took me four years to get a two year associates degree because I kept failing the math classes they gave me, even the special ed ones. After I graduated, I was 21 and started job hunting. Not in my preferred field (history), but I just needed something simple that paid. Two years later, I still have never been employed by anyone, anywhere. It‚Äôs mainly because I have no ability to operate a cash register, but lately I‚Äôve been getting a new reason for rejections. I applied to a food service job at a local mall, and during the interview the man asked me why I didn‚Äôt list any prior employment. He seemed incredulous when I told him that there was nothing to list. He ended the interview right there and said ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve never had any kind of job before 23, you‚Äôre just screwed.

I like my studies, I like the career it‚Äôs pushing me towards, I love my friends, I like my part-time job. But I feel kind of low-level restless a lot of the time. Part of that is COVID, I‚Äôm sure- I see people less than I did; the two hobbies I loved are impossible under social distancing restrictions; lectures will be mostly online, parties are obviously off the table. During lockdown in my parents‚Äô house I built a solid routine, and every day had a definite structure. That‚Äôs harder here. We don‚Äôt eat communally, which throws me a little- in my parents‚Äô house we all ate together and watched TV and talked at the end of every day, which was helpful. I ran every day there, too, but I sustained a foot injury shortly after I moved in with my friends, so I lost that. When I was living at home I was trying to lose weight, and there were no snacks in the house; there are here, and now I‚Äôm scared about gaining weight. How do you maintain a routine every day when the people around you aren‚Äôt? Is there anyone here who maintains a sense of steadiness and variety without routine?

With that money I could easily buy a fairly decent phone and still have money left over to at least pay for part of the phone bill.

843,"Started off in Accounting. Service manager came up to me a month ago and stated there was an open position as a BDC manager, I said yes. I asked about pay and it was $3 more so I accepted. 


It‚Äôs by far the worst decision I‚Äôve made at a company. 


I was advised my office would be ready September 14th and they haven‚Äôt done ANYTHING to it so I‚Äôve been sitting in a cube next to the service advisors. I wanted to show them I was hungry for success and they‚Äôve been abusing that. 


I‚Äôve been playing receptionist for all the advisors because the receptionist is off having conversations that have nothing to do with work and the advisors NEVER want to answer the phone when their customers are calling for status updates on their vehicles. There have been a number of times where the repair orders aren‚Äôt clocked in by the techs because the advisors aren‚Äôt giving them the work. So what am I doing? I‚Äôm doing their job... I‚Äôm running back to the shop inquiring about the repair orders and demanding answers so the customers have that peace of mind. 


Two weeks ago I began working on my service advisor certifications so I can be a service advisor and start taking care of the customers. I had spent COUNTLESS of hours on those courses because I knew they were short of advisors and then they hired some lazy bitch that half asses her job and quit the last time she was there. I was hurt. I was hurt because they had acknowledged I was out performing a few people there but I was overlooked. 


Well, the service advisor approached me last week and stated that he wants me to be a floater... be a ‚Äúfiller‚Äù for absent advisors. I will also be doing warranty, pre-approvals, and I‚Äôll also be playing receptionist. He stated I‚Äôll now be working every Saturday. He didn‚Äôt talk much about pay... he just said I‚Äôll go from hourly to salary.   

That place is a shit show. There‚Äôs no communication and it‚Äôs very unorganized. They had a truck that had been there for a year and hadn‚Äôt been touched! They forgot the truck was there! If it hadn‚Äôt been for the customer calling it still would have been sitting in the lot.

846,"So my friend group is weird. We say a lot of things that, when taken out of context, can look pretty bad for us. My friend, let's call him A (not his real initial) has done some really bad stuff, some of which is illegal (unfortunately we don't have the proof anymore, it sits in countless of deleted Telegram accounts and unrecorded Discord conversations) and the other stuff is just creepy. A told one of my friends and I about this stuff separately and one day we just kind of told eachother about everything that the other person didn't know and then we told 2 of our other friends, and then 2 more and now only 1 other friend doesn't know because he is dating A's best friend and we're afraid he might say something accidentally.  All of us who know want nothing to do with A anymore, and we would completely disassociate with him, but there's a problem: A might blackmail us. We all go to a pretty conservative Christian school. A few people in the friend group belong to certain minority groups that would most likely cause them to be bullied a lot if word got around about it, or even lead to their expulsion from the school. Another thing is, like I mentioned before, our Whatsapp group chat has stuff that might look bad out of context and A has access to all of those messages. We can't delete the messages since Whatsapp only allows you to delete messages for yourself if they are older than 2 hours, but you can delete it for everyone until 2 hours after you sent it. A is moving away at the end of the year to a town far away enough that he won't be able to visit us weekly but not too far away so he might be able to visit sometimes, but he'll still have contacts in the school and will still talk to us on Whatsapp and sometimes Discord. We are afraid that he'll release the information and screenshots he has if we disassociate from him, but we don't want to still be friends with him. We tried discussing it and the best plan we came up with is to pretend to still like him until we eventually naturally lose contact, but that will take too long for our liking and there's a chance he would still release the information.

I want to say before I start my story, that I don't want advice like ""get a new hobby, find a therapist, go to a doctor"" the common stuff, trust me. I have tried and I am still trying all of those. I need something  else, something, I don't even know what is.  


I am Emi, or Emily. A 19 year old trans girl from Norway. And to start off, we need to go back a little.  
When I was 1 year old, my mother adopted me away, and I got put into a foster home, with two foster parents, I grew up in a strict, but okay home. Even though I was forced into Christianity while I was there.  


Once I hit the age of 16, I was going to high school, and it all collapsed. I had been feeling left out and lonely for years, even in the foster family, and the church community. And finally, it all tumbeled over. In the span of one week. I went from studying and living with people I knew. To living in an orphanage, with nothing to do but sit all day. And although it was tough, I got through it, and finally moved out by myself, where I got put on a kind of state helped thing, where I get 300$ a month to live for, in trade for talking to a state sent person about how I am once a week.  


It went okay for a while too, I got myself out there, made some friends, had a few failed attempts at love. And even started going to job interviews.  


But then the start of this year came around, the year which just seemed to pull me under. In February, all of my friends ghosted me, and I haven't been able to contact them since. In June, I got thrown out of the apartment for not putting a cigarette out properly and making a smoke alarm go off when I left my door open. After I got kicked out I moved in with my uncle, where I do nothing but sit around, apply for jobs, and try to get out there and talk to people, with no luck on any of them. I have put in about 2500 hours since I got kicked out to get a job and some friends. But I just can't do it anymore.   


Everything I thought was going well, collapsed on me, I no longer feel like I should be alive. But worst of all, I feel invisible. The only person I ever get to talk to anymore, is my uncle. I say bye when he leaves for work at 4:30am. And hi when he comes home from work and hanging out at 9pm.

859,"So this might be a bit long but I need advice, even though I have a good idea of what I should probably do, but I‚Äôm hoping someone will have gone through something similar.

So there‚Äôs this guy. We met freshman year of college because we had a class together, although we never really talked in class. Next semester we ran into each other while waiting for the bus, and we chatted a bit, exchanged info, all that, because he seemed nice and I was curious because most people don‚Äôt remember some random girl they had one class with and never spoke to. To be honest, if he hadn‚Äôt spoken to me first, I probably wouldn‚Äôt even have remembered we‚Äôd had class together.

We hung out a few times, texted back and forth, got to know each other... and it was fun, we had a lot in common, and it felt great to have made a friend. I thought that‚Äôs why he wanted to be around me, because it was fun.

You can probably guess what happened: he had feelings for me that I didn‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt) return. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, and I told him I just wanted to be his friend. It was awkward, and humiliating, probably for both of us, but I mostly felt like (again) that someone I‚Äôd thought was a good friend was only interested in me as long as he thought I might date him. He dropped me off and home, and we stopped hanging out, and I thought that was that.

A year or so went by, and he reached out to me again. He‚Äôd moved away to another state, and said he missed being my friend. And like an idiot I believed that he meant it. I was at the time in a relationship, and was happy to reconnect with a friend I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd lost.

Nope. A few weeks went by, and then he started telling me about how he was thinking about moving back BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE WITH ME. For fucks sake! Nope nope nope nope nope. How creepy, I‚Äôm in a fucking relationship, and you‚Äôre hitting on me! I told you before that I was. Not. Interested!

I told him I was with somebody, and he backed off and stopped texting me. Geeze, typical.

Another year goes by, I‚Äôm out of my previous relationship, guess who texts me? This time I just ignore him, because I‚Äôm not falling for that bullshit again.

He messaged me again the next year. And the next. I block his number. He finds my IG account, follows me, and messages me on there. Block. Facebook, message, ignore. Every time I think he‚Äôs finally gotten the message and figured out that even if he tells me he just wants to be my friend I‚Äôm just too creeped out by the constant cyber stalking, bam, I get another message.

The only thing that seemed to work was when I was in a relationship. Fucking gross, only backing off when I ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to someone else. My ex-girlfriend told me that I should just tell him that we‚Äôre still together because she‚Äôs seen how much it creeps me out when he finds another way to contact me.

I‚Äôm actually seeing someone right now who is nice and considerate and gives me space, so I don‚Äôt have to pretend to be with my ex at least but he just freakin messaged me AGAIN. I‚Äôm so sick of this, I don‚Äôt WANT to be even friends with him but he keeps reaching out, wanting to rekindle our ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù, and I just know he‚Äôs got it in his head that maybe I‚Äôll be more and I WONT. I. Am. Not. Interested. GET. THE. FUCKING. MESSAGE.

Any advice?",01Oct2020,1

861,"So I was texting my boyfriend yesterday. We haven't been able to talk on the phone much since covid started but we text every day. My love language is skinship and not being able to touch him and him being busy with school work and before that with family is making me feel less important I think, so I've been trying to deal with that by myself since it isn't his fault. But sometimes he does things that make me feel like it isn't my fault that I feel less important. I'm particularly disappointed about yesterday. What happened was:

He hasn't been able to text me well in three days because he's been busy with homework and for 3 nights off and on he pulled all nighters and slept ALL day or did homework all day and didn't respond to me at all except to open my messages once in a while. 
That in itself is annoying but I've kind of gotten used to it and I understand that he is busy too.

But yesterday he said he was finally almost done with his work and he had some time to text me. He said he had an assignment that wasn't loading last night and had to stay up to wait for it to load so he played games with his friend all night. I was kind of upset because I wish he had texted me instead since I'm usually up really late and he hadn't texted me back all day yesterday. But I let it go I guess since we were talking now and it felt kind of petty. So then we talked about the game he was playing and I was happy he was so into something and I said I'd love to see him play. He said we should play it together! I was so excited! But I had homework and zoom classes all day and didn't have time to download steam or look for it, etc. So we texted about it during my classes and I was getting really pumped. The main thing was that in this game YOU CAN TALK TO THEM IN IT!!!! :D  Backstory: He never answers my calls. We've been going out for about 8 almost 9 months officially and he's probably only answered like 3 of my calls. He also doesn't call me often since covid started. Before covid when I lived 30 minutes from him we used to talk on the phone at least once to three times a week along with texting and seeing each other on weekends mainly because we were busy with school. I haven't seen him in about 3 or 4 months and that was only because I went to him after a long time because he was busy. Now he promised he would come to me to make it fair and he hasn't because I live 3 hours away by car and he has a lot of homework he says.

Anyways, we got to talking about this game and I finally finished all of my homework for the day around 8pm and I downloaded steam, bought the game for like 14 bucks on my computer and immediately found out that it doesn't work on Macs. In fact most of the games on steam don't...only 73 ones I've never heard of do work on a mac. But I'm in no position to buy a new computer just for games that I've never played before and I've had this mac computer for like 8 years. Anyways, I told him this and he said, ""sorry :c"" and then I kept trying to find a way and I was texting him but he wasn't answering but I was busy with looking for a solution so it didn't bother me too much and I assumed he was finishing his homework he said he needed to do earlier. I eventually gave up after a little over an hour on the internet getting confused by computer jargin(but if anyone has suggestions that would be nice) and texted him that I couldn't figure out a way today. He didn't reply still and I tried to just put it behind me thinking he was busy and he'd tell me tomorrow. But as I went to exit out of steam and close my computer I saw that he was in a game. He had been playing for over half an hour and was ""in-game"" it read. I exited the page and an hour later I went back because I was curious and no doubt he was still in the game we had talked about playing together, playing it with someone else.

So cut to later that night I was really upset and I told my friend and she said,""what a dick"" which gave me confidence to say something. I said I was unhappy with him right now and to call me tomorrow if he can.

He knows I often feel unimportant to him and I have trouble with that. I told him I feel like an idiot for believing him when he tells me I'm important to him. I didn't want to bring up the game thing since it felt petty and wrong of me to be ""monitoring"" him like that. But then he texted me back another 2 hours later to say, ""It‚Äôs ok cutie, as long as you tried and we can always play some other games and sorry I was showing my friends the game, I do care about you a lot I pinky promise ‚ù§Ô∏èGoodnight and I‚Äôm sorry your mad at me üòû and I do care about you"".

So he told me what he was doing...which...honesty is good but I'm hurt for some reason and I don't really get why. I haven't answered him today because I'm still upset but all he said was ""good morning my love""....
I'm not sure how to respond and I'm feeling really down. Please be nice and don't do that thing where you chant ""break up with him"" as a reddit brigade lol.",01Oct2020,1

869,"I (F25) really need some help here because I feel like my friend (M26) is in trouble and I don't know what to do, because he doesn't seem to realise. I'm so sorry about how long this is, thanks to anyone that sticks around..

Alex (not his name) met Emma (not her name)  right at the beginning of March, so just as the pandemic kicked off. She moved in with him immediately as she'd been crashing on someone's floor, and they isolated together. At first he seemed super happy, it's been a while since he's been with someone, but then we started to notice we were hearing less and less from him, when he's normally a super sociable and happy-go-lucky guy.

We met Emma properly when restrictions eased and she seemed pretty easy going and nice, we actually got along well. We learned from some time with her that she has a lot of mental health issues resulting from abuse; PTSD, OCD, depression and anxiety. I must say, this is NOT a reason not to love someone, but I mention because I think it's impacted the situation.

We first noticed odd things. Alex and Emma would pass one phone back and forth at gatherings with friends, and Emma would constantly talk about her ex's in front of him (talking about them in a good light too, which I know I'd find uncomfortable if my partner did that). These were things we stupidly shrugged off, ""maybe one of their phones is dead"", ""perhaps she's just very open and he doesn't mind, he's not the jealous type"".

One afternoon after we hadn't seen him for a long while, Alex came to our flat to meet a friend we hadn't seen for a few years. I had some time alone with him and he completely broke down (I've never seen anything like this from him before, he's always so positive, I was stunned to see him cry). He said Emma had been so angry about him leaving the house (telling him he was 'selfish' and sounding completely horrible) and leaving her for the afternoon that she'd threatened to cut herself, and he'd snapped and just left. He told me she had done this before, and how hard it was to live with her; he wasn't able to get a job because any he was offered had elements that would trigger her PTSD, yet she wouldn't get a job herself because of her anxieties. Every time he came home if he'd been allowed out, he had to strip, shower, clean everything multiple times, and this would take up half his evening. She told him that if he wanted to be with her he had to accept she would be sad for most of the time, and Alex couldn't see how he would be happy in his future. Emma thought that leaving the country and going to Canada would fix her problems, but Alex didn't want to leave the city yet alone the country.

I told him what you'd expect, your life goals don't align (RE the move), you're the most unhappy I've ever seen you, you need to leave. He agreed, for the most part. Said he loved her and wanted to help her but that this has been the hardest few months of his life. I advised that he forget about what he'd left at home that day and try to go out and have fun with his friends.

Long story short I got a call later that he'd had to leave the group because she was threatening to kill herself. I told him to call an ambulance, but he'd had her mother on the phone who ASKED HIM NOT TO (?!) saying she'd been in the system before and couldn't hack it again. So he didn't. He went home, and I got a text later that evening to say all was well and they ""just needed a hug"". My response was firm; ""I want you to be happy, but unless she gets professional help you never will be"". He wouldn't budge, said all she needed was love and support, and shrugged off my pleas to get her help. I told him people go through years and years of training to be able to support people like Emma and it was okay to be out of his depth, but he disagreed.

He hasn't spoke to me about his breakdown since. We needed some help looking after our cats when we were away so called upon Alex and Emma as they were couch surfing at the time (the rent increased at their place and they had a gap between that and getting their new place),, so we thought it'd be nice for them to stay in our flat whilst we were away; I left them food and drink as a thank you and also to make their weekend at ours nice. That seemed to go well, but then we stopped hearing from them again afterward.

After ignoring messages from my partner for days, out of the blue they asked to stay with us the same night. I had to put my foot down as we live in a small one bed flat, and I'm working from home at the moment too. They've also been taking advantage of my partner recently - they ignored our messages, then contacted to say they desperately needed help moving (my partner went without question to their aid) then they ignored us again. Then again, they said they desperately needed to pick Emma's stuff from her old place that afternoon or it was getting thrown in the street, and again my partner rushed to help. Afterwards, silence. Both of these things they've made seem like emergencies, however when my partner immediately contacts and gets ready to jump to their side, he is then met with ""yeah okay we'll let you know when is good later if we're not busy"" (IF WE'RE NOT BUSY IS AN ACTUAL QUOTE when her stuff was supposedly about to be thrown from someone's house, my partner had to literally reply ""MAKE yourself not busy!"")

So I didn't want to let them do this to him again by staying at ours, especially as they messaged at 6pm asking to stay that very night, making it seem like an emergency again when I had my doubts that it was. My partner (god bless his beautiful soul) convinced me to let them stay for the night, so I offered, saying they'd need to be out by 9am as we had family round the next day. Being out by 9am (a reasonable time? especially if you're in a sticky situation?) was enough to put them off (they both smoke a lot of weed and aren't usually up before 11 / 12.) They chose to stay in a hotel instead. It seems a bit backwards to imply that you desperately need a place to stay (they said their alternative was to pay ¬£100 for the night), but the prospect of being out ""early"" is enough to make you pay the ¬£100 anyway.

Since saying they could only stay for one night (and I did my best to say this kindly, that our place just isn't big enough), I've tried to extend the olive branch, even though there isn't really anything we've done wrong. I've sent both Alex and Emma messages to congratulate them on moving into a new home, to wish Alex happy birthday, all ignored.

My partner finally got him to do an activity together this evening after quite a long silence, and has come home worried as hell. Alex seemed to have a great time with him before becoming increasingly worried that Emma was not replying to his messages (messages sent from my partners phone, because she had his at home, this phone that they now ""share""). He was increasingly stressed on the drive home because of how angry she was going to be that he had left her for a few hours, and it's tainted the whole evening.

I don't know where to go from here. He's talking about moving to Canada, which I know for a fact she wants to do but he doesn't. He can't get a job because she makes him turn down offers. He can't leave the house to see friends. He's thinner than I've ever seen him. I'm scared.

I explained to him that I'm not making him, I only asked him if he would come and support me, since this is a VERY big deal for me. I suffered a lot of trauma from this experience and I just want to finally press charges after so many years of suffering.

I am now at a full time university during the pandemic and about 50 of my credits have transferred. After this semester, I would be a junior (in credits) and I am being urged to declare a major. The plan was always to major in computer science. 

While obtaining my AA degree, I loaded up on as many computer science classes as I could at my community college and learned C++ and Java and even dabbled in cybersecurity. I've always had a love for compsci and for all of middle school + high school, I was convinced compsci would be my major. Now that I am in university during a pandemic with a calc 1 class and intro to object oriented programming, my grades are slipping rapidly and I do not understand anything for some reason. Things are much more intense and they are only going to continue getting intense. I don't know if this means that compsci isn't the career field for me. I am absolutely miserable and I don't know why. 

I've thought about majoring in elementary education because I love little kids + I've volunteered as a TA at an elementary school twice during the summer. Thing is, I've never taken classes relating to elementary education, so I don't even know if I'd be interested in learning about this in a classroom environment to obtain a degree.

When I've taken those little aptitude tests, I always get jobs relating to teaching, social work, psychology, and computer science (to a lesser degree) which are things I'm also interested in.  

Does this mean I should declare my major as elementary education? Is it better to stick with computer science? Should I take a plunge into social work or psychology instead?

I live with 3 brothers, my mom, and my grandmother. My grandmother has dementia, and constantly fighting with my mom. They scream at each other back and forth all day when she isn't working. She gets over worked by her fucking job and is severely depressed. She's on antidepressants, but always tells me how much she wants to kill herself.

She keeps telling me she wants to slit her wrists and that everyone would be happier without her here, that no would care or miss her.

She's always been supportive of me and my choices. I love her to death, and I always tell her. She tells me if it weren't for me, she would have killed herself a long time ago. She keeps telling me she doesn't want me to leave.

I was accepted into a really good school, but it's pretty far upstate. I'd have to move and wouldn't get to come home on weekends or anything. I want to go so bad, but I feel like it's selfish. This household is so toxic, and I don't want to live here. I love my mom but it's just so fucking hard. My own mental health is worse than it's ever been, and every day gets so much fucking harder.

On the day of the meeting it will be three weeks since the last email exchange. They didn't allow visitors to the school for the first four weeks of term so that's why the long(ish) wait.

My problem is, do I email them to confirm that the meeting is still on? Since it was three weeks ago, I am kind of worried that they may have forgotten about it (teachers are very busy people after all), but then again I'm also worried that if I do email them they may say ""actually, we can't do it anymore"" the day before I'm supposed to go in. I'm only worried about this because of Covid, if it wasn't for that I can't see a reason why they would cancel. The number of cases here in the UK has risen quite a bit, although my county is still under moderate risk, not high.

For example, he would always call me ""grandpa"" because I didn't really want to go out and party anymore and has called me ""cheap"" a handful of times. He also never cleaned around the house we lived in at the time and I always had to clean up after his mess in the kitchen.

We didn't talk for a long time after that incident and he cut me out of his life completely (which I feel like was my fault because I gave him the silent treatment and ignored him for a while when I could've just talked to him about it).

   my mom is really in love with her new boyfriend and she sees him all the times, and she works as nurse with him on the same unit. she leaves us home alone for 3‚Äì4 days sometimes staying the night with her bf. she checks up on us every now and then though with a ""hows everything?"" ""did you get door dash? there's leftovers in the fridge."" 

   but what really gets to me sometimes is how she is so good at breaking people, she will nag you and pick at every insecurity you've ever had, even to her own kids, she victim blames and forgets things about us, she makes us think she hates us, which i believe, and the gas lighting just makes me want to kill myself. she will make you feel so special one moment and the next, shes making a fool out of you in front of her boyfriend because she felt like it. 

   she always takes out her anger on me, even if she was the one who messed up, today she forgot to pick me up from school because she was tired, and i forgave her, but then she yelled at me right after because ""i never give her a break.""

I thought they would be motion-sensor and activate when someone walks by, but all of them have been playing eerie music, howling, meowing, cackling on their own non-stop for the last 3 days (every few seconds both day and the middle of the night, and I wish I was exaggerating). The thing about this is that I can hear all these sounds in my room (both day and night) and it's really annoying especially when I'm trying to sleep or study for a midterm. I've already talked to them about 2 days ago and asked if they can either turn it down a little or at least turn it off at night after 11pm, but they didn't bother doing that. They've also been putting up more Halloween decorations in the middle of the night at like 3 - 4 am so I hear them talking/hammering/drilling.

Anyway I've been really fixated on a kink and wanted to express this to her and as she has done in the past said she wasnt into the idea but said she would do it for me because I like it. I don't want to feel that I forced her into anything so I said I no longer wanted to do it and was pretty bummed out seeing as I was trying to pursue my more subby side, (recently discovered im a switch) and was clearly bummed out but no more thaj I would be if I dropped some cake or got a ticket on my truck.

At this point she gets frustrated with me and explains how she only dose most rp because I want it making me feel that I've forced her into all our rps in some way or another which only made me feel worse. She started talking about how I used to be more dominant and masculin and that she isn't sure about me anymore, this made my heart hurt as well as my feelings. I trusted her with this side of myself that I buried for my entire life till I met her and now even she's telling me I'm wrong for being like this.

After this point she starts making the conversation about herself in the regards of asking me what she's doing wrong thinking that I'm only upset because of her and that what I'm doing and the things I'm trying are because she's doing something wrong as a girlfriend and a sub which only made me feel worse. I tried to explain to her it isn't her fault and that I just wanted to drop it. She's now on her computer on a zoom call with her boss whxih ended the conversation.

Dear ******, 

I am a postgraduate and a Ph.D. As it's been a while that I have been in **** university, I have experienced a lot of good moments. However, I and my friends are usually insulted by the posts that are sent on this page. Although mostly they are anonymous they contain initials of possibly real or fake people and this has caused a huge misunderstanding to many of my friends followed by mindfulness and phycological problems and consequently, the same to me. Also, a lot of the published posts have a strong sexual language and theme which again many people get interrupted from their main goal which is studying in the best possible way and progress. I am writing to kindly suggest to apply a much better control over the posts written on the page. So please DO NOT publish the posts with the initials of the real or fake person. PLEASE DO NOT publish any posts with a strong sexual theme And Please control the comments not to be directional or insulting toward any type of people (Either directly or indirectly), race, or belief (As I have found several insulting comments in this regard). 
The existence of all these on the page causes severe mindfulness for the students and psychological problem as I have seen for a lot of my friends that they have these symptoms thanks to your activity. So for the sake of the wellbeing of the Community of students, I would be grateful if you applied a better control over the posts and the comments of this page. 
Thanks for your understanding. 

Sincerely,


Ok so first of all this was a romantic confessions page for students which turned into a normal confessions page. We got like hundreds of comments a day so there is no way we could‚Äôve gotten through them all and keep refreshing new comments (we were students). Also, lots and lots of students loved our page... A LOT. people were saying that they found their now girlfriends because of us and lots of people sent in full blown applications to run the page after us.

926,"Hello fellow redditors!

I need some advice on my relationship. At the beggining I would like to say that my attachment style is dismissive avoidant. I am in relationship with my gf for 2.5 years now. The issue is my feelings are constantly changing, like once I feel I am happy that she is in my life, once I get urges to break up which are hard to resist.

When I think about breaking up and not loving her I feel anxious about me, about hurting her, which I would not forgive myself obviously. 

I wonder if its love, because if I don't love her and I stay in a relationship with her I hurt her by not letting her meet someone else, but if I leave the relationship I would probably regret it and hurt her too. My mind is kinda spiraling.

I feel numb very often and distant to her. I doubt everything, my reactions to her behavior and for instance ""If she would be in situation X, would I leave everything to help her?"" etc.

The feelings I have are rapidly changing. My mind is in chaos, when I dont feel the certain way I am filled with dread and sadness.

I don't know what to do, please try as objective observer give me some advice, your experience with relationships etc.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT: another thing worth mentioning is my mother suffers from diagnosed GAD and I can be prone to that too. I sometimes feel anxious without a specific reason. I sometimes get not serious and managable suicidal thougts, like ending it all would be end of my misery, for instance I imagine myself hanging from pull-up bar and it feels like a relief.",01Oct2020,1
927,"As the title says, I got caught talking bad about some friends/roommates behind their backs on discord. I had forgotten that one of the roommates was in the discord. If it matters, it was a small thing (I was complaining to some other friends that they took up too much room in the fridge and the lie was that I told the friends that I talked to the roommates about it when I didn't). I made it seem like the friends didn't listen to me when I just didn't even talk to them at all about my problem with them and instead turned to other friends to vent about it. I didn't do it out of malicious anger towards them, I was mostly just annoyed that they weren't considerate enough to leave me room in the fridge for my food (again, my fault for not talking to them about it in the first place)

The roommates found out and called me out about the lie and not talking to them first before venting to other friends. I apologized after a week or so of stewing in my guilt. They seemed to take to the apology and we were cool for a little while. I told them I would try to talk to them if I had any further issues with them, however, it's just very hard for me to talk to people about my issues with them so they felt as if I wasn't trying to change. They were trying to give me examples and advice on how I can express myself to them and I didn't really take it. Recently, I think the mistrust had just built up too much over time despite the apology (I had not talked about them to other friends at all after this one time) and the air in out apartment felt hostile to me. I ended up doing the opposite of what I said I was gonna do and just shut myself up in my room. I'm not blaming them for the hostility, the whole situation is ultimately my fault, but I just wanted to clarify why I was shutting myself in.

About, I wanna say a month ago, I was hugging on my cat a bit too much so he scratched me up pretty bad (like almost took an eye out bad), so I locked him out of my room for an hour while I treated my eye and took a nap. After my nap I woke up and let him back into my room. My roommate confronted me about my treatment of my cat, saying that he seemed spooked when they opened their door. He said I shouldn't punish my cat for something that was my fault to begin with, and that locking him out of my room was my way of getting rid of the problem. His lecturing annoyed me so I took to venting about it with my friends again, this time to more trusted friends.

Eventually, I was just exhausted of the energy in the apartment and started staying at my mom's house more and more. The apartment just wasn't home for me anymore. The lease for the apartment is up in December so I decided to just live at the apartment part time. I told them I would just transfer the utilities to them now and they thought I was moving out right away. I also brought a friend to the apartment to start packing and that caused more confusion because I didn't tell them exactly what I was doing. I DID let them know that I would be paying until the end of the lease. I think my actions of packing up my room gave them a different idea and they questioned me a lot. I was gonna pack up some stuff and leave for to my mom's house for the day and then come back the next day to transfer utilities, but because I didn't convey this clearly they thought that I would be transferring the utilities the day I came to pack. This was when they found out that I had been paying all the utilities for the past few months (because of covid and one of them is unemployed). Because I didn't discuss doing this with them it further compounded the problem. They confronted me about my lack of communication with them. I said their aggression towards me made me not want to talk to them. They said I have a major victim mentality which I see now causes my need to vent to other friends rather than confronting the person I have the issue with. They expressed some paranoia that I made other discord servers just for talking bad about them ( I did not, however, I would still vent in a private chat I had with my best friends). A few hours before they confronted me at the apartment, I asked my friend to kick the one roommate from the discord server so I could share an fb chat I had with the roommates. I see now that it was really petty and shows that I haven't really changed. I was irrationally angry that day and wanted support and attention from my friends.

The friendship is pretty much damaged and done for. I don't think they will ever forgive or trust me again and I don't expect them to. I'm still moving out so it's pretty much just all business now. I've acknowledged that I do have a problem with victimizing myself and it's something I would like to change. I really didn't think it would ever come to this from one lie but here we are (the one lie turned into multiple lies to make myself look better or to save my own skin) . I am wondering if this is something I should forgive myself over and try to move on? I've been feeling very guilty over all this and don't know how to move on from it.

931,"TW// self harm, vomit. Throwaway because some people IRL know my main account. This will most likely be a long read.  

So as a background, I‚Äôve had body image issues since I was around 8/9 maybe? I remember being conscious of being overweight, but it got bad in secondary school. Since I‚Äôd say maybe year 8 id always be on diets on and off, and kept gaining weight till my heaviest last year, 197 pounds or a UK size 16 (I‚Äôm 5 foot 5 for reference). I decided enough was enough and lost fifty pounds this year, went to a UK size 10 and was my lowest at 145 pounds. 

I was so happy, except then I turned 18 and the alcohol/nights out started and I put around 20 pounds or so back on in 6/8 weeks. I am miserable. My size 10 clothes which were at one point loose, are now tight and even a 12 sometimes doesn‚Äôt fit as baggy as id like it to be. I was working on exercising, cycling and running and calorie counting again before I went to university and started to lose again. I was still uncomfortable in my own skin, like I just wanted to rip it off, just felt embarrassed and like everyone just looked at me and thought I was huge, but I knew if I carried on that way then I‚Äôd lose again.

And then I got to university. Suddenly the binge drinking as a typical student started again, and when I get drunk I tend to eat. The first week I managed to go to the gym and keep my diet right when I was sober and lost some weight, but the second week the diet went out of the window. It was a Sunday night and I‚Äôd just eaten a lot of food I‚Äôd bought from ASDA for the week (snack food which id bought on impulse like crisps and custard creams) and I felt disgusted with myself. I had eaten a lot in a short quantity before but this time I made myself sick. And as fucked up as it sounds, it felt almost good? Like I was in control? All the girls are so pretty and thin here and it‚Äôs just so glaringly obvious that I‚Äôm the fat one you know? It‚Äôs a horrible feeling but purging made me feel like I was taking control over my feelings over my appearance, like I could get rid of all the crap I‚Äôd eaten and not face the consequences? 

Fast forward two weeks and I‚Äôve been making myself sick at least three times a day after every meal (with the exception of two days last week where I went home for work;my mum found out about my purging and made me promise not to do it again but I started when I came back to my uni halls) and I can‚Äôt stop. Today all I‚Äôve done is binge and then purge, binge and purge and it‚Äôs just a horrible guilty feeling once I‚Äôve eaten. I always plan to eat a very low amount of calories, like 4/500 but it ends in a binge then purge. I weigh myself lots of times a day and I saw I gained a few pounds from yesterday and I just lost control and cut myself a lot at the top of my thighs (I‚Äôd self harmed in the past but not in a long long time). Now I‚Äôm even more miserable.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I do think this behaviour is abnormal but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd call it bullimia since it‚Äôs only been two weeks and I think I‚Äôll stop as soon as I‚Äôve lost the weight, but I know it‚Äôs not right. My throat constantly hurts and my heart palpitates and I‚Äôm paranoid my chest will give out (even though I know it won‚Äôt). I feel so attention seeking even posting this but I don‚Äôt want to tell my mum the extent of it as it‚Äôll break her heart. 

Has anyone here experienced anything like this? I‚Äôm just constantly paranoid everyone thinks I‚Äôm really fat and I‚Äôm just always looking in the mirror and pulling at my face and arms and it‚Äôs such a horrible feeling, I just want to be at my lower weight again but I can‚Äôt seem to stick at the calorie counting :( I‚Äôm just not sure who to talk to and where to go from here, sorry it‚Äôs a bit rambled I‚Äôm just at a loss of what to do",01Oct2020,1

934,"I‚Äôll start off with the back story. I‚Äôm 44 at the present time. 

My childhood wasn‚Äôt the greatest, I was born to a middle class family from New Jersey in 1976, have five siblings (3 brothers, 2 sisters) my parents were fair, and did the best they could do to provide for us, my father was a hard worker, mother a stay at home mom. I had friends in school and from the neighborhood. In 1986 we moved to a very rural Pennsylvania there wasn‚Äôt anyone around my age in a 20 minute radius and my parents were always hesitant letting me hang out with anyone from school, in elementary I had friends I never got to spend time with out of school. Once 7th grade hit I started get bullied pretty hard, I figured joining the band and playing sports would net me more out of school time with my classmates, but frankly that made the bullying worse, my parents would never listen to me about it, I would get blamed for stuff I didn‚Äôt do and my parents would always side with the teachers, they (teachers) hated me too. It was a small town surrounded by a few smaller towns everyone knew everyone and knew what you were doing, or just made it up. I even got bullied on graduation day as I sat in the chair waiting for my diploma. 

My first job was a part time one as I went to a small college, I only worked there for about 6 months, about two months in I made the mistake of a girl out, she agreed, gave me her number, turns out she was telling everyone at work I called her all the time and was afraid for her life, I found out while I was on break and a bunch of people were talking and asked me if I heard about this guy stalking this girl, I was intrigued since I had asked this girl out, but then found out they were talking about me, I only called her twice, we were supposed to go out and she cancelled. So this part of the story turns out to be a huge plot point. 

Fast forward to the year 2000. I started working at a different place, about 4 months in I started catching wind of a rumor about a guy stalking this girl, yup it was about me. Turns out this person that worked at the first job was telling everyone I was a stalker, this person had nothing to do with the girl I asked our mind you, so I spent 2 years at this job mostly defending myself from the constant attacks, and management not wanting to stop it, well two of them did but after they both left holy hell started.  I finally quit

New job in 2002/03 I was there for almost a year, there girl that started the shit at my last job saw me working and literally got a job there, shortly after I was getting shit about being a stalker and the management didn‚Äôt want to anything because it was a he said she said. I started getting stalked and getting death threats while working here. I left this place after about two years. 

2004/05. I got a job at a big bank call center, within a matter of days I start hearing about this stalker shit, turned out a friend of the girl that started shit worked there and spread rumors.

2005 I get a job at a small hospital about an hour from the two previous employers, I was there for a little over 3 years when said girl from the previous two jobs has a drs appointment and the shit starts. Quit

So I have worked at places and had no trouble, I really haven‚Äôt had issues since 2008 from this person

In 2020 this guy from the place I worked at in 2002 tries to start shit at a random gas station. 

I haven‚Äôt felt the desire to make friends after working at the hospital, I‚Äôve always had trouble asking women out since all this started, it actually led me to favoring prostitution which I‚Äôm not happy with and am lucky I never caught anything. But I get flashbacks, some days I‚Äôm fine, others I‚Äôm not. I mean the last instance (besides the dumbfuck from a couple months ago) was about what 13 years ago. But it‚Äôs put a huge damper on my life. I spent most my 20s and 30s in by myself cause I‚Äôm too afraid of this shit. And don‚Äôt want to constantly be looking over my back. I should add I shy away from confrontation, I have never been good at defending myself because I used to get in trouble for it when I was younger.",01Oct2020,1

943,"Hi there, for some short context, My father and I have been dealing with my brother‚Äôs mental illness for the last 5 years. We‚Äôve been dealing with our mother‚Äôs mental illness for the past 12 years or so, lost track of her count. 

We are a stable family, but the mental illnesses that run in this family tear our lives apart. I don‚Äôt want to live in the next 5 years dealing with mental illnesses, it‚Äôs too much for me and my dad, my dad is also retiring in that next time frame as well. I really do not want my dad to live through dealing  that. He raised this family with hard work, dedication and he‚Äôs a hard working person. 

Our brother‚Äôs mental illness is far worse then our mom‚Äôs. I believed according to the context of my dad he was very much bullied throughout his major school life. He was a great student, athletic, academic, polite. It‚Äôs the bullies that got him. I cannot explain HOW complex or what this mental illness is. I think it‚Äôs a form of depression. 

Our brother‚Äôs life style usually goes like this:
- Sleep about 9-12 hours.
- Play video games or scroll the internet for the rest of the day.
- Eat junk food.

Our brother isn‚Äôt productive at all, he does not do any beneficial thing for anyone, he often thinks for himself. I think he thinks that he‚Äôs young and nothing wrong will ever happen to him.

My dad around 4 years ago used to do some more assertive tactics such as getting him employed, it did not work, but what my dad told me: 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an adult now, I cannot force him. He makes his owns decisions, that‚Äôs why we are suffering so much, we cannot fix his life if he does not cooperate.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what is going on in my brother‚Äôs head. This mental illness is very complicated.
He went to many therapists, doctors, yet, like my father said: 

‚ÄúHe makes his own decisions, he‚Äôs an adult now. I don‚Äôt know how I can fix him without his cooperation‚Äù

The doctors prescribed him some anti depressants and sleep medicine. I do not understand how the hell that is going to solve my brother‚Äôs mental illness.


HE HAS no future intentions to do anything from what i‚Äôve seen. He thinks that everything is fine. He deprives us sleep and energy. I am very frustrated. My dad is frustrated. 

I am not mad at my brother, I love my brother, I think he has great suggestions and opinions, he can come up with great ideas quickly. I am mad at his mental illness.

The goal here is to make my brother think properly, be able to do functions similar to us, have mental confidence in trying anything so he can learn new skills, being able to take constructive criticism and improve himself. Become an independent person. love his family, live a great life, and I really want to do something together with my brother (start a company together, do a project together). So he can finally normalize himself.

The worst part of my brother is his diets. ALL THE TIME he‚Äôs eating a diet that WILL DEPRIVE HIS HEALTH!

I am trying to suggest solutions to my father to be aggressive, like if he does something unexpected (like be selfish towards himself or switch to a self destructive diet that ruins him) I would tell my father to just tell my brother that what he‚Äôs doing is wrong and he needs to switch.

My father said he tried that aggressive tactic already and he said he even worsened the situation since my brother cannot take criticism. I still believe this aggressive tactic can work. My dad believes that just waiting patiently until our brother finally realizes it‚Äôs time to correct himself. I don‚Äôt wanna do that, that can make him a middle aged mental illness man. Please, pray to the lord that my father and I will deal with this for a long time.
He currently does not love his relatives.

I just want my brother to be my brother again. I miss my brother. I miss having fun with him. 
Please God, let me see my brother for my life time again.

Please, ask clarification on anything, I will do whatever it takes to revive my brother. I just want to have a normal family, I want to grow up properly.

946,"Hey everyone, first time posting here.

I come to you seeking advice on a somewhat embarassing topic, which I am willing to be open about.

For context, I am a 23 year old male. I have lived a rather sheltered life and have never been a very social creature. During my youth I experienced alot of bullying, violence and hostility at the hands of my classmates, which led to me developing alot of social anxiety, which I am seeking therapy for.

As I am an adult now (or need to really become one) I have tried improving alot of things about myself. From loosing close to 100lbs, to beating most of my akne and becoming more sociable through therapy and friends. 

This all sounds good so far, but as I am trying to mentally prepare for dating and experiencing emotional and physical love for the first time, I can't help but notice some of the ""special"" interests which I have accumulated of years of depressed porn watching. The main one being ... somewhat taboo.

Basically I love Breastfeeding. Not just the act of it, but the trading of power that preceeds it. I want to be a ""strong man"" for my potential partner, but I know that I couldn't keep up the sharade 24/7. Sometimes I would NEED to lay off this power and have her take care of me. Whispering relaxing things into my ears in a cute high pitched voice, while she nurses me, making me feel completely at ease for a moment, as if there is nothing wrong with the world. Combine that with a handjob and you have the single most sexiest thing I could possibly imagine....

I brought this (not quite all of it) up to some close friends while we were drunk (piggy backing off of the typical ass- or tits-guy question). One friend then asked me if I was breastfed as a baby, or if my  mom spent enough time with me (not in a mean way, the dude is a good friend).  My mom worked full time and no, did in fact not breastfeed me or spend alot of time with me.

I have now realised that this interest is propably not very conductive to actually getting into a relationship. I NEED this kind of thing to truly feel comfortable, and don't think most young women would find this charming at all, most likely creepy. Bringing this up to my therapist would slow down the already slow progress on my social anxieties, which I don't want either.

**TL:DR:**

Have a strong Breastfeeding / ""Mommy"" Fetish. Want to find a healthy relationship with a woman. How do I / Should I try measures to get rid of this fetish and be ""normal""?",01Oct2020,3

948,"Advice on how to deal with my life?

I was friends with these two in 5th and 6th grade, and much closer friends with them in 7th. Then I was homeschooled for 8th grade and lost contact. Right before the beginning of the 9th grade year, I saw them. It was been over a year since I‚Äôve seen them in person so I said hi. 

I can‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, it was just something simple like, ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù One of them looked at me, but neither of them said anything back. I kind of hurt, because I used to stay up late texting and talking to them, and I went to restaurants, went swimming, went to a theme park, church, roller skating, grocery shopping, birthday parties, etc. And these people wouldn‚Äôt even say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù back. 

This happened a while ago. Now I‚Äôm in 10th grade. This just came back into my memory because I was just at the park today to skateboard at the basketball court. One of these people were there on the swings talking to someone else I sort of remember from school. I wanted to maybe talk to them, but was too shy. Of course neither of them acknowledged me. My brother was there and wanted to go on the swings. I sat in the swing right next to one of them and I felt like a ghost. I was swinging for about 5 minutes and they got up and left. 

I‚Äôm not saying they should‚Äôve even talked to me. It‚Äôs my third school year I haven‚Äôt been at school. It just makes me feel depressed. Why don‚Äôt they want to acknowledge me?

Thomas was troubled, he had asperger and severe AD/HD not to mention OCD and there was a lot of times that he wasn't in school, but we remained friends as we had been since we were babies. 

We all moved school and in the new school I got tons of new friends and things went along well for two years, I turned into a rather devious kid. This is where I met Adam (ENTP). Adam and I hit it off almost immediately and we quickly became best friends. My devious side faded and me and Adam became very close. We shared our interest in Video Games and played together almost all the time, even with Thomas which is how they became friends. I introduced him to history and before we knew it, we went off to High School where we all met new friends but always remained best friends. He introduced me to some of his friends and him to mine. During High School, however, I was almost in a constant toxic environment where power games, violence and drugs were more or less present all the time between the class, bare knuckles into the last round.

My now ex girlfriend told me about it but of course, though I didn't see it at the time. High school changed me, but my girlfriend made me happy and I always stayed away from the drugs but it was clear I had become darker. I know some consider ToXiC mAsCuLiNiTy a meme but the way it changed me wasn't. To be clear, I wasn't a victim of the problem, I became a part of it even if I did hate it. Nevertheless, I persisted. I found my calling and began to study university-level business and economics, being the earliest of my friends to study ""further"" as we call it here in Sweden as my ambition drove me to. As I had all my friends still here in the city, I remained and studied at the collage in the city (where there isn't much ""life"" within the collage itself). The first year was great and I began to move on from High School even if parts of me were still a bit toxic but always with good intentions, I met some new people but Thomas and Adam were always my closest and those that I loved the most. Life was good.

The summer of 2019 is where things began to go south, however. Adam and Thomas began to hang out with Franklin, of course, they invited me along at first. It was rather clear though, that I hadn't forgiven Franklin for the way he used to bully me back in middle school, so Adam and Thomas began to party with Franklin without me, barely even speaking to me. This caused some Paranoia as it made me feel abandoned and lonely. It was then the big truck hit as my girlfriend of 2 years at the time left me as well. She had her own problems that she had to deal with but I became a wreck because, to me, that was a blow too much and one I couldn't handle (first relationship and first heartbreak didn't exactly help). The thing that I remembered most was that in panic I left the apartment, going against my pride and walked to Adams street, asking him over text if he could come out and talk. He denied me, despite that this had happened before but where the roles were switched. I called my other friend from high school who was studying in Barcelona. He already had a distaste to the way Adam had been treating me and he bought me a plane ticket there taking off the very next day. 

I took that hit, tried to move on and it went rather well, I suppose. Adam was still working and I continued my studies pretty quickly. The following semester I grew a lot as a person. I had cut the contact with most of my old classmates from High School with the exception of two and hung out mostly with Adam's friends from High School which were great people. The next semester I met many new people and studied hard with results I could be proud of. I developed a dream and even a small company in finance with a great vision (this was started in high school but it only became serious here). 

Covid hit and we began to have our finals at home. I didn't have a printer and we had to print out this document that we had to sign that basically said ""I've not used cheats"". We didn't get the PDF file we had to print until the finals had begun, however, so during the test I called him up and asked if he could go to the city library to print it out for me while I was doing the test (we live rather close to eachother). I thought he'd do it for me, as I would've done the same for him (he wasn't working at the time) but as it turned out, he refused. He hung up the phone but I managed to get a Tinder match I had never met before to deliver me it from the far side of town so it worked out in the end (yes, we began to date). It wasn't this event that dissapointed me, but more of the principle. I know it sounds stupid but it made me remember the time I tried to talk to him after my ex left me but it didn't phase me too much.

The summer of 2020 was the best summer of my life. I convinced Adam to pick up golfing and me, him and his two friends from High School played almost every weekend. At one party, however, he was talking about Franklin and his tales with him, about how he bets in sports. I quickly commented that turnover wasn't the same as profit to which he came quick to defend him ""No, you should see him, it's crazy"". I didn't think much of it and I shrugged it off, this comes in later. At another party, however, I foolishly lashed off in a drunken stupor at Adam and all the things I was displeased with. We agreed to have a talk about it to figure things out. We talked and it felt good to get everything out, he admitted that perhaps he hadn't treated me the best but we also pointed out my paranoia from 2019, concluding that I had low self confidence (which really wasn't new). We moved past it and whenever we finished golf we decided that me and the two friends of Adam from High school would take a roadtrip down to the city where Adam would begin to study to hang out. Adams other friend from high school had also begun to date a mutual friend of my ex, causing me to text my ex and see if there was, and if so, straighten out any bad blood between us so it wouldn't be emotionally should our friend groups collide. She never even opened it. 

The semester begun this fall. Me and Adam still talk but lately he's been undermining my dreams and visions while I've always supported his. It feels like he thinks what I study, what I do, my dreams and ambitions is just ""a hobby"" and a joke, a phase. I suddenly remember that never has he supported my ambitions and dreams but as soon as I make a comment to Franklins hobby, the man who used to bully me, he jumps to defend it. This week, his friends from High School left for the city where he studied without me, I didn't even know they were going. They're all hanging out as we speak with the mutual friend of my ex. I broke down earlier this week and even suicide has been on my mind for the past few months. I don't know how severe those thoughts actually are but the fact that I am thinking about it has to be a sign that things NEED to change. Now or never. 

I understand that this perhaps isn't that big of an issue, compared to other things. I've talked to my sister as she's the only one I could turn to. She told me to talk to Adam but I don't know if it's even worth to persevere the friendships at this point. Since last we talked in the summer of 2020 he hasn't really changed much towards me. Should I talk to him about it? Or should I end it? Should I do something else? Please, help.",01Oct2020,1
950,"Hello redditors.

TL;DR: scroll down to last section ""here's the challenge"".

Looking for any useful practical advice, or maybe just hope. I hope this thread can help a lot of other people too. I'm rewriting this a 3rd time for your convenience, trying to be briefer and cut to the chase. I could just state a quick simple question with less context but that ended up less interesting, so here we go.

I have been slumbering, alone and unemployed my whole life. About three years ago when I turned 30 I decided to change my life (now 33). Doing ANYTHING would be better than nothing. Quick summery of key changes:

So I started flipping burgers at 30 as a part time job (my first ""real"" job) and saved up money. I studied hard for over a year to qualify for university and got into an attractive university for a STEM-field degree at 32: I now got about 1 year done and 4 left to go at age 33. Lost the job with the pandemic.

I will be done with the STEM masters degree when I turn 37 if I study full time. I lost my virginity in a short relationship that didn't work out after age 30 and I also got rid of my overweight and dealt with some other issues in my life. I found myself a friend as well with some huge luck.

I am still pathetic and my life SUCKS .. but my life sucks A LOT LESS than before and I'm not giving up my project just yet.

My savings for moms rent are out in a few months. I need to start working at least a week a month again. I'm glad to help her but I need to build my own life. I don't feel that there's space to grow when you're living with mom. Doesn't feel nice to be 33 while others have their own cribs, car, partner and maybe even a degree before 23. I don't feel normal (and I'm not but I accept it).

My first plan was this: get my degree at 37 and then do whatever, I'd be the same pathetic guy but with a degree and some experience of at least stepping outside the door and suck a little bit less. But I am raising the bar. I dream of some ""young man goals"" and those shouldn't/can't just wait forever, it's late as it is already:

I need a real income, my own crib and I need to start dating (while not living at moms) ASAP. In that order.

If I quit uni and start stuffing shelves at Walmart (or maybe even find a satisfying job), I could focus completely on my other goals (and maybe reach them.. but I find this a bit desperate and too compromising). But the uni-degree is happening, it will be my own thing and achievement to have when my future angry cheating wife leaves with the kids and I get homeless. I'm not sacrificing the degree but I will have to plan around it instead.

I'm not taking a loan either, I rather then just work a part time job as a single at moms then and only focus on my studies.

**So here's the challenge (remedy to post title):**

I only see one solution (best chance) to satisfying all my set goals: always have a part-time job and study at the same time, while trying to build up and maintain my social life and renting a crib. What could possibly go wrong? It's dangerous, I risk ending up worn out and the chances of success isn't overwhelming. I'm the opposite of super-man. I'm always tired and sluggish and I hate doing the things I need and want.

I don't even know what to ask. Just some advice I suppose. I could really need some.

Thank you for reading.",01Oct2020,1
951,"Hello, long time lurker, first-time poster. Please forgive any formatting/grammar/tense issues, I don't really know what I'm doing.

So. I (18F) just started my freshman year at \[Redacted\] University. It's been weird with all the pandemic stuff happening, so most of the time, if we're hanging out, it's in someone's room or on a floor lounge. We don't always keep 6' of distance because we've all quarantined together, but if there's anyone else, or more than like 6 people, we wear masks.

For the presidential debate on Tuesday (yikes I know) 5 of us planned to meet in a mutual friend's room and play a drinking game. The mutual friend (18M) (henceforth referred to as F) has a roommate (19M) (to be called R) who had plans with his friends to hang out in the lounge on their floor, so he didn't care that we were all there. I've met R maybe once before and he seemed friendly enough.

During the debate, we were drinking and it's fun (but also horrifying looking at the future of the country), and every so often R would come in and offer us some alc he had in his fridge. Every so often someone might disappear to the lounge and then come back a little later and a little drunker. All in all, it was a good time, and just about everyone ended up drinking a lot. I know I for one drank too much, and I didn't quite black out, but I started losing patches of time, and time was getting kinda fuzzy, so I was shitfaced. Somewhere during all of this, most of us ended up hanging out in the lounge.

At some point in the night, I couldn't tell you when, I went to the bathroom, and on my way back to everyone, I stopped off in F and R's room to look for my water bottle and ended up laying on F's bed for a minute to check my Snapchat. I was alone in the room, essentially almost passing out until R walked in. We were talking for a bit, and I don't remember most of the conversation (probably something about politics, but I do remember mentioning the Jonas Brothers?) and he ended up sitting on F's bed next to me (I was still laying down). I don't remember the exact progression after that, but I remember him slowly getting closer. I was a little uncomfortable but not about to make tea with him because I was drunk (could have been moving towards him idek) and I think had been drinking too (I don't know how much he had). I do remember saying something along the lines of ""I'm fucked up"" or ""Shit, I'm drunk"" to a response of ""No, You're fine""

After a little while, another friend (18M, now called P) came in looking for his phone and a snack. He hadn't been drinking as much as everyone else but knew how much I had because I had jokingly tried to fight him earlier in the night. He saw R and talked to him about some sports thing (again I don't really remember I think I was kinda half passed out during this), but P got his stuff and left. R and I started talking again, but I was again, in and out during this. I think I finally passed out sometime in the middle of a conversation about some class he was taking.

I don't think I was out for too long (longer than the previous times I had been in and out, but no more than a minute or two), and when I opened my eyes, R's nose was touching to my nose, and I could feel him getting closer. It kinda startled me so I kinda shimmied away and made some excuse about needing to go to the bathroom and left (again I had minimal motor control at this point so walking was not my friend). I go to the bathroom and then run down the hall towards the lounge where everyone else is. I went to bed shortly after this

I left my water bottle and my (empty) backpack in F &amp; R's room, but I don't know if I want to go back and get them. I think I might be overreacting, because if it really was any sort of deal P probably would have said something when he came in. I haven't seen or talked to R since, and I haven't mentioned anything to P or F or asked anyone else about it. Otherwise, it was a fun night, and I don't really want to be problematic.

So what do I do? What do I say? Do I say anything?

TLDR: I got drunk and passed out and don't know if my friend's roommate kissed me.",01Oct2020,1
952,"My mom makes almost no money, and I (21M) make around 75k a year. I want to move out and be more independent, but if I move out, what my mom is going to do? Because while I'm here I'm paying rent and all the bills, but if I move out I can't pay my bills while paying for hers. What should I do?

954,"Okay, so, this is my first post so here goes nothing. I‚Äôm the typical loner people usually poke fun at during classes, I‚Äôm 18, male, single, and average physically. I used to be a normal guy with a group of friends, decent grades and good at sports, but since my uncle died, I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart. To give some context, my parents worked a lot when I was a kid and I barely saw them in my day to day life (and when I did, my dad beat me a lot) so they would usually just drop me off at my aunt and uncle‚Äôs house and so I became really attached to them. As I grew up I had all of the usual stuff a teen has like being horny or getting sad out of nowhere, but eventually grew out of it. The problem is that, day by day I feel like I lost all my talents, I feel just an average guy lost in the crowd, I used to be a creative and eccentric type of kid, now I can‚Äôt even find a reason to get out of bed. My father had intensive therapy and is now a calmer guy, luckily for my younger brother, and he keeps telling me i should go back to being an athlete, but I just can‚Äôt be excited about anything, I just go to school and come home to play games so the day goes by faster. I don‚Äôt know what to do next, I feel lost and I feel just ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù, and it feels awful, I can barely recognize myself, and I‚Äôm scared it will get worse.

956,"As my last resort, I am coming here for advice. Not too long ago I got the surface pro 6 as a gift. Within the warranty I have been having a lot of technical issues and havent been overall happy with the product. Before the warranty ends I have brought it to best buy to get fixed 3 times now. The last time I went and had an issue with my software, they sent it out for service and replaced it with the only note being cracked screen (i had a screen protector on :| )  As soon as I got home the computer crashed running the camera app  and continued. Now trying to rush to get the computer serviced one final before my warrenty ran out I had left my computer on the roof of my car and it is now destroyed(ill post pictures of the damage) .(i know it‚Äôs counted as reckless but my point being i shouldnt of had to even had to bring  it in because it was just replaced) The best buy deny me my warranty and say there isnt anything I can do. Does anyone know a loop hole to get around this? Does anyone have any advice? 
I feel really terrible about what happend to the gift  I recived and dont know how i would break the news to them aswell as being out a laptop and stuck with couple hundred in windows accessories (they offerd me a selection at the open box laptops and they were still way out of my no existing budget thank you for reading",01Oct2020,1
957,"I'm a recent college graduate and I have just about $15,000 in student loans which have been paused until December due to COVID-19. I'm still living with my parents, which is fine, but sometimes the atmosphere is toxic with arguments and I've been wanting to get out for a while.

I just got a job where I make a comfortable salary and I can afford to move out to a nice one-bedroom apartment. The benefits are that I could finally have some independence, get out of an uncomfortable environment, and I would be moving closer to my boyfriend (he's about a 45-minute drive away right now). But there's no rush or pressure from my parents to move out and if I stay at home I can pay off my student loans faster. If I moved out now, I could live on a budget and still pay off my loans about 5 months later than I could if I stayed home and put that ""rent"" money to my loans as well. (It would only add about $500 more in interest if I paid them off later).

958,"So to start off, my mother is nearing 60 so shes not 100% tech savvy in today's social media climate. I introduced to her to facebook some months ago to keep in contact with her friends.

Problem is I think I made I mistake in not warning her about adding certain people. My mother isn't foolish but at times can be too trusting of people especially once they start proclaiming to be christian. 

Sometimes that leads up to making mistakes by helping the wrong people who have taken advantage of her in the past. Sometimes her faith and Christianity leads her to making bad choices and having a bit too much faith in people.

Anyways, today she asked me to see what was wrong with her phone because she thought she messed up something and while tinkering with it, I get a sudden notification from some guy on Facebook. I know it's not my place to pry but I mistakenly opened up the messenger and well...

This guy seems shady...All he does is reply to her in what feels like quotes from the bible. Upon checking is his profile, he seems like the extremist christian type. His entire profile is just talking about complete loyalty to Christ or be condemned to hell.

But I don't think my mother has checked out his profile and just accepted him. He reveals so little about himself and my mother is just throwing out information such her location and name. He barely replies back. The last thing she wrote is asking him why doesn't ask more about her. Thing is she is giving him info about herself and he saying nothing but quoting god.

So, how do I handle this? I know its not my place to interfere but I fear for her well being because I know the dangers of social media. She doesn't know anything about this guy and only met him a month ago and yet she seems like she wants him.",01Oct2020,1
