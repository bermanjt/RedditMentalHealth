0,"I know this isn’t the fault of the peaceful protestors and people who want change. I don’t fault you. 

But my uncle is a Sargent and a good man. A picture was taken of him without his knowledge just standing - not in riot gear, not hurting protestors, just standing - it was tagged police brutality. His name appears of his badge. 

I’ve had to delete my Facebook because I’ve gotten death threats and people are saying nasty things. My cousin got the picture taken down off Twitter but Instagram still has it up. I explained to the poster that we’re receiving threats over the picture but he won’t take it down. Is there anything i can do? 

Is there a way I can get Instagram to take my claim more seriously?",03Jun2020,1
1,"I have this pain in my chest, sometimes I don’t feel it, but it can come on from random things like right now, I’m lay on my side and it’s like a stinging feeling in my chest and underneath my arm pit on my left side. It feels sore but gets relieved if I stretch or massage/rub it. It’s definitely not that painful more of a discomfort.",03Jun2020,1

I feel self conscious all the time wearing normal shirts as my arms look great, but I have a lip of belly fat and always feel like everyone judges me for it. If anyone has any recommendations on shirts for tall guys that doesn’t emphasize the stomach I would love to hear it. Preferably casual style, cloth, tank top, or just standard tee. I will mostly wear it in a gym or to classes. I don’t know if i am on the right sub reddit but I couldn’t find any that seemed more appropriate for this. If there is a proper sub please tell me and I will post this there.",03Jun2020,1
3,"So we've been married for 7 years now (33M and 30F) and we use to have sex all the time and try different things but now it has to be the same way every time(her way) the way I finger her, go down on her, she hardly every gives me a blowjob anymore and when she does it's half ass and she stops early and says it ""hurts her neck"". I've hold her I want to try different things or change things up a bit but that has fallen on deaf ears. What else can I do? We have two kids under 3 but I don't think that's the issues since this started before we had our first child. Advice?",03Jun2020,1
4,"Let's say I have to pick something arbitrary, such as where to eat or what to watch or which way to go or solve a problem, and you honestly don't care about the choice, just a positive outcome. However, people would benefit from you making the choice. Your spouse learns what youre interested in lately, your coworkers learn your likes/dislikes, you provide support to other peoples decisions, etc

However, the act of choosing means that someone who actually had an opinion is now disappointed. You push the vote for one restaurant higher than another. You pick a movie that someone ends up hating. You go somewhere and traffic is terrible and everyone is upset. And now that you've made a choice, next time when you actually have an opinion it may not be ""your turn"" and you're upset. 

None of this is your fault or even within your control, but by choosing you contributed in a way.

How can I be more decisive and deal with all this bullshit and just enjoy my choices?",03Jun2020,1
5,"I’m 20 and I’ve never really had a social life or good friends. This is largely due to my mother’s controlling ways, she’s mentally abusive. It’s been happening for years and I’ve just let it happen, accepting I won’t ever lead my own life. 

I don’t wanna get too deep into talking about our relationship because there’s just too much, she caused me to have social anxiety for years and would make it worse by planting ideas in my head that people would laugh at me or something terrible would happen if I ever tried to leave. 

I got therapy and my mental health has improved but now I actually want to be around people, I am no longer fine with being lonely. I want to sort my life out and have something I can call my own. Obviously she isn’t happy about this and it’s been non stop arguing for months now. 

My online friend who I’ve known for 10 years has offered me to go stay with him for a weekend, even offered to pay for return ticket. He’s offered in the past but my social anxiety was too bad back then. 

I want to go but my mum is making this about Coronavirus and saying it’s too dangerous to go on the train... I know it probably is but what’s more dangerous right now is me considering suicide because I can’t cope with the arguing and mental abuse anymore. I need to get away from her. 

I have Cystic Fibrosis and she’s been my carer my entire life but I’m in good health, hardly ever sick, she’s just tries at every point to make sure I can’t be independent by doing things like not allowing me to cook or do stuff other people my age do. She’s even stopped me from getting jobs in the past just so I’ll stay at home with her. 

Should I just say fuck it and walk out? I’m sick of saying “I’ll do this” or “I’ll do that”, I want to take action and turn my back on this shitty life. She keeps threatening to ring my doctors if I leave. I know they won’t approve obviously but surely they would understand if they knew what I was dealing with here?",03Jun2020,1
6,"I'm 20M, not violent at all, I don't even think I've ever been in a fight before. However when I'm mad I do tend to take anger out on inanimate objects: I slam doors, I throw my phone if I'm stressing out while using automated services, I throw controllers impulsively if I'm mad at a game.

What I'd like to know is should I seek some sort of therapy for this? Usually when I'm truly mad at a person (which doesn't happen often) my response is flight and not fight; I get out of the situation that's frustrating me and go to my room or something to cool off. Usually I'll mutter to myself and maybe vent the situation out with a friend or workout to mop up the excess adrenaline.

My reason for asking is that I recently had an argument with my Mum where prior to it happening I slammed my bedroom door (not on her, she was downstairs at the time), I told my GF about the situation and she's worried that one day I'll take my anger out on her physically. I see from her perspective why she would be concerned but is she right? Am I a ticking time bomb and should. I seek some sort of anger management before it's too late?",03Jun2020,1

So my b if this is long but I’m a black 18 year old turning 19 this June and I’m super stressed because I want to leave away for college but I’m 120 lb 6ft slowly trying to gaining weight, I started of at 110 last month, but I’m scared to go away for college because I don’t want to get bullied like I did in high school because of my size but my neighborhood is bad I got robbed when I was 13 home alone, and yesterday it was a shooting with a automatic gun right next to my block, and we’re shootings in the past, I’m going through late puberty and only just started growing at 17 my dad is 6”5 and brother is 6”3and they all went through delayed puberty and I’m worried about still changing in college, like my voice is still changing and hormones , so should I just leave or stay and do online college, sorry if this is all over the place just stressed.

8,I was thinking about looking into the emt career but I'm not sure if it'll be a good way to go. I don't want people to use me or become homeless or anything.

9,"A friend of mine recently had her father pass away somewhat unexpectedly, I am not super close with her so I don’t know all the details of the situation. She also suspects that she has an eating disorder and has not-so-healthy coping mechanisms. Upon returning home from college, she realized that she is slipping into a depression just like last summer. 

She is not someone who ever asks for help. However, recently she realized that she needs help finding a way to sort through and cope with everything that has been happening so she contacted multiple therapists/psychiatrists/counseling centers all of which turned her away because they “aren’t accepting new clients”

To me, this sounds ridiculous. I am not a mental health professional and I understand one person can only manage so many patients but how can a place specializing in this type of care turn her away with no suggestion of how to help?

Is there a way I can help her find the support she needs? Is there something I can do to help her besides listen to her? I can’t stand by anymore and watch people I care about get hurt over and over again.",03Jun2020,1

12,"This is going to be long so I really appreciate anyone who even bothers to read all of it let alone give any advice.

I'm on antidepressants and currently getting ""help"" from a UK organisation called Minds Matter as I was referred by my GP. I went for 10 sessions of what she called talking therapy in which we discussed a whole bunch of things and I was assigned tasks to do to try and help me stay in control of my thoughts. And I found that having someone I could talk to, even just every other week, that I could be honest with and just vent to really really helped.

At the end of those 10 sessions (in January) she referred me for ""some more intense CBT"" and so I was put on a waiting list and then contacted a few weeks ago to arrange having telephone sessions each week because covid. 
I'm 2 sessions in and so far it's mostly just been him pushing me to tell him about the problems I have, how it effects me and what causes those problems which for me just sucks. It's like I'm being made to have a conversation with myself when I don't really know what I'm doing and I'm just guessing but then that's being taken as fact and then I don't get a helpful response just another question about that thing or we move on to something else. If I wanted to do that I'd write it down after spending hours thinking about it some nights unable to sleep not in my Lunch hour on a Friday over the phone with someone I've never met.

Which leads me to my dilemma. 
On the one hand I feel like I should try to tell someone at Minds Matter this and end the sessions and stop wasting everyone's time. I've seen a service advertised on here called better-help.org which looks like it could be helpful. And while it's £200 / month and I'm only an apprentice I don't exactly have many outgoings so I can justify it I suppose. 
On the other hand I have no idea how I'd even make the call to start that conversation never mind having it. It terrifies me, and I'd feel rude that these people are trying to help me at no cost to me and I'm just going to call it quits at 2 sessions? Maybe if I just bear with it, it'll start to pick up and be helpful. 

But then again I'm skeptical of any service that starts by asking me ""So what do you hope to get out of this therapy?""
I was caught off guard by that and didn't give a proper answer but now I've had some time to think here's the honest answer for anyone that's made it this far. I want the same thing that scared 15 year old me did when he walked out of college at 09:30 and rang up the doctors surgery with the phone call that started all this. To be able function normally without having to feel like the smallest tasks require some Herculean effort.",03Jun2020,1
13,"I'm in my early 20s.  I've just been taking the path of least resistance since I turned 18.  Ive wanted to move out of my parents' since I was 13 because my parents were ""awful"", imo.  But honestly I've been too afraid.  Or too comfortable.   I still haven't graduated, but I have a lot of credits (like 50s).  I have a job, but I don't get much money from it.  I hate that job.  I hate everything that I do right now. I'm gonna start saving all of it it and cut a lot of things I don't need.  I could move out in 1.5 years with an associate's degree or stop going to school, save money from a second job, move out in 6 months or so and live comfortably for a year with no plan of going to school and just work/save until I find something I'd want to pursue a career in, wthout my family's influence. I'm not even sure this degree is what I want, it's just a way to make money and it's a family profession.  I've been doing the same thing for too long and getting nowhere.  I've never even lived alone  I wanna move because my parents are overbearing.  Also, they have made it clear that they don't want me to live with them anymore. My little sibling doesn't respect me.  My dad doesn't respect me.  I honestly feel like I shouldn't be here anymore and it's embarrassing to me that I am. So I want to move out ASAP, but I'm just like really wondering if it's smart to do so before I get a strong reliable income (like I'd have with the career from the associates) or should I just save and save and get an apartment and try my hardest to get scholarships down the line for a 4 year college and a major of my choosing? I know I'm rambling at this point but like life's short, right?  I should do something I love and if I haven't found something I love I should at least try to be happy and responsible for myself and find that thing and not allow others to control my destiny?  I guess another thing I'm worried about is graduating and doing it debt-free.   I guess I'd be happy to take on some student loan debt if I could pay it off within 5 years with the job I got if I found something I loved. 
 I was honestly fine waiting til I graduated with a degree in something I don't really enjoy but can make money from... but then 2 things happened this week:  i did something kind of stupid and worried my mom and she told me for the millionth time that I should move out and that she's tired of living with me.  I always get really down/hopeless/suicidal/defensive when this happens because I feel unwelcome in the place I call home and I haven't planned to move out.   The second thing that happened was my friend talked to me about it.  I was planning on moving out over 6 months ago and I didn't and they also said things that made me feel really defensive at the time.  Like ""move out"" and ""what's stopping you"" and ""we talked about this 6 months ago and nothing has changed bc you haven't changed it"" and I was really pissed because I felt like it was off base. But they were right.  I'm still here and I feel like have to do something.  I'm really torn because why struggle (move out or move out AND keep paying tuition) if I don't have to? but also it might be good to do something different. I feel like this is good though because it's encouraging me to set money aside and think about the future and what I'd actually be willing to spend time/energy on if it was all on me.
  Should I move out? How do I do this moving out thing?  Like I'd need money.  I'd need more hours or a second job.   I need to mentally prepare for this huge change and I have to decide whether or not I'm gonna continue to do what my parents want me to do in school. It's not the easiest thing to do, so maybe it should be something I'm fully invested or interested in.  But also, I can't just chill and study for 1.5 years? I feel like I stunted my own growth at some point lmao. I have to make a lot of changes to my own behaviors no matter what I do.
Any advice?",03Jun2020,1
14,"i’ve been talking to one of my high school friends since last year because i heard she broke up with her bf (no i wasn’t trying to be a rebound, i just wanted to help) and slowly started to develop feelings for her. i told her how i felt once and she said she didn’t feel the same but we still kept in contact, about 4 months later she seemed to be feeling the same and we even started sending each other cute love memes but when i told her again she said she wasn’t ready to date again. we still kept in contact again and we started getting even closer and started calling each other every night, have each other cutesy nicknames, and sometimes i could hear her mom teasing her and making kissy noises while we were calling. then her ex texted her and now she seems to be pulling away, i think maybe she’s thinking of getting back together with him. this is the happiest i’ve been in years and i’m

15,"Hi, I had 2 seizures when I was a sophomore in high school, and after being put on medication I have been seizure free since then (since 2014). However, I have been reading about sudden unexpected death in epileptics and other things that can cut the life expectancy short of people that have had seizures, and I genuinely can’t take it anymore. 6 years free and my anxiety is worse now than ever.

There are so many things I enjoy like making music, being with my friends, and even simple things like playing video games.

16,"For some background...I (20F) was with my now ex (21M) for a little over 5 years. The first time we technically ever had sex was when I was around 16, at a party. I was so drunk I could barely stand and don’t remember anything except falling a lot, apparently we had sex because people told me a guy friend of mine got me dressed and got me out of there because he caught us. Afterwards, when I found out I felt disgusted in myself because I hadn’t wanted to have sex and we stopped talking and broke up. Well we got back together five months after and were together ever since and it hadn’t happened again until last year. We broke up for good but we still hung out as friends, one night he told me to go over so I did. It was obvious he was drinking because I could smell the alcohol and he was acting way different. Anyways, at one point during that night he started being pushy, literally and was pushing me on the bed and i told him to stop. I should’ve left, I know but I stayed. He got mad when I was going upstairs to the bathroom. when I got back he started kissing me and i asked him to please stop and I wanted to leave and then he pushed me on his bed and pulled off my pants and underwear and went down on me and I said I didn’t want it. When he was done, he held my arms down kind of hard and he inserted himself. He was trying to make out with me and lick my neck and then he finished and rolled over and slept and I started crying and I fell asleep. 
I know we had previously had sex and I was always okay with doing so and he never pressured me until that night. I’m not sure if you would consider that sexual assault or rape because of that. I felt terrible about it, especially because I know I should’ve just left and he was also kind of drunk. Advice please?",03Jun2020,1

18,"I'm 22 and I have asperger's syndrome. Right as the UK government put in lockdown procedures, my dog Rusty, a dog that I've known and loved for nearly 17 years, was taken to the vet when he started to have a severe nose bleed. He had a long and fulfilling life, and we had shown him so much love, but he was getting old, he could barely walk, he was sleeping almost all day and he barely ate a bite. The vet recommended we put him to sleep and so Rusty died peacefully that day. 

It's been over 2 months since he passed and I haven't been able to go home to see my family, or go into the house where he would be to see that he isn't going to be there anymore, and I'm really struggling to come to terms with it all. He wa smy phone background long before he died and I can't bring myself to change it to something else. I still dream that he isn't really dead and that I'm back home and were all there and then I wake up and start crying because I know he isn't. 

I know there isn't any immediate fix for this but I just don't know what I can do to help me come to terms with his death. I just want my mind to accept that I won't see him again but I don't know how to do it.",03Jun2020,1
19,"A few months ago, my brother actually told me his dark secret. Apparently he suffers from some mysterious mental disorder. He really doesn’t know what’s truly wrong with him since he never actually seeked professional help. My brother told me that somedays when he feels down or even bored, he tends to be “suicidal”. He doesn’t cut himself mostly because he doesn’t want anyone to find out. So instead of cutting himself, he reads books and pretty much stays in the house doing nothing but play mobile games or watch YouTube. He does that as a way to not only to help him distract himself from his own negative thoughts but to also escape reality. He tells me that he wishes that he had the same life as a popular student would or like the same life as an attractive person who gets all the attention. He hates his life and he hates himself. He claims he’s “suicidal” but even he admits that in reality he doesn’t know whether he is or not. He says that he wishes to die but at the same time he doesn’t want to die. He says that he’s confused about what he’s going through. He knows that there’s something wrong with him but he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him. He just says that somedays he feels like he wants to scream in agony while at the same time he hits his own head as hard as possible. The fact that he is confused and doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, frustrates him even more. He refuses to seek professional help because he thinks that no one would understand and he thinks that no professional will ever figure out what’s wrong with him. He also fears that for all those 10 years he’s been suffering could be nothing but something normal or an exaggeration. So instead of seeking help or telling our parents, he tries to fight this mysterious mental disorder by himself. He thinks that he can handle it by himself but I don’t think he can. I notice that somedays he hits his own head because sometimes painful memories from the past try to haunt his mind. He hits his head as a way to stop thinking about the painful memories. He tells himself that it’s best to forget and move on. Another thing he does as a way to cope with his mysterious mental disorder, he tries to do anything to keep himself busy and distracted from his emotional pain. So in a way, I think he just wants to ignore his emotional pain and pretty much act as if everything is ok. He surprisingly managed to stay strong for all 10 years. He posts a lot of things about his thoughts and emotions on an app called The Mighty. He sometimes talks about our parents. He does this as a way to relief the pain he’s going through. Sadly our parents don’t even know that my brother is struggling almost everyday. I want to tell my parents about my brother so bad but he told me not to tell anyone. Should I really be keeping this from my parents!? Should I listen to my brother?? He’s been fighting this alone for quite a very long time and he still does to this very day. I’m afraid that someday he’s eventually going to give up. Should he really seek professional help??",03Jun2020,1

21,"My last partner I had was very immature and I tried different ways of letting him know I wanted to do something. From giving small obvious hints to just asking he would always insult me about it. Back then I didn't have a high drive with him because it was just discouraging to try and made me stop all together. So we ended up just going off his terms which was never that great. 






Now in my current relationship is struggle with this immensely. It bothers me deeply, I hate it. It blocks me mentally and physically. I know my current SO is different. I know he's not him. But it's frustrating trying to make the first move. I never know when to try to do anything. So when things don't go as planned it just becomes all just as discouraging again. It's happened so much with the last guy when it happens now it just makes me want to quit. 





For some context to the ex. The small times I DID try to engage, it led to name calling. I won't repeat the things he said. But it was pretty discouraging. To be clear my current partner does NOT do this. But I do feel bad when it backfires cause I just feel like I messed up and upset him no matter how much he tells me. I'm trying to break through it, but when you're verbally abused like that it takes awhile. 



It's a mental struggle and it's basically this mental brick wall that I can't figure out how to pass. SO is aware of this just not the whole verbal catarophe I went through. He's never done anything horrible. It's just a mental scar I've been stuck with. Any solid advice would be appreciated. 

He's given me a suggestion, but I told him I'd feel trashy doing that. And it kinda relates back to last time I was told something similar and the events that happened afterwards. I just really don't want to sound like I'm pointing fingers. But this is something I truly struggle with. There's other things my ex did, such as literal sxual assault towards me. But it's really taking time for me to surpass this.

26,"I'm 24 and I come from a lot of childhood trauma, a narcissistic family, stayed in a shelter got my own place last year but this year it's hard to see the sunshine...  I have been through so much and I have become stronger and resilient but tell me why is it getting harder to recognize these things about myself? 

Currently I'm pursuing payroll management certification bc guess what? My family won't help me what a surprise and I don't want them to either. They're trying to punish me for leaving for escaping their abuse. I'm not passionate about payroll but I have a B average and I am just trying to get myself out of extreme poverty this is sooo hard. It's very lonely. I'm halfway done with the course and then I have the potential to make 25 and up if I work for someone or 45 if I freelance. Since I struggle with social anxiety I'm leaning towards wfh and freelancing. It's sad bc it's like my dad who wanted to be an art teacher but gave up his dream bc he was poor and had children. I love to sing art and fashion but I think ppl won. You know? 

My family members said I wldnt make it and I wld fail and I wld be nothing. And I feel that way. A lot of ppl said I wldnt make it. I have worked hard though. Harder than ppl realize. I'm ready to throw in the towel I want to die. I pray God takes me out this world each day. I'm unhappy more than unhappy. 

Like ppl I graduated with have their own apartments and cars and are doing so well and I'm struggling. I do all my course work on my iPhone I wear the same dirty clothes each day and I'm tired. I just want to die no one cares about me. I hate my family. There I said it. I have always hated my family. I used to feel so depressed as a kid and jealous seeing other siblings have fun together and girls who cld talk to their moms and ppl who had dads in their lives. 

I really don't want to do payroll accounting but I'm an adult in the real world. Adulting is a trap and lonely and scary. Unless you come from a rich family where you can ask for a small loan of a million dollars or 300k to startup a business. I have to do payroll bc that's how I will have more
Money that's how I will be able to fund my creative dreams that's how I'll be able to live a better life but tbh it's getting bleaker and bleaker each day some days I just can't do it anymore.

30,"Long story short: I met a girl that I’ve fallen in love with. I think she liked me as well, but I’ve probably hidden my feelings too well. A few weeks ago she got herself a bf, and I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown. I‘m considering to write her an anonymous message on Instagram, but after some advice I’m actually more leaned towards not sending it. In any case, please, take a moment to read it and tell me what do you think about it (please do not consider the exact words, as this is a translation from my language):


Hi [her name] [emoji that represents her nickname],
I know this might be the most stupid thing I’ve ever done, but I decided to do it anyway. Since I saw you for the first time, I got an insane crush on you, and I’ve spent everyday daydreaming about you, and about us. I know you’ve probably heard this story already a thousand times, but in my whole life I’ve never seen (and I say never) in any other girl what I saw in you. It sounds like a cliché, but I could spend hours talking about everything that made me crazy for you. I guess it would just hurt me, though.

Why didn’t I tell you? I ask that myself everyday, and the only reason I can come up with is that I’m an idiot. Why did I decide to write you this message? Because I felt I needed to, and because I know I made the greatest mistake of my life. You got in my life by chance, and I thank God that it happened. That’s why the only word that comes to my mind when I think about you is ‘miracle’. An angel, maybe, and I always feel like [a famous poet’s name, madly in love with a girl] and you’re like my [the poet’s crush’s name - which, ironically, is the same as the girl I’m talking to].

Every time I open Instagram my hands start shaking, a sense of anguish haunts me, and I don’t know anymore if it hurts me more seeing you with somebody else, or it helps me seeing you happy. I think maybe I should just get over it, but knowing that the chance of meeting a girl like you is once in a lifetime, makes me feel even worse. I’m not very confident that this is going to help me, but hope dies last. I’m only asking you a word, any word, that would prove you read my message. I’d call myself happy even with an ‘ok’ or ‘fuck you’. I’m sorry for risking to embarrass you, but I just couldn’t keep it inside anymore.

All the best,
somebody that hopes not to be recognized
(and that maybe, deep down in his heart, hopes to be)",03Jun2020,1
31,"I’m scheduled to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed at the end of the month. My mom has told me that she will not allow me to use prescribed painkillers after the surgery, and she will only allow me to have Tylenol/ibuprofen. 
From what I’ve heard from my friends who have had theirs removed, it’s a painful recovery, especially for all four. I can’t imagine undergoing this without the painkillers.

33,"So this is my first time here, and this does not compare with some stuff that I've seen but I need to let this out.

Ths starts a year ago (I was 16 at the time) the year school year started I immediately notice her. The twist? she hated me. We basically didn't even spoke to each other cassually until last 2 weeks where she started not hating me and just disliking.

Fast foward summer break and this year we are acttually fine with each other. I developed a crush on her a didn't tell anyone cause I knew people were going to say stuff. My bestfriend \[F\] anoyed me for 2 weeks to tell her... so I told her. 2 Days later we're at a birthday party and halfway through that she tells me that she told my crush and one of our friends that I have a crush on her (She was at the birthday party). Bad news for me, she didin't like me (has I predicted). Thiings got a bit awkward but back to normal some time soon.

If corona didn't happen I made a ""pack"" with my bestfriend we would tell our crushes we liked them when we went to Açores (Im portuguese) but corona happened and we didnt go so we didn't told them (although mine knew already).

Fast forward quarentine to now, I want to tell her because I have this feeling she might like me back, but I have ran so many scenarios of her saying ""no"" in my head that I'm worried she says yes. Like I dont really know what to do because we are not very intimate so I think it'll be awkward.

So yeh, what do you think?",03Jun2020,1
34,"I am a 25M and live with a 28F, and I'd like to know what is a good way of having the awkward conversation that I am moving out.

She is primary reason why I am moving out, so I obviously cannot say that to her face. I've lived with her for 1.5 years, and still have 3 months on the lease. Just to give a bit of insight as to why I don't want to live with her any longer:

&amp;#x200B;

* She talks too much, which disrupts my concentration when painting, reading, or playing music.
* She is very superficial, always gossips about other people in a negative light. Her laughter is usually about someone elses flaw.
* I feel uncomfortable bringing anyone ever into our place because she is ALWAYS home and in our shared area. Granted we should all be quarantining right now; but she is always glued to the living room and never goes for a walk.
* Her presence negatively impacts my self-improvement goals. She doesn't recycle appropriately, always eats junk food, watches trash reality tv, and never talks about anything besides work or peoples' dating lives.
* Her voice itself is loud.

So how do I explain that I am moving out? Here are the current ideas that I have:

* Living closer to work. Say that the commute has become too tiresome and I would like to shorten it.
* I have a friend who is struggling financially, and so I'm moving to help him financially.
* Be slightly more honest and admit that I would like to practice my violin/piano/guitar freely. Additionally, included that I have been struggling to get some sleep because of the animal below me (weird side story that is actually true).

Any advice would be much appreciated!",03Jun2020,1
35,"Throughout my time, I've always tried to be fair and a good mentor/coworker to people in my workplace, and I think I've largely managed that as I get along well with the vast majority of people in my workplace.

However, I'm not so delusional as to think that everyone likes me or something. And recently, another friend in the workplace told me that my own mentee has been gossiping about me behind my back with another co-worker, both of them more junior than I am, about personal experiences that I shared with my mentee (which I thought was in confidence).

I already intend to stop sharing elements of my personal life with these 2 people, and I know I could just ignore the whole thing, but I suppose finding this out and made me a lot more insecure about whether or not I've really been a good coworker, and what if everyone else in my workplace actually harbours these feelings about me, too?

I’ve tried so many ways to cope already, but I don’t know how to get him out of my head. I spend time doing my hobbies, I talk to supportive friends, and I get attention from other guys. I even tried giving other guys a chance, but it doesn’t help, so I decided that I shouldn’t use or rebound to other people since it hurts them and it doesn’t benefit me either.

The argument also involved the sister in question, we can call her Bottle. When I was angry, I vented out some general frustrations about life on my Twitter. I never once mentioned names, tagged anyone, or even talked about the situation at hand. Just what I was personally feeling at the time, and Bottle screenshotted and sent these tweets to our Mom. I thought it was dumb because imo I felt like it was just instigating (because this happened after the argument) so I shot my sister a message saying that she doesn’t need to be doing stuff like that, and I ended up blocking her on Twitter because sending my Mom my tweets while I’m an adult is just immature imo. I also tried speaking to her on the phone and made an effort to speak to her, and I thought everything was fine afterwards because she seemed calm.

She then blocked me on FB &amp; Instagram. At this point I’m just at a loss at what to do?

48,"So sorry this is long. I'm rambling. 

I recently made a self-discovery that my worst traits stem from my strained relationship with my mother. I guess I kinda resent her for giving me these attributes. 

**Traits**:

* She is very critical towards me and my siblings causing me to be very **insecure**, a trait I absolutely despise and view it as a hindrance to my happiness. She would compare me to other children. She would even criticize my best friend (not in front of her face of course) for being in a ""broken family"" as if that's a flaw she can fix. 
* I used to always want to please her resulting in me not being able to **say no** to requests or favors despite it being a burden. It also resulted in me being very **clingy** to whoever is my best friend at the time. I'm just so lucky it doesn't actually repel them. But I hate how I feel when they hang out with their other friends. Of course they are allowed to, so I feel guilty that I feel bad.
* She would call me fat constantly (giving me body image issues) and once in front of my friends. I hate it when she does her outbursts in public. I'm surprised at all she considers it a good place and time to do so. Like one time at a crowded restaurant, with tears all over my face and her voice echoing in the entire room. I just feel such a unique type of embarrassment it is absolutely horrible. Her public outbursts resulted in me being too **shy** for the average person. I hate this so much why can't I just do public speeches or presentations like a normal person. Why does it have to make me hyperventilate and shake so much. I even cried just trying to introduce myself to the class and it still haunts me to this day. So yes I hate that I have this trait.

I have two younger siblings both just out of preschool. I'm observing she is treating them the same way. I just feel so terrible that all I can do is slowly watch it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fights**:

We don't talk much but when we do it's a nuclear war that result in either me crying or her crying or both. It is the opposite of enjoyable. It is inevitable as we both have dominating personalities (a trait I got from her) but not to this extent. Disclaimer, I'm a huge spoiled brat.

* We had a fight once during prom because she wanted to post photos of me in my dress but I didn't want to because I was (still am) very insecure and hated my face in pictures. She dropped it, only for me to find out she posted it behind my back. One of the greatest things I treasure is honesty so you could guess the betrayal I felt from this or maybe I was overreacting and being sensitive I heard that's also a trait derived from mommy issues.
* While on the topic of trust, one time I told her a secret of my best friend and repeatedly told her not to tell. As I went downstairs, guess what I hear. Her telling the secret immediately after to her friend. I'm just shocked it was IMMEDIATELY after.
* We had a fight once when I told her not to post yet another set of photos. A little backstory, I discovered that my best guy friends would laugh and send each other pictures of me that my mom edited. She does these ""cringey?"" little edits like a regular mom. But when I found out about my friends I couldn't talk to them for a while it was horrible the things they said. I felt betrayed. I wanted to change my hair, not wear glasses I needed to help me see, all in the hopes I would be less ugly. I just didn't want my mom to continue adding fuel to the fire. But did she comply? Nope!
* We had a fight once that she would get mad because I would leave the room when she enters just because I was so tired, so fed up. I would cry every time she talked to me and I was so tired of crying. It's exhausting.
* We had a fight once that I got angry she made me a sandwich. Hahah i know. I was upset because I told her not to make one since she didn't know how to make it the way I wanted (wow what a brat I am) and it would be a waste but she made one anyway. Yes yes I'm a brat. The only reason I was mad because she did this before with cooking noodles when I told her not to and another incident with eggs. I guess I was just thinking ""wow do I have to tell her EVERY time""
* We had a fight once that I accept that I'm in the wrong. I had the belief that what she does to me I can do to her. Like we are equals. I don't know. I always had this big view on equality on all aspects. But I understand now.

Don't misunderstand these fights, that I can do no wrong. I know  I am also at fault.

**What I hate**:

* I hate how she makes me lie. I value honesty more than anything. But only she can make me turn on my morals. She makes me lie and say I love her when I don't. She makes me lie that she didn't make me upset. I hate it. I tried telling the truth, an outburst would occur. It's just not worth it. 
* I hated it when she would say sorry and put blame on me the next day. I hate lying. If you're not sorry, why say it?
* I hate it when she would shout at me and force me to answer ""Do you even love me?"" As if anything other than yes is allowed.
* I hate it when she teaches and ingrains in my younger siblings head that she's always right and knows everything. Those were her exact words.
* I hate how when my siblings and I would misbehave she says ""I'll call your teacher!"" Involving other people is just the worst and just makes us more shy
* I hate it when she thinks I *choose* to see her in a negative light. I really don't.
* I hate how she wants us to be close overnight. I've told her countless times that I can't help it. I can't help the fact that she makes me so uncomfortable.
* I hate how her definition of sweet is my definition of fake. ""Call me mommy (we usually use mama) even when you don't want to. You have to It sounds sweeter"". I guess I hate it because I view it as a form of lying. I did tell her it feels like lying. It did not end well.
* I used to scar my skin because I was so unhappy and insecure, don't worry I'm not suicidal it was just a typical teenage emo phase and I wanna tell her but I'm just so sure her response would be ""you're so dramatic""
* I hate how one time I opened up to her and she disregarded it by saying ""you're thinking too american"" I do see what she means. I have a more liberated view I think is how you say. But it just made me think wow how unlucky am i to be born in this part of the world to not be allowed to think a certain way. 
* I hate how every time I ask my dad something she gets mad that I didn't ask her. I can't ask someone who's not in charge of the meals ""what's for breakfast"".
* I hate how she treats my father. He is just so kind and I want to raise my children exactly how he raised us. So understanding with the right amount of discipline. I mean anyone would look good in comparison to her. But she has such a dominating, shouty personality and my dad just succumbs to it. I think they love each other though. I don't know
* I hate how you force me to be nice to you because you claim you are training me to deal with people, but I literally have never experienced this with anyone else. Just you.
* I hate how seeing loving mothers in my friends or movies makes me cry because I wish I had that. I hate how when I told you this her response was ""stop watching movies""
* I hate when I'm having such a good time with my siblings bonding and it felt genuinely fuzzy and warm, as soon as she enters the room, the mood just dies.
* I hate how when I cry she calls me sensitive and overacting. But when she cries she uses it as a weapon ""how dare you make your mother cry""
* I hate how she signs me up to these programs that take up a portion of my life to.just.Math.everyday. and I opened up to her and told her how I regretted it because I didn't have much of a childhood. She got angry at me for saying that. I hate how she's doing the same to my siblings
* I hate how she focuses on the failures and not the achievements. One time I won bronze in a math contest that was international so I felt that it was a big deal. She said ""why not gold""
* I hate it when every time she does a good deed she always says ""In return you have to behave"" It feels like a debt. It's like everything she does has an ulterior motive and must have a reward.
* I hate how after every time we talk I lose all motivation. My elaborate list to be productive is just thrown out the window. I just lie in bed and stare. I have no motivation to eat so I eat too much the next day so I punish myself by not eating and the cycle goes on.
* I hate that I rely on her.
* I hate how I can see myself becoming her.

**The good**:

My mother is not a bad person. I don't think. Actually, I'm not sure. I'm not so pure and innocent myself. She is the one supporting our entire family. She has made many sacrifices for her children. She always says she does everything for her children. Always reminding me she loves me. So why do I hate her? I don't know if hate is the right word. 

I am just so confused she does so much like pay expensive concert tickets for me, buy expensive clothes for me, pay my tuition for a school I want to go to even though she doesn't want me to. Why can't I just bring myself to love her. I try but I don't even think about it and immediately act coldly to her. I don't get it. I am so insecure but so cocky with her? 

One time she had surgery and when we visited her in the hospital, I didn't talk to her or ask how she was doing. She loves to bring that up every chance she gets. I don't know why she doesn't concern me. I don't know why I just want to cut her off. I want to know why. Am I an alien for not loving her? Everyone's suppose to love their mother, right?

She and my dad were going to get tested for the virus and I kept crying because my dad dying would be the most horrifying and unjust situation, but i didn't have any concern for her? (Thankfully their both safe and ok) Sometimes she would share some parts of her day and I would say """"Why do i need to know this"" I don't understand why I'm just automatically an asshole with her. I'm pretty sure I'm not like that to others, otherwise I wouldn't have friends. She just turns it on. I don't know. She tells me to remove the hatred in my heart but if I knew how, I would. She would always say ""Why are you treating me like this?! Did i ever abuse you? Huh? Did I ever hit you with a belt (she did hit us so she had to add)...repeatedly?"" And she was right she didn't abuse me so why was I acting this way.

We used to get along, when I was like 10. And she always says she misses that and missed the little me. I cant help but interpret that as she doesn't like who I am now. Wow how painful

**Conclusion**:

I feel like I'm in a cage. I tell myself once I'm financially independent and rid myself of my debts to her, I'll be free. But I'm starting to think it's never gonna happen.

The longer I'm with her, I don't know I just feel like I'm slowly deteriorating.

Sorry the punctuation and grammar isn't perfect. I'm just ranting. Thank you so much if you read this far. I myself have a hard time reading long posts. I just gave you my whole life story haha. Literally any advice is welcome.

**TLDR**: Basically, I want to rid myself of the negative traits that stem from my bad relationship with my mother but I'm not sure how to go about that.",03Jun2020,1
49,"So I have been friends with this girl for like 2 years. Recently, she started acting a tad weird and started saying stuff to me that I didn't ask like what she was eating etc. I messaged her a week ago saying if she had feelings for me and she said that it is a solid maybe...more to yes but she needed time to reassure her feelings for me. Recently, we were talking about it and she asked me if I would be wanting to date because she was scared that I would be jumping into something that I am not ready for (I have never been in a date). She said she would let me know when she is ready.
I got two questions?
1) how likely do you think we would start dating from this
2) what should I do in this situation...like not message her at all, give her space and let her think and when she is ready, she will message me?
Also, I oughta point out that this will be a long distance relationship if that helps

54,"Feels like I can't find any friends anywhere. I have social anxiety so I have tried to meet people online just about everywhere. The only friends ive had irl have always judged me for being wierd if I ever suggested anything spontaneous. 

It seems like no one wants to hang out and just vibe in random places, act silly together, talk about deep stuff, make jokes, be open to each others interests. Everyone is set in their ways and just want to talk about tv or whatever and sit on their phone. 

And it feels like if someone does say they're adventerous then they mean they like going to the city and being at bars etc which i'm not into. 

Is it actually uncommon to be like this? Are most people not like this or something?",03Jun2020,1

56,"So today I opened social media and saw all the people posting black screens. I have had a parody/anonymous twitter account since 2012 where I only tweet jokes. Well today a joke I made on twitter didn’t go over well. 


It was something along the lines of “Someone should’ve clarified it was black OUT tuesday. Now I gotta take all this face paint off”. I know it’s a sensitive topic but it was clearly a joke. It’s meant to mock the social media activism where people are posting stuff and taking no action beyond that. Like people were told to post a black screen and they did it and pretended like that was helping.

I personally thought the joke was funny and still kind of do but completely regret ever sharing that thought, especially during this tense situation going on in the US. And I realize the timing is the worst part about it.

Anyways a group of girls i know (all are white) found the tweet and started putting it on their stories and calling me out. Next thing I know people are tweeting at the company I work for and saying “twitter do your thing”.

I’m guessing my company is gonna contact me tomorrow. The tweet and the account it was tweeted on have been deleted. My name was not attached to it so I feel like I can deny it was me based off that. Or I can come clean and try to explain that my joke was not aimed at a specific group of people, rather making fun of those who took no action.

So where do I go from here? Honestly have had people tell me both options and I’m not sure what’s the best for myself and my career",03Jun2020,1

58,"Quick note: I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I do plan to see a doctor about this, but I would like some educated opinions or guesses as to what this might be or whether it's something to worry about.

There's quite a bit to lay down so I'll do it as quickly as possible.

1. Yesterday, I had probably the worst pain in my life. My guess is that it was a spasm that hit the left side of my torso, between my last rib and hip. I literally wanted to jab a knife into my side because of how bad it hurt. Some painkillers and a heating pad helped and I feel better from that now.
2. Roughly an hour later, I started feeling nauseous and dizzy. Earlier this morning, I vomited repeatedly for about a half hour. It was suggested to me that it was possibly a side-effect of the pills I took, but I don't know.

I looked up more information on muscle spasms, which appears to be the cause of the pain but I wanted to be more thorough. For whatever it's worth, this is the most relevant background information that didn't feel like I was oversharing or too private (e.g., anyone that knows me would know this).

* I work in a grocery store as a stock person and cart pusher, so I spend hours on end walking or standing, sometimes outside in the heat and pushing/lifting heavy items.
* I'm not a nervous wreck or a hypochondriac, but I do get stressed and agitated. It hasn't helped I've been frequently stressed out over the past few weeks, especially with things that happen in the course of my job.
* In that vein, because of something I can only attribute to stress recently, I've had a diminished capacity to be able to eat. Sometimes it lifts and I can eat (which I never do to the point of feeling too full or vomiting), other times I feel like I can barely eat anything at all.
* Not sure if this is related but recently, I've been feeling an unusual pain gripping my entire torso from armpit to hip. It lasts for a few minutes and it was much different than what the potential spasm earlier (in particular it was sharper but not as severe, if that makes any sense).

I'm currently off work, so I really don't want to feel this way on the job.

Thank you for any help.",03Jun2020,1
59,"My girlfriend and I are expecting are first baby in 6 months and are looking at private renting an apartment. As I mentioned I have not started my job yet, but I am going to be starting in just under a week. My girlfriend has been living in supported housing for a year and a half and it has very quickly become unsuitable for her to live there any longer, due to her being pregnant. She cannot sleep because her mattress is very old and extremely uncomfortable, we are unable to replace the mattress, as that are the rules of the building, and they won't budge. It is unsafe especially with coronavirus.

Therefore, we have to move out ASAP so that we can start our life properly and I can support her physically by living together. We have been looking at Select Move properties, however the only one that we have found which is suitable is too far from this new job, and I do not have my own car just yet and may take a while until I can get one. Where we're looking to private rent is in the same location as the job, so it would make things 10x easier.

My question is. If we we're to say to a landlord that I am starting this job in walking distance next week, and we would be able to pay the rent and other expenses on time, everytime. Even though I have not started there yet, do you think that they would be likely to accept us?

61,"My neighbours let their two cats roam freely during the summer and they usually always come by my sliding glass door which freaks out my bird (his cage is next to the window) and is now causing him to pull out his feathers rather harshly, resulting in blood.

At first I tried moving him to a different room, but somehow he knows when the cats come by and starts freaking out.

After a month I went back after it started back up, and again I was told it was a virus. But apparently it had been on the pillow and I re caught it (thought you get immune after?). However again, it got better. I asked my dad and he said if it’s fine then there is no need to sort it. 

About 2 months later I brake my nose and go to the hospital (not important how, don’t think anyway) and when I’m there I ask about the cough. Yet I don’t quite remember what he said but some sort of thing and I should t worry yet. And it keeps going on and off for a few days every month. 

So I cough 4-5 times a day, but it gets worse as soon as I cough and if it’s a bad cough day, it’s really bad.

At the start we were perfectly fine, I fitted in well and was getting invited to hang out with all of them often, but recently, like in the past 6 months, they have been hella distant with me. They go out to parties on the weekends and organise parties and I don’t get invited to them, and when I pull them up on it they give me excuses, like ‘you live so far away’ or ‘it was a last minute thing’. Every weekend I feel so lonely because all I want to do is what they go out and do - they have so much fun at these parties and they know I want to be there as well. I’m not close with them like they are to each other anymore. And I can’t talk with them at school like normal anymore because all they talk about is the parties they went to the weekend before, which I can’t relate to and I’m left sitting quiet. I know I should try and find new friends but we’re in grade 12 now, there’s only a few months left of school and everyone has their friends sorted, with their own comfort zones.

68,"Hi reddit people! I often feel very uneasy, stressed, anxious whenever i’m going to a party or anything like it. Reason being i care to much about what everyone else’s opinions and what they think of me. 

In the coming weekend i’m going to a party with 3 of my friends. The person hosting the party doesn’t really like me, but my friends convinced him to let me come.. 

He doesn’t really know me, he dissliked me because i used to be friends with his girlfriend before they even dated, and he felt threatend by me. So i am very anxious and stressed that there will be someone there that will cause drama. I despise drama so i’d like to avoid it. 

I want to show him that i’m a nice guy. I’m laid back and very chill, never the one to cause problems or drama. But people have a habit of not giving anyone a chance once they decide that they disslike that person. 

I struggle with anxiety and i overthing almost every social situation whenever i’m going to a party. Example: «who will be there?» 
«will people disslike me?» 
«will anyone try to put me in a bad spotlight?» 
«Will there be any bad rumours about me?» 
Etc etc. 

I live in a small valley, people spread stupid false rumours all the time due to personal reasons or whatever to make themselves better and put someone else down. This happens everywhere to be honest. 

So it seems i just can’t relax in social situations, i am always thinking about negative things that could occure and preparing myself for the worst. It’s sucks, because i can’t have fun when i’m always anxious, stressed and afraid.

69,"So I contacted a service that used zendesk and they had a contact form to contact support using my personal info name, email, and phone number. 

I asked them to delete the form but they deleted all my info on the main site instead! Hooray they did more than I asked for. I genuinely wanted that deleted as well but they didn’t delete the original contact form with my equally important info. By the way the zendesk site and main site are different so I thought they still had my contact form.

The 1st time I contacted them for my original question they messaged me the next day but that’s because I contacted them after their hours. 9am-5pm.

The 2nd time I contacted them I replied to the original email a month later and I got a request received email. They replied within an hour of me requesting at 4pm and they replied at 5pm. 

They misunderstood and deleted all the data on the main site so this morning I messaged them again so I would receive a response the same day. I thought over it a lot last night and decided it was better to ask them again but when I emailed them again I didn’t get an email saying “request received” I did it again and still no email saying they received my request.

Panic.

What if they DID delete the form and they can’t get back to me anymore? What if they made it so I don’t receive anymore emails from them? What if they did respond to me and I just didn’t get it and I can’t get my info deleted anymore because I can’t receive anymore of their emails?

We often aren’t, but we are fortunate, and things usually work out. With that said, why is there so much rich people hate? I watch interviews of celebrities and the comments are always flooded with how they sold their soul or something, even if they aren’t in any hot water and it’s a lighthearted interview. I think to myself “everyone wants to be wealthy, I have ambition, and I want to work for it, we all do. Whether we intend to use the money for personal pleasure or charity, most people want money.” I know some people are born into it, and some people use it to flex, they are often super annoying, but what about the people who worked their way up, and fought hard to get where they are? Why do so many people think celebrities or above or below human? Don’t get me wrong, many of them choose to let people know everything about their lives, but whether they are egotistical and rightfully criticized, or if they are (at least I think) seemingly nice people, there is this way of looking at them that I just can’t understand.

72,"**TL;DR: A beautiful woman at my work started hitting on me. We went on three dates, she wanted sex, I didn't jump at the opportunity because I didn't pick up on the signs. She was angry at me for months afterward. I'm wondering why she'd want to have sex, but not have my arm around her. I'm upset about this every day looking back, knowing that I blew it.**

Also, all of this was pre-c0víd, so no cause for concern there.

Last summer, I was working at a large hardware store. They had recently hired this beautiful woman - like tall, slim, blonde, solid 9/10, vibrant personality - who started coming on to me very strongly. I asked her out on a date, and we ended up going on three.

The first one was a coffee shop date. We talked about a lot of stuff about life and stuff and we clicked on a lot of things. During the date, she talked about how she had a birth control implant in her arm, ans she let me feel it.

The second was a dinner date. Beforehand, she talked about how she accidentally had her vibrator in her purse, and I asked her about it. We later had a nice dinner/chat. I asked her to come back to my place afterwards to watch a documentary and she actually agreed. On the way to my place, she started talking about how food is a porn category (she had eaten 7 soup bowls for dinner). But later declined to come back to my place, citing a stomachache.

On the third date, she talks about how she's moving to Arizona soon to get a job that she likes. We drive to the movies and we're talking about it. I asked her how she reconciles dating me with her wanting to move to Arizona. And she says ""I shouldn't really be dating right now"" and that we could still be friends afterwards. During the movie, I ask her if I can put my arm around her. She declined, saying ""I actually hate it"". On the way home, she started talking about how she had sex in the back of a cop car. We were talking about sex until we got back to her car and then hugged and parted ways.

She then went on a two-week vacation, and when she came back, she was passive-aggressive and hostile to me for MONTHS.

After making a Reddít post the following February, I only realized then that she was trying to sleep with me.

1. WHY would she want sex, but refuse me putting my arm around her?
2. This might sound petty, but this thing has been.bothering me every single day. **I was offered on a silver platter what 99% of guys have only dreamed of, and I screwed it up.** How do I mentally/emotionally deal with it?",03Jun2020,1
73,"It all started a week ago. I was sitting in bed by myself when out of no where my girlfriend asks if I think we should go on a break. I was really confused because were in high school and have been together for almost 3 years. We’ve been mostly happy the entire time. So I said no. She basically told me I can’t go and see her and she needs space because neglect her. Which I kind of see because when I’m with her I play video games and sit on my phone most of the time. But so does she? A few horrible days pass and she asks me if I have been talking to any girls. I said no of course I’m not. Next thing she says is that she’s been “talking” to one of my old friends but doesn’t like him. She added him on snap and she says he’s been flirting and suggesting sex. She also said she’s somewhat been flirting back. Great. This came out of nowhere. Another thing she says is that me and her dad hating each other stresses her out. I can see why but we manage to get along most of the time but that’s a whole other story. I realize I need to make a change and stop neglecting her and I have to show her I can change that. But she won’t give me the chance to come over and show her. Eventually i can’t take it anymore and I decide I’m not doing this break bullshit and stay away from you while you sit there and talk to other guys like that. You either stay with me or leave me. I decide to tell her I’m coming to her house to talk about things. She begs me not to and says she will make the decision easy if I do. I’m too stressed out and I do anyways. I knock on the door but it’s locked. I text her and eventually convince her to let me in. We sit down and talk about things. And cry. She tells me she doesn’t like him like that (the guy she’s been talking to) but she wants to know what it’s like to experience other guys. (We were both virgins when we met). I was mortified this was completely out of character for her we have always been so close. But she said she just wants to see me change. I told her I would do what ever it takes and I will. But she can’t be talking / flirting with another guy especially one that wants her. She’s never done this before. I somewhat feel like things will be okay and I decide to stay the night. She wakes me up at 11:00pm after talking to her mom and says I have to go. So I do. The next 3 days I sit there and try to convince her that things will change. She keeps saying she needs more time and space. Finally after being away from her for 3 more days I realize why this might all be happening. She’s an extremely attention driven person. And if she says I’m neglecting her and not giving her attention she needs to get it elsewhere. Weather it’s from me or other people. Maybe she just wants attention and that’s it and doesn’t actually want to bang other guys. That makes me feel better. I realize what I have to do and I start to convince her that all she requires is attention and If I give it to her it will satisfy her. I start to feel my hope coming back. (This is happening as of 2 hours ago). I ask her if she is still talking to that guy and she says she’s “hanging out” with him tomorrow as “friends”. Not okay. She’s told me she flirts with him and he wants to bang her, we’re on a break, and you’ve told me you want to experience other guys? I basically went off on her and told her it’s not okay and if she does I won’t be here for her tomorrow. A lot of arguing later and she told me I’m being controlling and this isn’t fair of me. This kills me because I haven’t even gotten to prove to her that we can change and that all she really needs is my attention. We were so close. I told her she can’t through away a life long relationship over a 1 night stand and she told me nothing will happen and I’m over reacting. On top of this if her dad finds out we’re on a break he will hate me even more and probly make is break up. But idk what he knows so far. She doesn’t seem sad, she took my name out of her bio really quick when we started fighting, and she keeps o bombing me on Snapchat. The last thing I sent to her was “so are we over?” And she answered. I will check it now. She said “you made it pretty clear we are”. But she knows we’re not because earlier when asked if I was leaving her I said “no” but if she “hangs out” with him tomorrow I am. 
So should I break up with her? Or should I convince her to let me see her again (which idk is possible) so I can prove to her I can treat her right and prove to her all she needs is my attention to be satisfied.",03Jun2020,1

75,"Okay so I'm a girl and there was this boy who bullied me in 2nd grade. I'm 18 now. I'm a highly sensitive person so I always been that person who cried a lot and uncontrollably. That boy easily saw that I cried a lot and started to call me a crybaby almost everyday. I think he one time called me stupid. He would try provoking me in class and get a reaction out of me. He physically hurt me a couple times; he kicked me in the leg in art class and him and his friend would sometimes try to sit next to me in class to touch me in the back. His friend never bullied me but he would want him to bully me with him. One of the classmates even said, ""He always bothers her"", and he was just smiling. He didn't show any remorse for his actions. I tried telling my teacher about it but most of the time, she would tell me to ignore him. She would occassionally confront him but he often acted like he didn't do anything to me and it never worked. I kind of blame my teacher for not effectively stopping him. I feel like he was jealous of me too in a way because he told me that he thinks I'm rich.

In 6th grade, I sat next to him in class but he never bullied me that year but we didn't get along either. I told him that the way he treated me in 2nd grade was not okay and he tried acting like he had no idea what I was talking about and that made me annoyed. I heard something from his friend who he tried to get him to bully me that he had a dysfunctional home life. His legal guardian was his grandmother and I never seen his parents before. I don't think his parents had anything to do with his life. He kind of bullied other kids too but they were boys. In 2nd grade, he provoked one of the other boys to the point where he made that boy poor food on his head. In 7th grade, he got into a physical fight with a guy and they both got in trouble. He seemed to have serious issues that I don't know of but that's not an excuse to be an asshole to me just because I cried a lot.

I remember his grandmother even conformed me one time while I crying over him treating me that way but she had no idea her grandson was bullying me. My 2nd grade teacher would always send me outside if I cried. It's been over ten years and sometimes, I just want to go back in time and beat the shit out of him for treating me that way. My parents didn't even know he bullied me until years later and it hurts because they didn't understand my sensitivity around that time either which is hard. He never apologized to me for picking on me. He showed no remorse and was trying to get away with treating people like shit. He was an asshole and there's no other word to describe him. I don't know how to forgive him. Even if I saw him today, I would tell him that he should go fuck himself, that's how resentful I feel.

79,"my (f23) bf (m23) and i have been talking about taking some time this weekend to go to a protest together, he seemed okay with it at first but then suddenly yesterday he told me he didn’t think that he wanted me to go with him because he “doesnt want to have to protect me and thats how its going to be” and that was kind of annoying. we went back and forth about it for a while and his reasons are all “i dont want to spend my time protecting you” and he says he doesnt want to put me in danger because he plans on kicking back tear gas canisters. i’ve never once implied that i would need protecting, and im annoyed. i want to be able to go to a protest or maybe a few, and most of my friends can’t go because of work/wont go because of the virus, which i understand. but in the little time off i have from work i would like to go and i wont go by myself. it feels like im being left out because he doesnt want to babysit me but im pissed off that he thinks of me like im fragile and that i cant take care of myself. he says he doesnt care if i go with other people but it comes off very condescending like he said to me last night “holding a sign with your bf means nothing to the cause, its not a parade. if you wanna go march, then go march, im not stopping you, but im not taking you with me” and it just seems like he assumes that all im gonna do is hold up a sign and thats it. i dont know this whole thing rubbed me the wrong way, i just want to protest and he’s the only one that i know that is interested in going and he’s just planning to go with someone else, and he refuses to let me come too. he called me selfish for being upset about this, is he right? im not sure what to do. anything i say seems to upset him.",03Jun2020,1

81,"I'm a minority in the country I'm currently living and I went trought something humilliating these days. In this country locals believe we're lazy and ungrateful and that we want everything for free despite that the truth is that we work longer shifts than locals for less money. 

So I had an infected cut and I went to the doctor. The doctor almost didn't inspect me and asked me to take some expensive exams I can't afford. I politely explained her that I can't afford the exams right now and that I was wondering if she could recommend antibiotics or anything so I can go back to being a functional adult again, which may not be the best case for my health in the long run because of potential antibiotics resistance I guess but it's what I could afford. It's not like I have coronavirus or anything, it was just a cut.

She refused to recommend me any medication and she basically told me that ""nothing is free in this country"" and that I have to take the exams, I told her I couldn't afford them right now and I asked her what I can do to aliviate the infection while I save money to pay for the exams and she didn't recommend me anything and she replied ""the exams are not free"". 

What the fuck. I didn't ask her free stuff I was just trying to explain her that I just want to go back to work because I can't afford whatever exams she wanted me to take.

I left, I bought some random antibiotics at the drug store, I drained my infected cut at home and it's healing amazingly but I feel so humilliated because I feel I validated a bigot in some way in a country where I'm a minority :c I feel humilliated and I can't stop thinking about that. 

How do you deal with this? I feel so bad, I didn't want free stuff I just wanted something to keep me going because I can't afford proper medical exams right now.",03Jun2020,1

84,"I have never found someone I can truly talk to. Ever. I, for literally as long as I remember have always been the person people turn to. Always. I can recall be very young and having adults having conversations with me that I knew inappropriate but even at a young age I would listen and keep what ever secret they chose to devout to me to myself. I have always been the “strong friend” that checks on you without you needing to ask that makes sure everyone is okay and keeps things in order. I always have someone else’s burden on my back and I think that if they could just live one damn hour in my shoes. To see how fucked up I am even though I manage beautifully to keep it concealed they would never say anything to me again. It’s not that people haven’t reached out and it is not like I haven’t tried. But I get nothing I’m these exchanges. I get no hope, no comfort and I most definitely don’t get any desire to ever go back to that person. I typically regret it immensely and grow frustrated. I just wish there was someone I could talk to. Who didn’t want anything in return. Who when I laid my burdens out they were silent when I needed them to be silent. They’d comfort me when I needed comforting. And just did everything right like I do for others. I wish they didn’t come back with their hardships and their experiences what they would do but put themselves in my shoes and accept my burden selflessly like I do for so many people. I want to be the selfish one now and o want to give it away even if it’s piece my piece. I am so tired of living but I know I can’t go because I know it will hurt too many people so I’ve stopped even fantasizing about the day I die. I think I was put here to help people in anyways but I feel as if I am just being chipped away, giving every piece of my sanity away and no one has taken the time to LOOK at me and see I have nothing else to give. I am giving away scraps and people are happily taking them and skipping away and I’m left with nothing. And I have to hold it together because it has become so pinned up not what I’m afraid to let it out. I’m afraid if I let it out and I don’t receive the comfort I need that I will do something stupid.

88,"I have been given the chance to move out of my house with my two sisters who are 25 and 20, myself being 18.  Both of my sisters work full time jobs and are willing to split the apartment bill half and half. 

I think that moving out is a good choice for me personally but I worry about my younger siblings. I have been taking care of my younger brothers since I was 13 due to my mother working full time and my incompetent father who refuses to cook his children dinner or do anything for them. I have become a makeshift mother for them when my mom isn't there, and made sure that they take showers, do their homework, and eat all while my father lays in bed for up to 8 hours a day scrolling through Facebook or working a max of 15 hrs a week saying he is ""tired"". He refused to drive me or my siblings to school because he didn't ""feel like wasting his time"" on us and I had to sign my brothers and I up for the bus. My highschool career was not full of having fun, going to club activities or even being involved in clubs or sports as I was forced to be a nanny to my younger brothers all while I had the weight of highschool stress on my shoulders, sometimes getting only 4 hours of sleep a night. 

Despite all of this stress I took harder classes and managed to graduate with an honors diploma, and have the chance to go to my local college for art. I had little to no help from either of my parents but I am almost going there for free and HATE it when my parents try to give themselves credit for my success. 

My parents want me to work full time at a chicken plant with my mother and go to school part time, but that's not what I want to do at all. My sister (20) followed this path due to our parents not paying for ANYTHING for college and now hates her life. 

Now I really want to move in my with my sisters but the catch is my oldest sister is pregnant. The father is not in the picture and will only provide through sending money. The catch if I were to move in with them is that for a few hours a day I would have to watch a young young baby after my oldest sisters 2 month maternity leave. My sisters would both work and provide money for the baby and the apartment, while I go to school full time and watch the baby while they are not there. It would actually give me a chance to socialize and have people come over/sleep over because I'm not able to do that now. My sisters offered to cover all of my class fees (which isn't a lot bc I got scholarships/grants) and get me a computer for school, something my parents never dared to even think.

My parents have refused to let my sister (20) and me (18) learn how to drive/get our license/get Ids and if I am out of this house I know I can get things to advance myself done. I am just worried about my two younger brothers (14) and (17) and how they will have to basically run a house all by themselves if I leave. 

What I am asking for is an opinion based on my situation, should I leave or not? I think I know what I need to do but I really need someone's opinion on this

89,"This has been my “normal” for a while and I kept trying to rationalize it with myself by thinking “ I’m fat and I’m getting healthy”, but found myself getting worried every time I ate. Whenever I eat it’s like I can feel myself getting fatter and the idea of getting to that size is terrifying to me. I come from a bigger family so I was at one point overweight, but I was never near the extreme as my parents (maybe 10lbs overweight at worst). I’d avoid food until it hurt, but still think “you’re literally always hungry” and ignore it. I would also try to make a rule for myself to only eat if my mom offers it get food, but I made sure she never knew that. Foods she gave were questionable for qualifying as a “meal” that made avoiding much eating easy. One day I’d eat a hotpocket, next day a handful of cheezits, next day a chug of chocolate milk, etc. All the healthy food my mom buys is always “her’s” so she just leaves me with all the shit she wants to eat, but can’t so feeds to me instead. She’s trying to make me more fat than her so she can boost her ego. This isn’t even a “I think she might” she’s hardly hiding it at this point. 

Last week I was scrolling through social media and saw a post saying the white monster energy drink could curb your appetite. That clung itself to my brain so hard. I did it for a couple days with a snack in the middle of the day or two, but for the past 3 days whenever I felt hungry I’ve just been taking a sip and ignoring it. Overall I feel normal, but haven’t a complete meal and can’t get myself to get food close to my mouth. Every time I try my arm just kind of freezes up and my mouth won’t open. I know I need to eat real food, but I can’t separate it from my fear or gaining weight.

93,"My brother,19, I think is becoming racist, insane, and a bigot. Here is why I believe so,

1) He doesn’t think Jews were tortured and killed during the Holocaust. Thinks Americans installed smoke stacks and falsified total deaths of Jewish prisoners.

2) He thinks Jews are the devil.

3) Thinks all Asian cultures worship the devil.

4) Thinks Iran is controlled by the devil.

5) Thinks God and the Devil talk to him, and if you disagree that’s the devil in you trying to trick him.

6) Thinks our other brother is the Devil because he chose a career that pays well.

7) A older women, who tried to sleep with him, when he was 17 told him he’d become a great musician. After she “read” him and told him about himself she decided not to sleep with him and left. Because of this he believes she’s someone sent by God. He never thought about  pursuing music, playing music, or anything until that point.

My brother dropped out of school last year and decided to become a rapper. He’s white and we grew up in the Midwest. He a thinks he’s piecing together a secret code God left him. If he isn’t talking crazy he talks about the 12 times he thinks he almost died. These incidences didn’t involving any serious injuries or anything. Just times he thought he almost died. He rolled an ATV a few weeks ago and that’s when he really started speaking his mind more. It wasn’t until last Saturday did he tell me his beliefs.

96,"Until this passed winter, I didn’t really know my boss’s brother, Matt. I’ve seen him pop in a few times here and there but it wasn’t until like November when he came to help out in our store while we were slow.

I’m 25, my boss, Jon is 39 and Matt is also 25. I was mind blown to find out how old Matt is because I just wasn’t expecting that big of an age gap. I remember sitting down with Matt and asking him, “So who’s older? You or Jon?”

Matt looks at me blandly and says, “Do I look older than Jon?”

Me: I don’t know, Jon doesn’t old enough to be almost 40 and yet here we are.

Matt just laughed at me and told me how old he is. Honestly, all that was just a ploy to tell me his age because I just wanted to know lol Later on in the week, I overheard Matt asking another coworker how old I was and she wasn’t that subtle about it because she said not so quietly, “I don’t know. Hold on, let me ask her. OP, how old are you?”

At the time I was 24, my birthday was just a few months away. When I clarified that, Matt got this look on his face like he was considering it or something....? I’m baby faced. I’ve never looked my age. I did a poll and most people guess my age between 18-22. 

I have always enjoyed talking to Matt whenever I could but unfortunately because I was consistently busy doing my job, I couldn’t talk to him much. He would help me whenever I needed it. I would always catch him staring at me from across the store and vise versa. Matt, unfortunately transferred to a different franchise once business picked back up again and I didn’t see him for a while. 

I saw him again for the first time yesterday in months. He came back to the store to do some training with Jon. Matt was already there when I got to work and we had short brief conversation before I had to get to my job. I was so happy to see him, my heart and stomach was that stupid happy dance. I was the only employee he actually bothered to talk to. Matt is normally really quiet around everyone and doesn’t speak unless spoken to but yesterday he engaged in a conversation with me and I was ecstatic!

I have had a crush on Matt for months now but I am too scared to do anything about it because I don’t want it to jeopardize my job or upset my boss or worse; it could turn my boss into a teenage girl and he could spread it all over the store and tease me about it for idk how long. He’s like that. He’s done it before with another employee but that one was nothing more than a rumor he started. I don’t want that to happen. 

Idk know what to do. I really like Matt but Jon is what is stopping me from doing anything and I’m pretty sure Matt is feeling the same dilemma.

I never really spoke about porn to her, but I was using her phone to see a video (mine was low on battery and charging) and a message popped up about a guy saying *wondering if I should watch porn*. That just made me worried. I get it she is a teenager and all but she is my baby sister and I want to protect her. And also I don't want to get the idea that sex is similar to what they show in porn.

106,"My brother is 18 and is staying with a friend he knows until he moves into his new place. He owes me $30 so I sent him a payment request on Paypal, but he kept canceling it. He told the friend he is staying with that I was harassing him and threatening him, so she took it upon herself to find me on Facebook and message me, telling me to back off and stop 'bothering them both'. 

I've been no contact with my brother for a few weeks because I discovered he was spreading a lie that I abused him. I got legal advice about it and they said there's nothing I can do to stop him from spreading it. 

It's not the first time he has done this. He made up a lie that our father abused him, that our mother abused us, he basically just makes up lies about everyone he knows. As soon as someone starts seeing through his bullshit, he begins to hate them and spread lies about them, too. 

  
The truth is, he is a thief and a liar and a master manipulator. He doesn't feel empathy for anybody or for anything. He will steal from you relentlessly and shift the blame onto you, because you got angry at him. He is an expert at playing the victim. 

I just want my money back. He also stole my shoes when he moved out, and I was going to use that money to buy a new pair, because I'm supposed to be starting a job soon and I can't show up without shoes. He stole one of my younger brother's Nintendo Switch games (smash bros) when he moved out too, and is refusing to give it back. Really he just has a very lifelong history of theft that has gotten progressively worse, a few months ago he stole $100 from my father (twice) and never paid it back.

Should I just give up hope on ever getting that money back? Weird how as soon as I sent payment requests to him, he runs to his friend and tells her to message me. He probably lied to her and told her all sorts of things about me. I know he's been spreading the lie that I touched him for months and months to everybody he knows. (It's a lie for sure. I myself was sexually abused as a child, and its sick to know my own brother is spreading that lie about me)

Part of me wants to message him and unload everything onto him. All my anger, my rage, my disappointment, and my sadness about what he is doing to me and my family. Part of me wants to scream at him and yell and get mad and tell him to never come near us ever again. But I know that's a bad idea. I have a really firm feeling that my mom is on his side, too. At least I know she wants to try to support both of us at the same time, and not pick a side, but it feels like she is somewhat enabling my brother to keep doing this stuff, because she never tells him its bad or she disagrees. 

I'm wondering if its worth a try to wait a few years and try to get back in contact with him. I know he might try to contact me first, anyways. But I'm just worried. What if in the future I have kids and a family of my own, and he starts coming back around, and steals everything from me? Or hurts my kids? Or tries to manipulate my future partner or spread lies about us too? Is it worth it to try and contact him again in a few years, or should I just consider him to be dead to me?

I don't trust him. Nobody I know trusts him. My mother won't even let him in her house, because she knows he would destroy her trust. 

Has anybody else on here had to cut contact with one of their siblings? What happened? Did your relationship get repaired, or are you still no-contact? I'm wondering what the best option is for me.",03Jun2020,1
107,"Firstly, i want to tell you that i am not a nihilist and i do not have youthful maximalism etc. 

Hi, i am 18 M. Since childhood i always had problems with my parents, they are divorced and have new families now. There were a lot of argues and scandals involving me, but i will try ro make long story short.

Since 2.5 i lived with my grate grandmother, cuz my dad married a new women, and my mom just became alcoholic for these years.

At 10 my father decided to take me back, since my grandmother became too old (almost 80) and her social incomes were tiny. I was treated bad both by my father and his wife, but the real problem is that i was constantly supressed by them and they tried to kick me out of the house at that age. Like every month. 

Ended up with my mother at 13, when she married again, because father told me to go away. When i lived with mother, i had the same problems. She continued yelling at me and often told me to pack my things and move away back to the father. 

At 16 she forced me to move out to the father again. I understood, that i cant take such life anymore, so i have tried my best to make money. Started to work as a freelancer at 16, because this was the only way while studying in school. Bought notebook for the inheritance money, which my grate grandmother leaved me after she passed out.

Last summer, in August (i was 17, still underage), my father kicked me out from home.  I rent a room with another guy and lived paycheck to paycheck, combining freelance and waiter-position. Since then i did not talk to my father and dont want to anymore. 

So i lived like this to january, when my mother bought a new house ( she got the money after selling inheritance of my grate grandmother ). She told me that i can go live with her because the house is much bigger then previous. 

I moved to her, and, as you can suggest, the scandals were here. Now i am going to leave her just when i get more money. By local jurisdiction i am an adult now, and i have a legal right, as well as enough income to rent a decent flat for myself. 

What bothers me, is my younger brother, who was born after mom married again. He is 4, almost 5 now. He is the only person, who i love now, after the death of grandmother. I want to leave that home and never know about my as called mother again, but my heart brakes when i think that i will lost contact with my brother. 

Then again, i understand that there is not much i can do and i must try to build my own life. If i want to help myself, i need to increase my income, so i can get an education, buy my own real estate and make more social contacts etc. 

I have never receiced an actual parenting, and i doubt my brother will do (as long as i see this now). In fact, it is a miracle to become a human in such conditions. But what can i do with this? The only thing what comes in my mind is to try my best now, and to help him when he grows up. 

There is no way i can continue with mother. She is a psycho, or more like a biorobot. I am tired of her gaslightning, manipulations and the guilt (duty) feeling, which she tries to impose on me. The only chance to be sane for me, is to prevent any contact like i did with my father. I'd gladly do this, but my brother ...

If any redditor experienced such life situations, i would like to know your stories. I believe that i was betrayed by both parents, and every person irl is really shocked by this stories. No way i would talk to my toxic relatives, because i have an experience of interrogation with them.

P. S. i was not needed in those new families. No, i am not drag addicted, and i have never did something VERY wrong or really bad. So do not think that i was permanently kicked out because i am a freak or something.

Thank you for answers, i appreciate your help, which i strongly need now.",03Jun2020,1

I was kicked out about 6 months ago, and have been living with my boyfriend since.
Since I was about 16, I've been selling pics online. I know it's illegal now, at the time I was unaware and just looking to get some cash.
Now I'm about to turn 19, and it's more important than ever that I have money otherwise me and my boyfriend (20m) won't be able to pay the rent for his mother's 3 bed house while she's in hospital, as her sick pay is £90 a month and she obviously can't afford the house anymore. (me and my bf are also saving up to get our own place when she's better and able to go back to work)
I lost my job due to corona, I was on furlough for a while but they ended up laying a bunch of my coworkers and me off. I decided to go back to SW to be able to get the funds to pay rent, bills and eat.
My bf is unaware I've been laid off, and doesn't know how I'm getting my money. He's a very jealous man (he's not mean or anything before yall say anything) and would rather us lose the house and have to either live with his married sibling and their kids/ live in a shelter than me do what I do.

She's fine with me doing what I do. She has no problem with sex workers but-
An old mutual friend of ours who she still speaks to bought £450 worth of pics a week ago. He did this because I didn't want to just accept the money from him and he's also had a little crush on me for a couple years. (although he's well aware I'm taken, would never make a move and is a respectful man)
I told her about him buying my pics and she went crazy, saying how disgusting it is I would sell to him especially when I know he likes me, and the fact we've known him for about ten years makes it so much worse.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I normally make about £60 per sale as each of my pics are normally £30 ish depending on what they are, so for him to offer to buy such a large amount of pics and for such a large amount of money I couldn't turn it down--bare in mind this is literally my only way of making money at the moment.
I've explained this to her, and she isn't mad that I sell, just that I sold to our mate. I feel like I didn't have a choice. I really needed to make this money.

109,"I'm sorry if the answer is obvious. I can be slow sometimes.


Last year, I attempted suicide four times. I was almost always found before I succeeded because of my living conditions. After being found by my Dad, he ignored me, and every so often would remind me that I'm ""selfish and ungrateful"" for wanting to die.

If he would have called an ambulance, maybe I wouldn't have attempted again and again. I want to know if next time I feel close, or want to hang myself, I have the option to call for help. Because God knows my family don't care enough to help me.

I don't know what would happen though. What would happen?

I'm not going to call any time soon, though. Not with Covid happening. Other people need hospital beds more, so I'll stick it out. But, after all this, I want to know if I could call.

110,"My neighbors have a mobile home, which appears to be unoccupied. However, there are at least two, possibly three, campers on the property. It is a wooded area so we can’t see behind the mobile home but people come and go from back there quite often. People come and go at all hours of the day and night from these campers, although we rarely see someone enter or leave the mobile home. They go without power for weeks at a time before it gets turned back on. Worst of all: there seem to be children either living there or spending quite a bit of time there. These campers are not nice, they are old and rusted and don’t look fit to live in. I called child protective services anonymously once before because I saw them leave an infant unattended in one of the campers. Someone came out once or twice but nothing appears to have been done. I’m not sure who I need to contact, or if I even should since I’m not super familiar with the zoning laws in my county.

Now 3 years ago I moved to a new state, and obviously, a new school. Originally, I liked it and the people in it, everyone was nice and reasonable. Got myself a couple of friends and life was good. Then as we grew older we drifted away while tethered, if that makes any sense. Most of my best buds became attention seeking idiots who didn't care about education as a whole, not just school. Over time it got worse and worse until we were just a merge of different friendships and different enemies.  One friend, who will be called Marcus, always started fights in our group because of his stupidity. He was a horrible son, spending his moms credit card for v bucks or madden points for my best friend currently. He hung out with bad examples and when we tried to sway him away from said example, he couldn't grasp why. Then there was Isaac (name not revealed for obvious reasons) who had extreme anger issues. Edward, who can only be described as a average redditor who is a regular at meme subreddits and has a crippling ramen addiction. And Leo, a real one who is informed, cares about learning and has hobbies other than gaming, but he usually only wants to do the same thing everyday, and is a bit of a egomaniac. I know this is basically just middle school to high school in a nutshell, but these guys just refuse to split up even though there is constant back talk between them. It just makes me sad how this group of good friends devolved into constant fights and bickering with their only thought being ""tik tok"" or ""fortnite"" (I have no problem with this, but its the only thing I see in our group chat). The only thing preventing me from branching out and finding new friends is Leo, because he is still one of my great friends and wants to fix this, but it seems impossible to do so.",03Jun2020,1
114,"My girlfriend has very perfect teeth. I’m talking teeth model material. She had braces from a young age and had them off a few years ago. She’s always very paranoid that they’re not straight or that she may damage them by hitting them or knocking them against something. 
Anyway, when she sleeps, she tends to grind her teeth. Really. Really. Badly. 

Her teeth sounds like they’re cracking. It goes through me and gives me the chills, it makes me feel so uncomfortable and stops me from sleeping. 
When she does it, her teeth will squeak sometimes. That has the same effect on me and makes me super uncomfortable. However, she only does this when she is really tired. But nonetheless it is still super uncomfortable for me.

Since she doesn’t know she is doing it, she can’t control if she does it or not.

How are some ways that we can use to prevent her from doing it?

Is there an easy fix?

Any advice for me on what I can do for her?

128,"Ego might not be the right word for it, but hopefully my explaining will make it more clear what I'm seeking. 

I've been at this acting school for 30 weeks now (it's a 15-month program for an Associate's so we're halfway to the end). Since day 1, I've had problems with grabbing my classmates' attention, being socially intelligent, and just overall someone that people would like to hang out with. Not that I don't have friends, but my main friends are people I've known for years, before acting school. I'm 24F, a few years older than most of my classmates but not the oldest person there (I already went through college but discovered this new passion later, like a later-bloomer of sorts). 

Some of the rules we've been taught at this school are letting go of self-consciousness, relaxation, and overall being vulnerable. I struggle with all of these. Especially vulnerability; my whole life I've had a hard time being 100% my honest self with strangers and letting myself go to make a joke, like I'm too worried it won't be funny enough. I've noticed though that when I'm doing exceptionally good in a scene or monologue, or a performance in general, I get confident and let loose, talking louder and talking more to people I otherwise think don't really like me much. But when I'm having an average or below average day, I kind of shrink into the background. I try to make plenty of small talk but it usually gets ignored for louder, more charismatic people, and the more it happens in a day the more I get tired of trying (for that day). 

I just, I don't know how to not be this person who struggles with normal conversations and is always held back by self-consciousness. My classmates probably perceive me in a way that isn't how I want my ideal self to be and I don't know how to close that gap.

Anyways about 4 years ago she had a kid. I helped a lot to the point where he sees me as a guardian I took care of him while I was in school he stayed with me on and off months at a time. Recently she’s been going through a episode in any of her delusions my parents are the villain of her life. Some of her episodes have led her to be violent. She’s been in and out of mental institutions. She decided that my parents can no longer see her child he absolutely loves my mother they have nicknames for each other and everything. My sister  had(has) always been a heavy drinker. A lover of wine. She sent my mom heavy emails berating her my mom was super hurt. I feel like she weaponized my nephew again isn’t my mother as punishment for nothing. After this  email  me and my brother texted my sister to tell her she’s going through a episode and needs to seek up. Our dad is bipolar but refusing to acknowledge it and seek treatment. We explained that she knows how had it was to grow up in the environment of a unmedicated bipolar parent. She ignored the text. I since have moved out and moved states. I seen my nephew a while before this all blew up and my nephew looked so miserable he looked pale his hair looked thin and he look skinny.(he’s already a skinny kid but he looked way thinner than usual.)

137,"I met a girl online early last year when I was living abroad and she was still in my hometown. 

&amp;#x200B;

We got along really well and talked for months until I moved back home. 

We started going on a few dates and things were very nice, but I could clearly notice she was way more in love with me than I was with her. I always told her I wasn't looking for a serious relationship and she said she was okay with it. 

We had two situations where she had jealous attacks and it was really uncomfortable, so I decided to back off and leave it behind.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after, she texts me and we start talking and eventually going out again. This time she's noticeably more mature and emotionally capable of something casual. 

Quarantine starts and the only place we can hang out is her house. I would stay there for days and things got really serious when I met her parents. I was still adamant on not wanting a serious relationship. I feel like I'm only 22 and the thought of not being able to go out and meet girls, screw up, fuck around and do reckless shit scares the hell out of me. I definitely do not feel prepared to give all of that up. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we settled for an open relationship. One where we couldn't have sex with other people nor get emotionally attached. Only making out and etc. We stayed like that for four months, spending most of our time together, the feelings evolved like crazy and it definitely became love. She always felt very jealous and insecure even though during this whole time, both of us didn't see other people. She was extremely upset with my online flirtings and I would constantly remind her that she couldn't be upset over that if she agreed on an open relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last weekend, everything was fine until some virtually-based jealousy crisis sparked and things got a little weird. She asked me to be completely open and tell her all about the girls I flirt with, asked to see the pictures and etc. 

I, reluctantly did and she seemed okay with it for one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday she came back from work and read me a long text she had written earlier that day explaining that she couldn't continue with our relationship, that despite the great moments, the insecurity, constant jealousy and curiosity got the best of her. She ended things with me and I left her house in tears. Like I had never cried for a girl before. We finished things off in good terms, wishing that we would reunite again some day. She even said we're 'endgame'.

&amp;#x200B;

She is the prettiest girl I've ever met. She treats me like no one else ever did. I admire and respect her more than I could ever imagine. I love every single one of her qualities and can barely find any flaws. We relate like crazy and enjoy the same hobbies, music, tv, etc. I could totally see myself living a life with her by my side.

&amp;#x200B;

But I really don't know if I'm ready to do that at the age of 22, I kinda still wanna see other girls and experience things. It's a huge conflict that has been killing me and I'm suffering so much without her.

Does anyone have any sort of advice? I can provide more information upon request. 

Thank you.

what i’m saying is, fortnite makes me really happy when my emotions gets really down. but i don’t know if it’s healthy to continue playing it? i’m not even sure if someone could say i’m addicted. i just know it’s better than living my life in the “real world” every now and then.",03Jun2020,1
151,"I love meeting new people and talking, the only problem is im terrible at making new friends. Every time i talk to someone, i get in my own head and a lot of things i say come out ingenuine. In short, i think i care too much about what people think and I don’t know how to stop that.

I have childhood friends who I feel close to and don’t have trouble talking to at all, as well as a boyfriend who I feel the same way with. Its only with new people, I haven’t made a friend i feel like i can hang out with outside of where we regularly meet (like work). I get shy thinking we’re getting too close or like I’m overstepping a boundary, and its seriously inhibiting me from making new friends. I’m also seriously a people pleaser as much as I would like to not be and don’t really have a brave bone in my body.

155,"My name is Shane and I am 16 years old, throughout my life I have had sexual encounters with my family members. The earliest memory I have is when i was around 5/6 (maybe older) and a older female cousin treated me as a baby and made me have sex with her, I have no recollection on how this abuse started or ended so I cant speak much on this experience, all I have are vague memories. A couple of years later when I was 8, me and a male cousin used to have sex but we were of similar age and it was consensual this went on till I was about 10. To be honest none of this experiences have really affected me until i was around 14/15 which is when I started to fantasise about my sexual encounter specifically the male one. At first it was the occasionally thought I would use to masturbate to but since then my thoughts have moved to boys that were around the ages of 10-13. keep in mind that I am deeply ashamed of my thoughts and would rather kill myself that hurt a child but lately I have been concerned that through these years of fantasising I unintentionally rewired my brain to have sexual thoughts about minors. (And just to clarify I am straight). So I am now asking anyone who has ever been in a similar situation as me to give me advice on how to stop these disgusting thoughts from coming to my head and hopefully go on with the rest of my life as a normal person.

156,"For background info, I am 18, my boyfriend is 20, and my younger sister is 14.


We have this next door neighbor (We'll call him Andy) that we've lived next to for about 5 years now. He's 19 now, but his parents have told us that he has the mental capacity of a 7/8 year old child. I don't personally believe that, but I'll get into that more later.


He's kind of shunned by most other kids, and for the past five years I've kind of noticed him riding his bike all by himself or playing with frogs and whatnot in his yard. But he doesn't have any friends. Three years ago, thinking he was more my sister's age as he hadn't gotten his growth spurt yet, I started telling my sister to go ride bikes with him, invite him to come over and watch anime (he has a lot of Tokyo Ghoul merch), invite him over for dinner, etc.


My sister and I would give him company as much as he could. Whatever I was doing (whether I was gardening, polishing my bone collection, walking the dogs, etc.) I would invite him with.


A couple days ago I went over to the neighborhood park to get my sister who was LARPing with her friends in cosplay, when I noticed a couple of my sister's friends making fun of Andy and telling him that his Black Butler costume was gay and that Sebastian from Black Butler was gay and that he clearly was too stupid to realize it. I was shocked. The bullies were laughing. My sister was just standing there sheepishly, clearly uncomfortable. And suddenly Andy started laughing too, thinking they were making jokes and not realizing they were bullying him.


I told them to knock it off or I would call their parents (I know I act like an old lady for my age but what else would I do, beat them up? They're kids, I'm kind of an adult) and then I pulled Andy to the side and said, ""Let's go back to my house and bake brownies."" He said, ""Can my friends come?"" I said, ""No I don't have enough for them."" And we walked back to my house.


Our conversation while me, my bf, and Andy were baking brownies went like this:


Me: Those kids are mean and you should stay away from them until they apologize.


Andy: They're not mean, they were just joking around. They were roasting me.


Me: I don't think that's what roasting is, they were bullying you.


Andy: Why would they do that? They're (sister) and I's friends.


Me: They're not your friends if they call you things like stupid.


Andy: but everyone knows I'm stupid.


Me: No you're not, you graduated on time, you have a job delivering papers, and you will be going to college next year. You're not stupid, you're just as smart as they are.


Andy: They don't mean any bad, they're kidding.


And the conversation went in circles like that. Andy would not believe that they were being malicious, me telling him otherwise, him making excuses for him. My bf ended up inviting him to play some Jump Force in the living room and that was that. How do I get through to him? Andy is the only person with Autism I've had a lot of experience with. Does anyone know good ways of showing him that they're not nice kids without hurting his feelings?",03Jun2020,1

159," I recently engaged in a discussion about whether BLM protests are the right thing to do. 

This person's perspective is that, these protests are not the right thing to do now because we are in the middle of a pandemic and people are just rising up now because police killing happened again but everyone will forget again and will achieve nothing, again. Moreover, he/she thinks, it was a distasteful thing to write ""I can't breathe"" on masks, because it makes ""light"" of the patients who are suffering in Coronavirus. And it's  in poor taste because if it wasn’t about patients they should not have used a statement that applies directly to patients. He/she believes the pandemic and the protests are interconnected so if the protesters are going out they need to show respect to the pandemic patients.  Overall there will not be any tangible outcome from these protests. 

Now, although I absolutely agree that vandalism and looting is hurting the cause. And some people will take advantage of the situation, but that's just part of human nature in action. We need to voice our concerns despite knowing these obstacles. I do not think the protest and the pandemic are related. It is extremely unfortunate that the timeline is the same. But a protest against a systematic oppression of hundreds of years doesn't owe anything to a natural disaster. And a violent eruption was bound to happen and United States 100% deserves it. I believe  saying people should wait for a pandemic to pass by before protesting is highly discrediting of the pain and strong emotions they are feeling. Yes maybe there was a better way, but reality is messy and often very complicated. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't have a proper discussion, before getting shutdown. But it is a new perspective I encountered. I don't mean any disrespect to the victims suffering in the pandemic, but the reality of the situation is much more complex. But am I the asshole for pointing out that these protest has nothing to do with the pandemic and these protesters doesn't owe to show some kind of respect to the patients?",03Jun2020,1

here is the surprising part. My daughter actually wants to go and visit which is surprising since I thought it would be scary for her but she actually seems enthusiastic about visiting
I also talked to my wife about it and she says bring her if she wants to. I am also surprised about that because I thought she would flat out say no
but the most surprising was a corrections officer that works there I talked to, she said that since my daughter is a teenagers it is perfectly fine to take her. She also said use it as a learning experience (what does that mean do you think), ask your wife to be honest about what happened, and to simply present it as a punishment for wrong doing.

When she was over my house (before quarantine), she got a little upset when I mentioned her name while her friends were there. Whenever me or my friends say her name, she will be like, ""I'm not Blaire!!""  or ""Blaire is not here!!""

Blaire has also said to these friends that her full siblings were actually her half siblings and that she was motherless (she does indeed have a mother). This is just one of the lies that I am aware about. There could be so many more instances that she has lied to the people, I just don't even know.

173,"(Not a big reddit user here, one of my first posts. I don't ever really know how to start these things, so I'll just get right into it)

I (22M) am in a really bad place in life right now. In January of 2019, I got out of an abusive situation, but the aftermath of said situation has absolutely devastated my life. I'm stuck living with my dad in my hometown. I have absolutely no friends here, and haven't gone out with friends since my birthday in August 2019. I'm working 10 hours a week at a $10/hour job because it's the only employment I can find in my small town.

I have an online friend (20M) who I've known for a decent while. We've become very close over the years, messaging each other and having long conversations every day. 

He recently had to come back from studying abroad due to the covid-19 situation, and has decided to finish his education in the USA. We got to talking about it, when he came up with the idea of coming to my state, moving in together and finishing his degree here. 

He comes from a pretty wealthy family, so he offered to pay for everything, rent, utilities, food, furniture, etc. He literally told me to just bring whatever I want and he'll take care of the rest. I come from a pretty poor family, and have practically no financial resources myself, which has been the biggest obstacle in me getting out of my dad's house.

Obviously, I jumped all over this. To be able to move out of my dad's house, to a place where I'll actually have friends again (I have another childhood friend who lives in this college town) without having to worry about coming up with the money for everything myself is a dream come true. Even more exciting than that is finally getting to meet my internet friend after so many years and be able to live with him. Given that I don't have any friends irl, I would honestly consider him my best friend, so to finally have him as a real life friend sounds amazing.

Here's where the problem arises: He's exactly my type. 6'3"" and an easy 8/10 for me. He has an amazing personality and, obviously, we get along very well.

I do not have feelings for him yet, but I can very easily see myself falling for him. We've actually discussed the idea of dating before. He's certainly not opposed to the idea, and essentially ended up deciding that we'll do things on a ""we'll see where it goes"" sort of basis once we're living together.

Thing is, maybe it's just low self confidence, but I don't know if it would ever actually work out between us, for reasons that I'm not gonna get into too much here. In any case, I should probably plan on things not being romantic.

So that brings me to the title. How can I keep myself from falling for this man? Unrequited love is bad enough on its own. Having it with a roommate sounds like pure hell. Normally, the best advice in this situation would probably be to just not move in with someone I might end up having feelings for, but, given the circumstances, I absolutely *cannot* afford to pass this opportunity up. My life has been miserable for years and I'll probably never get another opportunity like this, so I'm gonna need to figure out a way to make this work without falling for him.",03Jun2020,1

182," So  this situation has escalated a lot in the last few days and I can't   fully get into the details here. Basically, I'm a senior in high school   and my younger brother is in middle school. A couple classmates of mine   have had my brother's teacher in the past, and they told me that he  was known for hiring prostitutes. This was about 3 of my friends that  said this. I asked my  younger brother about the teacher, and he also  told me that the guy was a creep. I didn't think someone like this  should be teaching at a middle school - I  made a post to my Facebook  page calling the man out as someone that shouldn't be around children,  and it garnered a decent amount of attention (more than my posts  normally get).

I don't have this   teacher as a Facebook friend obviously, but somehow the post ended up  getting back to him, and he has not had a good reaction to it. Things   have escalated since he found out in some ways that I never predicted,   but ultimately what's happening is I'm being accused of slandering or   defaming him through this post, when supposedly no actual evidence   exists of the claims I made in my post. I find it ridiculous that people   are trying to call me out for just making a Facebook post - I was   speculating about him based on information that was made available to me   through people who knew him - I don't believe there was anything wrong   with what I did. I feel bad if what I was saying was not accurate, but  I  was just posting it to my own page, it's not as if I got ahold of  the  police or tried to mess up his career in any real way (which is  what's  being claimed currently). I would like to hear what others think  of this  situation, and whether I deserve the ludicrous amount of blame  that's  coming my way.

There's been periods during the last few years where I would become considerably depressed and anxious about what my next moves but I can't let this carry on any longer as I don't want to burden my family especially my mum who has supported and raised us all as far as I can remember by herself.

It's recently come full force during the summer as I dont think I can continue to the last year in my degree in IT as I've started to hate it and don't believe I possess the skills to pass the last year as it requires a dissertation. I want to know how people find and pursue their passions or goals they want to achieve in their life.

The closest I've come to that was looking at university courses and stumbling upon a Japanese course that would of gave me the opportunity to live in Japan for six months and I became very emotional as to live there would be my dream. However it wasn't meant to be as my grades in high school weren't the most desirable and I had no chance of being accepted despite knowing the material for the first year of the course through a hobby of mine.

186,"(Sorry for format, I’m on my phone)

I’m turning 19 in a few days, I’m in shock of how quickly my life flew by.

I lost many years of my life because of my abusive father, I didn’t have much of a childhood.

I often get very excited like a child over childish things I never had, or I just randomly act very unknowingly innocent. 

I get confused as to why it happens or why I enjoy things meant for children? 

What should I do? Do I completely ignore these wants or do I continue to take part in the childish activities I enjoy? 

I feel like I should grow up faster and leave all this behind.",03Jun2020,1

A day after, he said he would pay for them when he got back to work (covid) and before I went back to school. now, I go back to school in a month and a half and my brother has dodged every time I ask him when hes gonna pay my glasses. my parents are separated and live in different cities. my mother doesn't really seem to care and says that it's a problem between me and my brother even though she knows he doesn't seem to care. my dad was pretty pissed but can't do much. the relationship between my mom and dad isn't too good and so they don't communicate much. The glasses take AT LEAST a month to arrive and I go back to school in less than 2 months. Right now I asked him AGAIN when he was gonna pay for my glasses and he literally stayed quiet and just put his thumbs up. I was fucking shaking with anger and wanted to punch him in the face so bad.

191,"Hey, everyone. Last November, I broke up with my girlfriend because I found out she was going through my phone. She didn't find anything all that bad apart from unanswered DMs from girls she didn't like and a couple white lies, like my friends and I doing something dangerous and me lying to make her less worried. The first thing I said to her about dating me was ""don't lie, don't cheat, and don't go through my stuff without asking. if you can do that, we'll be golden."" When she told me about the phone, it was almost a year into dating, and she said she'd been doing it since the beginning, I was so naive. I was pissed and acted impulsively. I felt so insecure about it that I thought pushing her away, calling her names, and lying about not loving her would make me feel better. I was so wrong. At the time, I felt as though it was the right choice.  

It's been almost 9 months, and I think about her every day. Just when I think I've forgotten her, she pops back into my head because a smell or sound or song reminds me of her.

I'm not really one to get caught up on people like this, though. i've seen enough death for 10 people my age, experienced more loss than anyone i know, but it's different with her. Up until we met, I considered my emotions to be null and never treated them with their due respect. She helped me see my flaws and blah blah blah, you dont want to hear that.

Long story short, after the breakup, she had a bit of a breakdown; dyed her hair 3 bright colors and back to normal in a month, started hanging around a bad crowd, did poorly in her classes, started drinking and not caring about anything, etc. and I feel as though I am partly to blame.

one reason i'm posting this is because i can't get with anyone else. this might be a little NSFW, but i can't have sex with other females, they're just not attractive to me anymore. every female i see is subconsciously compared to her and can't hold a candle to her.

i don't dream frequently, maybe once a week, but when i do dream, i dream about her. i see her face when i first wake up and try to hug her but she's not there.

maybe i'm making this out to be more than it is, but I really don't know how to handle it. we're not on good terms, in fact, she's blocked my number and my instagram \[because she refuses to give me my belongings back and refuses to get hers\] and we haven't spoken in like three months.

what do i do?",03Jun2020,1

193,"When I was 16 I begged my mom to teach me how to drive. She wasn't a mother to any of her children. Most of what I learned I taught myself or from my blind father. At this time she was obsessed with her new boyfriend, this is an important detail. She refused to teach me  that spring/summer. One winter day I asked her to teach me next spring or help me pay for lessons. She got furious at me and took me driving then and there. It was raining the night before in the middle of December so there was ice on the road. She was texting the entire time  and I know I should have just said hey, I'm not doing this if you aren't going to pay attention. I made a turn, went too fast, hit the gas instead of the brake and hit a tree. She tried pulling on the steering wheel which made it worse.
I'm almost 23 now and my husband is bugging me to learn how to drive. I know I should. I shouldn't be taking buses and uber's whenever I need to go to the store or work. He asked me about 10 minutes ago and I actually wanted to cry at the thought of driving again. He is so caring, he said he would teach me everything I need to know. We have been together since before that accident happened so he knows how it affected me. The accident wasn't THAT bad, but I am still terrified of driving. Especially his car. What if I am just a terrible driver and I shouldn't be behind the wheel? He needs his car for work. This has made me lose promotions at work and it is just an inconvenience. I still can't get over what happened.

195,"Now, I know how this sounds, but this isn’t a typical “student/teacher infatuation” thing.  He’s not an academic/school teacher, and we are the same age.  I have known him for a few years now and we have become pretty good friends.  We have similar senses of humor (very vulgar, at times), get along really well, and I really like him as a person.  I have had romantic feelings for him for a while, but I haven’t made any moves, aside from playful kinda-flirting, which probably went unnoticed.  He’s very shy, and it took him a while to warm up to me.  I have always tried to progress things slowly with him, as far as our friendship, because he is so shy, and seemed fairly uncomfortable with me when we first met.  My approach seems to have worked fairly well, as we are pretty close now.

As time went on, my romantic feelings have become stronger, because I’ve gotten to know him better, and he’s a really great guy.  He’s kind, thoughtful, caring, smart, and funny.  I’d like to ask him to hang out outside of his workplace (it’s not uncommon for other employees to do this, so it’s not against the rules there, by any means), but I am really nervous.  I don’t want to make things awkward, but I don’t want to just sit back and not do anything either.  I really like him.  I think he might have a crush on me, too, since I seem to make him nervous (still, after years of knowing him).  But he’s also a shy person, so I don’t know for sure.  I guess what I’m asking for is advice to make me more confident, so I can ask him to hang out?  I wouldn’t be straight up asking him to date me, I would just ask to spend time with him while he’s not working.  Is this a good idea?  Bad idea?  Any thoughts?  In any other social situation I would’ve asked him out already, it’s just the student/teacher thing is holding me back and making me nervous",03Jun2020,1

I am now 21 and can definitely see a future with him, but part of me still has doubts because he is the ONLY guy I have ever been with and I am the ONLY girl he has ever been with. He is literally my best friend and we talk about everything with one another. This includes the conversation of an open relationship that I had initiated. I initiated this conversation not because I do not love him or that he underperforms in bed, but because I feel like I cannot be sure that he is really the one for me without me having any external experiences. His response was very laid back and he seemed to share a similar perspective, but part of me feels like he was holding back.

This resulted in me engaging in sexual activities with random men online, which included cam sex and sending nudes. I told him everything he wanted to know about it, and he was pleased to know that I actually made some money off of it. But at the same time, he did not really want to go into further details, which made me feel guilty and so I closed off all my ties to these men. 

I have so many questions that I would like some perspective on, which includes: 

\- Is this cheating/am I an awful person?

\- I love him, but does these feelings of temptations and guilt mean we should break up?

214," 

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I don't know where else to turn to right now. I know throughout my story I have made planty of mistakes, so no need to point out the obvious. It also is pretty long, bc there is a lot of little things that just add up.

I started a first time business adventure, for me, with a co-worker ( calling him CW). CW seemed very knowledgable in what was needed for the business, and it seemed like a good fit becuase we had the same goals in mind, and our input was opposites (CW liked to do the marketing and admin work, and i liked to do the hands on type work). During the buying stages of the exsisting business we obtained a 3rd partner. This partner (call him XX) was known to me but not by CW, but the way the hours would work, XX was a good fit.

After we bought the business and started working there, things were ok at first until about a month later. Again CW was in charge of the marketing, design, kinda all the behind the sceens/office stuff that the business needed. We all put in about the same amount of hours at the physical business, and everyone, at least I thought, knew what was expected of them. So about a month after we bought it, some things, some red flags started to come up and some things started to fall out of place.

The computer system financials were still set up to be paid to the old owners bank account. So for about a month we were really just scrapping by. Once we finally realized this is what was happening, CW just dragged his feet to contact the old owner bc he didn't want to be ""mean"" about anything, bc it ended up that it was a friend of a friend kind of thing. So finally when the old owner agreed to meet up and pay the money, she wanted items that were left behind at the business. Some of these items we could care less about ( shoes,dishes,some tools, just little stuff) . About a day later we get contacted by the old owners brother that had left a big ticket piece of decor behind and he wanted it back. After some talking we decided to wait for that check to clear before we gave this piece back, otherwise we had no leverage to get any of our money back. Couple days later it clears and now CW wants nothing to do with giving said items back, and then right around that time goes on vacation. So myself and XX were left to give the items back, long story on that is that the police were called for the exchange and it got ugly.

After that we get a call from the Landlord asking about some insurance papers that is needed for copies. CW tells the Landlord yupp I'll get them over to you. Well CW comes to me and says ""I have no clue what the Landlord is talking about, we don't have any insurance"" .

Anytime any artwork, design, flyer, or marketing was needed CW would do it, but take a solid week to complete it, so when marketing whatever it was, we would start weeks out and it wouldn't be completed until about 3 days prior, to then advertise said flyer/design for whatever event it was, needless to say, the events always flopped, turnout was crap. It always seemed that all CW wanted to do was to sit and just post on FB about the business, which went from 7 days of posting to about 2-3 days a week posting.

There are many many more little things that I could sit here and talk about that were issues along the way , but fast forward about a total of 6 months later and CW has left the business. He paid his share out and has left to persue yet another business. So the problems really start here, because in order to take CW off our LLC we had to pay a lawyer, as well as a fee to take him off ( I forget the legal term of what this is). Both of which he hasn't paid a single penny of. Also when CW left the business had no money, he thought we did, but in reality we were in the rears about $500 at that time, to which we later found out that about $3,500 in bills wern't paid from prior months, some going back as far as 4 months, so really total we were in the rears by about $4,000. When CW heard there was no money for him to take and leave with, he wasn't mad ( at least he didn't show it) he just left and didn't turn back.

So heres where I need some advice. right now I'm faced with seeing him on a daily basis at work, and the way myself and XX sees it , is that he ""fairly"" owes 1/3 of $4,000 and 1/3 of the lawyer and LLC removal fee, about $1,000 , but realistically these expenses wouldn't have been here if he had just stayed, so we occured these expenses bc of him, to which I think CW should pay them all, but I am willing to settle on the 1/3 . So I'm wondering if I should bring this up to him ( obviously not at work), or if I should just leave it alone and basically take the financial hit from CW?

The other problem I have is that CW doesn't like to keep his mouth shut about business in general, and has been spreading lies. I have been asked by co-workers of myself and CW about how much money I OWE CW, and why haven't I paid CW back yet for the money I owe him. This same group of people that I used to get along with , no longer talk to me, and strictly keep it to work only conversations.

Any advice in this would be greatly appriciated. Also just an FYI, I am not the best at typing, and I am sure there are many typos as well as grammer mistakes here, I'm sorry for that as well as the long read",03Jun2020,1

It started in highschool when my schedule was too full and I dropped lunch period and opted for a 10 min pass to grab food and eat during class. I never got food then because I didn't want to miss any information. 

My school mornings were spent waking up and having just enough time to get ready and feed my cat but never myself. So I grew a habit of eating just dinner. Back then I would try to pack snacks and eat after school. Especially,  during the weekends where I made sure I would eat normally. 

However, come freshman year of college, I was commuting and needed to wake up even earlier for the trains daily. I didn't much money to feed myself as a students so once again I opted for just waiting for dinner. By then I was use to eating one meal a day. I've grown accustomed to it. Now that I'm quarantined at home, with no income and debt needing to be paid off before I worry about myself. I find it hard to eat anything my parents buy because I feel guilty for eating things that they buy for the family. We already don't have enough food and so I stopped eating anything unless my father calls me for dinner. 

Sure, there and then there is breakfast and lunch made for me too that I do eat but I only feel the need to feed myself when my stomach audibly grumbles. 

My father has called me fat and chubs throughout my life which hasn't helped. I know I could probably make some things but then occasionally my parents say things about my appearance or I eat too much when I know I barely eat at all. 

So I mostly just sit in my room and hope that quarantine will end to I can find a job and properly feed myself. 

The pain of not eating gets number each day where I sometimes need to ask myself ""Did I actually eat within the past couple days?""

I've been so depressed over it and stuck in a hole that I want to cry out to my friends for help and guidance but whenever I try to talk to them about my personal issues, they don't seem to care. Quarantine hasn't helped this at all cuz they all live essentially across a bridge. I don't live too far from NYC which adds another layer of difficulty to seeing them. 

I don't really know what to do anymore as my thoughts eat away at myself. I want help, I need help,  I don't know if they'll care about me. I need something before it gets to the point I don't realize that I've starved myself to death.",03Jun2020,1

Basically I (17M) am absolutely in love with her (17F), and I planned on talkung to her abou how I felt at a party earlier this year, but it got cancelled due to quarantine, and right now I'm not sure if I should just keep postponing that conversation until quarantine ends, whenever it does, or talk to her about it right now.

After literal weeks of exchanging texts and phone calls we finally met. I had definitely seen pictures of his face so I knew what he looked like but I was slightly surprised to see in person he is a little bit over weight. I still find him cute, don’t get me wrong, I just feel slightly bad and guilty that he’d be even more attractive with a little weight loss ... please don’t send me hate!!! I mean no harm by it nor am I trying to body shame him. I know some people struggle with weight loss and it’s not something he can just do over night, I just feel unsure if I should continue seeing him if I feel this way, I feel really shitty about it.

221,Basically I am doing a summer internship. We live in an apartment and I am back in my parents apartment for the summer. My dad keeps coming to my room and constantly asks me what I am doing and what I am working with. I tell him to stay out and lock the door most of the time. Furthermore he calls his friends and other people all the time and I tell him I am in a meeting and he is so loud and the apartment walls are thin. I literally have to mute myself EVEN WHEN I am talking or just talk very loudly. He keeps calling my name and coming to my room and being really inquisitive. It’s getting very very very annoying and frustrating. My dad is not working due to covid and he has literally nothing else to do than annoy me. Idk what to do. I can’t even rent another apartment cuz I don’t have the money to. I can’t stay like this long. This is like day 2 of my internship and it’s already so worse. Plus when my mom comes back home I tell her what my dad did and they argue and I am doing my internships and I am in a meeting. I want a peaceful environment to work in. My dad and my parents arguments gives me anxiety. I think I won’t be successful in my internship like this. Any advice?,03Jun2020,1

224,"Basically, i had a rough start a college this year because i was dealing with mental issues, so now that the semester is reaching its end, i have a specific class in which i didnt send two papers and now I need like a 13 out of 10 to pass.

I reached to the teacher about it and he offered me to send the papers and get a new grade, albeit with a cap, that would allow me to continue the class and take the exam to pass it this semester, my other option is to basically dont do it, tell him i rather start over, and wait a whole year to retake this class, because its done every other semester.

I dont know what to do, i talked to classmates in similar situations and most of them either will retake the class while others have already quit college, my family supports, or atleast my father, my decision of waiting and starting over.

My gut feeling is to wait it out, mostly because the classes have been shit due to corona, and my already shit mental health would take a hit so strong that i may actually end up offing myself.

228,"So I am asking for advice for my younger sister. I come from an arab family where my mother is white-skinned and my father is black. Me and all my siblings have taken more to look like our mother, and we are all white-presenting. One of my siblings however, my younger 16 year old sister, is the spitting image of my father. She is the only one of all our siblings who has dark skin. Every time we meet new people they ask infinite insensitive questions on how this could be, all of which have always made her uncomfortable. I have always tried to teach her that melanin is beauty, and this has really helped her as she's grown up to love herself. The reason for this post is that i need help. From when she was a BABY, to this very day my (black father), has HATED her. I do not say this lightly. He has always called her things such as the N word and all sorts of racial slurs. He singles her our in any situation he can. He will tell her to get up when me and my siblings are playing together just to isolate her. He shows a CLEAR hatred towards her and him reducing her to tears has become somewhat of a norm in our household. I am grateful for the small mercy of her naivety and innocence, preventing her from fully conceptualising the depth of his hatred. Nonetheless she is aware of it. She has said on multiple occasions said, 'dad hates me because i am black'. He told my mother that she must have had an affair because this black child could not be his. My mother is an obedient old-school wife. She would never speak back to my father. I am aware that this story is all sorts of fucked up from every angle. I stand up for my sister when anything happens but my mum always tells me to be silent. My mum would move heaven and earth and put it all back again if it meant my dad would be happy. I don't really know what to do with this situation. How do I help my sister? How do i educate my father who is clearly so deeply riddled with self hate that he offloads onto his only black child? How do I make my mother understand that this is NOT OK?",03Jun2020,1

When I went to silence it as we opened windows, it then chanted from saying “smoke” to saying “carbon monoxide”. When we were able to open the oven again, the whole thing was gross. I don’t doubt that it’s possible that some came from whatever was in the oven, but now what?? We opened the windows and texted the downstairs neighbors to apologize in case their detector went off.

235,"Heyo, advice-givers! Might be a better question for a medical thread, but here we are.

Tl;dr: I have lived all my life with symptoms of autism or adhd, but because it was never explored when I was young (I’m 23) I’ve developed coping mechanisms and live a pretty decent life (mostly). Do I go in and get diagnosed, or keep living my life? 

Long version: 

I’m 23F. Certified “wiz-kid” who grew up into a high-achieving and hard working adult. Most people who know me in passing think I’m a fucking genius; my friends think I’m infallible, and a limitless bounty of fun facts, chill vibes, and solid advice. 

Get to know me a little better, though, and it starts coming apart.

(I’m going to use these terms as I understand them, so bare with me!)

I hyper-focus for 8-16 hours at a time. This means I work faster than everyone else.

I had special interests my entire life without knowing that’s what they were until later. 
Usually characters in media or specific stories— I had to know EVERYTHING, and my life can be organized by tracking these special interests. 

My working memory is noticeably bad. I’ve left burners on before, or food out. 

I disassociate mid conversation. I disassociate often tbh. My brain wants to think about something else or “hold on” to a thought so it doesn’t escape.

Talking to me is like playing bingo! You never know what topic I’ll give you next (even though it’s related, I swear!)

Now that may sound like ADHD to you, but let’s keep going!

I can’t do parties, crowded spaces, or loud noises or I WILL get upset and cry. I can’t tell you why, but it’s like putting me in a bee hive. I’ve managed to get around this by avoiding parties.

I do the raptor arm thing. T-rex arms? Apparently this is common for people with autism.

Sometimes I come off as having little/no empathy for others because what upsets them makes no sense to me.

The specifics of which one I have doesn’t really matter. What DOES matter is that I don’t know whether to go in and deal with it or keep chugging along.

I’m afraid if I lose my ability to hyper-focus, I’ll lose my leg-up when it comes to work. I’m not fucking around, I am disgustingly fast at what I do in no small part because of this hyper focus.

I like my special interests! 

I’m afraid I’ll lose my stellar long-term memory in favor of repairing my shitty working memory. 

On the other hand, I left a fucking gas burner on the other day, I can’t go to parties, and sometimes I can’t hold conversations very well. (Though if I focus, I can pretend to play the game— I’ve been put in leadership positions often and totally killed it!) 

Plus, some days are just... bad days. Like everything that isn’t the ONE THING i want to do becomes venomously distracting and annoying, which can lead me to be less than polite. I need a warning before plans change or I get SO upset— this includes “Hey, can you wash these dishes?” (That I forgot about and SHOULD WASH), when it is decidedly Planned Vacuuming Time.
I know this is illogical, and it’s taken me a long time to realize it IS something medical and not me.

236,"I liked this girl since January this year and talked to her every day over Snapchat and we hung out one or two times before COVID, her mom is strict so she was only recently allowed to go out and we talked every day of quarantine and I had a friend who helped me get confidence and helped me out mentally (he never talked to her) and so yesterday we had a fire with her, her friend, my self and it was at my friends house, it went good and then we went inside and we were all being that hyper you get when you’re really tired and we were all laying on each other and then when we got off they were spooning and didn’t stop for 1+ hours, she has made signs she likes me back but when I asked her the other night if she liked me (this was after I asked her and I said because I don’t want her to think I’m acting weird for no reason [dont judge me]) she said “idk” which is whatever, | keep in mind that this girl is against people who drink a lot (he drinks a lot) and really against people who do drugs and he does drugs as well |  idk what to do because she said she didn’t know how it happened and she’s also going through the shittiest week of her life and he’s going through relationship troubles.

He later blamed it on ME for not taking my move when he was upstairs and then wouldn’t let me get close for the entire night, keep in mind I don’t want to randomly start spooning a girl with other people there and he had the audacity to blame ME for it.

237,"Let me just give some essential info briefly to give some context.

I have been in a couple of relationships, only one of which was serious and long term (nearly two years), however, I wouldn't really say I have ever fallen in love before. This girl I have been seeing is quite special, and would say is deeply in love with me. I do quite fancy her back too, I sometimes feel like I actually do love her like no other girl I have ever loved. However, I can never bring my mind to commit, even though that has never been a problem for me in the past and was my goal when I was dating her. And now that she is mentioning it and asking me if we are boyfriend and girlfriend, I keep kinda running away from the question - while I don't even know why.

  
I do like pretty much everything about her, except a couple of things, some are fixable some are not - either way, I am fine and want her as she is.. I genuinely am deeply in love with her, and I hate this feeling of not wanting to commit and being scared of falling for her and putting on the label officially, as if I would miss out on things (or other girls) otherwise - sounds really nasty I know..  
I could have easily said yes when she asked if we are officially together and I wouldn't have lost anything, but with this one relationship, I don't wanna be rushing anything and wanna make sure that nothing is forced. And apparently, I cannot get myself to actually be official with her unless I feel like I am forcing myself, even though I actually have deep deep feelings for her.

Has anyone experienced something similar to this before? Does anyone have any explanation for this? It's a gutting feeling not being able to easily fall in love even when you finally do want to.

250,"Hey guys first time I’m posting or even popping into this subreddit. So this is me trying to get some advice cuz it’s a bit ongoing.

So, when I moved over to where I live now five years ago, a girl I’ll call Ellie, not real name, took a liking to me. Enough to ask me out for a Halloween dance in middle school. I decided to take her up on it, and thought i was lucky. I was pretty shy, guess I still am, and don’t have a girlfriend mostly cuz I keep to myself.  Anyway, I thought I’d had a catch, but after sometime, I realized there was more to a girlfriend than her just wanting to be your girlfriend lol. 

See, she wanted to spend every free moment she had with me. Every single one. Maybe I’m going on a tangent with this next part but her voice is just.. so piercing and annoying. I could hear her from across the cafeteria, while it was loud. While we’re on voice-related topics, she has a Spanish/Mexican accent, that makes me understand maybe half of what she says. This isn’t anything personal on my part, I’m just hard at hearing and sometimes need to ask people what they said several times to understand it, and that’s without an accent throwing a wrench in the equation. 

And this next detail is what made me dump her most of all. My pal Devon talked to me when I finally had some time to hang out with him and away from her. He was worried for me, and basically said, that she was pretty much stalking me in the halls, watching where I was going, and he had a feeling that she would, in his own words, “Go yandere-Chan on your ass.” So, yeah, that freaked me out, but I don’t wanna break her heart or anything so I tried to ride it out, maybe it was a weird phase in the relationship. Then someone who I’m a good friend with now but wasn’t back then had a chat with me. 

She had told me what Devon had told me earlier, this girl who we’ll call Sandra. Ellie had apparently done this before. She found a guy she liked and got obsessed with him, stalking him on-off for 3 whole years! It only ended when the guy moved away to another state, and she wanted me to warn me. 

So yeah, the same story being corroborated by two people, whom I have no memory speaking to each other, felt like reason enough to dump her. She took it.. surprisingly well. Said she wouldn’t mind if we stayed friends. I was open to that, except, friends don’t stalk each other, right?

So began a streak over a few years as we went into and through high school. I’d find her passing me by in the halls on my way to classes, and always acting angry when she saw me, but moving on. That couldn’t be weird, right? Well, except that I’m one passing period, the path she’d be taking to pass me would be completely on the other end of the small school. So, maybe she wasn’t just passing by me on her way to school. Idk I could be thinking too much into it. Oh, and one more thing. Almost every day, she’s be sitting at a table at lunch either a few tables from me or across the room, but always with a way to see the table I’d usually sit at. And when her table was a bit closer, I could occasionally look her way and see her pointing to me, and mentioning my name, as if she really was obsessed with me. Maybe coincidental timing, but that many times?

This went on for all my years at high school, which recently came to an end. We had a graduation ceremony that adhered to the things to try and prevent spread of the virus, but was still quite grand. We had a car parade and everyone’s cars gathered in a drive in theater where a video of the school announcing and congratulating the graduates played. Well, I met and reconnected with a few of my friends, including, lo and behold.. Ellie. I pretended to be friendly with her and what not, but before she left she had asked me for my phone number so we could talk and reconnect, and spineless me gave it to her.. 

So, just how bad is it? Well, in the four days that passed in the ceremony, she has called me at least three times in one day continuously. I didn’t want to fuel the fire and I’ve just let them all ring. Guys, I’m terrified, I don’t want a stalker who I can barely understand for a girlfriend, so let me ask you for some advice.

Judging by what I’ve told you, tell me. How can I permanently end this whole thing with her trying to pursue me? Or even should I?",03Jun2020,1
251,"Way-Back story: My dad met my mom as her drug dealer using a fake name because he had escaped Canadian prison and came to the US. They got pregnant with my brother and then me so they got “married”. My mom stopped using but my dad continued and was/is a very heavy drinker. They broke up when I was 5 and then he stopped visiting us when I was 7. When I was 12 I received a phone call from New Mexico looking for him because he has caused a deadly hit and run. Eventually he was caught and his identity fraud was discovered so he was deported back to Canada to finish his sentence. 

Fast forward to when I was 20, he found info about me from high school online and through the grape vine got in touch with me. I entertained the idea of having a phone relationship with him for a year and eventually my mom even paid for a flight for me to go visit him because he claimed he was dying from diabetes and wanted to see me “one last time”. During the visit he proceeded to pop oxy (he had just had half of his foot amputated from a diabetic infection), chase it with multiple beers, and then insisted that he drive in 6-feet of snow to another bar at which time he then began telling me what an awful person my mom was. This was when I decided no more. When I got home I told him I wanted nothing to do with him. 

Fast forward to when I was 31 and I went to a 10-day silent meditation retreat where I sincerely forgave him but also realized forgiveness doesn’t equate to a relationship. Part of my healing/forgiving involved me emailing him via social media that I had forgiven him and I hoped the best for him. He responded and I then asked why he left. He proceeded to again tell me what an awful person my mom was and everything was her fault. 
Side note: I know my mom is no saint, but she raised my brother and me without him and I am grateful to her for that. 
After he messaged me mean things about my mom being to blame for him leaving I again told him that I didn’t want him in my life and I wished him the best. 

Another side note: he has been telling my brother than he only has 3 months left to live for the last 5 years. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago (I’m now 33) and he keeps attempting to add me on social media outlets that i don’t use but I receive emails when people attempt to add me. 

I am honestly unsure of what to do. I really have forgiven him but each time that I attempted to allow him in my life he showed me what a mean and self-centered person he is. I doubt anything about his personality has changed so I don’t want to open myself up to another badgering from him about “how awful my mom is” nor do I want a guilt trip about him “wanting to see me one last time” (my brother had maintained a phone relationship with him for the last decade and he constantly makes my brother feel guilty about not visiting). 

Any advice is much appreciated!!",03Jun2020,1

255,"A lot of my panic attacks are triggered by arguments with my boyfriend. Usually during times when I’m really overwhelmed with life in general. He will sometimes say things that hurt my feelings. They aren’t insults, I’ve just been really traumatized by the way I was treated by my parents. My brain has a way of twisting everything that people do and say to me, and turn them into reasons why I’m worthless. I know that I’m not “normal” and I can’t expect everyone around me to know what upsets me. I wouldn’t expect my boyfriend to ever understand, plus these are my own issues that need to be managed with therapy (which I’m working on). 

My issue is that whenever I’m having a panic attack, my boyfriend ignores me. He will walk away and act like he doesn’t care. For me, this makes the whole situation worse because I just repeat over and over how nobody cares about me. I feel so scared and my face always goes numb, so I start to freak out even more. I really want to be held in these moments. It brings me back to all the panic attacks I had growing up, when my parents would ignore me. I would throw up and even passed out a few times and instead of being concerned, my parents accused me of being on drugs. 

I need to know if the problem all lies within me. Do I need to cope with these panic attacks alone? Would my boyfriend holding me even make a difference? If it does, how do I explain this in a way that he would understand?",03Jun2020,1

261," For starters, thank you for coming and reading this post. I have suffered from situational anxiety and depression my entire life, but I was never suicidal until my last relationship. Apparently my ex was suicidal and she was being monitored. Her parents used that benefit to fuck with me psychologically because I wasn't always perfect. I felt like I was stuck in a situation I really did not want to be in (being in that relationship with her because we just weren't good for each other), so I spiraled into depression and was convinced to see a psychologist. The psychologist let me take home some questionnaire and my ex had changed some of my answers. I had a gut feeling that the psychologist was corrupt because he automatically assumed I was schizophrenic without even listening to what was going on. Now for being monitored through my ex for an entire year and now my therapist because he thinks I'm suicidal, also reached out to my crazy ex-girlfriend and she told him some lies (I cannot confirm nor deny what she had said because I do not know what she said; I just know that what she had said was something that made them think I was suicidal). My psychologist will not share any of the patient information with me, nor respond to my emails about terminating treatment because it is a false treatment. Now for the most recent monitoring that makes absolutely no sense to me; I've tested this in many different ways just to prove that I was not inside my own head nor making these things up. For example; I stayed awake one night until 4 A.M., not in the best mood, but I live alone and honestly, was venting (I enjoy venting even to myself because of the way I was raised, I was not allowed to talk very much growing up) and I received a panicked phone call from my family asking if everything was okay, keep in mind that I wasn't talking to anyone or anything, just to myself and weird little instances like that have been happening nearly every day for the past year and a half. Friends calling and the first thing they say/ask me is ""what's wrong"" instead of saying ""hey, what's up"". I feel like I'm stuck in a situation where I do not belong, and it's making things really bad. It has affected my personal relationships, my future job opportunities, and god knows what else. I just want to live a life where there isn't any external interference, and I want my privacy back. What do I do?",03Jun2020,1
262,"I struggle with my ups and downs a lot. I know it's human nature, but just in these low moments I feel like all I'm doing won't mean anything when we are all in apocalypto in 30 years.

Especially during times like these. I promote, I donate, I sign petitions, but I feel I'm not doing enough for the black lives movement. And if I don't going on instagram for updates or if I don't share something I'm a bad person and people will think I'm doing this all for clout.

Pretty much everyone i’ve asked has been telling me to leave her because she’s kinda bossy, but I feel like it’s my role to help her out because I know she’s struggling but never really shows it. Even though she’s kinda hard to get along with I feel pretty close with her (not really in a relationship though) and just want to help her. I’m about 95% sure she wants to be more than just friends because she always sends things that you wouldn’t really send to a friend if you know what i mean. She constantly wants to talk with me which I usually don’t really want to not completely because of her, but because I just don’t feel like to talking in general.

270,"I’m a 24yo female who’s had a weird intense childhood with mental abuse and hearing of my mother’s physical abuse.. I repressed most of my memories and feelings about the situation which resulted in a huge dose of anxiety and bouts of depression.. this also triggered an existential crisis and a sort of soul awakening in me.. which when I ride the wave and try and experience life for the weird wonderful amazing thing it is, it helps a lot. Don’t get me wrong I’ve recently started anxiety medication after a pretty intense battle with this crazy going on so I know that it’s not an easy ride but I thought I’d share some philosophy’s of mine that help me see the bigger pretty picture.. 

. Everything we see before our eyes, everything you look at is something that once never existed.. only in someone’s mind. Man kind has the power to literally manifest something from nothing.. wether it be building a home a road a car or another human soul.. I believe that means something.. art, thought, consciousness.. love. It’s the most powerful feelings..

. I know the riots and protests are very scary at the moment but I do believe that if we hold our integrity close to us and use only the intention of love and justice in the face of hatred, ignorance  and corruption. But the love and solidarity of man kind at this moment in time -I believe- is genuinely some sort of miraculous moment in history and a movement of change.. 

. I heard one time that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.. which is what we are at the core of us.. a walking, talking, thinking bag of meat and bones being powered by some sort of energy source.. I believe that to be born a human is such a tiny tiny tiny tiny-probably more tinies- chance in the universe for that to happen.. so I think it all means something wether we’re alone out in the universe or not; to be here and now experiencing life and each other a family member a lover and a sunrise or your pet or a poem or a piece of music or instrument or psychedelic awakening, spiritual or religious awakening.. nature and adventure your friendships your memories your connections it’s all relevant and connected.. it’s all love and beauty and moments. I got a tattoo that says , we are golden. That’s what I believe we are as a product of this weird world but I think it means something so I keep fighting to help fight the good fight.

283,"My Mum is one of the kindest and most hardworking people I know and yet, she is constantly not listened to. People also deflect their own shit on to her all the time. For example, she’s currently volunteering at a crisis support hotline centre. She had an older gentleman on the phone the other day. He had told her that he had recently lost his wife last year (he’s around 80 as far as I know). My Mum recommended that he should seek help by going to his GP. She then told her manager that this person may be in crisis and it would be important to look out for him or maybe get someone to give him a referral to a GP. It’s important to note that the hotline workers cannot give counselling advice unless they have been trained. So in the end, the older man who my Mum had helped, actually made a complaint against her! He said that she made him upset because she brought up his dead wife! This is the complete opposite of the truth, my Mum didn’t even know about his wife until he told her! Lastly her manager is not listening to her. Mum was trying to explain that this man needs help, he’s reacting this way because he’s hurt. But the manager wouldn’t listen to her and even said that Mum wasn’t listening to her.

He would call me honey or sweetheart sometimes (I know how that sounds but it always felt in a more fatherly manner so I didn’t read into it too much). At times I almost questioned some of his comments, such as these. However I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and I sensed that there was no ill intent, and that he was maybe coming across differently than he intended.  

About a month ago I gave him my phone number with my first and last name, as he mentioned he may have some extra shifts for me in his department and would call me if he needed me (he’s not a manager but kinda like a supervisor). Until today, I never received any contact from him regarding shifts or otherwise. But today I received a text from him saying hello, and he also friend requested me on Facebook and sent me a message through messenger (he found my FB because I gave him my last name; we have no mutual friends so he must have looked me up, which made me a little uneasy) In the text he commented on my Facebook profile picture, which confused me until I checked my Facebook. It was all a little overwhelming, as he is quite a bit older than I am and I just don’t feel comfortable connecting with him outside work. I don’t want to accept his request because I mostly use FB for family and close friends and I honestly just don’t feel right about it.

I don’t know what the right thing to do is in this situation. I don’t want to just ignore the friend request and leave it in limbo, because I don’t want to offend him and have him ask questions later on, but I don’t want to accept it either. I’m not comfortable connecting with him in this way. I’m also not really comfortable bringing it up with him and talking to him about it. I won’t be leaving my job anytime soon and neither will he as far as I know, so I don’t know how to handle this in a way that doesn’t potentially cause repercussions for me at work.

I really think he’s just trying to be nice, but doesn’t understand that he may have crossed a boundary. I don’t know if I set myself up for this by friendly to him as well, as I am a very outgoing person, which may have invited further effort to developing our relationship. I see him quite often so I just don’t know how to handle this in a clear yet polite way.",03Jun2020,1

287,"This is a long and confusing one reddit so bear with me. So I have worked with this girl since my sophomore year of high school. We didn't go to the same school because she lived in the town next to mine but we knew each other from work. When she graduated high school she moved to my town and we started talking a little more. Turns out we got along really well and we slowly became better friends. However, all of my friends hated her (to be fair, she had a lot of personal drama prior to her finding out they were my friends, so the feeling was mutual) and all of her friends hated me . It never bothered either of us because we didn't really socialize outside of work, it was just nice to have someone to talk to in a otherwise boring job. Now our favorite virus strikes, and for the first two weeks of quarentine we're keeping in contact. We were actually talking more than we were prior to COVID. All of a sudden she drops off the map. I see she blocked me on all social medias, and all other forms of communication. I tried to think back wondering, ""did I say something? what just happened?"" Flash back to last week when we were at a memorial day party (nothing huge, just a few friend groups at a pool party). I walked in the door and made brief eye contact with her. Now I have an extremely good poker face, like I unintentionally throw off doctors when I describe my pain level. So I pretend to not notice her right away and I go talk to some of my other friends for a few minutes. As soon as I turned around, shes gone. I asked one of my friends where she went and apparently she got up and left as soon as I walked in. Didn't say a word to anybody. I know this is really strange and I am kind of worried about this, but I still haven't done anything crazy to contact her. I figured when businesses open up again I'll see her at work and I'll talk to her then. Now we have todays events. I went to the supermarket to pick up a few things and I seen one of our other co workers. She asked me about the email we got detailing the reopening procedures to which I responded ""What email?"". I called a few other people from work and they all said they got the same email that I didn't receive. To add a little extra background some people have tried to get me out of there every other week. It fluctuates every time between ""He beat me up"" to ""He stole money from the safe"". But it's the same few people every time and the company knows that these claims have no evidence to support them, in fact there is camera footage to prove my innocence every time. My HR file is thicker than most text books, all with false complaints. It probably could be used as a human resources encyclopedia of fire-able offenses (they started getting creative, ex: no boss I didn't stampede cattle through the office), without any evidence. I have thought about quitting several times because of them but my boss tells me every time ""they'll get whats coming to them, eventually they'll mess up big time"", just enough to keep me on the job. However he as also warned me ""Watch your back, if someone throws a curve ball complaint it could end you cause of this"". To be clear she hates the people filing these reports against me with a burning passion, so there is no way they're collaborating. So now you are caught up on current events, I have yet to speak to my boss about the email because I don't want to mess something up. Right now we are on temporary layoff from COVID and I don't want to make a call that might be my termination while on unemployment (not asking for advice on that, save that for r/legaladvice ). However I would like a bunch of strangers input on everything else. What is happening and what can I do?",03Jun2020,1
288,"First off I never in my life thought I would need the help of reddit but here I am. My mother is emotionally abusive and in some other ways verbal and physically

List of things my mom has actually done

Thrown my sisters phone against the wall so hard that it cracked and was very damaged( my sister couldn't use it anymore)

My mom is prone to outbursts especially if she has had a bad day she will take it out on my siblings and I. 

My mom has yelled and hurled insults at my sister over not making a savers run( a goodwill kind of place where you can drop off things that you want to donate) a few days after this my mom was talking about this with me and she said"" i guess im really stressed about moving"" AND TREATED IT AS SOME FUCKING JOKE WHEN SHE LITERALLY YELLED AND SCREAMED AT MY SISTER FOR NOT GETTING SOMETHING DONE.  MY MOM SAID THAT IF SHE WAS THERE SHE WOULD"" run you over with a car""

Most of the time it feels like im walking on eggshells around my mom. You can never tell what mood she is in and im always afraid of her screaming at me

( abuse that has happened to me) 

1 the grocery store incident
I tried to confide in my mom about I was going through and my mom put me down and basically dismissed the problem I was dealing with. I almost started crying but I had to scrape myself together( in the video games section of t a r g e t) I was very sullen for the rest of the time at target until we got to checkout when my mom asked me what was wrong and I said I was feeling sad( big mistake) my mom asked me why and I shut down and said that I didn't want to talk about it. My mom would not stop trying to pry me about it saying how I was"" destroying our relationship"" and trying to guilt me into saying why I was sad. Even though I was BEGGING for her to stop. She said that she "" wasn't going to leave it alone"" having someone pry you open emotionally and force you to tell them something is the most damaging hurtful thing a mother can do. Eventually when I did open up u( at the produce alie ) my mom put me down AGAIN. At this point I could not keep myself together and I started crying in the middle of a stop and shop.  

It took me three months to forgive her for this. Although I will never forget the look of disgust and pure distain and fury on my mothers face when I told  her what was wrong with me. 

I was completed destroyed when the grocery store incident was over. It took place on 12/28/19 and since I was on christmas break there was no escape from my mom.

There was another argument where my mom yelled at me and my siblings for ( not doing things her w a y) and she used the fact that I started crying against my brother which broke him down as well.( my brother is very resilient and confrontational/ he cares about me more then anything). My brother tried to run away because of what my mom did. How she tried to use ME in my already BROKEN CRYING STATE against my BROTHER. 

The rest of Christmas break was emotional hell. But I have some things that have happened as of recent. 

Lately my mom has been taking away meals from my sister as a punishment( my mother did this to me and my brother once./ locked us in the basement and told us that we could not eat until it was clean/ for six hours\) My mom will take away meals from my sister when she talks back./ doesn't do a chore. Ive actually thought about calling C.P.S over this but im not sure it's really worth it. ( my sister is 19) 

My brother has talked to my mom today about lessing the chore load so my brother can focus on schoolwork( nothing changed at all. My sister and I have to do three hours of yardwork every day.( used to be two hours) 

I don't see the chores as that bad but I feel as if my mom is taking a lot out of me and expecting a lot. 

( it has worked out in some ways. I can cook and clean for myself I know how to do my own laundry and I know how to do some house building things and yardwork. I am also 15 )
But parenting in the way that my mom does I think is very unacceptable.

Am I just being hormonal?
Am I taking this way to seriously?
What would happen if I called C.P.S?
What would foster care be like?
Am I really over thinking this?

**NOTE**

sometimes my mom can also be very nice on good days but things like this I believe should not be ignored and should be addressed 
I've already forgiven my mom for everything at the moment but I don't plan on keeping her in my life when I grow up

Thank you for listening to me whomever may read this

Anyways I had gotten a text the other day out of nowhere saying I had been scheduled for work again.

294,"This might be a bit hard to explain but I have no clue what to do anymore so here I am.

I'm a 20F who participates and owns a large discord community. We have around over 4k+ members who participate in the community, and majority of them are fine people who just hang out with each other in their own individual cliques. To keep things short, since I own the community and I am a female, I have been a target of online harassment and doxing many times. 5-6 people bot DM my address, phone numbers, etc. They send around my name and call my parents to tell them things about me that aren't true. I also get insulted and harassed about an incident of stalking that had happened from someone in this community, where they came to where I live to try to meet up with me. I have been diagnosed with PTSD relating to that incident, and don't really want to get into it, but basically I get jokes of people saying they're going to come to my house and rape me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the obvious answer is just to leave and not participate anymore, and disappear from this community. I've met a lot of my good friends through this community though, people who are genuinely good people and I have been friends with for 8+ years who rely on me to run it. I don't want to disappoint anyone. I also don't want to be weak and do what trolls would want me to do, which is trying to run me off from the community. But this has gotten to a point of affecting my health. I'm constantly anxious about checking my phone and seeing someone sending another threat or insult, or someone DMing me to tell me that someone has sent my dox to over 100 people again for no reason. I'm not an extremely ugly person, but I'd say I'm not really attractive either, and I'm extremely insecure about how I look and photos of me from when I was younger and generally was an overweight kid.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I'm at a loss about what to do, and need advice. I can't talk my parents about it and I don't really talk to my friends about it at all. I've made efforts to remove any presence of myself online, but since these individuals already have my information, there's not much I can do. Does anyone know how to handle doxing in the best way? Or harassment? They did not obtain the information illegally so the police are unwilling to help me, and I doubt if I just disappeared for awhile that they would stop.",03Jun2020,1
295,I believed an ex close friend of mine after an altercation both parties had almost a year ago. Person 1 pushed Person 2 to the ground after person 2 had shown up to their home over an argument I believe (from what person 1 &amp; 2 told) and Person 2 ended up having a scraped knee. Person 1 is a male person 2 female. I’ve known person 1 for years and person 2 we meet around town and I thought they were nice people but we weren’t friends. Hearing only person 2’s side originally the hearing person 1 I was confused on the whole situation and left myself out of it. Months and months go back I don’t talk to either of them but TimeHop posted a memory of person 1 and I from their bday years ago so I posted it completely forgetting about the situation at hand with person 2. Person 2 then unfollows me on everything and we just never speak. Since that day it’s been in my head how foolish I am to think so minimal of the situation.

296,"I've had issues with anxiety and depression for the last 4-5 years and have been on various medications over the last two.

I've spent my whole life thinking I was fat, but now that I actually am I realize I had a nice body shape before. I've tried to lose weight but I struggle to stay motivated because I just seem to keep gaining no matter what.

297,"Hi. In the scheme of things, this is probably not all that important. I know there’s a lot going on. (The fact that there’s a lot going on is probably why this feels so much worse.)

Anyway.

Yesterday we found out that my dog has cancer. She was not feeling well for the past couple of days, we took her in, and she had cancerous masses both on her spleen and her colon. They removed the masses on her spleen, but couldn’t the ones on her colon.

The veterinarians said that dogs usually live about three months. 

I do not know any more specifics about the condition, because my parents haven’t really told me. I don’t want to ask.

Before I go further I want to say that the dog we had before my current ones was very old and also had cancer. She got to a point where she could not walk, and my family put her down. My mom to this day believes that the dog we put down would somehow have recovered.

I say this because my parents, especially my mother, seem to have no intention of now euthanizing my dog. At the moment she is not in significant pain, but is throwing up, groaning, and is much less mobile than she was already a few weeks ago.

I do not want to watch my dog grow weaker and weaker. She sleeps in my room every night. I do not want to wake up one morning and find her dead. I do not want to hear her dying moans or her dying groans. I do not want to hear or see any of these things. The night before we took her to the vet, she made a noise which was only her retching, and it scared me very very very much. I can’t imagine having to hear worse. 

I feel like we are torturing my dog. I know that we love her, and we want her to be comfortable, and I want that too. But I don’t feel right with this. I don’t want to spend the next three months so scared of when she might die, watching her grow weaker. It doesn’t help that my mom continues to remind me about everything, continues to tell me that I need to cherish every minute with her. 

I love my dog. I do not want to watch her die. I do not want us to force her to wither away until the cancer slowly eats her up. I don’t know how to express any of these things, or if I’m even right to feel that my dog should be euthanized before she is suffering each day, before it gets too bad. Does that make me a bad person? I can’t talk about any of these things, because my mom will hate me.",03Jun2020,1

The numbers are at an all time high and I understand now is the least safe to visit/be visited, but I'm really wondering when it would be considered acceptable and safe to see her once again.

I worry that if I wait for numbers to go down, I'll be contributing to a second wave. I've continued to work at my essential job, and she will be resuming her work soon as well.  At what point would it be safe to see her again?",03Jun2020,1
299,"Get ready cause this is long but worth it. In 2016 a friend of mine (who we will refer to as the “girl”) slept with her creepy neighbor. She lost her virginity to him at the age of 18 and he was 56. But let me tell you this man was a creepy mofucker, he would ask her to smoke weed with him in his nearby studio knowing she had a pretty sheltered upbringing, so he groomed her to believe he was having sex with her so she can have experience with other boys her age, and the first time they had sex she was nervous about losing her virginity so he made her do anal. We told her it was weird, wrong, and risky because she babysits his kids, he still lives with his ex-wife (divorced but living together for the kids), his ex-wife and the girl’s mom are very close friends, and this girl still lives with her mother and grandfather. After we convinced her a couple of times, she finally agreed and told our friend group she would stop sleeping with him. So we were under the impression that after the 3 times they had slept together prior to this, she was done. Turns out she had been with him multiple times after that, plus the man sent her dick pics and she sent nudes too. The girl had been secretly telling one of our other friends all this so the whole group doesn't find out. Unfortunately for her, the ex-wife found out about their little affair and instead of confronting her, she started to spread rumors in our church so soon enough our parents found out and told us to not hang out with the girl anymore. We know she doesn't love this dude but every time she fucks him she goes and tells our friend like she's proud and we feel like she’s honestly doing it for attention and validation. And even tho she acts like she tryna keep everything lowkey, she knows damn well if you tell one of us you basically telling all of us so she tryna prove herself or some shit. To be honest, it’s not like we would have cared either way but this man is grody, still lives with his ex-wife, she babysits their kids, her mom is good friends with the ex-wife, they literally live in the same building … so the whole situation just seemed really messy and we tried saving her from it. Fast forward to 2019, we all live in our home town and she moved to a different state late 2016 to “get away from everything” and the guy and his ex-wife and kids moved to Vegas as they said they were gonna remarry and start over. As time went on our friend group just stopped talking as much but we still hang out from time to time. One day, some of us were heading to Vegas for a birthday party and one of our friends gets a message from the girl saying she was in town and wanted to hang out. She told her sorry but we were on route to Vegas and the girl said “Why? there are so many business conventions there this weekend” to which my friend replied  “how do you know that?” and she proceeded to say some bullshit. About a month later the girl ends up calling our friend again and spills the TEA! The girl ends up saying that she was back in town to see her mom PLUS get an abortion. Apparently she ended up also moving to Vegas earlier in the year to be back with the same fucker and his family as he and his now-wife again gave birth to a newborn. Who knows how many times they bumped uglies. Anyways, she said that she’s pretty sure she got pregnant from their last encounter WHICH WAS A THREESOME WITH THE WIFE! Honestly not offended by it but they are legit in their 50s and busted, crusty, and musty and she’s in her early 20s and supposed to be thriving. Not to mention this was an abortion she didn’t want but the guy and his wife gave her money to get it done and she decided to do it here so she could have some support from her OG friends. During the year, our friend would receive texts from the girl and sensed something weird going on as the girl would randomly ask for $20 or $30 from time to time. Our friend would never ask the girl why and just sent it to her knowing that her family is kinda fucked up. (Mind you her parents are divorced, her dad is not in her life as much, her mom is supposedly a call-girl for older men IN OUR CHURCH and her granpapi gives everyone the creeps.) What we also suspect is that she actually had the kid with the dusty man and didn’t have the abortion she had come in town to get earlier. We think she had the kid cause one time she posted pics of her and a kid then deleted them quickly. Our suspicions were somewhat confirmed when the wife of dusty man came to town and had told her family that the girl did in fact NOT go through with the abortion and threatened to go to the authorities if the guy didn’t help her with taking care of the child. He agreed and I guess she has a kid now but we also really don’t know cause she never told our friend?? Anyways her life looks pretty crappy because, on top of all this shit, she hasn’t really cared about school or a career, just going from random job to job. We all feel bad for her and she has been our friend since preschool and while we don’t talk all that much anymore, we don’t like how she’s 1) Fucking up her life at the age of 23 … 2) Having shit be talked about her in church and … 3) Having to be in the same house with this dusty man whom she doesn’t love and possibly has to take care of a kid that she does not know how to take care of because her family and upbringing is fucked up and has no real support. So the question is, how do we help her/what should we do in this situation? As far as the girl knows, there is only one person that knows the whole story and it’s our mutual friend but actually we all know cause our friend was genuinely concerned and honestly that is some tea she spilled. Any advice would help.",03Jun2020,1

301,"Okay y’all I am straight up panicking. 

Some context: I [20F] am a college student looking for a job this summer, since my normal summer gig is closed due to covid-19. I am pretty desperate and have started applying to tons of places around town and even took the recommendation of a family friend to apply as a factory worker for the company he works for. This company drug tests so after applying I stopped smoking for a few days to see if I would hear anything. After not hearing anything for a week I went back to smoking. BUT NOW, he heard I had applied and emailed the hiring manager to recommend me. Which is awesome and so nice... however now I’m panicking about passing a drug test. 

So I am 20 year old, female, 5’2” and about 175lbs. I smoke a couple days a week alternating between smoking a spliff mix in a Dart One Hitter and taking 3-4 hits on a basically empty dab pen. Most recently I use the dab pen past night. (Please no judgment I am out of shape and basically dankrupt)

302,"I’m sorry for the very melodramatic title but it truly is how I feel on a daily basis. I graduated HS at age 17, went to a university that was way too expensive for 1 yr that I regret terribly to this day. I dropped out because it was a waste of money and I wasn’t sure about what I wanted to study. I don’t think I was ready for such a big change. I chose a college over 600 miles away from home. I’d never really been away for long periods of time especially not at that age. I have a family relative in particular who has always been a huge part of my life and I love them dearly, although they are extremely overbearing and manipulative. They stress me out. They coddled me from a very young age which I later found out in college, was a sh*t show because it led to me being extremely passive and submissive in situations for a huge part of my life. After I dropped out I stayed in the college state for 3 months subletting a apt downtown (never again). I was terrified of telling anyone. I was 19 at the time and after being alone rather in a dorm, campus, or apt I started getting used to the “unfriendliness” reputation of the area. Although I’ve never experienced a rude person, maybe I’ve been it? Who knows. But I liked it, how you could almost become invisible in the crowds of the downtown area. That soon had to come to an end because my mom expected me to come home after “college” let out for summer. I had to pack all of my stuff from my little sublet apt and try to manage to fit all of it into two baggage claim items. Since then I’ve felt stuck. I’ve had meaningless jobs. I’ve started new hobbies, tried running to increase the happy hormone in my head so that maybe I could have motivation to get it together. Everyday it’s the same question and everyday it’s the same sad response. Because in truth, I really don’t know. I think of my future nonstop. “So what are you going to do?” “Without me I don’t know how you could live” etc. I recently applied for a dental hygiene program. Mainly because of the salary. Is that immoral? And if so? Does that matter? I want to get out. I’m genuinely sad when I’m here, I’m not me",03Jun2020,1

304,"First time i'm doing a long post like this, so please excuse my mistakes.

I'm m/19 and currently I'm in the second year of professional training in an office job.
I tend to get attached to people to easy and it's hard for me to let lose.

My instructor is f/23 and this post is about her.
2015 she started working in the same office department as i do now.
2018/2019 she moved to a different city 1,5h away.
In the summer of 2019 she got promoted to the personal assistance of the regional manager.

I noticed a slight change in her character but nothing to big.
Her new home was im the same direction as mine ( i also live 30-40 minutes away from work by car) so we drove together sometimes.

I could always speak to her about my problems and i value her opinion very highly.

For example arround my 18th birthday i had many arguments with my mom and i got kicked out in the end. I was with my dad every weekend, now i live there permanently. 
Because of her I still have a good relationship with my mom and I'm happy about that.

Few weeks ago my dad had a stroke.
My dad was in the hospital until last Friday, she was the first non-familymember I could speak to.
She was supportive and said i could take time off, if i need to.

When she told me that she was quitting, I played it cool asked why and about future plans but I haven't said how much I'll miss her. She's like big sister to me. 
She said we'll stay in touch (dinner with colleagues and stuff) but it's easy to lose a friend if you don't see him in person.

So I'm asking for your advice with...

-Should I tell her how I'll miss her?

306,"Okay, so we have some new neighbours who have been blowing what I found out is a shofar almost every day. We had no idea they had kids for the first while because they never came outside. The kids finally emerged outside and somewhat warmed up to my kids until the dad found a spider man helmet on his lawn. I didn’t hear it but apparently some other kids got yelled at by the dad and he was going off on them saying that he was going to break the helmet and that Spider-Man is a demon and whatnot. 
Since that the neighbours just stayed inside and dad just came out to blow the horn. This past Friday the police showed up to their door for some reason and the dad was fuming. He blew his shofar horn out in the middle of the street and was getting all pumped up yelling “yeah yeah” and now the whole family hasn’t been around for about 5 days. It’s super weird though because they have a small vehicle and I guess they somehow fit two adults, 3 teenage kids, and 7 puppies and adult dog In there and left somewhere. I’m just totally confused on where they would have gone or what may be going on. 
Anyone have any insights on that religion or anything?",03Jun2020,1
307,"Hi, I'm 14 and I wanna get this off my chest and get some advice. So some backstory:
When I was halfway in 1st grade my school closed down. My parents decided that they would homeschool me and not send me to the school that students we're moving to because of the area. They got me hooked up with a site and basically made me just get on it for a random amount of time. It wasn't everyday that I got on it (my memory is iffy,this was 7 years ago) after idk how long of that they put me back in school for 3rd grade. Only lasted till some time after picture day. Homeschool for a little bit, not teaching much, and throw me into 4th grade because I kept begging to go back. Lasted a few months and took me out because of ONE incident that happened (I was 9 mins you) and took me out with the excuse ""oh it'll happen again and just get worse"" time skip 5 years and them doing nothing to educate me and expect me to do all the work and understand it with no help from them. I barely remember subtraction, I can't do 99% of multiplication for nothing (the easy ones, 2s, 5s, 9s, and 10s) I don't know what the neck division or fractions are, I'm not caught up with my grade what so ever and just taking a glimpse at what I should know makes my head hurt. When ever in with friends or someone mentions school I get anxiety and wanna break down and cry. I can do addition, but I'm very slow and I think I have ADHD (inherited from mother) which makes me feel embarrassed. I already called our CPS on a different issue (apparently the teacher called when I was 9 or something due to a mishap) and I've made 2 calls regarding the aforementioned and something else and I was told by my mother not to call again (she doesn't want issues or me being put into a foster home) and idk what to do. I wanna get a work permit and all and get a driver's permit next year but this is the biggest setback in my life so far. I don't know what to do",03Jun2020,1

309,"Hello :)

25M (almost 26) Canadian. I have only been intimate twice in my life (both were with sex workers at the beginning of the year (in January 2020) before the COVID19 pandemic descended upon us. Before both of those sessions, I had been a virgin who had never been intimate in any way with a female. I am glad I got it done before COVID19 because it appears COVID19 will linger on for quite a while. I am a single man and have never been in a relationship. I have been self-isolating and social distancing ever since the pandemic began and have been left feeling very lonesome in the process. I have, indeed, been wanting to feel intimacy again. I have not been able to get sex organically (for some complicated reasons which should be for another post) and so, before the arrival of COVID19, I had been thinking it may be a good idea to continue exploring sex with sex workers (even if it at least just one more session and then perhaps quitting the hobby altogether). I found that the previous sessions helped me greatly in many ways. I am not sure if the arrival of COVID19 though signals the end of this hobby. Some sex workers and some massage parlours have started resuming services as of yesterday and today. I don't know if, however, at this point because of COVID19, the massage parlours would only be giving handjobs as opposed to full service. I would not be that interested in just a handjob. It makes sense to assume, however, that they wouldn't be going further than a handjob although I'm not quite certain.

I woke up quite super early today and for some reason, thought of just entertaining the possibility of visiting a massage parlour. I thought if I am the first client on the first day of their resuming services and if I take safety precautions of wearing a mask etc, maybe I wouldn't run into major risks of contracting COVID19 ? I ended up not going because I was so undecided. I spent much of the day contemplating this issue only to end up watering down the prospect of being a first/early client if I did indeed go for it. However, other massage parlours are yet to open later still, at which point that possibility could arise again. In the meantime, I had been thinking of reports in Italy that the virus is losing its potency and was wondering if there is room for more potency to be lost as time goes on. However, the WHO dismissed those claims as lacking evidence. I think I will likely end up continuing to self-isolate and abstain until the pandemic is over and a vaccine is developed but the lack of intimacy is kind of getting to me a bit, especially that I live alone too. I am in Montreal Canada which has been hit hard by covid19. What do you think about this? Should I continue to abstain by not visiting any massage parlours or not seeing any sex workers until a vaccine comes out? Are you facing the same issues of longing for intimacy and how are you coping with this?

Just a little bit more perspective regarding my situation that may perhaps be of relevance to my current feelings: As I said, I live alone. I have had very very little contact with humans closing in on 3 months or more now. I assume that is the case for many other people as well. I certainly don't mean to claim I am singularly facing this issue and thus put down others' experiences in the process but it is getting to me a bit :( and I just felt like wanting to talk to someone about it.

Thank you so much in advance :)

TL; DR: Single man feeling so lonesome as months pass by during isolation. Lack intimacy. Entertained the idea of seeing sex workers but probably will continue to self-isolate and abstain. Felt like I wanted to talk to someone about how to cope with this and get people's opinions/advice.",03Jun2020,1
310,"So, I'm 25, I've been jobless since 2016 through honestly sheer laziness and the fact I don't want to waste my time in a field I don't want to be in (probably bad mindset). I have a 2:1 bachelors degree in a field I can't really pursue due to where I live and it's a tricky industry to get into and earn a comfortable living. My dilemma is this; I want to apply for apprenticeships here in the UK in the IT field so I can maybe get a job in the gaming industry somewhere down the line. But I don't know if I  should lie about my job history (I've only had one job which I had for 2 years), or just make something up completely to fill the gap, because I don't really want to turn up to an interview and just be like ""yeah, I was just too demotivated to find any job""",03Jun2020,1
311,"I (now 17) have been internet friends with this guy (now 19) for about a year and a half. Since our first conversation in 2018, we’ve gotten along pretty well to the point that he feels that we have a sibling relationship. Personally, I don’t feel the same way, but that’s besides the main point.

He’s really into gaming and writing, so he’s taken it upon himself to create his own Minecraft Role play series. Additionally, he has a team of people (that he doesn’t pay btw) to help him with production. I, unknowing of what would happen later, volunteered to help out with art, writing, and such in fall of 2019. 

It wasn’t until this year that I heard him and several other of his friends say the n-word blatantly in a discord call. I was extremely taken aback, and when voicing my discomfort the responses I got were:

“Yeah, we don’t censor people here.” (my friend, the owner of the server)

“____ is black, and she doesn’t care that we say it.” (the referred person is 14 years old)

“You’ll get used to it.” (in a joking kind of way)

I was speechless. Despite knowing how disrespectful and devaluing this mindset is, I felt I wasn’t prepared enough to tell them off. I didn’t have the knowledge and courage to do so. I fell silent for the rest of the call, not knowing what to do. I still don’t, unfortunately. 

Many other friends that I’ve talked to about this have told me to retract my service and take back the art I have done for this friend. I plan on leaving the team before they release their first episode, but there are many smaller projects I want to finish. 

Recently, it happened again in a more private call. I’m disturbed at the fact that my friend feels comfortable enough to say these kinds of things around me, but I don’t know how to leave. Truthfully, I’m afraid of losing a friend and having people turn against me. There are about at most 10 other friends of his that support him and have this mindset. They’re bold and not afraid to start drama/confrontation. Obviously, I’m the opposite. 

Should I call him out? Do I go back on my initial intention of helping him out with something that means a lot to him? Is it wise to cut off ties with him completely, or do I educate him? Do I put my personal morals/ideals before a friend?

I’m not too educated myself, so if you want, you can send me any resources about racism and segregation. But I am attempting to do self-research.",03Jun2020,1

313,"I answer the phones for a medical clinic (among other things). And I've been doing all right, I've done this work before at another clinic, but really didn't have the best time with phones. Fortunately I was moved to billing so I didn't really have to deal with the urgent calls that came in.


But I'm at a new job now, and I'm on phones all day. My biggest fear is mishearing someone saying something serious, or someone just casually mentioning something that was actually important health wise, and instead of getting them to a nurse I just end the call as usual.


I'm stressed and I'd just rather do anything else than answer the phones. Even answering billing calls was better because they weren't calling with medical issues, they were calling with stuff that was less likely to be life and death. But I can't just ask to transfer to billing here, because it's done in a centralized location like 100 miles away. This job pays better than my old one, too. It's just... aagh.

314,"Hey so I'm a 25 year old male and I have been dating this 20 year old female for 3 years now. We get along very well and occasionally we may disagree on something but we always seem to work through it. A few months ago before this pandemic, she moved into my Toronto penthouse with me and we've been quarantining together ever since. 

We butt heads sometimes because I came from a wealthy household while she didn't and we cant see eye to eye on certain topics such as politics and economics but we put it besides us and we don't let this get in the way of our appreciation for each other. At first I was dreading not being able to go out but I actually became so much closer with her through these past few months locked up together, it feels like we're back in our honeymoon phase almost!! 

But yesterday she told me something about her that really didn't sit well with me. She grew up in a poor household, with her father constantly working both as a truck driver and a construction worker while her mom frequently cheated on him while he was away with random guys she would bring home. Her mom would abuse substances and frequently hit her, but I knew all this before. The bombshell that she dropped on me was that she had been raped before by one of the guys that her mom brought home.

I felt really bad when she told me this and she even cried, but at that moment all I could think of was, that means I wasn't her first like she had told me. Now I know this may sound selfish but, I loved her because I felt that she was pure. Girls in my circle are always so snobby and slutty, I don't like them. I thought she was a pure girl from the poor side of town who I could take in and fall in love with, but after hearing that she had been raped, she is no longer pure in my mind.

I told her to never mention it to me again and she agreed, but I don't think she understood the reason why I asked her to. I don't want to bring this up because she was so emotional when she told me, but I also don't want a girl with me who has been raped before. 

What should I do guys? How do I break this to her? That I don't want to be with her anymore and how do I tell her to move back in with her mom without being rude. She has grown used to the lifestyle I've provided her with so its hard to break it to her. 

Thanks guys!",03Jun2020,1
315,"I’m posting on here because the last time I posted on relationship advice the advice I got was “use the right there” and I was in tears. But I didn’t edit the theres and if it bothers you that much don’t read, I just really need help. 

I feel like a monster, a manipulator, and a liar. I haven’t felt this much guilt in my entire life. I broke up with my boyfriend out of no where. After weeks of acting happy and giving him love and care I ended things and I feel bad.

To give a backstory, two years ago I was in an narrasstic abusive relationship. One of things my ex did was ignore me for weeks just to make me more desperate and clingy when she talked to me again. It was a form of manipulation and she was always able to somehow make me feel guilty for the reason she ghosted. This along with isolation, body shaming, gas lighting, and humiliation left me depressed, anorexic, and bulimic.

I got fully treated after two years and I have never been happier. I wanted to start dating again so I found this guy online (I’m able to have an attraction to men and women.) He was really sweet, funny, and cute, and we were really compatible. He was an equestrian and he was really passionate in horse riding, owning two farms. We would ft a lot and he would make me feel so good. We committed quickly, after two weeks saying “I love you.” I had an inability to say no to him though, if I said no to my ex she would ignore me and hate me, so I always went along with what he wanted, even if it didn’t make me happy. 

But then we started talking less. A baby horse was being born on the farm so he had to give more attention to him. He would sometimes snap me, send pictures of the horse and stuff, but we overall talked less. It started to remind me of the nights my abusive ex would ignore me, and I started feeling insecure and anxious. I barely got sleep, I cried a lot, my emotions were unstable. But when he did check on me I would say “I’m so happy, it’s fine, I love you.” After a few really bad and depressing nights with acting like I was happy, I couldn’t do it anymore.

His initial reaction to the break up was easygoing. He would say things like “Oh okay...” I still felt bad, I didn’t want him to be sad, but he wasn’t angry, which I was scared of because then it would of felt like my ex all over again. But the second day things changed. “Thanks for leading me on, your real honest. Stop acting like you happy when your really not.” He screenshoted our chat and I’m afraid he’ll post it on his story. He ended the chat by ignoring me, and that hurt me the most because that’s exactly what my ex would of done.

I feel terrible because I did in fact lead him on. He didn’t deserve it, he didn’t mean to make me feel that way, but he did. I’m trying to make him forgive me, but it’s really hard because he refuses to listen. Any advice would help, and any advice to not lead people on in the future would help as well.

Edit: this is also the first time I have ever broken up with someone. I have always suffered from fear of hurting people. I’m kinda of proud I had the guts to do it, but I don’t think I’ll ever do it again.",03Jun2020,1
316,"So, I'm in my early years of adulthood living in California. I've been thinking about it for awhile now and it sounds quite nice to move out and finally be my own person and such.

Currently I have a minimum wage job working a normal 40+ hour or so work week, so that's a start at least.

Besides that though, I don't know what to expect with moving out. I don't know if I would be able to afford all the renting, food essentials, and utility bills. It seems difficult trying to account for it all.



*So quite basically,* I'm looking for anyone who can lend some advice on moving out from their parents house for the first time.

Like things I need to keep track of and plan for, small details I might overlook while forming plans. Any mistakes I can avoid or tips on making it easier?

317,"I want to preface this with saying that this is a throwaway account.

With everything that has been happening to the world around us, I wanted to take responsibility for my past actions. I am an Asian-American who has casually used the n word with my friends, and I was angry at myself for supporting BLM with the past I have had that I never apologized for. In my tweet, I owned up to my speech, expressed my disappointment in myself,and discussed how I have since learned how impactful words are. I mentioned that it was not my place to EVER say such slurs, and i apologized for my shameful ignorance. i have never publicly said racial slurs (on social media, specifically), however, it is something that i deeply regret and care about.

Today while eating dinner, we were talking about the way we portray ourselves, and i brought up my apology. Immediately, my brother and dad (who is very “corporate America”) told me to delete it, and that I am outing myself for no reason. They said I will never get a job if they find that tweet, and it will take long to recover. Honestly, it scared me because i know it’s true. However, this was never about ME. I wasn’t apologizing to protect myself, i apologized to be accountable for my disgusting actions in my past. 

Now i’m stuck, extremely anxious, and clueless. Please, if you have ANY advice, I would be willing to listen. Whether it be criticism or not, I will appreciate anything.

319,"This is a new account because I signed out of reddit and forgot my password. I made this account just now to ask this question.

Everyone in this story went to high school together. We are in college now, but living at home bc of COVID and summer. My boyfriend is pretty good friends with 2 girls, who I’ll call girls 1 and 2. I have hung out with them several times before, and was already acquaintances with the girls outside of their friendship with him. 

Today girl 1 invited him to go camping with them and girl 3. She told him that I can’t come because girl 2’s family is worried about her being around too many people due to COVID. I’m not sure I buy that because we have hung out with girls 1 and 2 recently. He believes girl 1 but isn’t sure he’s going to go, and definitely won’t if I tell him I’m uncomfortable with it.

I trust him 100%, and I don’t think any of the girls have feelings for him, just to get that off the table. However I have suspected that girls 1 and 3 didn’t like me in the past.

320,"hello, i’m really shaken up right now so i’m sorry if i make any typos or blabber. 

so i was with my ex boyfriend, we’ll call him Z, for almost three years, we got engaged a little bit after we hit 2 years, we lived together for 8 months in our own apartment. I supported us financially, he had a bad childhood and was a troublemaker. he went to jail 4 times before he was 19. anyways, during the relationship he slowly became addicted to multiple drugs, i did everything i could for him, i tried to help him as much as i could but he didn’t want the help. as time went on he became more and more abusive, first being emotionally and mentally then he started getting physical. he went to jail for punching me in the face in April of 2019, i stupidly took him back and stayed w him until November of 2019. Throughout the last year of our relationship he would constantly belittle, insult, and yell at me as well as slapping me whether it be on the chest, arm or face. The breakup was messy and he was still obsessively texting me up until he went to jail for burglary in February of 2020. A mutual friend just told me that while Z and i were together Z told our friend that he fantasized about slitting my throat while cuddling, cutting me, strangling me, and just harming me in general. I’m so distraught and shaken right now because there were a few times my ex actually asked me to let him cut me on my arms or thighs. I trusted this man more than anyone in the world and he wanted to kill me. He went to therapy for a few mental illnesses but never stayed on top of his appointments. He has another court date June 5th (3 days) and may get out of jail then.

322,"Before I say anything, I just want to state that I’m not the best at articulating my thoughts, so this post may all over the place. Sorry in advance - a TLDR will be at the bottom!

My brother seems to have anger management issues, and this might be exacerbated by his narcissism and stubbornness. He doesn’t handle accountability well, which is what I believe is the pinnacle of the problem, and this is all causing unnecessary family drama and a potential breakup with his girlfriend. I really don’t want this breakup to happen because I believe that his girlfriend is the best thing to happen to him in a long time. We just got done talking and what she told me sounded like unconditional love on her part. She thinks he hates her now because of a fight that happened today (which he blames her for), which is awful and adds so much stress to her. 

He has a short fuse and gets angry at the littlest of things. He is also highly competitive and no matter which game he plays, he always has to win or he blames his loss on someone else. Every time he  loses a game he gets into a sore loser mentality and  the game isn’t fun anymore. Most of the time he ends up storming off and cursing out people. When his girlfriend is there, she has to go and calm him down before he comes back. But every time this happens, he never says that he’s sorry. He just blames it on something else. 

Today was one of the worst days for my brother and his girlfriend (23F) as well as myself and my other sibling. All four of us were playing a game and he got competitive (like he always does) and started getting angry when we three decided to not take the game seriously. He stormed off, and cursed out my other sibling and said some really harsh things. He then went to his room. Things escalated from there when he told his girlfriend to leave the house and didn’t say another word. This is the second time he’s told her to get out of the house. She’s been a guest at my father’s house for about 3 weeks, and 2 weeks ago this exact thing happened. However this time, he threatened to break things and harm himself if she didn’t leave.

She left, and so did my sibling and I because we did not want to be around him because he started banging on walls and throwing stuff around in his room. I had a panic attack on the way to my mother’s house (my parents are divorced, and this happened at my father’s). Now we are spending the night at my mother’s. He tried contacting me earlier, but I didn’t answer because I knew he was trying to get me to take his side.  His girlfriend and I just had a conversation about what will happen tomorrow because there are two options: A) he doesn’t speak to her and goes back to his college campus because my father is kicking him out, B) he talks with his girlfriend and sorts things out with both her and my father.

Let me remind you that this whole situation happened because he lost a game that we didn’t take seriously. And then he blamed this whole thing on everyone but himself.

I love my brother, but the crux of this issue is his inability to be accountable when things go awry. I hate that I don’t have a solution to this. My father tried talking to him earlier today, but nothing worked. My sibling and I keep stressing to him and my father that he needs counseling/therapy or some sort of medication. The thing is, he is a grown adult and is too stubborn to admit that he needs therapy and so he says he doesn’t need it. I’m afraid that without professional help, this situation will happen again, and I’m afraid things might get physical. I’m struggling to find a solution. I’m desperate. Please, is there any way I can help my brother? 

TLDR; my stubborn brother keeps getting into more and more fights with my family and his girlfriend. He doesn’t want to see a therapist for his anger issues. He doesn’t think he needs counseling. He hasn’t apologized to any of us or his girlfriend (who he hurt the most imo). How can I (or any of my family members) fix this?",03Jun2020,1
323,"First a little background.

Like I said, I’m almost 25 years old. I live at home, dropped (flunked) out of college about 2 years ago. I’m considered “highly functioning” on the autism spectrum. My biggest interests in this world are sports (mainly baseball) and film. I have a 20+ hour a week job that I’m going to be going back to here soon (I’ve been off because of the Corona Virus. I also have two lower paying jobs that are much closer to what I want to be doing with my life but like I said, they don’t pay much. I think it is important to note that I have a long list of mental health problems in my life but thanks to neurofeedback and other forms of therapy, I am doing better than I have since I was very young. Would I consider myself happy? No, but I’m not suicidal anymore. I’m not horribly depressed, I still have a long ways to go but I’m proud of the strides I’ve taken. 

I’ve always wanted a girlfriend, and I think early in my life I probably wanted one too badly, and when I was in high school I had several very bad, traumatic experiences with women. Because of this, I developed serious trust issues (that I still have) and I went through college without ever mustering up the courage to even ask a girl to get a drink. All those past experiences really scarred me. I think for a long time I believed that if I had a girlfriend, I’d be happy. That was an incredibly stupid and narrow-minded way of thinking and I’m sure I came off as very desperate and creepy. I never meant to be, I was just sick. Like I said, I’ve changed. The biggest issue now is confidence.

Basically what I’m asking for is advice regarding what I can do (if anything) to try and figure out how to really take that next step and meet women. I would like a girlfriend. Hell, I’d just like to go on a date. I used to just be such a baby about the whole thing and lament all my failures with women. I don’t do that anymore. I just don’t believe it’s that much of a possibility. I’ve become very jaded and personally I just don’t believe that there is anyone out there willing to put up with my baggage. I mean well, I’m a very kind person with a big heart, but I have a lot of flaws and while I don’t believe there is anyone out there willing to put up with them, I would kinda like to try again. I'll be willing to answer any questions you might have though I won't be willing to give away too much private information. Thank you

324,"TLDR: Shame motivates engagement in socially normative behavior. Should white people leverage this to spur supportive action from outspoken racist family members in an effort to further assist the anti-racism and equity movement?

I am a white person and have some flagrant racist family members (e.g., uncles, cousins) who are not open to owning up to their racism, let alone contribute as an ally to the anti-black-racism movement. Instead, they are responding to social media posts that call for concrete action aimed at eliminating and rectifying systemic racism with misdirection, goalposts-moving, and ad hominem attacks. Their replies to their white family members’ unfavorable responses to such tactics are gross, but they reserve their most hateful replies for—surprise, surprise—Brown allies’ responses. (Sweet baby jesus fucking christ, we need to do better!!)

Here’s where the possibility of “policing” such racist white people (via shame) into complying with financially supporting anti-racism efforts comes into play:

My beloved parent and grandparent both passed from COVID (mega sucks, but—as a white person—luck of the draw; reminder for white ppl reading this, Black and Brown people are disproportionately affected by Covid), and my mother and I are sitting on memorial services for them until people can safely congregate again. Would it be useful to publicly call out my racist family members—who espouse their go-to coded “family is family, no matter what political differences you may have” rhetoric—on their racism and commit to the stance that their attendance at my parent’s and my grandparent’s (their sibling’s/cousin’s/uncle’s) eventual memorial services is prohibited because flagrant racists who are not willing to pay reparations are not welcome to formally grieve? But point them to ways they can begin to contribute to anti-racism efforts—namely, by donating some substantial percentage of their annual income (e.g., 10-20% or ~$6-$16k, at least for my family; I’ll listen to your recommendation[s]) to an anti-racism organization (e.g., NAACP, BLM Global Network; again, I’ll listen to your recommendation[s])? An ostensibly-unwilling-to-change racist’s entry fee, if you will. (Documentation required for admission, of course.)

In this way, they can choose to either (1) comply with tangible anti-racism efforts (seems like the closest to a win we might get—these are flagrant racists we’re talking about); or (2) shoulder lifelong and publicly severed ties with my immediate family + the regret of not being able to engage in the rituals of grieving for their brother, uncle, etc. + having to explain to my mother that her husband and her father are worth less to them than X% of their annual income.

Truly, my apologies if this question has already been addressed! I’m not trying to consume time/emotional energy needed for more pressing and essential components of the anti-racism and equity movement. Just  want to assess whether this approach—pursued by whites who are trying to be helpful in meaningful ways—is something that would indeed assist Black folks’ efforts before pursuing it. Also open to recommendations to modify this approach and/or alternatives!",03Jun2020,1
325,"So I’ve had this thing for almost 2 years where I can feel really sad for no reason. None at all. I could feel at my prime and seconds later crushed to feel like you know maybe life isn’t worth it. This happens multiple times a week. Especially at night. It’s torturing me or least it feels like it. It has its times where its severe to the point where I just don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t see the point in living at all   Seriously there is no point in life what so ever. Nothing holding me back from just leaving and I’m scared I might have enough courage soon. 

It’s took me a couple of days to write this so if it seems weird or a bit out of place maybe or doesn’t flow well it’s because I’m not very good at talking about feelings and as I’ve mentioned I’ve pick this up and dropped it many times while writing. I’ll try and keep this short though. 

I get apathetic. Even if I know I’m being rude or dismissive or sometimes even nasty to anyone. Friends. Family. I don’t care because at the end of the day if it gets to the point I can’t handle it I could always kick the bucket and that’s the mindset that sinks in. It sickens me after I snap out of maybe the next morning. 

Can’t even fake feeling happy anymore which broke me for a while. One specific scenario when I broke down in the gym for no reason again tearing up and people where asking if I was ok l or saying I don’t look well. It shattered  me to hear that my pretend smile wasn’t as good as I thought it was. 

Everything feels like a chore even my hobbies so there’s nothing to distract me. When that feeling of nothingness sinks in I can’t even try and pull my mind out the hole I just slip down and I just keep spiralling until I eventually snap out of it and become “normal” I guess. 

I’ve seen therapists and and talked to people that I’m close with and to be honest nothing has really managed to help me even understand what this is I’ve been dealing with and I think that’s one of the things that scares me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This one really hurts me though because because no one understands or “gets” it. My parents have been kinda helpful in the fact they listen but as soon as we get into a little fight eventually I get told to grow, asked why I’m so “depressed”, get told I need my head checked, I don’t know what sadness is and hearing those things after pouring my heart out stings. All the things I’ve tried to help me doesn’t work it just feels like I’m prolonging the inevitable. Like I’m just pushing my end slightly further away. 

I’ve never experienced any traumas and to be honest I’ll say I’ve been lucky in life and say my life until this point has never really been hit with tragedy. My life now is very normal I would say and average with no threat or loss. It’s all for the most part average and I know this yet I never really get the enjoyment out of life. 

I’m at my wits end with no where to turn. I’m scared. Really scared. Don’t even know how long I’ll be here for but I just hope and build enough strength to share. Thanks for reading",03Jun2020,1

331,"Both 21F. We were best friends as children. I don’t think I would call it best anymore as we don’t see each other. We talk about anything and everything we want on text. She use to answer calls about 4 years ago, not anymore. We understand each other deeply which I think is why we even have kept up taking with each other in the first place despite no physical interaction. Every single time I mention meeting up with her she ignores it. She doesn’t ignore anything else we talk about. I have casually, along conversations, sent her pictures and videos of myself ever since we have seen each other last and she won’t show herself at all. She has always been a quiet person, off to the sides but with each other we were free to do whatever say whatever type of thing. I can still see this come through in our conversation. I am thinking she might have social anxiety? I’m so confused as to why she would be ignoring anything with showing herself in any way. It honestly boggles my mind. Advice is appreciated.",03Jun2020,1
332,"I (25f) have posted about my husband (26m) before on this throw away account, but I’m just really struggling and don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m stressed about work and then this man I’m married to. 

I’m so heavily immersed in a culture where divorce is so looked down upon. My aunt (moms sister) was abused and is currently going through a 23 year 3 kids marriage break up, and my mom is literally arguing for them to stay together. This is happening as i am currently basically daily verbally abused and disrespected by my own husband. What do you expect she’d say to me? “Work it out” or “marriage is hard” just like she’s telling her sister who’s been abused for 23 years. My mom and i have had a pretty shit relationship my whole life, but i don’t have many friends or people other than my husband and parents anyway so i have to take what i have i guess. 

Not that I’m asking for a lot of respect or something, but i just sometimes need something’s from my husband and he’s just not ready to do them. He fights over ANYTHING i ask for, sexually or about life. But he does whatever he wants (including something’s that are triggering for me from a childhood “experience”). His first response to anything i ask or say is “no” and either i have to convince him of the opposite or give up. 

I have no one to talk to and no one to vent to. I don’t want people to only tell me he sucks because i already feel like i ruined my life and his by being married for 4 years and together for 7. But I’m in such a bad situation and i feel so completely helpless. We fight all the time and he wants us to have kids some time soon in the next year and i just see him and think that there’s no way at least at this time that i can have kids with him. He won’t help me raise them. It will be just me doing all the work. No matter what the fuck he tells me that he’ll help and be there. I can’t count on him. Because he can’t even fight properly. I feel our fights bring us backwards each and every time.  

He doesn’t help with anything around the house, he’s lazy and still in grad school. Doesn’t work. Failed a year of grad school, and still has two more to go. Doesn’t exercise and has gained a bit of weight. He gets angry and gets loud and it’s so hard to work through an argument with him. He turns his back and walks away. Every. Single. Time. Never buys me flowers or does anything remotely thoughtful. 

to end an argument, i come and i apologize, take the blame and still I’m somehow still am not listening or don’t understand him or whatever the fuck else he says. 

I work full time for a company that may be going through layoffs soon and I’ve been so stressed about keeping my job. Daily that’s all i think about and worry about. I also try to exercise call my parents(they are far), show up to his family events weekly and try to be the best daughter in law i can be. But at home it’s just so hard for me to survive each day. 

I’m finding it hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe I’m just annoying and not meant to be a wife. I made a mistake and i ruined someone else’s life.  Sometimes i just wish i could do something rash and not have to live to see tomorrow. I know it’s wrong. And i know these thoughts are wrong. But I’ve struggled a lot with them my whole life and i try to push them away. But all i think about is that I’m so so tired and I’m exhausted and it would just be so freaking nice to just not wake up tomorrow. Because that’s the only way i would be out of this mess and out of the stress.",03Jun2020,1

335,"BG: Until March, I was living in a basement apartment where I thought the upstairs residents were too loud and inconsiderate during the late night, but this was mitigated by the fact that while it happened weekly, it wasn't daily, it rarely went on past midnight, and I have gun range earmuffs that allowed me to block out 99% of it. Still, I wanted to move to an aboveground apartment where I would have more peace.

At the beginning of March, I moved into a residential first floor apartment where I was assured by the landlord that even though there was a family with a child upstairs, they were quiet working folks that he never received complaints about. Well boy was he wrong. These people had a 3yo who wouldn't be active for most of the evening during week days, but then start up running and stomping all over the place at 9PM and wouldn't stop most nights until midnight, sometimes later.

I think I can count on one hand the number of times the toddler did not actually turn the upstairs apartment into a sports arena after 10PM. Long story short, I tried working with the neighbors and then the landlord until it was obvious there was no actual follow through on getting the kid to bed. And the whole schtick about being a working family? The man sporadically worked a graveyard shift, and slammed around at 2am getting ready. The wife didn't work and would be awake through the night, which is why she allowed the child to be awake.

So, I did what a person trying to maintain there sanity would do. I recently got a promotion, so on May 21, I upgraded to a nice $1k/mo. apartment in a complex away from the hustle and bustle. I sacrificed my security in order to break my lease at my other apartment, but I thought it was totally worth it. Everything was repainted, all the utilities worked well, there were new carpets installed, and I even have a nice-sized patio.

Ahh, home...

...Or so I thought. It turns out the actual flooring quality in my building, and I would venture to guess in the other buildings, too, is shit. These buildings were built in the 70s at the latest, and it's like flooring never got touched up. It's so shoddy, I can hear my upstairs neighbors wherever they go—that is to say, I can hear them because what I can only assume is the subflooring snaps, crackle, and pops all over the damn place.

""Okay, be cool,"" I thought. ""It's just the flooring. You can handle flooring."" Well, it's not just the flooring..It turns out my neighbors are quite obese—which fine, I don't judge, but they absolutely don't know how to walk without hammering their heels into the floor. Thump, thump, thump. And when they're in the kitchen, my cabinets actually rattle when they walk.

Heart rate increasing. Take a deep breath. ""Okay, okay. They walk loud, but at least they seem to have normal schedules, so you should be okay when it's bedtime at least."" ...In my two weeks of being here, bith of them magically become active around their apartment at 9PM, one doesn't usually go to bed until close to midnight, and the other person (from what I can tell of walking patterns, I believe it's the man) doesn't go to sleep until 2:30AM. And when they're active, it's not just crackling subfloors and heel-strike thumps reverberating through my apartment. They have a habit of letting objects hot the floor loudly.

Ah, but Mad-Hammer! I have a solution! Didn't you say you have gun range earmuffs? Why yes, read, yes I did. And wouldn't you know they're 31db-blocking. And wouldn't you know I also where them every night. I have to if I want to beat the creaks and cracks of the flooring under my neighbors' feet. I even go so far as to run a fan next to my head, too, to disperse incoming sound. And wouldn't you know, the thumps and bangs are still loud enough to penetrate my earmuffs and wake me up in an adrenaline-induced delirium each and every night.

Now, you might think these people just have later schedules. BUT THEY EFFING DON'T! The man works construction (or some other outdoor activity that calls for carharts and bright orange and green t-shirts) and starts thumping around at 5:30AM every morning, and the woman rolls out of bed at 7:30AM and starts doing household chores. So three hours-maybe- I get of sleep before the morning proper. And I say ""maybe"" because they don't even really sleep when they're in bed. The longest I've heard both sleep straight through is maybe an hour. Sooner or later, one of them has to get up to tog to the bathroom and then spend the ensuing twenty minutes after completion doing more crap around the apartment. So even my three hours isn't unbroken.

I don't know how they live like that never getting sleep honestly. And I've gotten to the point, where three bad apartments in a row, and now no good way to get out of this one, my chest and left arm legitimately start.to hurt and ache every time I hear them at night because I'm so goddamned stressed. At this point, I literally feel like I'm either a victim of a sudden early onset cardiovascular disease, and like I'm going to have a legitimate heart attack in my thirties from never having peace, quiet, and unbroken sleep.

I don't know what to do at this point. I could talk to the neighbors, but I'm afraid to because I get the Karen vibe (you know, the kind who stomp louder when a neighbor mentions it), and I'm afraid to talk to the management because I get the vibe they don't really care about that stuff. Hypothetically, I have enough saved to move one more time and take the hit of paying for the apartment until they fill it, but I don't want to blast my savings away on that only to possibly move into noisy apartment #4.

I'm at my wits end. I'm a husky, bearded 30-something man who likes beer, sports, and action movies, and I feel like crying like a scared little boy.",03Jun2020,1

Found out this week that my sister (24) had packed up her things and ditched her out of nowhere. Now that me and my sister who used to provide for my mom are gone she is in a bit of a financial crisis. There‘s still our younger brother (19) but he barely has income. Our older brother (26) had left too a couple years prior because of drug related issues.

While i know my mom doesn‘t agree with my lifestyle i feel an unbearable ammount of guilt and i feel bad for her, she‘s had to live through a lot in her past bc of our „creator“ and now 3/4 of us are gone.

I sent her a bit of money bc she reached out to me telling me she wasn’t able to cover rent because there was no one that could help her so i helped her out because i truly feel for her. These recent developments have also led me back to feeling very down again, after i had somewhat started recovering from being dismissed by my family for being gay.

338,"Hello all, and thank you for taking a moment to read through my post.  I could really use any input you’ve got for me.  Okay, here goes:

About a week ago, I was minding my business walking to the store when I heard piercing screams that sent me running to the sound phone in hand. I was ready to call 911, but when I saw what I saw...I froze.

The best I could do was turn my camera on.

Long story short (and in the interest of protecting my identity)...I helplessly witnessed a gang murder in broad daylight. The fact that I couldn’t stop it is driving me insane. Worse, they know me and I know them.

These openly gun-toting, blue-gang-color-wearing animals saw me not only watch them commit this unthinkable murder...but I’m pretty sure they saw me film it too. Adding to the insanity, they’re so bold that they literally looked right over and fking smiled at me (or for the camera) WHILE they finished the job. 

I bolted and haven’t been able to speak since. It’s been almost a week and this is the first I’ve told anyone.

I watched how satisfied they were as they killed this man right in front of my eyes; and I assure you that for these monsters this was a labor of love. It’s unmistakable and gives me chills to the bone.

These lowlifes think they’re untouchable and I feel so helpless because I’m too scared to expose them. 
They know my family and where we live. They’re organized, deliberate, deliberately violent...and have bribed, coerced, and even eliminated accusers + their families many, many times before.

They have to have faced hundreds of serious charges over the years (if not thousands)...but very few have stuck.

And I sh*t you not, they will literally puff their chests on social media about their actual crimes and ones they want to commit in the future.

For those of you who also wouldn’t go Takeshi on the Crips...I mean cops, sorry...I guess my question is this:

If these animals, being agents of the government, intentionally break established laws or violate constitutional rights as a part of systematic criminal behavior that impacts commerce.... How can I ensure that they are taken off the street and my family is safe?",03Jun2020,1

I get really anxious asking people for things, and I’ve already asked to borrow his duffel bag for the trip. My mom says I’m overreacting about needing a face mask, so I can’t ask her to get me one.

349,"First of all, I have never been to a therapist so I have no clue if I actually suffer from some form of a disorder. I have tried to call a therapist once but chickened out before the appointment because I was afraid I was going to look like an idiot with no business there. 

Anyhow, I have been in my countries version of high school for four years and during that time I've gone out with my friends numerous times. 

But, sometimes I would just end up really sad in the middle of the party, thinking about all the other people, if they really care about me or just invited me as an afterthought, all sorts of thoughts like that. Eventually this would happen even in school, constantly thinking about my relasionship with my classmates and friends. And having a crush on one of them probably didn't help much. 

Now, as time went on i realized that my friends, at least some of them, anyway, do actually like me, but I still couldn't help but feel like I was letting them down by being a dickhead, or acting improperly and I couldn't stop overthinking every interaction, every conversation, and weather or not I did or said something wrong.  I just really didn't want to become someone ignorant of their flaws and hurt the people around me (ironic, right?).

Now as quarantine started and I didn't have to go to school (I'm also in my last year) or hang out with my friends anymore, I soon realized that I was the happiest I had ever been. I stopped having this gut-wrenching pain in my stomach every morning, I stopped having constant thoughts and internal monolouges with myself over my friends and I for the first time in what felt like forever I actually felt better. I even stopped smoking weed! 

This went on for about 3 months, and I was honesly content with just sitting at home for the rest of my life like this. I know it sounds horrible, but I didn't feel like I missed them at all. However, some of them have recently started to reach out, asking me to go out again as the quarantine is more or less over. 

I had a convo with my crush a few days ago and she was wondering why I wasn't going out anymore and why I had left some of our text groups. I tried to explain to her best I could that I love them all but that I just want to feel better. She was very understanding, and asked if I know when I will be able to come out again.

The thing is, I just don't know if it's worth it. I was honesly never that much into hanging out with people and sort of only did it so that it would be socially acceptable to spend the rest of my time playing computer games or reading or doing whatever at home.

At the same time, I genuenly cherish some of those people and think they are great. Yet I can't feel like every time I'm out with them I die a little bit on the inside. 

I guess my question is, should I try and go out with them ? Even if I know it might make me feel horrible ? Is there a way to battle these thoughts, to know you are a good person and not a burden to people around you?

I know that if I ask them they will deny it. I would do the same, even if I thought otherwise.",03Jun2020,1
350,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years. Our relationship is great and we're even planning on getting married. I wanna give an example of my moodiness and I want to know how I should react in future situations to prevent outbursts.

So during that ""time of the month,"" I tend to get pretty moody or irritable with everyone. I cannot help it, and when I try not to feel so bad, I just go blank and I don't feel like doing anything. So while my bf and I were playing video games over a call, he asked me ""Hey babe, are you okay? You sound pretty off today... what's the matter?"" I explain to him that I'm just feeling ""a bit moody"" and that it's not his fault. He says ""Oh okay, I'm just making sure."" Throughout the whole day, he kept commenting on my ""moodiness"" and trying to comfort me, so I just told him ""Look, babe, I know I'm moody, but I don't want you to keep reminding me about it. I don't want to feel this way and I just wanna play video games to distract myself."" He understood and stopped talking about it. Towards the end of the call, he got pretty irritated for something out of the blue. He said ""Fuck, my sleeping schedule is off again. Here I go sleeping at 2 am again instead of 10 pm like I wanted. Whatever, I'm going to sleep."" I know this is never really a problem for him since he's stayed up plenty of times before, so I basically called him out and said, ""Babe, I know that's not the reason. You've stayed up for longer and never complained about it. You're upset because of my mood, aren't you?"" and he said ""You know what? Yes... yes I do. No matter what I said to try and comfort you, you still felt the way you did. Whatever, I'm going to sleep."" and he ended the call.

From what I can tell, he seemed to take my mood pretty personally and he just didn't seem to understand that it wasn't because of him that I felt off. This isn't the first time this has happened. Would it have been better if I just withdrew and told him I wasn't feeling to well instead of forcing myself to keep playing video games while I was in a bad mood?

I’m a 13 (gonna turn 14 on July 19th) Right? Right. I went out with the girl of my dreams(ill refer to her as ‘S’) a couple of months ago, and I tended to like to spend alot of my time with her on ft. However, S broke up with me later because I was being clingy. I was honestly devastated. We ended on good terms, though, and when she broke the news to me she told me that she needed space and time. S said that she was still atracted to me and that we could be in a relationship again when she was ready. I was confused and sad but I came to accept it. Luckily, S still agreed to be bestfriends (we were bestfriends before we dated) and we still kept and used eachothers hoodies (we exchanged them). We still regularly facetimed eachother and were close. When quarantine started (My school went into springbreak and cancelled school from there on) and we basically were in ft for days on end for about 2 weeks and a half. (Forgot to mention that she has a 16 yo sister that’s like my wing girl(Ill refer to her as ‘Y’) and she’s also like 3rd wheel sort of, so we were like a trio) Around early to mid April, however, we slowly stopped fting and keeping in contact down to the point where we wouldn’t text daily no more. I was confused but since I didn’t want to seem clingy I didn’t protest or ask. I even stopped texting Y. On Instagram she started posting someone new she met online. It was a girl that shared her common interests (Mb I also forgot to mention that she’s a k-pop fan, and likes to edit them alot. It was weird to me because we didn’t share too many interests.) they became inseperable. I eventually asked Y why exactly S didn’t ft me anymore and she told me about her new friend. I was relieved a bit to know it wasn’t another guy that she was getting really close with. My memory is a bit hazy about the new few things, but we started fting again. (I should mention some issues that I have. I have anxiety that worsens and eases, a bit of anger issues and I tend to overthink. So whenever something seems wrong, no matter how small, I imagine it as being way way worse) and things were going good and around this time we would ft for way longer times (we made around 64 hours a couple of times) and we made it clear we still were down to get together again. So around late late april her german shepherd had puppies. She immiediatley became attached to them. She liked 2 in particular, Junior and Mark. Unfortunatley, Junior passed away due to health issues. She was devastated and I didn’t know how to help her. (Im really bad at comforting others and consoling them because I grew up having friends but not exactly someone I could tell my issues to and as a result I didnt really ‘practice’ supporting someone emotionally like that) Even worse, Mark soon passed away as well. I tried to support her by writing paragraphs and I gave her a bit of space. Soon S felt better and I tried to be there for her at the very least. By now it’s mid may and we again gradually stopped fting daily and texting. She again started posting her friends which is fine. This keeps going on until Monday. Her mother let her know way back that they were going to give away all the puppies which S reluctantly had to agree to. There were 3 left on Sunday, but on Monday on 1 was left. The other 2 passed away. She was again very devastated. I again wrote her a paragraph but on the same day got my phone taken away so I couldn’t contact her until I got it back around 4 hours ago. I feel like an asshole because I couldn’t really be there for her when she needed someone. She seemed to be doing a bit better, though. Her stories aren’t completely about puppies (although most of it is) and I’m planning on checking on Y too because I do care about her as well. I don’t know what to currently do regarding S and Y right now.",03Jun2020,1

359,"I’m starting to get a bit afraid by the persistence of this person at every turn , I’m on the verge of tears and shaking right now. 

This man that followed me on Instagram has been repeatedly messaging me for atleast a year, his message started to get a bit frustrating and I opened a can of worms I wish I never touched by responding ; he kept asking me out and I said “ i am not interested please refrain from messaging me I have a boyfriend” he responds to this like I’d caught him off guard he’s like “I’m so blindsided who’s your boyfriend, you don’t have a boyfriend who’s is it I need answers” as if I owed him that explanation even thought we’ve never had a conversation in my life , I simply said “none of those details matter except that I am not interested” he went all crazy questioning me and I just left it alone and then he asked me again the next day to go out as if nothing has happened so I snapped again and I said “STOP MESSAGING ME” and he repsonds with “ why would I stop I AM interested and I will continue to ask you” 😳 so I blocked Him because it freaked me out I go to Facebook messenger to respond to a friend and there he is in my inbox there and it comes to find out he’s been messaging me SINCE 2014 with out an answer and his most recent message ready “you mind as well block me here too then or you could just go out with me ....” at this point I’m AFRAID . 

So I block him for Facebook as well .... I think it’s over and then he MAKES A TIKTOK ACCOUNT and starts commenting on my videos so I block him FOR THE THIRD TIME... I’m scared still BUT it has to be over now ... 

NOPE ; he EMAILS ME , says you really should just go out with me ... and now ever since he has been emailing me repeatedly 3-4 times a day , sending fucking pictures and asking me and demanding me to go out ... I have 27 emails and counting ... each of them freaks me out so much more tonight he sent one with a photo that said “ U R Mine 😬” 

He does jiu jitsu same as me and after digging I realized he’s probably been at many local tournaments that I also go to and it freaks me out that much more because I could run into this guy and I am

361,"This might be a long one so brace yourselves. 


So I want to start off by stating how I've been depressed for about 5-ish years now due to constant bullying and being excluded by basically everyone in elementary school. This has greatly affected my social skills causing me to develop horrible social anxiety and very low self-esteem. As a result of this, I can't seem to keep a stable relationship with anyone; friendships, boyfriends, and even family members have been hard to please. To make matters worse I'm extremely sensitive (probably another reason for me being bullied) and it's really hard to hold back my tears whenever I'm feeling depressed sometimes. 


As a teen in high school, it seems as if the severity of both my depression and anxiety has skyrocketed over the years and it's getting to the point where I can barely cope anymore. My parents can't afford/refuse to get me therapy and even if they do I wouldn't be able to go anyway because of COVID. One of my last coping mechanisms is listening to music alone in my room (I have to share it with my Mom, while my Brother has to share a room with my Dad because we can't afford a 3 bedroom apartment) which is very difficult already because I barely get any alone time with just 3 people let alone 4.


I can't go a day without listening to music alone and when I do I notice an immediate change in my demeanor. I become grouchy and irritated really easily and it gets even harder for me to control my anxiety. I love my family members but they all like to sort of walk all over me especially the younger ones. (pathetic right?) I get extremely anxious when I hear that I have to take part in a family gathering in fear of being called ""shy"" or asked to ""speak up"" again. On my Dad's side of the family, they constantly make me feel like I'm lazy or petty because I'm deathly afraid of helping one of my aunts cook, set the table, clean, etc. in fear of looking like a fool that doesn't know what they're doing. 


My Mom's side of the family just completely disrespects me and my Mother just sort of laughs it off. This especially has depleted my mental health because whenever I try to stick up for myself I get shut down almost instantly. (By my aunt and my own Mother) My cousins love to wait and eat snacks and other stuff right in my face without offering any because they know that I will never ask them for some myself. (Both of my parents forbid me from EVER asking my family members for food because it makes it seems as if ""they don't feed me at home"" which make them look bad) I know they're not obligated to offer me jack but it's just rude because my family always offers them food when they come over, even if we don't have anything to offer but some Ramen noodles. I want to limit social interaction with them as much as possible so now I don't even go to their house to get my hair done anymore.


When I said I was literally disrespected by my younger cousins I meant it. Whenever I go to a family gathering I'm greeted by my 3-year-old cousin on my Mom's side (let's call her Stacy) with a wide grin on her face, and about 4 toys in her hands. Why is that a bad thing OP, you ask? Well, it's not, except when Stacy is constantly ignoring you when you tell her not to climb on top of the bed frame and jump off of it. When she gets hurt the blame is me because I'm the older cousin. It's frustrating as hell when you get reamed for not disciplining someone else's kid and also reamed for trying to discipline them. (Which also happens to make my Mother angry as well)


With those horrible experiences, I try my best not to be heard or seen by either side of my family now to avoid any unwanted attention. (I don't even answer their phone calls) Now that one of them is literally going to be living with us for the next seven days I can't really escape it. I don't want to be distant with him or seem mean, but I don't want him to find an opportunity to disrespect me like the others either. I know I'm messed up in the head but I really need some advice so I can at least act like a normal human being for the next seven days. 
(Sorry if there are a lot of grammar mistakes, I've been typing this for an hour)


tl;dr? My mental issues are stopping me from properly gaining the respect I need from my younger/older family members, so I have to avoid talking to them for as long as I can at gatherings, but now I can't avoid it bc my younger cousin is coming to visit and I don't know how to communicate with him properly.",03Jun2020,1

I have a very poor inner dialogue with myself. I quit playing sports (I played my whole life until this past year) and I think that did diminish my self esteem because that is what I felt I was best at. I have struggled with addiction issues since I was 15, but rarely do drugs anymore. (Aside from weed and alcohol). I feel like I do have that part of my life under control now, but I am dependent on both of those things to some extent. Sometimes I wish I could avoid social situations all together to not feel anxious all the time. Also, I don’t know if I should label myself as depressed because it’s not like I physically cannot leave bed at times, and in general, I can talk myself off a ledge when I am feeling down.  I make a lot of reckless decisions, and then feel guilty about them and wish I could do better. I kind of live my life in opposite extremes at times.

I was walking back from the bathroom, in the dark hallway, to my room and I looked down the stairs and saw a black/gray figure on the steps at the bottom and heard ""It's all over"" so I bolted into my room and am now glued to a corner of my bed where nothing is behind me. I see figures often, and faces (in my head when I close my eyes) even more often. It's really giving my trouble because I know the TV wasn't on because that was the only thing I heard, nothing before it and nothing after it. And the fact that I heard ""it's all over"" makes me question my sanity and mental state seen as my immediate thought process was that it meant I should kill myself, just end it right now. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid to move for two reasons. 1. I'm afraid it (whatever it may have been) will appear at the head of my bed (a huge fear of mine) and 2.

I have been having so much free time that I start to think so much it makes me wonder is it normal to hate myself sometimes and to want to see life go by without really doing anything.

379,"So I’m kind of bummed out, I was chatting with a good friend about recent events, one whom I’ve had many intriguing conversations with. I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion and it’s important to be respectful but, in sum, I find out he has the “All Lives Matter” mindset. He does not support racism or police brutality in any way, however, he believes it’s a cultural issue. He thinks systematic racism does not exist since “we all have our own and different struggles”, and basically thinks it’s being made into something it isn’t.  

SOo I said all the logical things I could think of at the time to simplify and highlight the issue: how things like prejudice and racial profiling is so ingrained in some people with authority and creates a system that works against people of a certain skin colour. That it’s not to devalue the lives of other races, but just to bring attention and help to a specific race that is struggling more to due to societal barriers. That it’s not saying ONLY black lives matter, or they matter MORE, no. But the importance of helping an oppressed group and kindness is free. I told him that he does not understand and does not have to, but it’s crucial to be supportive. He also relayed that one has offered any solution to the problem with the riots and they’re just destroying property and lashing out (had a sub discussion about protesting but that’s a whole other thing).  

It went back and forth and although it was rather civil, it was so disappointing and frustrating that nothing was getting through to him. I emphasized that just because he has not personally experienced being treated differently does not mean that it does not exist. I stated that if all lives mattered then there would be universal healthcare and no homeless people, but there’s so much more to it. It was hard not to get passionate but I tried to use it as an educational opportunity, though I just don’t know how else to reason or provide a new perspective perhaps (And he's a generally quiet person so he's not outspokenly backlashing against what is going on or anything like that but still...he doesn't get it).

Lately, I've been feeling extremely down just because of those dumb likes on facebook or linkedin. Yea, I know they're just likes, but it bothers the living SHIT out of me when I post something and it only gets a mere few likes or none at all, mean while someone else posts basically the same thing, with little effort or some event that wasn't even that great and gets 1k likes in the first hour.  

It pisses me off so much. I spend time writing these posts to be as informative and helpful to people, but that just doesn't cut it. Mean while, people who write ""Oh I just got a job because of this group, thanks!"" get the 1k likes in the first hour, and not give a shit about the group any more. 

I just don't understand. And there are even similar posts that are even longer but just not informative at all that still get way more likes. 

And hell, this is starting to drag into my personal life.

387,"Background:

In the past I really struggled with attendance in school and would often just not turn up because I found it to be boring. For my final two years of secondary school I had around 20% attendance and couldn’t tell my ass from my elbow in terms of academic subjects - I pretty much spent all of my time sleeping and telling myself that exams were easy and I would be fine (idiot!).

The year I was supposed to take exams in ten subjects, 2018, I ended up only doing two - which is not enough for even the lowest-ranked sixth form colleges or state schools in the U.K. So, I decided that I would teach myself the remaining eight by depriving myself of a social life and studying for 12 hours a day from September 2018 until June 2019. Eventually, I managed to get in the top ~700 or so of around 700,000 students who took the same exams as me last year, and because of this I was able to get into a very old and prestigious boarding school with an almost entire scholarship starting in October of 2019.

At first, I loved the school, the atmosphere, the impressive buildings and the chandeliers etc...however over time I began losing my motivation to study and I started falling behind the rest of my class. This gradually got worse as I began to completely forget about my qualifications and university application and began playing sports, partying loads and reading and writing different things that had nothing whatsoever to do with school. 

This eventually culminated in a huge house party in the middle of March, right before lockdown began here in the U.K, where I initially invited a dozen people, but hundreds showed up - our family house was ruined, but it was an exhilarating experience. Since then, it has triggered a losing of all purpose in my life where I have barely left the house, and achieved nothing while ignoring both the myriad emails I was getting from school and the online lessons and work being set for me.

The reason for this is I have been suffering from incredibly painful migraines since joining this school that intensified further since the beginning of lockdown, rendering me helpless for days at a time. I have tried everything to fight these, so it isn’t really relevant for advice, but I thought it would be important background information.

As I write, it is quarter-past eight in the morning and I have been up all night as I slept during the day to escape the light that makes my migraines worse - I am desperate for help and I feel utterly useless. I am thinking of giving up on it all and teaching myself again (which I can only do by shutting myself off from the world for a straight year, not the most enjoyable experience).

TL;DR: 

I used to be able to work very efficiently and achieve success, now I am months behind my classes and considering leaving the school I worked so hard to get to to teach myself again. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",03Jun2020,1

These riots have only escalated their stress. Any time I express my views I am instantly yelled at, and please trust me when I say I am not instigating for a fight, I just want civil discussion about what’s going on. Today was quite possibly the worst. I was bringing up my views about how the police knocked over the old man in Utah, and how I thought it was terrible. My mother instantly exploded on me, in tears yelling at me saying I support the rioters, hate police, etc. To which I retaliated with yelling which I acknowledge was an inappropriate response. My father then threatened to beat me over the head with a chair/broom and lifted both at me to shut me up. Every time an argument happens I always feel guilt tripped and that I’m just a bad child. Today especially did not sit well with me. I feel uncomfortable sitting in the same room, where they can say whatever they want about what’s going on and disparage my views (how can you support XYZ, you probably think it’s okay people are rioting, etc.) but as soon as I say something it’s perceived as a threat.

400,"TLDR: dream school is affiliated school, but current school is shit. Scared of finding the same shit over there.

Background: I'm not from the US, and this isn't college. My country has high school going from seventh grade to tenth grade, and later it has pre-college studies which span two years. My current school, and many others, don't offer the pre-college studies.
———
Now to the actual story.

I have been at my current school for five years and I have started applying to transfer to another school for my pre college studies. I already had a choice in my mind for a long time, my dream school which is affiliated to my current school. I applied to some other schools just in case, but put my dream/affiliated school at the top of my list.

However during online school I have found out awful things about my school... now I look back and it's like, no wonder I have been stressed and anxious for five years. The teachers don't care at all about your learning, only about their pay. They don't care about everyone's different abilities. They constantly misinform students, set surprise exams, and never listen to their students. Besides that, if someone tries to tell them about a problem they have, they get sent out the door. Basically, the teachers (ALL of them) are authoritarian. Have I mentioned that our English teacher constantly makes basic mistakes?

Today I have seriously considered withdrawing my application to my dream/affiliated school in fear of it being just like my current school. We are all expected to go there and it's my dream school but I want to get away from my current school in all its forms. I will receive my application decisions tomorrow and I'll find out if I did get accepted to my dream school, and I need to know if I should withdraw or not.",03Jun2020,1
401,"I don’t know how to start this, but basically my parents are not together and I visit my dad every other weekend. My dad lectures me like any other dad, but he would do it every time I visited about stuff like my hair (which I thought looked fine), and most of the time a year or two ago I would break down in the middle of the yelling/“lecturing” and start crying. I don’t know if i remember this right but I think once or maybe a couple times he and my step-mom even called me a crybaby.

A month ago, I remember specifically he said “if you were my child” in the middle of a conversation to me, and never acknowledged it. He isn’t strict, doesn’t make me do chores, but makes me feel like I can never make him happy.

Anyway, Last week I was in my room reading like I do everytime I’m at his house, and he asks me to come in the kitchen just to get out of my room. Then he starts taliking about if I do that at my moms house and i say that I go talk to mom a couple times a day, he asks what I talk about, i say random stuff because me and my mom do talk about random stuff (we once had a full conversation about penguin knees), he told me I couldnt say random stuff so i said books. keep in mind the day before I was reading a book in the car he asked what i was reading and I just said I forgot the title because I did and was enticed by the book so I didn’t check the cover. So after I said books he started yelling at me, saying how I never talk to him (which I don’t really because he has done so many little things over the years to make me really insecure). He Gets really mad really fast and my step mom is yelling at me too, I hadn’t cried in a year because I bottle up my feelings more since they called me a crybaby but I did start crying a little when he slammed a newspaper on the table hard while he was shouting, it genuinely terrified me so I started crying because I was a bomb and my emotions were just set off. He says I don’t love him (which I do because he is my dad) and how my mom paints him in a bad light because when he called when i was little she never said “dads on the phone“ (which is bad but he insults her all the time and she doesn’t insult him unless I’m ranting about him and she says “who cares what he thinks!”) . He knows I don’t like going to his house so he yells/“asks“ what he has done. So I tell him of the INCIDENT a year or two ago.

THE INCIDENT ( i know this is dramatic but I’ve been watching a lot of movies lately soooo, and I want something lighthearted because this is about to get really dark for me)

A year or two ago I was really numb most of the time, I felt empty and when I didnt feel that I was sad. I don’t like admitting it but I had some bad thoughts, to the point I wrote down how long it would take to die for each death and how painful it was, my biggest art work that year was of a girl hanging herself. Of course neither parent knew about that part and they never will, because right now I’m better. Adding to those thoughts I started experiencing HEAVY social anxiety, I had my first “attack“ on the 4th of July with my mom, I don’t want to offend anybody if this doesn’t sound like an attack because I atleast think it was from some research I did. Anyway, I got really paranoid, couldn’t speak without crying and could barely breathe. My mom got me through that luckily and I told her i didn’t want a therapist because I had one when I was like 6 or 8 because my dad kept me in a car for a few hours each time he had work with no water, air, or windows cracked, sorry I rambled about that but the main point is therapists didn’t help me that time. 

So now I’m going to get into the “incident” involved with my dad and stepmom. We were at a festival with my cousins and their parents, at the peak of my social anxiety. I had a attack I couldn’t breathe I couldnt make words make sense I was crying, my aunt and uncle and cousins all asked if i was okay And if we should leave. But my dad and stepmom? No. They made me go on a ride. My step mom said she has them before and there was no way I was having one. Anyway we left, my cousins drove with us to ihop and after we were done eating they got in the car with their parents leaving me alone with my dad and stepmom, I still remember what they said but I’ll just give bits and pieces.

”that was embarassing for all of us”

”You made us look like bad parents”

So we got home and they got mad that I didn’t tell them, and then asked what was happening and why i felt that way because I have “a better life then them”, also says my mom isn’t allowed to take me to a therapist at all (Eventually I went to the doctor to get one but the therapist called and i made mom decline because I couldn’t do it).   
that is the main memory i have of my dad and that is not a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to the talking last week, they asked me why I never stayed over longer then i had to and why didn’t i enjoy staying there. I told them I didn’t like being called an embarassment because of something I couldn’t control. And guess what? You probably thought they would stop yelling, and say “Oh my golly-gorsh\~ I’m so sorry that we insulted you while you were dealing with stress and mental health declination mostly because of us!!! Please forgive us!”. They don’t say that. Stepmom doesn’t apologize and my dad says “I’m sorry you felt that way”. Sorry. You. Felt. That. Way. so he didn’t even apologize for traumatizing me into Never telling him ANYTHING AT ALL, and then continued yelling.

i don’t know if I’m over reacting, I don’t know if he’s strict or emotionally abusing me. I just don’t know.

i used to cry every time I went to his house because i would be lectured and cry.

i Know parents aren’t perfect but I was told I was an embarrassment because of something I did unintentionally....

I love my dad, I do. But i don’t know if I like him.

sorry I did this but I needed to vent to someone other then my mom because she’s dealing with something right now. I don’t think this is emotional abuse but at the same time idk, I’m pretty sure he loves me... But he’s done this stuff and other stuff like missing something really important, something that was a one time thing because he forgot

There is this guy at work that I really like and I mean, I REALLY like him. I’m to the stage where if it’s his day off, I refer to it as my ‘sad day’. I look forward to seeing him and I’m head over heels. 

The thing is that I’m really shy and awkward so I don’t talk to him much. I talk to him when I get the chance but I can’t just go up and start chatting, I need him to talk first. He’s a manager so nothing could ever happen anyway. 

ANYWAY. Regardless of this, my best friend has all of a sudden became interested in him. She promises that she doesn’t like him but as soon as he comes in, she finds any excuse to go to the offices. She sometimes works night shifts and as soon as I leave, she will text me to say that she’s been to the office to see Jake and they’ve been chatting. 

Yesterday, she came in and I said ‘morning’ and she said ‘morning, is Jake here today?’ Literally the first thing she said to me. She’s in a 10 year relationship so I don’t think she’s trying to move on him but she’s all of a sudden taking him over as ‘hers’ and I know nothing will happen between me and him but it still hurts that she’s doing this.",03Jun2020,1

The thing is, that ever since the first time I texted her, she takes a lot of time before replying.  When I say a lot, I mean from hours, to days, and once, like 2 weeks.  She told me when we first started talking that she always does it, and when she takes longer than a few days, she always excuses herself, even though she really doesn’t have to, because we’re not together or anything.  Normally I would think that it means that she isn’t interested but would feel bad to tell me, but that’s where the mixed signals part comes in.  She always texts me as if she liked me.  She sends a ton of messages, is really attentive to what I say, and sometimes flirts pretty noticeably.  Also, when I let her know that I like her and asked her out (for when the COVID crisis calms down a bit), she said that she likes talking to me and would really like to go out with me.

I was talking to my boyfriend and mentioned that I was going to go to a protest with three of my friends and he went quite for the rest of the call. I kept asking what was wrong but he wouldn’t tell me anything. After around 10 minutes he quietly said he was gonna go to sleep and hung up without saying “I love you”. It was really out of the ordinary and hit really hard because we were talking completely normal and laughing before that. He was one of the only few people I actually felt like loved me due to a childhood where my parents never cared about me or my three sibling so having him be upset with me to the point of where he didn’t even say I love you hit hard. He hung up before I could say anything either so I didn’t know how to react to it. I ended up pulling out one of my razor blades and cut a little bit. I feel really bad about it but at the same time I still want to cry because as I’ve mentioned before I came from a family where we never said that we loved eachother.

410,"My thoughts are all over the place at the moment, so sorry if my writing isn't the most organized. 

I feel like a lot is wrong with my life. I suspect I have depression and social anxiety (and a couple other things, but those are the ones impacting my life most in a negative way). I know that I should go see a professional or trusted family/friend, but seeing a professional would mean I would have to push my social anxiety aside which I can't and I don't have any friends nor do I trust my family as they're quite toxic and a couple are psychologically abusive even to the point where I nearly made a report for abuse, although I didn't because I was afraid of making things worse for myself like all those abuse stories I've heard online. 

I did once reach out to a professional and tried to indirectly tell them something was wrong with my thoughts. I tried hinting to my counselor that I might have social anxiety by talking about being nervous around people all the time, and they ended up telling my mother without asking me or even letting me know that they would... so much for them praising themself over confidentiality and ""only telling others if it's an emergency"". I only found out they told my mother from my mother saying out loud to the entire family that I may have social anxiety which is one of the many reasons why I don't tell my mother anything and why I have such huge trust issues against professionals now.

Oh and I'm pretty depressed. If dying was as easy as pressing a button and didn't require courage, I would've pressed it ages ago. I don't care if my death will cause my depressed thoughts to ""pass it on to others"" because my family never cared much for me nor do I care much for them, no I won't miss my family; I despise them, I don't care if I'll never see what the future holds, life is not a fairy tale with a happy ever after, there is no guaranteed ""light at the end of the tunnel"" ending. The only thing giving me a gram of hope to get help is the thought that I might be able to feel happy one day without a bitter aftertaste always following and that I don't want to become homeless and die of starvation. Other than that, not being alive sounds wonderful to me.

413,"Hello Reddit. 

Three months ago I was really considering being a cam girl. I was extremely desperate for money because my family was in a bad situation, but I was broke. I couldn't get a real job either because of Coronavirus. There were no jobs available to me in the area. 

So I decided that I would become a camgirl because I needed quick money. I didn't have any followers at the time, and didn't know how to build an audience, so I thought I would go advertise myself, and then I did absolutely horrible things. I sent nudes to about 5 or 6 people to advertise myself. I posted pictures of myself with my face in view (because I'm an idiot thought no one would follow me if I wasn't showing myself) on some random subreddits. Again, I was so desperate I wasn't thinking straight. 

I dont know how, but I took a minute to think about what I just did, and I INSTANTLY regretted it. I took down everything. My reddit account, and my Instagram alt that I used to send nudes. I realized that I did something so ridiculously stupid and I instantly regretted it. I deleted all of my accounts right there, but I'm afraid I already fucked myself over. 

It might seem like not a big deal to you, but I'm afraid that those pictures will be found and ruin me forever. I'm currently in college studying to be an accountant, but now I feel like I have no chance. I just completely hate myself for doing such a disgusting thing just for money.  Everyday from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed I panic in fear thinking one day those pictures will be found by someone I know and my life will be ruined. My family is religious, so if they ever know of this then I'm completely finished. I don't go a day without considering suicide now. I'm a complete moron. Please don't tell me that I deserve this or that I'm an idiot, because I know I'm stupid. I just wasn't thinking straight. I don't know what to do.",03Jun2020,1

415,"We have been dating for a little over 3 months and it’s been nothing shy of great. We are long distance and met over the internet, but we spend most of everyday with one another. He is a Christian and I am agnostic, but I have critical views on religion due to pat trauma. I accept his religion and he accepts my views, we don’t talk about it much at all because religion, particularly Christianity and Catholicism, tends to remind me of past trauma. I want it to be known that I am grateful for everyday I’ve spent with and I am very appreciative of him and all he does for me. He has truly improved my life, I am a much happier and positive person. 

Tonight we were having a conversation regarding our similar views on the current political climate. I mentioned that I appreciated that our views were so similar because it makes having discussions about current events a good experience. I was the one who brought up abortion, for whatever reason I had thought that we shared similar views on that as well. I genuinely thought that we held the same or similar beliefs regarding this which was why I even mentioned it. I would not have brought it up if I knew we didn’t. 

I am casually pro-choice. I don’t agree with everything and I have my own opinions in regards to that. My opinions outside of what should happen in the instance of pregnancy due to non-consensual sex doesn’t really matter in all of this, so I won’t be mentioning it. 

I believe that if someone becomes pregnant after non-consensual sex they should have the right to choose whether or not to continue the pregnancy. I do not believe that the victim should be forced to carry the child of their rapist. (I am not asking for you to agree or disagree with my stance, but it’s important and relevant to state given my question.)

As a sexual assault (and rape) survivor, I could not imagine being able to live through this experience without the overwhelming urge to end it... it being either the pregnancy or my life. I cannot imagine the emotional, physical and psychological pain this would put on someone. 

Because of my experience I have met others with similar experiences. What happened to me happened at a fairly young age and I (thankfully) was not able to get pregnant because of my age/maturity. Unfortunately that’s not always the case. I’ve connected with many girls who did get pregnant, I’ve talked to those who have chosen to terminate and to go through with pregnancy. I respect each girls decision, but through listening to their experiences and reflecting on my own I knew that if I were in that situation I would have terminated the pregnancy. If I were just a bit older I might have been in their shoes. 

My boyfriend thinks that this is wrong, and that all pregnancies should be carried despite the situation. When I brought up the issue of the mother losing her life if she were to continue to carry a pregnancy, he said that that was the one grey area where he wouldn’t know what to do. He thinks that when an egg is fertilized that that is a being with a soul, and because I’m not religious I don’t know how to respectfully disagree with this without being upsetting to him. I do not believe in souls, but I respect his belief. I did try to compare it to animals, like a pig or a spider, but he told me animals don’t have souls, which I don’t understand, but I didn’t press any further. I told him that I see a toddler as their own being, a newborn as their own being, but not a developing fetus that could not survive without it’s mother. I tried to explain my views (the toddler has a concept of life and can think and live on its own), but he insisted that a just fertilized egg is the same as a toddler. He likened my views on abortion to killing orphan children. 

He told me it boils down to an ethical problem, which I agree with. He told me that no one should have the right to take another life away, which I agree with to an extent. I agree with him, once life is given you shouldn’t be able to take it. Like I said, I am only casually pro-choice and I do not agree with everything. I can see his side of the argument, even without being religious. The issue is where we both pinpoint the start of life. 

This brings me to my question. 

I hung up the call we were on, I told him I was upset and was going to hang up (I wouldn’t randomly hang up on him and possibly worry him). 
He knows I am a victim of sexual assault. It’s heart breaking to think that he would categorize me as a murderer if I were to have had been put in a situation where I had to make this decision. It hurts to know that he thinks of some of the strongest women I know as murderers. It would be ridiculous if he thought my friendship and respect for this women was the same as supporting murderers. 
It’s terrifying for me to think of the possibility of a situation where I would become pregnant from non-consensual sex and him believing I had to give birth to the child or else I would be a murderer. 
It’s scary to think that if I were to have medical complications regarding pregnancy he would be unable to choose between my life or my pregnancy. 

I want to reiterate that I really do believe I love this man and I am very happy with him. Since we have been talking, he has made me smile everyday without fail. I would not have brought up this topic had I known our views were this different on this particular aspect as I don’t want to argue with him over things that don’t directly effect our relationship. With that being said, his response and opinion regarding this has deeply disappointed and hurt me. I want to leave it alone and pretend it never happened but I don’t think I can without going into a dark place, as this conversation with him and his views reminded me of my own experiences.bThis is something that so deeply effects me that I am questioning our relationship (which I feel extremely guilty doing). 

I don’t want to break up with him, but I also don’t believe he will ever see how important this stance is to me. I don’t expect him to agree with me on everything, we have other disagreements (even involving abortion) but none are as personal to me as this. I don’t know what I can do in this situation. 

(I am not using an alternative account to post this and he can see this post by going on my reddit. I am comfortable enough with my dynamics with him where I don’t feel the need to hide anything, even a post like this, from him).",03Jun2020,1
416,"Hey, I ve been texting with a friend (She s 18 and I m 20) almost daily since February.

417,"My friend (18F) and I (19M) have been close-ish for about 2 1/2 years. She went through a bit of a depressive phase at the start of this year, and I too went through a similar, albeit much shorter, period, and deleted all of my phone numbers. I emailed her a number of times memes and things, and on two occasions included in these emails that I didn’t have her phone number now and that it would be much easier to send things via WhatsApp. 

I eventually stopped emailing her, as although she had said she was going through stuff, I did feel slightly neglected as a friend. I was particularly angry one night, and sent her an email lashing out at her, calling her a ‘part-time friend’ and saying that I didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. I regretted this as soon as I sent it. She replied, understandably hurt, and we made up. This email thread continued, and she confessed that she was feeling down because she didn’t feel like she had any purpose, having left school and everything being put on hold during the pandemic.

To cheer her up, I jokingly said that once I’ve graduated next year, I’d move down to where she lives now - about 50 miles away - and we would flat-share. She took this very seriously, said it was a great idea, and told her parents, who agreed. We discussed it more and it does actually make some sense, as it’ll give us both some stability and something solid in the future. I also began sending her bundles of memes from Reddit and/or memes that I’d made. However, it’s been 3 days now that she replied to my last email, and I’m wondering if perhaps all this emailing is a bit overwhelming if she’s still depressed. I did start all this emailing after all, which shows she evidently wasn’t up for talking to me ‘off the bat’.

419,"For context i’m a first year university student currently studying a double degree in science and global studies and also learning Japanese as a second language at an intermediate level as I studied it throughout school already. 

I am only 18 years old but I know for sure I want to work in the allied health field as a career - for example dietetics, physiotherapy etc. Or, I want to become a doctor. Either a GP or a Paediatrician. I’ve had a fascination with becoming a doctor since I was young. 
So career wise I know for sure I want to worth in allied health or as a type of doctor. I also definitely want to continue learning Japanese. 

Another disclaimer is I know already I will get into the course I want to, it’s just a  matter of choosing which option. 

Option 1: Is that I continue my Science/Global Studies double degree. It is 4 years in duration. I find global studies fascinating and we have to study a unit overseas in the degree so it is more appealing to me. However I doubt the career I end up in will have anything to do with global studies. I can still do a postgraduate in allied health after if I choose this degree, but it takes a year longer and the Global Studies may be unnecessary if it’s not apart of my career. However if I keep global studies and have a sudden career path change in the future I can get a job from that degree. 
My science subjects however will be limited as Global Studies subjects will take up some of my units. 

Option 2: I Drop my global studies and do straight science as my degree with my Japanese still continued. This will only take three years. Then I do postgraduate medicine / allied health of some form and will be finished a year earlier. I can do more science subjects because there will be no global studies which means my postgraduate probably will not take as long as well. However science is quite competitive. And if I chose to do medicine I will have to sit a test for it at the end of my degree, but if I do the double degree I won’t need to sit the test.

427,"Sorry this is so long, I probably put way too much details in this. 

I believe about a month or two ago this lady and son moved into a condo across the canal from our house. (The canal is about 30ft wide and each side has some sand between the backyard grass of each property and the water)

It started with my younger sister who had her friends over to sit in our pontoon tied to our dock (I am the oldest sibling in the family at 20). These girls are 15/16. The new neighbor boy, who is 13 I believe, swims by the boat numerous times and one of my sister’s friends “flirts” with the kid. From what I’m told it was mostly just talking to the kid and he was trying to get her number and find out where she lived. The girls left the boat and drove to get supplies for s’mores from a store. I am doing some yard work while they’re gone when I see this same boy run from the front of my house through my backyard into the water and swims across to his property. The girls get back and are having a fire, but this boy is standing on our side of the canal on the sand on our property yelling and waving at the girls and won’t go away. I go down and tell the kid to leave the girls alone and stay off our property which cause him to try and argue that the water and sand are public property and he can do what he wants. While the water may be public property, I was pretty sure the sand counted as ours, so I told the little shit if he didn’t stop I’d call the police. He stuck around another five minutes before leaving and that was that. 

There was another incident of him talking to my other sister and her friends (age 11/12) and then grabbing one of our kayak paddles and throwing it in the water. He retrieved the paddle and then the girls came inside (I wasn’t home and neither was my mom which is why we didn’t confront him). 

A few days ago my youngest sister and two friends are swimming in the backyard once again. I get a call from her telling me the boy is bothering them and won’t leave them alone again, and he keeps coming into our sand. My mom and I get home and head down to the water where my mom and I see him jump in front of some boat that is cruising in the canal and gets yelled at by the driver for being an idiot. My mom then tells the boy that he needs to leave my sisters alone and stay off our property. He starts arguing with my mom saying that he can do what he wants and he only harasses my older sister. He ends up just yelling and complaining, so we all went inside. 

Now two days ago I go outside with my girlfriend and youngest sister to sit on two inner tubes in the water. This boy and his mom are outside and his mom asks us where we got one of our inner tubes and asks if we found it. I say we didn’t find it and that if they lost theirs I can keep an eye out for it. (They leave all their crap by the water, so I wasn’t surprised to learn they had lost something) we are floating for a few minutes before the mom comes back and starts yelling at us saying there’s no where to get that tube in town and she got it off Amazon. I tell her it’s impossible that it’s theirs because we have had it since last summer and have pictures of it. Its not even ours, but it’s a family friends who got it from a different state and was letting us use it. She continues yelling and says “Karma is a Bitch” a few times. They then went inside. 

A few hours later, I get a phone call that the lady and her boyfriend/husband are at our front door yelling at my brother (age 17), who answered the door, that she wants the tube back. I am twenty mins from home and my mom is working, so I tell them to close and lock the door and call my grandma to go over to the house to talk to the lady (She lives about 8 mins away from our house). She gets there and gives the tube to the guy and says that they can have the 30 dollar tube if they leave us alone, but they better know it’s not theirs. My grandma also called the cops, so an officer comes and I get there and we let the office know what’s happening and say we don’t even want the tube back but we want them to leave us alone and stay off our property. The office goes to talk to them and he didn’t come back and say anything to us.

So now we are worried about what they could do next. In retrospect we realize just giving them the tube was a bad idea especially when it wasn’t even theirs, but we were just hoping it’d make them leave us the f alone.

434,"Serious question. My friend named Drew and I were talking earlier and what he said struck me as rather odd. There was this girl who was annoying him, not doing anything really bad besides texting, so he goes off on her to the point where she starts to cry. After she was extremely pissed at him, he manipulated her into believing that she was at fault while he was clearly to blame (I don’t want to get into too much detail for privacy sake, but I read the text message string). After the string of text messages, he openly admitted to enjoying toying with her emotions and seeing her cry and then manipulating her into thinking that she was in the wrong. Now this isn’t enough to prove anything but when he was in 7th grade (about 5 years ago) he got referred to the school psychologist for “manipulating his group mates to do all of his work” after talking to the psychologist, she concluded that he has sociopathic tendencies. But i feel like at 13 years old, that’s not old enough to tell (this is personal opinion and I’m not sure, if it is possible to tell please correct me because I am unsure). Another thing that struck me as weird is that he admitted to me that he doesn’t really care about his friends or family as well as telling me that he had almost zero emotion. But I always thought of him as being rarely nice besides never showing much emotion. If what he said is true, than it does almost seem sociopathic, especially because he is extremely charismatic. I’ve only known him for about 5 months, but as a person who has been taken advantage of a lot, I’m genuinely scared that he will start to use me (if he hasn’t already). I am also worried that since he knows i was manipulated a lot by some of my friends previously, that he will purposely start exploiting me and using me for his own personal gain. I really don’t understand why he would openly admit to me that he does not feel a connection to his friends, what does he get from that? I really need advice on whether I should continue our friendship as he hasn’t done anything personal to me or if I should cut all connections. Thank you kindly.",03Jun2020,1

436,"I have two main paths to go down. I'm thinking for the very long term here; I'm currently 38 working in IT infrastructure. My concern could I see myself working in IT infrastructure at age 50,60, etc? No way.

My company just announced that they will be doing ""work from home"" forever, which sounds nice but my entire job is based on data center and office infrastructure. So no offices/data centers = I won't have a job within the next year or two. The only reason my boss said to not worry about offices closing immediately were ""we'd lose money on the lease"", so it wasn't the most reassuring reason not to worry. This company is in Germany. I love living in Germany, and everything about it. I do find it extremely difficult to find a job in Germany since I'm American and don't speak German like a native speaker. 

My other option is to get a job in the US that I can't be fired from for any reason. I won't be paid as much, but I'll never have to worry about the whims of the economy or some bean counter deciding IT costs too much.

He asks me very basic questions, so I don't believe that he is ill willed, but I don't consider this method to be an appropriate way of getting to know someone, and definetly not considering how little we have socialized with each other.

438,"When considering my relationship right now, I’m feeling confused and defeated. I’d really appreciate some external viewpoints/advice. 

I’ve been with my Partner for 2.5 years now, and throughout that time we have been through some serious arguments pertaining to motivation, laziness and miscommunication (we seem to get hurt and misunderstand each other regularly). The same arguments seem to occur over and over again. Sometimes we’re good for months and then we’ll have a solid week of arguments.

I’m 27 and work full time as a business executive (approximately 100hr weeks) and outside of work, my hobbies are planning for a successful future by looking at investment options, housing market movements and ways to up-skill to secure income into the future. I sometimes like to game a little too or listen to music/rest. Outside of work too, I’m constantly “doing” to keep our house clean (wash, dry and fold our clothes, vacuum, clean up the kitchen etc) throughout the day.

My partner (early twenties) is a uni student and is currently studying online. He doesn’t have to attend lectures right now. Prior to COVID-19 he still would only attend when he felt like it.

Working from home right now, I’m finding it increasingly confronting and frustrating that whenever I see him he’s generally playing games around the house, watching Netflix or napping (almost constantly). Maybe 1-3 hours in a day, he’ll do uni work. 

Prior to my working from home arrangements, I noticed a similar lack of dedication and motivation - with constant gaming (sometimes even through the night) outside of when he has assessments and exams, in which case he will spend the night studying or working through assessments. 

In saying all of this though, I definitely don’t see the entirety of the work he does and I don’t understand the full requirements of his course. He seems to be maintaining a great GPA - but I can see that of late, he has been dedicating even more time to gaming than usual- so I don’t know how much longer he can maintain it.

Additionally my partner does help by cooking meals sometimes throughout the week. Outside of this we buy takeaway or I heat up frozen food as I can’t cook. After he cooks though, generally I clean. And I sometimes clean up after him when he makes snacks throughout the day/night. He takes it personally when I ask for him to clean up after himself or to help me out with cleaning.

I’ve tried to bring up my concerns with him throughout the 2.5 years we’ve been dating, but he takes any difficult conversations extremely personally and reacts like a child (stops talking, ignores me etc). Whenever I try to tell him how I feel he tries to make me out to be aggressive or unthoughtful or wrong - and doesn’t take any responsibility for his part of an argument or situation (something I try to do frequently). 

We share costs and living expenses and manage our finances separately, and I make my car available for his use at any time (which I pay petrol for, insurance on) and we both contribute to buying things around the house. 

I feel we’re at a bit of a standoff in our relationship. I feel like I’m being gaslighted or manipulated and I’m worried that he’s not going to change - I’m worried that he has no motivation and I’m worried that he wouldn’t handle full time work when he eventually graduates and finds a job. I’m losing attraction to him, I’m losing respect for him.",03Jun2020,1

446,"it’s a long story. my best friend has just sent me a giant paragraph of text saying how upset and disappointed he is with me and has blocked me. he’s honestly a good person and tries to maintain an open mind but i’ve just made him snap.

he’s someone i always go to for advice and when i need to vent (i try to ask him if i can vent first, before i do) and he’s been more than happy to listen. that’s why i always go to him - he listens and cares more about me than anyone else does in my life. however i always run into a lot of relationship issues. i’ve gotten into four relationships in the past two years (three of them were online and long distance) and i have always been the one to break it off because the relationship got too overwhelming for me or i lost feelings. basically i would always find myself growing tired of trying to meet the other persons expectations in the relationship and i’d break it off because i no longer wanted to put in effort into the relationship anymore.

i would tell my best friend all these things about how i felt, and he and i both agreed i was terrible with relationships (but i would always ignore his advice of staying away from dating for a bit and somehow fall for someone again).

i always ended up hurting the other person in the relationship because of my low self esteem and inability to manage time properly and a combination of many other things that arose from a lot of my emotional instabilities. i’m still friends with two of my exes (one who is actually my best friend of 7 years) and i can talk normally with them now like friends without much expectation of a relationship, so i think it has to do with me and how i perceive relationships, rather than the fault of the other person, since i’m able to maintain a friendship with them just fine.

i met this one guy online and started talking to him frequently a few days after i broke up with my boyfriend of seven months (because i lost feelings). i started gaining feelings for him. and my best friend immediately noticed because of how frequently i’d mentioned him. 

my best friend told me if i got into another relationship, he would stop talking to me because i just got out of a relationship and it would be wrong for me to date this guy.  i agreed with him a lot - it would be wrong and i also didn’t want to be burdened by a relationship since i wasn’t capable of handling it. so i tried my best to stay away from the guy i met online and told him i wasn’t interested in a relationship - but he tried to persuade me and say it would just be a label, and we could just talk like normal/friends and hang out but with the label of boyfriend and girlfriend, and nothing would really change between us. 

that idea sounded alluring to me. i really liked this guy, and he had a great deal of confidence that i liked. we started dating and it’s been going alright but when i told my best friend about it, he immediately got upset because i said that relationships made me feel more confident and gave me self esteem. i know it’s not a healthy mindset but relationships have been a strange coping mechanism for me that has made me feel both less lonely and shitty about myself. when i told him these things he immediately told me he didn’t want to speak with me anymore because i was a horrible person and blocked me.

i don’t really know what to do anymore. he’s my best friend and i’m so scared of losing him.",03Jun2020,1

Basically, I was with a guy that I really liked when I was 15 and we broke up for personal reasons but have recently got back together after he broke up with a girl called Lucy.

Me and her had spoken about the fact that she wouldn't mind my boyfriend dating me too if I wanted to get back with him and that raised serious red flags with me so I asked my friends who had also spoken to her and they basically all said that she was probably fake and made by my ex cause our relationship was a lil awkward. The thing that solidified it for me is the fact that she wouldn't do anything but text on discord and as soon and me and my boyfriend started getting close again she just deactivated her discord and was never heard from again but it dosent phase my boyfriend in the slightest and everyone has advised me that she was probably made up and I don't know what to think, I have asked my boyfriend but he just denies it and changes the subject",03Jun2020,1

^(I live in a small city so you pretty much have connections with everyone and it feels like everyone knows every detail of your life.) ^(I didn't mind everyone knowing everything about me at first, I don't really have anything to hide, until they started searching my brother's and mum's businesses on facebook, google etc, which is really scary because kids are cruel and you never know what they'll do. People also have multiple times passed my house whether purposely or coincidentally and taken pictures of it and sent it to me, they've also told each other my address so basically everyone knows. I find it so scary that people have photos of my house in their camera roll. I've told a few people the names of my family members and they've gone out of their way to search them up on social media and in my small school of around 200 students and information spreads like wild fire. People have screen shotted social media accounts with same name as my family members and sent it to me asking ""is this ur brother/mum/dad/cousin etc"" and sometimes they actually get it right. People also have guessed my password on social media and LOGGED INTO MY ACCOUNT. I've also made seperate social media accounts trying to seperate personal and school life but people always end up finding them. At this point I honestly think they're hacking into my phone or hiring an investigator to find out more about me.)

460,"So a little background on my Dad. He is one of those old school fellas who dosen't believe in sickness or soreness, hes a loving bloke but normally he brushes anything I say about my health off as an 'overreaction'. At first I told him I think I needed glasses and he said nah, you can probably see fine. I ended up getting my eyes tested and sure enough I needed glasses, not strong glasses but I still needed them. One time I threw up and he said ""she'll be right just drink some water, hurry up tho because we're running late"". 

Anyways, enough background.
So I lately (last few months) I have been realising I am more fidgety and can't focus on an assignment or zoom call for more then 10 min at a time, I use to brush it off as its just boredem but once I got my maths assignment, everything went to a shit shower. I started losing focus after five minutes, get distracted easily (I hear a sound, heck even no sound and then I think about that), I am starting to realise I ramble on and/or lose interest in conversations easy and many other kinda of scenarios. 

In the last year, I believe I had depression as I always lost interest in things easy, eating less and less and thinking what is the point in life and how unlucky my life has become e.t.c.
Until I found sup (stand up paddleboard) surfing. I have gotten really good at it and Im loving the shit out of it. It has taken my mind off the harsh reality and has eased my brain to a calmer state. I never told my dad about my thoughts of depression as I knew he would shrug it off, my mum would be the opposite and freak out too much and I didnt want to out her through that.

My main question is should I tell my dad about my suspicions on ADHD and what should I do about my suspected ADHD. Or am I just overreacting? My main worry about telling my dad that I am behind an assignment (he has always been on my case about grades, B and B+ was just meh to him, although he never really has had a stable income nor good grades).  And if I tell him I am behind on my assignment I am worried that he is going to take away my privilege of sup surfing or doing the stuff I enjoy, I would rather him take my phone then my board and paddle. What should I tell him? And should I tell my mum too?
I don't really like talking bout personal shit as its uncomfortable for me. I also know that none of my friends suspect I have adhd and I hope that they dont find out I do if I do have it.

Sorry for this long ass post, I will update once I make my decision.

* he doesn't have enough trust in me even though it was shit that was sorted out months ago
* he used to be clingy but now the tables have turned and i'm the clingy one - he barely makes plans or calls or anything, his mates come first, his ps4 and drugs come second and i probably come third. 
* everytime i try to bring up something that makes me upset that hes done, he just gets mad at me and i always have to end up apologising even if it wasn't my fault
* and when we got back together he didn't seem too thrilled about it either
* i am not allowed to talk to guys AS FRIENDS on snap but hes allowed to have close girl friends who dislike me

i have tried talking about all the above to him before but it just goes in one ear and out the other, and once again it always ends up being my fault somehow. however i'm a firm believer on not ending things if theres a chance to talk things out and make things right.

today we had an arguement and he said he can't put up me much longer, i'll admit that i do get angry for things and i jump to conclusions way too often.

in spite of all this, whenever we hang out we have the best time together and everythings really good, and we still have great chemistry. 

so guys help me out, should we just end things or try to make things work.",03Jun2020,1

467,"I have had a crush for almost 2 years now. She had rejected me many times, I try to move on but always return to the same place. 

I'm not the kind of guy that likes every woman, she's actually my first crush, first rejection, actually, the biggest time we had away each other was due to a fight because I got jealous for no reason because we were friends.

It's kind of cycle, any of us is boring we reach the other one, start talking again, I start to invite her to dinners, I realize I like her again, tell her, she rejects me, I delete her contact and vanish for few days, then add her contact again and wait until the cycle restart.

After the fight, we spend time away due to two things: she had boyfriends, and I kind of accepted my defeat. I also recognized that being jealous was really unhealthy and focused on a new hobby.

Eventually, I found out that her boyfriend assisted in the same place and she becomes a regular too. We weren't the closest ones, but the friendship just kind of restarted there.

I recognize she can manipulate me and I just let her be. I have done things for her that don't even do for my family, but I'm sure if she is aware of how manipulative she can be and I hope she doesn't do it on purpose. Like when she was really pushing to go out and eat something because she knows I'm paying for everything. The thing is, I completely know she will start to ignore me when she gets a good boyfriend and write to me when she is boring, as she did last night.

She is not a bad person, I know her family and her history, and she deserves the best, I have already spent a whole weekend helping her and I will do it again. But I'm struggling to keep my heart and mind separated. I have to contain myself to don't kiss her out of anywhere.

Right now, I'm in the daydreaming face. She is everything I can think in my spare time, I want to add her back and ask her out again, but I'm pretty sure if the outcome. 

Maybe kissing her will make her hate me and don't talk to me again.",03Jun2020,1

475,"I grew up privileged. Private school, yearly holidays to far flung destinations, friends with wealthy families. I was (and hopefully still am) smart, and was (but am no longer) popular, kind, fit. I got into a top tier biomed program, and slipped into one of the top post grad med courses in Australia. Yeah, I know, I was one of those arseholes for whom everything seemed to go right. 

On the surface whilst I was leading a fantastic life, I was deeply unhappy. I always felt like a fish out of water, and never got along that well with my classmates. I was quite bored by the endless memorisation, and extremely stressed out by the prospect of failing a year. I overstudied to compensate for my lack of passion and basically had no life outside of studying and gaming. So, naively, I ended up leaving medicine, depressed, with nothing but a useless biology degree, thinking that with my “InTEllECt” i could make it in this world. I wandered aimlessly for a few years trying to figure out what to do, and eventually settled on Civil Engineering.

Now I (25), with one and a half years to go with my degree, have begun to doubt my choices again. Ive started looking at grad salaries and even the big consultants dont really pay that much. It makes me extremely depressed to think that I have given up so many years of my life studying, to end up earning the same amount as a warehouse worker (a job I got over the holidays with no prior experience). I wanted to have a (small) house by the time i’m 30, and I always assumed that if I worked hard in my career, i’d always make it. But now reality has set in, and this is all looking like a pipe dream. In my worst moments, I even think about going back to medicine (another 4 years of study). 

I guess i’m just whining on the internet, but if anybody has any advice on how they figured out the right career path, i’d be open to any help. I don’t have anyone to ask in my life for help on this. My parents are a bit too supportive and just tell me to do what I want....but the problem is that I have no idea.",03Jun2020,1
476,"Hi, sorry if this is worded weirdly I’m not very good at staying on track but I’m going to try my best and make this as easy to understand as possible.

In my country Lockdown is still in effect and two weeks in my mother (41F) left her abusive husband after he was taken away by the police. My mum works full time with creating the test kits for Covid and wasn’t able to find a babysitter for my (21nb) siblings (3,4) so I stepped up and offered to help.

I knew lockdown was going to be a while so I knew I’d be doing this for a while. The arrangement has been that I would stay at her home 5/6 days a week to look after the kids and then I would get to go home every Friday night and leave every Sunday morning to limit exposure. 

It’s been two or three months and now I heavily regret my decision. My mental health has taken a really heavy dive and I can’t do it anymore. It’s not that I don’t love my family and want to help, I really do. I’ve just also realised that it’s not something I can at all handle. I have Bipolar 2 and I thought that I could suppress everything till my one day off so I could recharge and then come back but now my brain is just done with it all. I’ve been self harming, making attempts at my life and all of this my mum doesn’t know about because I can’t tell her.

What can I do? Is there anyway I can get her to find someone else to help or am I stuck with the decision I’ve made?

478,"Serious question. My friend named Drew and I were talking earlier and what he said struck me as rather odd. There was this girl who was annoying him, not doing anything really bad besides texting, so he goes off on her to the point where she starts to cry. After she was extremely pissed at him, he manipulated her into believing that she was at fault while he was clearly to blame (I don’t want to get into too much detail for privacy sake, but I read the text message string). After the string of text messages, he openly admitted to enjoying toying with her emotions and seeing her cry and then manipulating her into thinking that she was in the wrong. 

Now this isn’t enough to prove anything but when he was in 7th grade (about 5 years ago) he got referred to the school psychologist for “manipulating his group mates to do all of his work” after talking to the psychologist, she concluded that he has sociopathic tendencies. But i feel like at 13 years old, that’s not old enough to tell (this is personal opinion and I’m not sure, if it is possible to tell please correct me because I am unsure). Another thing that struck me as weird is that he admitted to me that he doesn’t really care about his friends or family as well as telling me that he had almost zero emotion. But I always thought of him as being rarely nice besides never showing much emotion. If what he said is true, than it does almost seem sociopathic, especially because he is extremely charismatic. 

I’ve only known him for about 5 months, but as a person who has been taken advantage of a lot, I’m genuinely scared that he will start to use me (if he hasn’t already). I am also worried that since he knows i was manipulated a lot by some of my friends previously, that he will purposely start exploiting me and using me for his own personal gain. I really don’t understand why he would openly admit to me that he does not feel a connection to his friends, what does he get from that? I really need advice on whether I should continue our friendship as he hasn’t done anything personal to me or if I should cut all connections. Thank you kindly.",03Jun2020,1

Due to Covid-19 we are being given the option at my school to choose between getting a normal grade or choosing to have our grade not be reported. My issue is I took a class I regret taking. It was an AP class I thought I’d be interested in and just never got into it. I tried pushing through it and got a B and a C the first 2 quarters. In the second semester I couldn’t do it. I started to not do the work. I just didn’t have a passion, interest or any motivation to try anymore.

481,"It has always been a problem of mine. I don't think people see me as competitive, for sure I come off as easy-going but secretly I want to be the best in everything I do. I tried to think why I have the need to be competitive and I realized that it's because I pick things up a bit faster than others so I tend to get recognition most of the time. Now because of that I feel like I have to keep up with how others see me. I fear that if I drop the ball any minute now they would see me as a fraud somehow. I know this is not the case and most people are busy caring about themselves but I just can't shake off the feeling that I am being judged everytime so I have to keep up a good front.

I notice that when dealing with a test or anything graded for example I always think that I have to excel at it instead of focusing on the problems and just enjoying the process of learning new things. When I make a mistake for example I always beat myself up for it internally. While I do not get jealous of others when they do something great for example, I do tend to feel like a loser if my work is not considered ""outstanding"".

This is such a big stressor for me because I have always been inclined to learn new things and master them. I seek them not because of recognition initially.

Well this one as soon as I moved the weight The  Door slams up shut throwing me into the trailer and slamming behind me.
And it wasn't gentle it was violent picking me up off my feet and threw me into the trailer.

I'm very outspoken when people do wrong things. Today while shopping for some goods I also wanted to grab a quick snack to eat from the bakery part. It is self serving there, you have to use gloves or tongs. 
A guy from another class at my school was there and picked the stuff up with his bare hands. I said to him ""bro, use the tongs at least"", to which he angrily replied why I care and if I work there. I tried to argue with him but he didn't even got my arguments (unhygienic, everyone has to he is no exception etc).

485,"Well I'm embarrased to ask about this because I feel it's such a bad moment to do it since everything that's going on in America when it comes to racial issues.

But anyway, my family is moving to Europe (Croatia) because it's better than living in Chile and I'm doing my research. Everyone in my family is white except for my grandfather who is brown and obviously my dad who is mixed race.

But both my sister and I are white and now I'm confused because I'm reading that in Europe some people think you need to be genetically pure to be white. That's not a thing in Chile, it doesn't matter here, that's not something that makes any you less white, asian, brown or black. 

Because it doesn't make sense, no one of us looks or identify ourselves as brown or any other race, we're never going to go trought racial opression or racial discrimination. We're never going to be victims of racism. We're not people of color, it's impossible to tell us appart from any random european. 

But from other sources I'm also reading that in Europe is not a thing either and that only white supremacists believe that and now I'm confused. So how is it then?

It's not about having white privilege or not, it's about losing the identity you've always had for a reason that's never mattered before. I'd feel as bad if I was asian, brown or black and I read the same thing about something so personal. 

So how is it then? Should I be worried over my identity changing? Do people care about that there? It's embarrasing to ask about this but I don't know what to expect.

487,"So I'm 23F and moved out for university some years ago. My brother is 21M and lives at home with my mum, he has a job. My brother has been smoking weed for ages, he smoked moderately and it never interfered with his life. Note that weed is illegal in my country. My mother was never told about it because she's against weed and thinks it's as bad as heroin and other hard drugs. Some time ago he found out my brother was smoking, had a meltdown, shouted at him for ages and then didn't do anything and is now in denial/pretends it never happened.

However, my brother has recently started to sell weed as well. I'm worried about this because it could lead to jail time (unlike having weed for private use) and I don't know what kind of people he's dealing with (the drug market is managed by the mafias). I've told him to be careful and I believe he's a clever guy, but I don't know what else I should do.

489,"So long story not so short, I moved in with a girl I used to know when we were teenagers and her previous college dorm roommate. Although I hated this girl when we were younger, I figured she’d changed and needed to move out of my parent’s house so I ended up signing a lease with the two of them. Things were okay for a couple of months, but gradually the longer we lived together the more I realized they’re both insane, immature, and terrible to live with. Unfortunately I had already renewed the lease for another year so I was SOL at the time, but they found a way around it by signing a lease for a different apartment in the same complex and will be leaving at the end of July, thank GOD. 
Over the course of us living together not even a year now, my stuff has been broken, my wishes not respected at all (constantly asking them not to wash my food knives and they do it anyways), I feel like I am always cleaning up after their messes and the majority of the stuff in the apartment is mine, and I just generally feel like they have no respect for my property. I bought the living room TV and I was never able to use it because they both hogged it and made me feel like an outcast. So finally I took it away because I didn’t feel like they deserved to use my things. On her 21st birthday, when we were still getting along, we threw a nice party for “roommate A” the girl I had known from when we were kids. She got shit faced within 40 minutes and me and another girl had to take her to the bathroom while she profusely threw up. Then she passed out and I had to entertain her guests for hours until they felt like leaving. During social distancing they have brought countless guests over and haven’t even asked me. Roommate A’s boyfriend stayed for 4 nights in a row one time which is against our lease agreement. Also against our lease agreement is having pets that aren’t emotional support animals. I love their pets but they torment my cat and she is approved to live there.
But anyways getting back to the slapping. I was getting ready to work the night shift at my hospital job and was looking forward to making french press coffee all day, but when I got into the kitchen I searched high and low and realized I couldn’t find it. I asked roommate A (the girl I knew from the past) if she knew where my french press was. She said a terse “No.” and quickly left our apartment, shutting her door behind her which was highly suspicious to me. So I texted roommate B and asked her if she knew where it was. Her response was “Idk where yours is but the one sitting out was Lauren’s, her grandparents gave it to her” and I politely told her that it wasn’t, it was mine. She rudely blew me off, so I decided to go into roommate A’s room and see if it was in there. Lo and behold she had stowed it away under her bed. I thought to myself “I don’t remember her ever having her own coffee press and I know I got my french press from Ikea, where I bought several items prior to moving in.” So I check on the bottom and it clearly says Ikea. There’s my proof. I tried to text roommate A to let her know that it was mine but she had blocked my number. We’ve had conflicts in the past but nothing severe enough to merit her blocking my number, and it’s also just such an immature thing to do. Anyways after I realized it wasn’t going to go through I texted roommate B and told her to pass the message along. She basically said “Congrats I don’t care bye.” Hmmmm. I was outraged by all the previous conflicts and the blatant lie roommate A had told herself and roommate B that her grandparents got her the IKEA FRENCH PRESS. So I started gathering up all of the things in the apartment I knew for a fact were mine and put them in my room. Right when i was finishing, roommate A storms in on the phone and immediately says “Did you go through my stuff?” I told her I had taken my property back. She got in my personal space and started yelling and insulting me while her friend was on the phone. She said something along the lines of “I know you’re trying to die because you drink yourself to death every night in your room.” That struck a chord with me coming from a family with a history of alcoholism not to mention it was another blatant, fabricated lie, and all roommate A does is work at a cake shop 2 days a week and sit on her butt and smoke pot in our apartment. I was so mad at this point I was shaking and kept asking her to leave me alone and give me space but she kept provoking me and refused to leave me alone. I told her if she didn’t I was bound to hit her, and then she kept saying “hit me hit me hit me” so I pushed her and then slapped her. This completely unfazed her. I’m almost positive she set it up, having her friend on the telephone and intentionally provoking me. She finally walked away into the entrance of her bedroom and continued to shout at me from over there even after i had smacked her. She told her friend on the phone I had choked her which was comical and kind of made me wish I had. 
Anyway, I’m not even really sure I feel guilty for hitting her. I’m fed up with her and the other one’s bullshit. I was far too kind and forgiving towards them when they didn’t deserve it. I guess I just want to know, how deep of shit am I in for doing that considering all the background information? I didn’t really hit her that hard because she’s a noodle and I knew she couldn’t take it. Let me know what you guys think and I’m sorry this post was so unbearably long.",03Jun2020,1

 My oldest brother is in a coma (has been for 25 years) and is cared for at home.
This lead to my older brother and me being left at my grandma's house a lot of our childhood. I understand that they didn't have much of a choice there but I couldn't help feeling a little alone.

Furthermore, my mother seems to have some anger issues and throws around really hurtful words when she's angry (slut, ungrateful brat, worthless and others). 

A few years ago she started to get interested in spirituel things and has even started a cult-like small community called the ""light circle"" (translated). 
(funfact: she called me a demon) 
I don't necessarily have an issue with that but she pressures my father and me to get into it as well. 

She tell me to just forgive and forget but it's not that easy for me. I simply don't know how. I am scared of her doing everything again because she doesn't seem to regret those things. She doesn't even acknowledge them as mistakes...

My girlfriend naturally wakes up at 7 no matter when we go to sleep, so she always goes to bed before me. The problem there is that she has difficulty sleeping when I'm not in bed with her. 

It's gotten to the point where I've had to compromise and start going to bed at 12, which is very early for me. I also sleep in until 1 when I have nothing to be up early for, so I end up losing hours of time because I need to be in bed at this time. Because of this I end up groggy and tired for most of the day, until about 8. 

I've tried going to bed earlier and setting alarms and getting up earlier, I've also tried just staying up for a full day and going to bed at 10. I've forced myself to have a normal sleep schedule for years in the past due to employment. Nothing is working.

Does anyone have any advice on how to change a sleep schedule?",03Jun2020,1

501,"Hey, throwaway account because I don’t need this mess attached to my main. 

Background: Recently, my cousin was attacked by a man who was attempting to kidnap, rape, and (presumably based on his criminal record) kill her. She was saved by people hearing her call for help and a transient man coming to her aid and running the man off as he was dragging her. She’s going to be ok, thankfully. As you can imagine, this hasn’t been the best time for my family. Many of them went into “find him before the police” mode. Well, the police found him first. 

Now to why I am asking my question. My brother is currently in jail. While he isn’t in jail for anything violent he does have an anger problem and is aggressively protective of family. As far as I know, he doesn’t know about this incident yet. He’s in the same jail where the attacker is now residing. When my dad found out about this he texted my husband asking him to get a message with the attackers name to my brother. My husband didn’t know that they are in the same facility and didn’t understand the significance of this request. I did. 

I didn’t know how to deal with what my dad did. Don’t get me wrong. I will not mourn anything that happens to this man. My cousin is 16, and she’s not even the youngest girl he’s gone for, but I am not ok with my brother’s issues being manipulated and my husband being made complicit in whatever would take place if my brother finds out about this while they are in the same area. So I called my mom and asked for advice on how to deal with my dad. And she decided to take of it. Tbh I was kind of hoping she would. I’m intimidated by my dad and my mom divorced him years ago, she has no issue calling him out on his shit. 

I’m at a complete loss right now how to process that my dad would just so casually be willing throw away the future of his son and son-in-law (and by extension his daughters as well) lives when the man is already being charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. This will take a while to process, I think. 

So, like I said, I’m pretty confident my dad is the all around asshole, but am I the coward for ducking out and letting my mom take the lead on calling him out for it?",03Jun2020,1

510,"So, since this Quarantine started I have completely isolated myself from my ""friends"" (most of which I did not share much interests with but our personalities used to gel) and am just living the life of a neckbeard gamer, eating junk, needless and mindless fapping, being up till late, no excercise, halted self improvement, no studies and being introverted. Been helping a few people with my advices, but the energy just went below the threshhold of me barely functioning. I just feel so tired, with an emerging pot belly, dark circles, no energy and just no motivation at all. I have hit the dipping point. 

Each day I worry about different problems, but today for some reason was thinking about my very deserted dating life. Not that I am a nice guy or any of that stuff, just that I can't find opportunities and there is just some little or big thing always coming in the way. I think I am fat and overweight, but I have developed a charismatic personality, or so I think until and unless I am bored and tired then I am as exciting as a cardboard.

 I want to be myself, and I am very open about topics like sexuality, spacey stuff, normal politics, and can have good decisions, but it just does not seem like the topic that most people would like to talk about. I cannot make small talk very well, and absolutely HATE bitching. 

People were not very receptive to my advances of flirting or such stuff when I was a total dipshit in many ways, which I still am, but I feel like I have become like 0.1% better and some people are receptive but I have this fear of flirting or just telling people that I find them pretty or asking them out which has blocking me from finding the one. I could go on and on about this, but you get the drill.

 I just really want to turn my life around right now and just get a little closer to live my dream life.

 Does anyone have tips where to start? Thanks for reading such a long ass post.",03Jun2020,1
511,"Hi! I’m a soon to be 16 year old female, and I’m about to ”graduate” from primary school (note: I do not live in America, its different here) 

I’ve never really liked, P.E, or the teacher, but I really try to do my dang best to keep up my grades..
Now this is the last week of school, and for 2 months I’ve had this assignment, where you have to make up some sort of dance with a song, of course, record it, and send it to our teacher via google classroom, which I find extremely psychologically difficult, I literally can’t find myself to do it, even though I want to and I have a lot of pressure too..
Now I’m not one of those who don’t care about my grades, I don’t mess around in school and do nothing, my grades are pretty good! 
I really want to but I just can’t! I feel horrible about this, and I do not know what to do! 
My teacher reminds me every week, and I’ve told her how I feel about this, and she just dismisses that and says ”No you can do it” and walks away.
I have no confindence and never have, I hate looking at myself, and I break down in tears everytime I try to do this assignment! Maybe this is normal for teenagers but maybe there is some deeper issuse? My boyfriend is super supportive and believes in me, but even his support can’t even motivate me to do this.
I am grateful for any advice/tips/motivation, I feel kind of lost and I don’t know what to do..",03Jun2020,1
512,"TL;DR: I'm a 20yo (engineering student) multi-instrumentalist/music production enthusiast considering to change my current career path to pursue a career in music, not knowing what my options and potential jobs are and how hard it is to get a financially stable job in the music world.

I started my first guitar lessons when I was 8, and I immediately fell in love with the whole concept of music. Playing it, creating it, and the physics behind it all is fascinating to me ever since. 10 years ago, I joined a local orchestra which brought the music even closer to me. Along with some friends from the group, I traveled throughout Europe for many musician exchange programs, and I got to know many amazing musicians and cultures. During my time in the orchestra, I played the guitar, the trumpet, the percussions and bass.

For the past couple of years, I've been in a constant discussion with my inner self about whether or not I should pursue a career in music. I'm from a country where you are, from a young age, pressured into finishing all of your studies by the age of 25 and then immediately getting a job to support yourself. My family is economically stable, but even I feel that social pressure in the air wherever I go.

I graduated from a mainstream highschool instead of a musical one, because a career in music isn't exactly  considered a ""safe"" path in my country. Also, the music schools have somewhat of a bad reputation here education-wise, coming from the musicians themselves.

I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable when it comes to theory, and my friends from the music school  tend to tell me I know and feel more than their music school colleagues. Since my hobby began 12 years ago, all my saved-up money went into investments such as buying recording gear, buying both an electric and bass guitar etc. I'd also say that my taste is fairy diverse. I deeply enjoy a wide variety of genres, hard rock, progressive, metal, ethno, fusion, you name it. I especially enjoy the intricacy and complexity of jazz and similar genres. 

My most recent projects were playing as a solo music composer/arranger/artist for a theater play, and playing bass in a professional musical play.

My current studies in engineering aren't going too well because I feel so disinterested. Everyone says the first year is usually terrible for everybody, but I seem to struggle with focus, goals and priorities way more than others, presumably because I might have chosen the ""safe"" path which might only lead me to financial stability down the line.

So, after my rambling, sorry about that, I ask you: 
If I were to pursue a music career abroad, what are my options as a multi-instrumentalist/music production enthusiast, and what could be my potential careers, apart from, say, being a music teacher ? Do you have any rough guidelines I should follow ? Is it difficult to find financial stability in such a field ?",03Jun2020,1
513,"Right this is a bit of a fucked one, and I'm totally beside myself on what I should do! So people of reddit what would you do? 

My brother went out with this narcissistic beast, we shall call her hippopotamus because of her ridiculous weight (I'm not fat shaming but in this case its justified) anyway she was always super jealous of mine and his close relationship, and had serious envy of the love he has for my children. 
I stopped hanging around my brother when he was with her because my son whom was one at the time would scream uncontrollably whenever she was near, they were never left alone together but children tend to be excellent judges of character, because of this she grew extremely enraged and manifested this strange vendetta against us, I guess because of rejection although I never voiced this to her just distanced myself silently. So anyway some time passed and they went their separate ways, job done right? No, she then told my brother that I had come into her place of work and harassed her which was completly fabricated unless you call pulling into a starbucks and asking for a frappe harassment.
My reaction to this was simply to block her. This was last year, no contact or run ins have happened since. Again job done right ? Wrong again! This crazy whore took it upon herself to at 11.30 at night post dark chocolate buttons through my letter box, throw chunks of brownie, buttons and broccolis over my garden fence, I watched confuse as she trotted away from my property , my neighbour witnessed this and I saw her myself, at first I was confused but then it clicked that these items were infact toxic in large doses to a dog, thankfully my dog is a rather pampered pooch and has his own bedroom so I was able to clear away all the waste before damage was done, i phoned the police and reported it to her place of work, now I am at a loss as to what to do, shall I wait, do I publically out her? I'm living in fear that she will come back and also In anger that I didnt make chase and round house her, but i just watched out my window confused trying to understand what and why that had just happened.

After speaking to my brother the only reason I can come up with that she did this is that they were rekindling their relationship and she saw how happy a video sent to him of my dog made him, he tried to contact her to confront her but shes just straight up vanished. What can I do now ? What would you do? Help my sanity please :(  does anyone know what the repercussions for her actions will be ?",03Jun2020,1

515,"This all sort of came to me while listening to a review/analysis of the album “To Pimp A Butterfly” by a Kendrick Lamar. I’ve been thinking about this but confronting the issue in any way scared me, but hearing this review made me realize just how important it is. In this album he compares his fame to his first girlfriend (according to the reviewer) in the lines 

“At first sight they love you

But I just wanna fuck”

Now when I heard this I (completely directly and immediately) felt a relation. I wouldn’t say I myself related to that, but I would definitely say comparing the words to my situation is like comparing a grassy field to a desert. The foundation may be different but the silhouette remains the same. With that out of the way I need to get to the point.

My girlfriend has had a history of abusive relationships that have directly affected her mental health and still do. She has been abused both physically and mentally and I feel it is important to state I have expressed a fear of lowering to such evils. I have had a history of anger issues and, though it has not happened, I fear the day one thing leads to another and I blow up and hurt someone I love, and having someone to love has awakened that fear in me. 

I should also give a more specific history about us. We have been together for only 8 months. From October to December our relationship was the closest relationship I had ever had to anyone since my brother when I was in preschool. In mid December my parents took me to inpatient for reasons unimportant to this post. I was kept away from electronics, and familiar people, as well as tested for 7 days, a full week. The experience though short was traumatizing, for other issues than the ones discussed above, upon release I was put on depression medication they thought would work but ultimately did nothing. The first day after being released I went home. The following day I took to the skies and traveled via plane to a different state in hopes of the fun Christmas times. Really the big important bits to take from this is i was away from my girlfriend for three weeks (nearly) and it was fine. When we got to see each other upon the return of school, we were just as close. This is important for the conclusion for lack of a better term.

Ever since January as you know the world has basically been in shambles, the first and really only important (to this post specifically) piece is that corona virus happened and my girlfriend is immunocompromised for various reasons. Like when I say various I mean various. There’s a lot. So that combined with the knowledge that depression had me cooped up in my room despite school being mandatory by the end of January (wayyyy before quarantine or even corona being common knowledge in my area) you can tell this has been a trip. Adding fuel to the depressive flames and important information to this post is the fact that since mid January I could feel me and my partner’s relationship growing farther apart. Now under many circumstances I’d assume my line of action would be to communicate this issue clearly and wait a bit to see if we grow closer again, if not take measures to see if I can reignite the flame. However the apocalypse (exaggeration ofc) is no mere “many circumstances.” These are times scattered with doubt, reflection and skepticism for me, at least. When I noticed this the first thing that came to mind was me simply having a good ol’ case of emotional numbness. However since this has been noticeable I have actually had many emotions on a daily basis, I’ve laughed, I’ve cried, I’ve screamed my lungs out in anger, and I’ve grunted in disapproval of social media people. I honestly from a logical standpoint do not believe in my emotional numbness that seems so existed from my emotional point of view. 

Only in the past month have I started to doubt my own awareness. I’m starting to feel like what I’m doing is just me latching onto the only close relationship I’ve had since before the world’s dirt first touched my young, innocent eyes for what wouldn’t nearly be the last time. Up until October I’ve been struggling with everything alone, and this one source of real support I just don’t think I could let go of even if I should. Whether or not I love her as much as I used to, which by the way I’m genuinely not sure, I still deeply care. In my realization comparison with Wesley’s Theory by Kendrick Lamar, the word fuck could just be seen as a metaphor for simply denying the unknown truth. At first sight, we loved each other, but in the present I may as well be denying my own lack of emotion(s) with only a half understanding of doing so. 

To translate this to the average joe who hasn’t quite had enough morning caffeine to understand; I’m stuck between two beliefs. I’m depressed, I should get help and see where I’m at then, I could still love her, but I am just numb in the present. I don’t love her anymore, and denying that will only drag the one I love into despair with me. 

To connect and sum up every paragraph written. If I break up with my girlfriend it is going to hurt both of us, and there is a chance I will leave myself with regret, especially if I still love her when I start to feel again. There was a time where separation physically did not mean separation mentally and emotionally, and though it was short compared to now, it still exists. And for a last bit of information, my girlfriend has noticed it too and we’ve decided for at least a month, we are going to focus on our own mental health in favor of talking to each other as often. We think if we become happier, we may become closer. However, happiness only feels further out of reach. At this point I don’t know if my own emotions are real, and my very thoughts are opposed to each other.

To conclude, this is a not-so-simple disagreement with my perceptive reality and what I believe is real in my soul and gut. I’m honestly scared of my eyes telling me the truth. I ask only of your opinion, your wise words, and your advice from behind the metallic curtain.",03Jun2020,1

520,"so I'm not sure what to write but I'm just going to start and see where it goes. 

For all my life I can only remember working hard and trying to do the right thing and helping others, yes I know it sounds like a cliche but my parents raised me in the manner of being respectful, kind and courteous as well as if you want something in life then you go get it. on to the point.

So I've gone down the path of doing a profession that makes you happy as you'll never work again and I can say after 8 years I'm still happy with my choice of being a chef. I got far in my career and worked for some of the best chefs in the country (UK). Things started to go wrong and fall apart, unfortunately. 

I've been through quite a lot of crappy jobs since what I like to think of were the glory days. From one job to another I had been treated like trash and now my mental wellbeing isn't what I'd call strong. I have gone down routes to get by but all my choices seem to blow up in my face. I finally found something steady with decent pay and good hours but of course, it went bad... really bad. I suffered a workplace accident with left me in hospital for a week and unable to work for a further 3 weeks with a slow rehabilitation process after as well as significant scaring for life all over my arm. 

I managed to get back into work and begin to build my confidence but my hours start getting cut to the point where I can't afford my bills. I bit the bullet and left and found another job with better prospects of hours and money. for a while, everything is looking up but as a few months settling in, I get told I'm being made redundant and will be unemployed. back to square one. I have no money, no job, and a lawsuit that has fallen through from my workplace accident which hasn't seen any traction for a few months now. through the current pandemic, I've moved to Norway with my girlfriend and have started a new life here. she has just gotten a job with fantastic pay and I'm very happy for her. the job I had secured has now been withdrawn and I'm once again unemployed with no idea on what to do as I'm now in a foreign country and don't speak Norwegian with no job. classic immigrant. 

my girlfriend doesn't like to hear me upset but I am depressed with money issues and metal issues with nothing going right with my life. I know things could be worse but its been 3 years of struggling with no sign of thing getting better, I tried to take my own life a few times now, and I'm not sure how long it will be till I finally succeed. 

I hate myself more than anything and look in the mirror and say to my reflection I hate you. I look at my arm and wish the accident were more severe and wish I died because as of now I'm so tired of fighting, I'm so tired of debt, I'm so tired of being pushed aside and disposed of like I don't have any worth, I'm tired that all the people around me have much better luck whereas I have none.

Basically she met this girl on Tinder 3 weeks ago.

* On Tuesday evening he asks me if I am okay with her staying at our place for a couple weeks - she is, apparently, arranging a place to live -, to which I say I am not OK with.
* On Tuesday night she is at our place.
* On Wednesday morning **I confront him and tell him if she hasn't left by the evening I am calling our landlord and his family**.

Everything in the story of this girl sounds *shady:* Just arrived in the city not so long ago, she has a rich family back in her country, she has some cool interesting business ideas, etc. I just don't buy it. Also she expects him to pay for everything.

I have seen enough of my roommate's beheaviours to be quite certain in thinking - in his intimate relationships - he is abusive and manipulative. He really **needs** the assurance of a lover. Therefore, I believe this girl is leeching off him through some made up stories, and, by extension, me.

Do you think I am doing the right thing?

Many thanks.",03Jun2020,1

523,"I've always had a hard time taking effective notes while reading new material. I try to only write the important things down.. but since I am learning something new, everything seems important. This causes multiple pages of notes that are pointless because then I'm just gonna have to read through all of those without the quick and concise information standing out like it should.

How can I decipher what is actually important enough to write down, and what I don't really need?

524,"Hey reddit people. I am in need of some real advice. Whenever i’m going to a party or a social type gathering with new people, old friends, or people i’m just acquainted with i get really nervous, stressed and anxious. I overthink situations and always prepare for the worst case senario.. it’s very taxing on my mind.

I am 21 years old, i live in a small valley where everyone somewhat know who you are, wheter it’s from a rumour (good or bad) or if you’ve briefly met somewhere. 

As humans have a tendency to do in my experience, it often occure that we talk other people down, to raise ourselves up. And we tend to notice and talk about peoples mistakes more often than we notice the positives/successes of other people. 

I have as any other man, made mistakes that i regret, mistakes that i am afraid people talk about or know me for. So whenever i’m going to a party especially, i have to picture the worst case senario and prepare for it. I process thoughts like:
«Do they know me?»
«Do they disslike me?» 
«Will there be drama around me?»
«Will anyone say something negative about me resulting in drama?» 
«Is there a rumour on me?» etc. 

I get very stressed, anxious and nervous because of this and i never end up fully enjoying myself or relaxing. I’m almost always tense and on my guard. In this situation i deem emotions like these unecessary and i wish i could turn them off.. but i can’t. 

I’m going to a party the coming weekend, and i know for a fact that someone who disslikes me will be there. I am too mature to think or do to others what i think they will do towards me. There is no way of knowing wheter or not anything will even happen, maybe i’m overthinking it.. but that’s the problem, i just have to prepare for the worst, and it’s exhausting. 

I get stressed in situations where i don’t have control. And i can’t control other people. And as sad as it sounds, a lot of people are enjoying putting other people down. 

Any advice on not giving a f*c is appreciated!",03Jun2020,1

I want to help my SO move in the grieving process, but I am unsure how to help them move along the process.

I grew up with pets my whole life and have had to put down some due to them dying in excruciating pain and wanting to end the pain quickly so they won’t have to suffer.

Other pets, I have let go peacefully in their favorite place wrapped in their favorite blanket. In a loved spot, warm and protected so they know that I loved and cared for them.

My SO is the other way. She has never had a pet growing up, as parents never allowed. Since we have progressed further; we have moved in and got a pet together when we have first moved in. With our pet, we became a small family of sorts. 

Unfortunately, this is also her first time witnessing a beloved pet pass on. We made sure he was in his favorite spot under his favorite blanket with his favorite snack laying against him. I told my SO that this will be his last rest and that he will be at peace and free from any pain and suffering. 

But I am unsure how to help her move on. I remember crying and the sadness for many days. I want to make the grieving process as easy and simple as I can. It hurts to watch my SO cry, and it hurts to watch the sadness envelop her; but she seems to have not accepted the pet’s death.

How can I help move this process smoothly and easily so my SO can move on in peace?",03Jun2020,1

My best friend since 2010, lets call him Dan

And mutual friend of theirs and my ex girlfriend, let's call her Witch

I've known Dan since 2010, as well as I knew Anna. We were really good friends, spent a lot time together over every school vacation we had. ( Each one of us lived in other city, 100km+ km away from each other. Aside Witch and Anna, they lived close to each other )

Witch came into play when one of my other friends got together with her. She also went to school together with Anna.  I did like her right away, but didn't want to do anything to brake their relationship. So next summer Vacation we came together, broke up few weeks later, then came together again and so on around 5-6 times. All of that played between 2013 - 2016..

In between Anna, Dan and me stayed best friends, and hung together every second we could.

Anna found a boyfriend in 2015. 

Due to the Family problems I moved to other country 1600km away from my hometown with my mother and sister.

I kept talking to Dan, but Anna would never write, and when I would do it her answers were short like ok, yeah, good you? etc..

So in 2017 i went there for my vacation, got my hair bleached, and 1 Tattoo, ear piercing etc..

He is afraid, always argues with mom about money (we are not poor, we own a buisness but even with a sustainable source of income, i feel like he negates many things to me)

Since i was a kid, he only threw at me the necessities to survive in this modern world, gave me a tv and then a pc, and let me destruct myself (i am exagerrating here). I ended up gaining weight. My max has been 112kg, and am now diabetic. For these, its my own fault, but i cant help but think ""what if he made the effort to controll me and make me move a little when i was a kid"".

He LOVES fishing, whenever he can he goes fishing. But he never made an effort to transmit something to me. In fact, I AM the one making the effort here and ask him ""can i come with you?"". But it only ends up with him throwing the necessary at me and making me figure it out myself while he fishes.

There has been even a period where i smoked weed and ended up with people that were not nice, just because my parents (my dad more, mom loves and tries to take care of us and talk with us) never checked on me.

I am sad and angry, i envy all the families that pass before me that go in bycycles and walkings, with their dad joking with them and genuenly showing love for them.

Its not like he does not care for me or doesnt love me, i love him too, but he's just... absent.

His train of thinking is ""i am the dad, leader of the familiy, i will work and bring the bread home, with both my sons that are genius angels with all straight 10's (A+'s), and a loving wife that will cook everything i want and like, that always has to be good, and all the time i want to sleep and rest"", like a fucking 1970's albanian (we are albanian).

Since her birth, I’ve been holding her, entertaining her, napping her etc. Shes a clingy baby so she’s hard work. I vaccum the kitchen and living room plus hallways on a daily basis. Me and my brothers handle dishes, washing and drying, cleaning the kitchen after food, and I cook some of the meals. I feel like I do an acceptable amount of housework, along with looking after baby and schoolwork. I feel like I deserve some time to myself for hobbies and such, since I have no friends, I rarely go out as I’m not aloud by myself and my parents are too busy to take me anywhere. 

My parents often complain we don’t do enough, they had huge fights that included it, so I’ve been trying harder. However when I do do extra jobs, my dad sees me and feels bad and tells me to stop.

She’s been saying this for a while now but this has been what she has been saying recently. A friend of hers has even told her that by the time I do turn 18, she’ll be older and finding someone will even be harder. Personally I think this has been an excuse since there’s no reason she couldn’t date someone whilst looking after me all this time, I think anyway. Besides that though, I just don’t really get it and I told her that unfortunately you need to look after yourself in order to be with a rich person and that the world is unfair like that because what are we going to offer someone who is super rich if we don’t even look after ourselves right? We started eating healthy but then she started buying junk food again, but it’s not like if the opportunity was in front of her she would date a rich man. I say this because she once met a rich man but pretty much turned him down because she thought he was ugly or something and then she said she’s not going to look for anyone anymore. It was nothing serious with him but he was being nice to my mom. My mom never even goes out to socialise or meet anyone either like I don’t but the difference is that she expects to have a rich husband without talking to any person.

555,"i can’t believe i’m even typing this but this dishwasher is the hill i’ve chosen to die on so here we go

i live with one another roommate who is a friend of mine and we get along really well. we both clean up after ourselves and are both very non confrontational and hate drama or conflict. 

however, the one thing she absolutely never does, which i will never understand, is rinses her plates or dishes off before she puts them in the dishwasher. and i’m not talking about rinsing a few crumbs or something, i mean she’s putting bowls and plates FULL of pasta sauce or butter or residue left inside and just letting it sit in the dishwasher and get dry/crusty and gross until the dishwasher cycle gets run.  

this inevitably leads to the dishes and plates coming out of the dishwasher and still being gross, because our washer is shitty to begin with and can’t handle all the extra residue that’s being left on our dishes when they’re put in. also, i genuinely thought rinsing your plates off was just common sense. i’ve truly never met someone before this that just puts in an entire sauce-filled bowl in the dishwasher with no ounce of water or rinsing whatsoever and just expects the dishwasher to magically remove all traces of it. 

my non confrontational pussy ass tries to be the one to start the dishwasher at all times so i have a chance to rinse all the bowls and plates shes put in there before the cycle starts, but obviously this can’t happen all the time. (although whenever it does, all the dishes magically come out of the washer perfectly clean. so maybe i’m onto something here)

so whenever it’s her that starts/unloads the dishwasher, she almost always comments on how gross the dishes still look. i ALWAYS comment (in a very objective, neutral tone) that i think it’s because we need to rinse them better before we put them in. i don’t know how many times i’ve said this now. at this point she’s probably seen me taking her own plates out of the dishwasher and rinsing them before i start a cycle multiple times now. i truly dont know why this isn’t going through her head. 

i feel so dumb because other than this she’s literally a wonderful roommate and causes no issues but it’s so so so annoying unloading the dishwasher almost every day and seeing disgusting dishes all because she can’t take 10 seconds to rinse them off. i am at a loss. i dont know how to bring up a small dumb dishwasher issue without making her feel blamed. 

it’s already been brought up multiple times when she goes to unload the washer, comments on how it never does its job properly, i comment that we need to rinse the dishes better in order for it to do its job properly, and then nothing ever changes. im sick of secretly rinsing all the dishes before the cycle starts.

He finally ended up texting me on whatsapp yesterday, sending me some weird message about how I shouldn't listen to other people and that I'm a good boy, and to answer his phone calls otherwise he would need to come to the town where I live. 

This freaked me out so I finally called him back to see what was up, he sounded nervous on the phone and asked me all about school and stuff, then he told me I really left an impact on him since I was such a good worker and that he frequently thinks about me at night. Then he asked me if I could come over because he has a couple of other projects he needed help with, I told him after I'm done with my exams in July so he would finally leave me alone, although I'm not even considering on going back to work for him, I am truly afraid he might molest me or worse.

I'm not sure what I should do, I am truly afraid of him as he does sound obsessed with me, ive seen lots of crime shows about stalkers and I'm afraid on what he might do. I don't think he knows exactly where I live, but he knows the town. Should I go to the police, but he hasn't done anything illegal yet, and there is no proof I actually worked for him.

560,"I feel like I’ve lost a quarter of my life to the “me that wasn’t the best version of myself”. I’m 26 years old. I got told by my psychiatrist to get her some school reports in an effort to diagnose me with suspected ADHD. I read them. Every single one says I have trouble with focus. Every single one says I am easily distracted, and that I am prone to distracting others. Highschool and childhood in general were really tough  times for me, usually relating directly to known symptoms of ADHD. The school reports are the nail in the coffin. I am overwhelmed with the horrible feeling that “this should have been discovered and addressed sooner”. I’m writing this because I can’t sleep. I haven’t shown the reports to the psych yet but I’m very confident by this point in what the result of her reading them will be. Anyways, goodnight.",03Jun2020,1

So i just heavily overslept work by 6 hours, meaning i slept for a full 16 hours. This job (or project) is just this one guy and me, we're basically equals, just that he's got more experience. I have 14 missed calls from him and i'm currently thinking about how i could word my apology to him and how i might make it up to him. Also this is not the first time this happens, i had stuff like this happen since school and lost a bunch of opportunities to the inability to wake up.

562,"I'm a 19 year old male and I had to I had to help my friend with a project this guys house. During this project the man we were working for weirded me out, he kept talking about sexual things, he was very touchy, always touching me in a playful manner and while talking about women once he made a playful remark and touched my groin area, me my friend and the boss were talking openly about women while working and he later showed me a porn video on his phone and asked me if I liked it and once he kept trying to convince me to take off my shirt while working.

All of these things made me really uncomfortable so when the week was over and I finally got paid I was extremely relieved, he asked us if we could help him with another project but I politely declined and told him I have to concentrate on studying during this period as I got exams soon.

563,"Guys, I've just recently graduated from an Arts school and now I have to choose between getting a job in either the advertising or marketing industry. As yall know the times now is difficult so when I contacted my previous intern (advertising) company, they could only take me back as an intern and not full-time. However, I can convert full-time in the future if I ""perform"" well on the job - means doing a lot of OverTime or stay back late to rush work... (sounds risky?)

My other offer is to work in-house as the brand's designer. They have a creative department but I'm expected to handle most projects on my own although I can seek creative advice from the main team if I need. I always think it's easy to get into a company as an in-house graphic designer but that limits my opportunity for growth right. 

I have so many difficult decisions to make for a first job and so either I pick one route from here or I seek for more employment offers as I risk paying more time...

566,"Some really complicated soap-opera kind of stuff going on here, I have no idea how to look at it and what to do, so I could really used some input... I’ll try to sum it up as much as I can.

So there’s this girl from the UK that I’m in a long distance relationship with. We’ve been talking for a little over a year, been together for three months. It was all perfect, we were planning a future together. Then we had a nasty fight (reason is not important) and she said that we were rushing it too much and that we should take a break and “just be friends”. We’re obviously not just friends. Friends don’t say “I love you”, or at least I’ve never said that to mine. And they don’t talk about kids and marriage. But whatever. She’s been acting reaaaaally weird, cold and distant over the past two months, since we’ve been taking this “break”. Why am I saying that she’s sending mixed signals? I’ll try to compare and contrast.

On one hand, we used to talk a lot. When we had a free 10 seconds, we’d get into a really deep and personal conversation about whatever. Even before we were a couple. We used to call each other, video call, make plans, laugh, cry and everything else related or not. We used to know what we were doing constantly. When she was sleeping, I’d send her messages and when I was sleeping, she would do the same (time zone difference). She was really involved and interested. Whenever there was something to share, she would share it.

On the other hand, now she’s barely texting me. Twenty bland messages a day, tops. I’m constantly trying to start conversations about whatever, she doesn’t join. She’s taking forever to reply. She’s constantly online and just ignoring my messages. I know for a fact that she’s talking to multiple people now, so I just feel like one of the many. She doesn’t call or text anymore, I’ve heard her voice like two weeks ago and didn’t see her face since we started this break thingy. She doesn’t ask about me, my day, my work, my thoughts anymore. She doesn’t ask anything anymore. Like, really, there’s no question marks (literally) in our chats, from her part. And most importantly, she doesn’t tell me how she feels anymore. At all. And it’s concerning. She’s talking very generally about everything, doesn’t share any of her opinions. She’s like a chat bot, honestly, and it hurts to even think about it. She didn’t compliment me once, on anything. When I compliment her, she’s just ignoring it, saying a short “thanks” or something like “You’re beautiful - I know”. She used to talk a lot about her family, now she doesn’t talk about them at all. She used to get worried about me for whatever reason, now she’s not. She’s refusing my help, whatever it is. She’s not giving me any attention whatsoever, she keeps apologising for it and keeps on doing it.

In her defence, she is really busy. She works from home and also is a second year in university, has homework too. Maybe she’s going through something (but really, two months?). And the most confusing thing, she keeps texting me first. Yeah, random, bland things, but she keeps doing it. There hasn’t been a day in which she didn’t text me. Whatever it is, she doesn’t let the conversation die. She doesn’t add anything to it either, but she keeps dragging it on. So that’s the most confusing thing about it. First of all, she keeps texting me. Second of all, knowing her, if she wanted to break up, she would’ve said that. If she had no feelings for me anymore, she would’ve said that. She’s that kind of person. But she’s not. She said at some point, when we were still together, that she only responds when she feels luke she has the time to give me her full attention. But again, she’s not really getting involved.

And against her, she’s never once helped me. When we were together, I was the one doing 70% of the planning, 70% of the compliments and talking. She was just being spoiled by it and somewhat returning it. Now, there’s other guys. She’s not talking about them, but I know for a fact that they’re there. It just feels like her personality did a full 180 overnight, literally. I have no idea how a person can change this much in such a short amount of time, not even on purpose, if it was planned to the latest detail.

One more important thing to mention. Lately, if I bring up any serious discussion, she won’t join. I can’t talk to her about it, she’s as close minded as one can get and she’ll cut it off immediately.

I told her that if anything bothers her or wants to talk about anything, I’m here for her. She says thanks and that she’s just busy, and that’s it. I honestly feel like I’m some sort of tool for when she’s bored or wants attention. That when the peer pressure will be high again, she’ll want to get back together and when it gets rough, she’ll just want another break. 

I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and see where this goes but it’s been two months already and it’s not going anywhere so far. Yeah, she’s still super busy, has shifts and homework and classes and exams, but still. I honestly feel like not texting her at all, although she will keep on texting me, but I don’t know what to do. There’s a lot of girls who are just like her, even better, but I still have feelings for this particular girl. And it’s getting to me. I feel like cutting her off from my life completely would hurt a lot right now, but be better in the long run, but this might as well be just what I signed up for initially and it could be a huge mistake. It’s long and messy...",03Jun2020,1

569,"i (16 f ) live with my mother, my parents split up a few years ago and i chose to stay in my home with my mother as im not comfortable living around my father (not important) anyway my parents split because my mother was cheating with her now partner, they had a child and he moved in (not even legally to everyone else he apparently does not live here, he does not even pay any rent, i would have to pay rent the moment im able to make money) like a year or something ago he bought two puppies, i love animals especially dogs and was excited to have a dog back in the family after our last was taken with my dad, we got 2 big dogs a rottie and a mastiff i absolutely adore them but they are not trained at all they arent even walked ever, the only time any of them went on a walk was when i noticed how bad the dogs were being treated and took up trying to train them and walked the rottie everyday (i was unable to walk the mastiff as she was in season because he refuses to get her done, she is now currently pregnant) i got pissed off at how he treats his dogs and started telling him to walk his fucking dogs and got told to fuck off because ""they are his dogs and he can do whatever he wants with them"" so i gave up, ok so im going to go into details on how he treats his dogs so if you dont like gross men hurting dogs then skip this part : he never trained them because he is a lazy cunt so they act like puppies still (jumping  up, barking a lot, playfighting with eachother, breaking stuff) his idea of training is kicking and hitting them if they do something he does not like, he also leaves them both in a cage that is way too small for the both of them for multiple hours a day he constantly threatens things like stepping on the dogs skull and crushing it he also has a cat thats disabled ( 3 legged, she lost the leg at birth since it got stuck and we had to remove it to save her, she was born from our old cat and mom gave her to him) and sometimes she pees or poos on the furniture, his way of dealing with that is rubbing her face in her pee and kicking her, so its no surprise she hates humans (she is sweet if treated right, i give her head scratches when i see her and she enjoys them and in return lets me handle her) so anyway onto how he treats my mother, manipulation, lots of manipulation i have noticed this since day one, he threatens to leave her if the house isnt clean enough for his tastes or he says he will leave her if she does not pay him back for the smallest of things, she literally had to borrow a £10 note to go buy us all some dinner and he gets on her case about it constantly and the thing is he pays no rent at all and cant even let his partner have £10 just to buy the family including him food so we dont starve she has to pay him back for everything, yet he gets away with paying nothing for living here and eating the food he does not pay for, i have seen him made my mother cry over how much of a  cunt he can be to her multiple times i fear he will become violent and is testing to see how much he can get away with before she realizes how bad he is and gets rid of him but i doubt she would as she ""loves him"" and even if she did get rid of him she would probably be in more debt due to all the things he makes her owe him, he is also bad with his son, my little brother, he constantly slaps him for doing stuff he does not like and yells at him so much he cries to which he gets yelled at more but he does not even do the parenting role properly, most of its just shoved onto my mother so anyway i fucking hate him and honestly am thinking about just slitting his throat in his sleep what should i do? i mean i could try to get him done for animal abuse, illegal drug use and for fraud (he told the government he is not living with my mother despite him living here for a couple years for financial gain so that counts as fraud if im correct) idk what to do im also worried if i try to get the rspca involved they may take MY dog, i dont harm my dog at all i research the proper ways to train her that professional dog trainers use ( using a certain tone of voice to let a dog know when its done bad and using lots of praise and treats when it does good) i walk her everyday but i fear they would take my dog away due to my age, if the two adults in the house cant look after animals why would a 16 year old be able to? what if the adults of the house turn to mistreating the other dog? idk i just dont want to risk losing her, my dog is the only creature that makes my life worth living, she is the reason i wake up in the morning (literally, i have to wake up at 9am to take he for her morning toilet)

571,"So, for the last few weeks I met through Reddit a nice boy same age as me (that´s why the throwaway), we would spend our days talking to each other and things like that, but after a few days I started having feelings for him, and I could notice that he was feeling the same.

Yesterday morning, the first thing I did was telling him the truth, and yey it was reciprocate. We talked a little bit more and he asked for a picture of mine. I asked for the same but he said that was uncomfortable with that, I did not want to see abusive or anything like that and just send him mine, then I had to leave because my online classes were about to start.

But, when I came back, he was acting a little bit weird, I thought nothing much about it then suddenly he just said: I don't love you, I imagined you were different.

Okay, that made me super sad, mad and dissapointed at him, altough I understand his pov, after some talk I just said goodbye and wished him the best.

We both just graduated from the same high school and sadly we’re both going to the same college. She didn’t get into her first choice college and I can’t afford to go out of town lol, so this is the only option for both of us. The reason why i’m trying to unfriend her is because she is just a shit person. She hasn’t done anything colossally bad to me, it’s just that she’s so annoying and her personality is terrible. Back in high school, she would sometimes use me for my work and always ask to see my scores on tests. Being around her feels so suffocating and toxic, I can’t fake friendship anymore (but to this day we’re still “nice” to each other).

575,"Ok so in 2017, I decided to go to my state college but I hadn't been able to take the SAT in high school. I think I had the flu that week. I planned to make it up but never did. So I asked my advisor what to do and she suggested I enroll in a community college to get 15 credits so I could qualify as a 'transfer'. 
My life went to utter shit that year. Homelessness and my car got stolen.
I got a 1.8 average.
Now I see how awful being a 'transfer' is. It means you just wasted time and money and I especially wasted time and money because not only are my classes irrelevant to what I want to do now, I failed them with no way to make them up unless I go back to the same community college and redo them. The CC also said I need to do 30 credits to achieve  'academic renewal' now. But I've moved and going back there isn't even viable.
I took the SAT later that year (2017) and actually did well on it. In retrospect I shouldn't have listened to the advisor and just taken the SAT. My situation has improved a lot but I still can't get rid of the grade.
How do I fix this problem and finish my degree?
Would an explanation essay in my application be enough?",03Jun2020,1
576,"I am becoming an angry person. I don't exactly know why. I do know that I am dealing with some recent difficulties - losing my job, ending a long term relationship and the worst having lost someone who I was close to consistently all my life.

I used to be a mediator but I can't even bring myself to try anymore because I begin a mental breakdown before I even get started. I have been having phases of obsession with different things for a few weeks at a time (ex - pinterest, clubpenguin, reddit, etc). All day I am on reddit and netflix and obsessing a little about savings. I am lucky to have family to fall back on for food and shelter.  

The only real productive thing I need to do is apply for jobs which I cannot until my previous employer sends me work samples that do not need to stay confidential. I am otherwise done with my portfolio and resume, which I obsessively did for a while too.

I have come to a point where my brain feels like its flailing when I have a quiet moment to myself and I cannot bear the solitude, I need constant distraction. I rarely part from my laptop and I don't even feel the motivation or curiosity to go to the balcony that is ATTACHED TO MY ROOM. I only realized this today. I used to sit on the balcony everyday for lunch when the lockdowns started. 

To be honest, all I genuinely feel like doing when I look deep within myself is to take a bat and smash everything around me, but I neither have that kind of tool nor stuff that I could break without costing me. Typing this all out is making me emotional and not in a ""good outlet"" sort of way. 

I started this lockdown out working myself into a steady motivation to learn and be productive but anytime I share my pursuits with my parents (after they push answers out of me) they start micromanaging me and bossing me around so much that I lost all interest and motivation. It becomes about following them rather than self improvement or learning stuff for myself. I am so frustrated.

I used to be the one to always reach out to my friends (they are all long distance) and now that they are freeing up I am getting messages for the first time but I don't want to be a downer and keep reminding myself of all things I am upset about. But I also feel really bad when I deflect from myself and push the convo on them because I am so consciously pushing away difficult thoughts. I feel guilty and weak. 

MAIN THING - I just want out of this mental state and be productive again and be at peace again. I welcome your insight. Please share any advice you have.",03Jun2020,1
578,"So I‘m not from a city, it‘s not that easy to find a big selection here, I‘m also not that good at cold approaching (being like: Hey Stranger, I saw you and I like your whatever...) So I concisered online dating.

Would be cool if you could share your experiences, I kinda feel like it‘s a huge time waste, plus you don‘t even have a guarantee that the person isn‘t trolling you, plus I don‘t know if everyone who‘s doing online dating is worth knowing. Might be a clichet but I find that a lot of people who online date, they must suffer from all kinds of deep problems, so that‘s why I‘m kinda scared off.

How do most of you get to know your girls?
Did you just walk around a mall and stopping someone on the street to tell them whatever?
Or is it more in bars? you go there alone and talk to random girls? if so, how do you avoid their friends? (because the girl won‘t be alone there right, if some of her friends see she‘s being approached, they like to get into a protector‘s role).

What do you find a good way, what would you advice a young person who wants to at least try to put themselves into a position where they could meet someone?

I try to work out with home programms and share my musical hobbies on Instagram. Would you want me to go and do cold approaching? isn‘t that just creepy? Plus I can only talk to a girl who‘s not with her friends right? because it gets really akward, they‘ll most likely push her past me even if she might have wanted to talk)

I really don‘t wanna relegate myself to pick up lines, that‘s as desperate as it gets, I find it cringy. I also don‘t feel comfortable walking up to someone mainly because of sexual interest (I don‘t know them, so it‘s just based off of that) I guess that comes if I force myself?

Dating is such a cringe fest to me... And I imagine it‘s really cringy to most girls, Imagine you‘re shopping with your friends and there comes this guy who somehow only talks to one of your friends, saying something about their clothes even if no ome asked for the opinion?  Am I getting this wrong?

581,"Hey y'all, this is my first post so hopefully I'm in the right place.

Please stick with me as I try to explain how I'm feeling. I know what I want to say but I'm not too good at articulating my thoughts.

The past year I've noticed that I'm starting to fear cherishing life as it is now. Crazy, I know. Not because I think something is going to go wrong as soon as I'm happy. It's more like this: I'm sitting on my couch, snuggled up watching Netflix and texting my friends. I have a beer cracked open and my puppy laying with me. My boyfriend is playing video games and my mom is telling me what her crazy African Grey parrot did that day. Life is good. So, so good. But, as I realize how amazing it all is, another thought comes into my head. And that is ""this won't be my life forever. One day I'll be old and gray. I won't be able to talk to my parents again. I'll lose my best friend, and my boyfriend too. My dog has (hopefully) 15 years in him, but 15 years is a short time and one day I'll be living without him, too."" I put myself in a funk that is so difficult to get out of. I'm almost afraid to cherish and enjoy the current moments because when I do, I'm just reminded that there will be one day when I won't have the people and things I love anymore. It's a vicious cycle and I could really use some advice to try and fix this. I don't want to look back one day and wish I had just told my inner thoughts to shut up and enjoy life now.

585,"hello everyone!! this is a burner username. I (26/F) just wanted some advice on what to do. When I was a kid (like 6/7 years old, I don’t remember) I was being watched by my babysitter one night and I remember she would give us benedryl to go to bed, essentially drugging me. I don’t remember much besides going to bed and seeing a guy standing over me at one point and then when I woke up the next morning, my PJs were on the floor. I don’t know what happened but it has never sat right with me. Said babysitter (female, mid-40’s) later would “teach” me how to french kiss. It wasn’t long after that I started being interested in sex and even started watching porn at age 9 (didn’t get off to it but was obsessed with it). Looking back, signs point to some kind of sexual assault happening that night. 

Fast forward to this week. My boyfriend decided to wake me up by using his fingers to ya know. I am not mad at him for it but when I started waking up and realized what was happening, I was confused and my mind instantly flashed back to when I was a kid and I panicked at first until realizing it was just him. I get he what he was trying to do and he doesn’t know about what happened to me as a kid so he wouldn’t know that what he did could be triggering. I think he knows I was bothered by it because he asked me yesterday if I enjoyed it and didn’t seem convinced. 

So do I tell him about this and explain that I am not upset with him for what he did because he had no indication that doing that could be triggering or do I let it go and wait until a later time to tell him this?",03Jun2020,1

588,"the title basically says it all. she’s been telling me about these issues she’s been having with her 50 year old co-worker, and recently it got worse. i initially responded in a way that made it seem like i disregarded her feelings, since i kept on telling her what i think she should do (instead of comforting her more in that moment that she opened up to me). i realized my response was wrong in that moment so i talked to her and listened to her but i still feel really bad. we’re both 19F doing long distance, so it’s hard at times to feel like i can fully support her the way i want to. i need to know what she needs to hear from me so she knows she’s not alone. she’s been very distant with me lately, and i know it’s about this situation she’s going through right now. 

what can i say to her so she can feel better? 

since she’s being distant, does she need space?

i kept on telling her that she needs to tell someone, but she’s scared. what should i do??",03Jun2020,1
589," 

my (23m) ex (21f) had to break up our ldr for her own mental health, she couldn't bear the weight of a relationship as well as her own crippling thoughts. She has since gotten help which I'm so relieved about. It's my first thought every morning how she is. I worry because I wasn't the problem and she might miss me but the few times I've reached out I've received no response which has made me feel worse and worse. It kills to know that someone can't know you for their own sake. She only ever spoke to me and her parents about her mental health issues before her therapist and I guess we didn't do a good job. I've spoken to a therapist but I don't talk to my family or friends about her because I don't want them to know she has such serious problems, she wouldn't want them to know either and I try to respect that. It's one of those things where I know things would be different if I lived there because my presence always helped her. It's hard to see how I will regain my optimism for life, when I constantly feel like I let down someone I love.

I had applied for a Masters course in her city before we broke up and I've just been accepted and am going to go because it's ideal for my career. I reached out yesterday after she told me not to months ago, I figured time had passed. I thought it would change things in terms of her wanting to speak with me, I didn't say I got in I just said I missed her and would love to try to be friends and talk, which is true. She didn't respond. It's a big city so we won't bump into each other so it will be tough for me living my life knowing she's there but I'll likely never see her again.

However, it's against the law for teachers to interact with students under the age of 18 outside of school so for her to interact with me would be illegal even though I just want to have a normal conversation.

Now social media is filled with blm. It isn't a bad thing (it's good that people are doing stuff) but I go to social media for escapism. I don't want to think about all the shitty realities of my life right now.

I follow people that have nothing to do with politics but that's the only thing they're posting now. I have nowhere to go, and I feel like I'd be the bad guy for trying to ignore what's happening.

592,"When I was 16 I got pregnant despite being on the pill. Due to the medication I took at the time I couldn't keep it as it is known to either lead to a stillborn baby or cause heavy birth defects. So when I went to the doctors I basically wasn't given a choice on whether I wanted to keep the baby or not. I got taken out of school for a couple of days and within two days I was already in surgery, getting an abortion. 

I never wanted a child before any of this but it completel, changed my mindset. During my short (~3 month) pregnancy I started loving the idea of having a child and the abortion was soul destroying for me. I had to go alone as I lived in the UK by myself and the father of the baby didn't feel up to going due to being too depressed from the situation. The whole thing was very hard for me without having anyone there to support me. In my mind it had twistrd more into having lost a baby rather than having an abortion as I would have kept it if there was a possibility of it being healthy. I ended up spending weeks in bed crying after, which wasn't helped by the fact that my lactation had set in, reminding me of what I'd lost. Everytime I got my period after it was like being punched in the face, my body telling me 'see what you did?'. 

Now, over 4 years later, I still struggle with this. My life is completely different (new town, new boyfriend, new career) but everytime I am reminded of pregnancy in some way I get really sad. I can't watch a movie or tv series where a character experiences pregnancy or be around pregnant women without at some point excusing myself to go to a quiet place and break down in tears. I honestly don't know how to deal with this anymore and I want to stop this from destroying my life any further.",03Jun2020,2

595,"I’m writing this in a complete state of shock. My bf and I have been together for almost a year now and while things haven’t been perfect, we both love each other dearly. It all happened last night. My bf was out all day and it was around 11 pm when I decided to call him and ask where he was and to make sure he’s ok. No answer straight to voicemail. I call again in 15 mins, same thing. All texts are going to green immediately. After about an hour of his phone being dead I started to worry so I message his best friend on Instagram to ask if he’s with him and if he’s ok. His friend replies saying that he’s been home and hasn’t heard from my bf in a while. I start to get really worried ( mind you I’m not usually this crazy but there is a curfew in my city due to the recent unrest so I was worried he was in some sort of of trouble). I am also 19 weeks pregnant so my hormones are making me fear the worst. Anyways he walks in and I immediately ask him to where he’s been all this time. He proceeds to tell me that his phone died and he fell asleep in the car. I was obviously pissed because why tf are you going to sleep in the car if your phone is dead?? Like you could at least charge it so I wouldn’t think anything was wrong. 

Long story short we start arguing and at one point I mention to him that I even messaged his friends to ask about his whereabouts because I was that worried. He flips out and starts yelling at me. He goes as far as to push me on the bed and pushes my head hard enough for me to physically fall backwards  on my back on the bed. He starts calling me a dumbass bitch and saying that he “loves me but doesn’t like me “ and that I need to get out right now and that he doesn’t gag about me and only cares/puts up with me because of the baby. 

Side note: I had to move in with him and his mom bc my mom kicked me out when she found out I was pregnant. 

After all the things he said, he makes me get up from the bed and go upstairs to his moms room just so he can tell her that I need to leave the house right now. Mind you his little sister and all of her friends were in the living room witnessing this going on. His mom starts questioning what is going on and he basically tells he that I’m an annoying ass bitch and that he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore and that he doesn’t care where I go but I can’t stay there. His mom and him go back and forth and eventually we all go back to the basement ( his room) and he tells me to pack my bags. I tell him that I literally have no where to go and even if I did I couldn’t go anywhere due to the curfew. 

He tells me “well then you gotta sleep outside”. He then proceeds to push my head hard in front of his mom 4 more times. To the point where his mom had to get between us and tell him to not put his hands on me anymore. More arguing ensued and went on until about 4 am. So 4 hours of arguing straight. 

I was visibly distressed and he also says “I swear to god if you get a miscarriage I’m going to beat the shit outta you”. Apparently to him, me crying was going to cause a miscarriage and not him screaming at me for 4 hours. His mom had to interject and say that it wouldn’t be my fault and situations like those were the reason I would have a miscarriage. 

Long story short it was basically all for nothing because he then tells me that I don’t have to go anywhere and he would never put me out while I’m pregnant. So then what was the point of waking your mom up and embarrassing me in front of your sister and friends?? I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t want to stay in a house where I don’t feel wanted but at the same time I have no where to go. I told him when I first found out I was pregnant that my mom would kick me out and he said that I could live with him and that everything would be alright. 

Am I overreacting to the pushing thing? It’s not like he full on hit me. I just can’t look at him the same.",03Jun2020,1
596,I’m new to reddit and Have never really shared anything if seriousness but right now I need advice. I’m not going to go into deep detail as to how it happened but I lost the girl if my dreams. I’m 20 and have had a few decent relationships but none like my previous. This girl is everything I could ask or have wanted and now she’s completely gone from my life. The whole quarantine took a tole on our relationship and we went from being best friends to having spite for one another. The arguments became more frequent and we started talking less and less. After a while things completely went down the shitter and I basically burned the bridge. She got drunk I cursed out her friends and cousins and I made a fool of myself but don’t think I’m a bad person I just made a poor decision because I was hurt. The next morning she broke things off with me and told me to not bother responding. I haven’t reached out to her in Andy way and I don’t feel as though I will ever. I truly loved this girl and all I wanted was to be loved back. I truly lost my best friend. I can’t stop thinking of her and all the amazing memories we had. I can’t picture my world without this girl. She literally and I mean literally is everything I ever could wish for and it was all ruined. We lost sight of what we meant to one another or at least what she meant to me. I really am lost. I’d give anything to have her back in my life. Please someone just tell me what I should do. I can’t love someone like that again it would ruin me as a person.,03Jun2020,1

599,"Hello reddit advice givers, I will start with a little bit of context:

I am 25 years old and currently coming up to my 3 year anniversary at my current position. My salary is decent, full benefits, great hours, etc. The problem - I am miserable. I feel horrible even saying this in a pandemic however I have been unhappy here for a while now. It mainly stems from being unchallenged in my role, employee/client unprofessionalism, and quite honestly I HATE the staffing/temp placement field. Thats a whole other story for a different day..

I am getting married this summer after 6 years with my fiance. I am looking to leave my position right around this time, but I am 2nd guessing getting into another dead end role that I am not passionate about. I did not finish my degree in Social Work for a variety of reasons. Long story short I had to move my grandma in and take care of her..I also have had academic, emotional, and behavioral issues my entire life. I ended up being diagnosed with ADHD-C Level 3 and GAD in adulthood after basically being unable to function without having panic attacks. Now that I have this mostly taken care of, I want to continue to move forward and make positive strides in my life. I don’t want to end up a worthless loser. I feel insecure about not having my degree.

So, with that being said im in a sticky situation with timing, finances, security, and job satisfaction. I am terrified of spiraling back out of control if I lose my health insurance and can’t get my mental health prescriptions. I am terrified of failure. I feel stuck.

What would be the best timing/way to move forward? I guess I would like ideas and advice on how to leave my job while also having the security of health insurance and having time to go to school. Please, no rude comments or judgement. If you make comments about *other people work full time, go to school, take care of family all at once why can’t you* I have gone to school full time and part time while working full time and I spiraled out of control so I am not willing to go to that place. I just want advice on how to be able to work up to 30 hours, maintain health insurance, and go to school.",03Jun2020,1

601,"Hello, I've just noticed that if I stop mindlessly browsing the internet then my day is empty. I don't have friends here, and work in 6 hours shifts... the rest is absolutely boring. Nothing to do, no sport no study no nothing. 

I am terrified of putting myself out there or start things (risk of failure, anyone?) but it's really unhealthy having so much time to think (I get over-involved with my problems) and I'm not tired enough in the evening to sleep. 

Part of the problem is that I lived my youth up until 27 on ""borrowed charms"": I was young and therefore attractive by default, supposedly up-and-coming because you still have time, and still with friends because it's easier when younger. 

Now a decade later I'm too old to be cool and kind of washed out, with the additional shame of having missed out on a lot of normal people's experiences.

603,"I'm 29 years of age and I've worked online (alone as a freelancer) since I was 25. I made the move back in 2015, so that's five years of my life spent working this way. 

I often envy people with normal office jobs (and just normal jobs in general) because they are likely to have colleagues they get along with and socialize with. 

Some offices are extremely sociable; I worked in an office for 12 months when I was 23, and I still see pictures of former colleagues going on trips together, on nights out, etc. 

The actual level of sociability I see on social media is probably only a fraction of the true sociability; there's likely team lunches, sports, lots of nights out that never get uploaded. I feel like an idiot for persisting with this way of work during my youth when people tend to be most socially active in life.

I am not earning a particularly impressive salary by working online. I am unlikely to ever own a home in my expensive city, for example. 

I am very highly introverted and prefer working on my own initiative, which is probably why I haven't gone crazy from working with only a laptop and sporadic email exchanges with clients for company. 

I tend to see the negative side a lot, but to try and provide a slight bit of objectivity, I had the freedom to live in southeast Asia for a total of around 18 months and experience a completely different culture because of this ability to work online.

I guess I am wondering if I'm ruining my life by working this way? It certainly feels like it sometimes but I don't know if that's influenced by my tendency for negative thoughts. Perhaps I'm glorifying other types of work? Either way, some input or advice is much appreciated.",03Jun2020,1
604,"Hi guys. A person I worked with for the last four years started to become very toxic to me this past year. We were put into two positions where we had to work very closely together, and she would often treat me terribly, talk down to me, give me attitude, etc and honestly just make me feel terrible about myself. I tried to talk to her in person to sort stuff out because the tension started over me asking her to do a job that our boss asked me to tell her to do, and she was obviously mad because she hates public speaking. I believe she thought I was just putting it off on her because I didn’t want to do it. Long story short, she never met with me telling mutual acquaintances that she knew “I’d just cry when trying to talk to her”. I’m not sure why she thought that. Anyways, we stopped having to work together so closely this last semester and kind of just stayed away from each other which let things die down. 
                                                                           
I just recently graduated and decided I did not want to stay connected with her anymore or keep her a part of my life, so I unfollowed her from Instagram and unfriended her from Facebook. She found this out and I believe she has been actively messaging/talking to fellow coworkers that I always got along with to unfollow me or something to make me upset. The reason why I believe it is her is because the day after I unfollowed her and removed her from following me (because I didn’t want her to see what I was up to), two of her closest friends did the same thing to me. 
       
This sounds so elementary to me when I’m writing it. It seems like everyday since that happened, someone new unfollows me from our program. I can’t lie, it hurts because I’ve worked with some of these people for 4 years and I thought I was always nice to them. It makes me afraid that she is telling them lies enough for them to unfollow me. I’ve messaged a couple of my coworkers to see why, and one responded very vague and the other one never responded. I’m not sure what to do, but I wake up everyday and my mood tanks to see someone else has unfollowed me. I know this kind of just reinforces how toxic she was, but why am I paying for the effects of it when she was the one that was so rude to me. :,(",03Jun2020,1
605,"Brace yourselves, this is a lenghty post, and thank you in advance to anyone who reads this. And excuse me for any grammatical errors, I'm Italian.

Back in 2006 my grandpa had retired from his job as a pastry chef, and my father advised him on how to split the property of the pastry shop to not get in this exact situation: my grandpa had two sons (my mom and his brother), and since my mom lives in a different region other than my grandpa (he lived in Sicily, we moved to a different region), my dad advised him to write will so the property would all go to his son, who lives in the same region as the pastry shop. How did we get here? Three days before he was to write down his will he got an heart attack, which unfortunately killed him on the spot.

So the property was split according to the law: 50% to my grandma, 25% to my mom and 25% to my uncle. This is where the bullshittery comes into play.

My grandma lived in Sicily at the time of death, but then decided to come and stay with us. She gifted her beach house to my uncle (which didn't have one) and sold her house to take residence here, but all the money from the sale went into paying off debts. She had no money to move, and so my dad had to buy another house, put a second bank loan on his back and push through it all. But this comes at a cost: my grandma now is the owner of a property (the pastry shop), which is in a different region from her residence, which Italian jurisdiction considers in the ""rich"" side of people, which comes at an incredible taxation, which results in her not getting her retirement money for 5 months a year. Guess who has to pay everything for her for those 5 months? My dad. My uncle never paid for anything for her mother, and my dad bleeds money every month for this elderly person: food, medicines, his house which he uses...

My uncle has tenants in the pastry shop, who run the business and pay the rent, which he used to keep 75% of. How, do you ask? Because my grandma **told him to keep her share**. She has no money, is weighing on the back of my dad and she tells him to keep her share. We later convinced her that doing so was stupid... and with later I mean 5 years in the biz.

My uncle then had the occasion to sell the property, and he thought he could sell it for 200.000 €. An offer of 190.000 € arrived, and the fucking idiot refused. Someone is willing to pay you 95% of your asking price, the housing market is a mess and you **refuse the offer**. Now with the current situation of the COVID, my dad is at home, my mom too and what does my uncle decide to do? **Renovate his house,** which he can't afford in the slightest, **and booked a 3 day trip to Paris** with his daughter and wife, which he can afford since he doesn't pay one cent to help his mother.

I'm not asking advice on how I should get vengeance on my uncle and my grandma or anything, they're already miserable human beings and I don't meddle with that. What I'm asking advice for is how should I stop this situation as soon as possible (obviously through talking to my mother, as I share none of the property), because we're running out of money and, if I have to say so, I wannna see my dad genuinely relaxed for more than three minutes, because what makes him the angriest is that he has to put money in this bad situation and pretty much keep it from us. He pretty much straight up told me ""I would have loved to get you to see Rome, but we have to pay for your uncle's trip to Paris"". This is saddening and enraging to me, so here's why I'm asking you for advice.

Thank you in advance.",03Jun2020,1

608,"Hey, I'm a 25m from UK

I've been going through a rough time for the past year or so.

I always lacked direction or ambition in life, I was a smart kid, top of classes but also a little shit who never did any work and wanted to be the center of attention.

I did the usual, school &gt; college &gt; University and now I'm in a 9-5 job.

My basic question is how do people find something to drive them?

I was with someone for 4 years, that ended last year. She was really good to me, she's now a doctor but she definitely influenced my work ethic and generally kept me going, got me through uni and pushed me to get this job now.

When things ended I burnt through my savings and I've been pretty bad budgeting ever since. Recently got better with the whole lockdown. Literally hoping to save enough money that it'll make my mind feel more free to think about what I actually want.

My job is dull and boring. I like the people there and the pay *was* good for a job straight out of uni, but now I've been there for 2.5 years and there's 0 challenge and I'm not learning anything. I applied for a new job yesterday. I felt guilty for some reason, leaving, but this new job is literally the same skills + a little more, and also like 50% more salary. It's far away, and I think I like it more because of that. I feel I need to run away.

I struggle with socialising, I'm very introverted to the point where I barely say anything out loud, I don't think I'm shy, just weird. That's my default state, I can definitely force out a social persona, and people tend to like me I think, but it just feels so fake and draining.

I currently have two friends.

One of which is a guy I've known for a long time, but only really starting hanging out last year. He's cool, and nice and whatnot, but he has probably less direction than me, which feels awful to say. So idk, I want to surround myself with people who can push me. Not saying I'd ditch him for others, just want a positive influence there.

The other friend is this girl who I'm pretty sure I've got feelings for. We were good friends for like a year maybe, and then had a small relationship for about a month. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great. I had commitment issues and definitely still had feelings from my last relationship. And I think she just wanted more from me. I still see her a lot as a friend, just to hang out, but I've somehow got to the point where my feelings for her are quite heavy and I just don't think I'd bring anything to a relationship really right now. So again, feel like I need to run away.

I currently live at home with my parents, and two younger siblings. My family is lovely but I am some what of a black sheep, and don't really talk to them much. I miss the independence I had at uni.

So idk that's where I'm at, thank you to anyone who read.

Can anyone give me any advice on where to go next? My current plan is to just save money and maybe buy a house somewhere, but I think I'll just be lonely and in the same place mentally.

I'm stuck in the weird limbo in life and feel like I don't know how to get myself motivated to get going, anywhere.

My ex girlfriend and I haven't talked for two years because of our bad breakup. She made out with my best friend and was overall pretty manipulative, which she admitted as well. I was a softie and I let it all happen. 

So about two weeks ago we meet again at a party and we talk the whole night. We've known each other since kindergarten so it felt really good to reconcile.

Last week we went to the same party again and we continued the conversation. We went to some bench and we talked about the problems we currently have.
She switches the topic by saying she wants to kiss me and I was shocked. I didn't think that that was the vibe we're vibing uk?

I played it off and the evening continued. It was about 2 am when I came home and I couldnt stop thinking about it. 

I don't know how to handle this. Should I just have fun and stop thinking about this as a serious thing or do you think I should resist the temptation because it might lead me into a toxic relationship?",03Jun2020,2
610,"So I just got out of a toxic 3 year relationship and I’ve recently developed a gigantic crush on a guy that works in the same department as me.

I literally haven’t felt like this in forever, I get super awkward and anxious around him and I stumble on my words (I do have social anxiety so that doesn’t help).

I am really bad at being able to tell if someone is flirting with me or likes me, but for the past few weeks, it seems like he goes out of his way to help me with things or ask me what time I’m going to lunch, getting off, etc.
Or it seems he goes out of his way to come talk to me randomly.

This could all just be me overthinking and over analyzing basic interactions though.

But the past few days, it almost seems like he’s avoiding me. I try not to “accidentally” run into him or anything creepy like that. And I haven’t told anyone at work that I like him, so it’s not like someone went and blabbed. I don’t know, maybe I’m just super fucking obvious?

Maybe he can tell I like him by the way I act around him or maybe I look at him too much?

Or again, I could just be reading too much into this and he has no idea at all.

When I shook the item around I could hear a metal object inside the device and when doing so the first time shaking the device actually turned it on. I have subsequently become worried that the device is dangerous as from what I know if a lithium battery is shorted it can cause a fire or explode.

I have contacted the seller who has asked me to return the item. If I go through the normal return process, Amazon will most likely send me a return package and waybill in order to place the item in for return.

My question is, is it firstly legal for me to send back a potentially dangerous item in this way, and if it does cause some sort of harm or damage who exactly would be responsible for that? Would it be myself or Amazon or the Seller? Also it does not seem ethical to send back the item unless it can be made safe to do so. What can I do about this?

This is the message I sent to the seller and the reply I received back from them:

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

The item you shipped did not have sufficient packaging and has been damaged in transit to me. I have attached a video here you can see the problem - there is something metal inside the unit rattling around. [https://we.tl/t-97k3LrBWNj](https://we.tl/t-97k3LrBWNj)

In fact initially when I shook the item the device randomly turned on while shaking it, which indicates to me that the metal object inside could potentially cause a short inside the unit, and possibly cause the battery to explode.

I am not really very happy you have shipped a dangerous item to me, a item that could plausibly start a fire/explode if the metal object inside touched the battery's and shorted them. I will be escalating this to Amazon also as the device is actually dangerous and should not have been shipped in this way. Clearly the amount of packaging is insufficient to ship this item in.

Kind regards

&amp;#x200B;

The reply:

OK,pls return item

&amp;#x200B;

I did send a message to Amazon via the chat help who said I should contact the seller first to resolve the issue. What would you advise regarding this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards

613,"Okay. So I know to many this probably doesn't seem like a big deal, and I know that there are people who would love to have this problem. Which is part of my problem...

I've been accepted into medical school. Yeah, hows that a problem? well, I didn't even really want to get in, I didn't try and I didn't care. I live in Australia and we have this thing called a direct pathway where you can apply for medical school in your final year of high school, you sit an exam and do your school exams and if your scores are good enough you get an interview and after all that you have the possibility of being offered a guaranteed place in medical school once you've completed a bachelors degree. Pretty sweet stuff. 

Well, I got approached in high school about applying and I thought sure why not? I won't get in. Yet, here I am the third year of my bachelors, one semester away from graduation and about to start med next year. The problem is I don't think i want to be a doctor, I don't even really like my degree. Don't get me wrong I'm not an idiot I'm not sitting here doing a degree I hate or have no interest in, but it's not a passion, I just feel kinda meh. The labs are fine, the topics are fine, but I'm not really THAT interested.

Sounds obvious right, well don't be a doctor. But this whole thing kinda fell into my lap, and I'm constantly told how lucky I am and what an amazing opportunity and everyone assumes I'm some kind of genius. Honestly? I don't think I'll be a good doctor and that scares me too, who wants a doctor who doesn't care? I sure don't. So I don't think I should go, but what now. I don't really want to use my degree (I'll still finish, I've come this far after all) and no one in my family has barely gone to university so they don't understand anything and i guess I'm afraid what people will think. I don't want people to think i changed my mind cause it was too hard cause that's not it, its actually that I don't want to commit myself to a career I don't really care about with basically no social life, for what? the 'prestige'? 

I know it sounds dumb, who cares what others think? Don't waste your life making others happy, I know that. But when you're the 'smart one' and everyone has such high expectations of you its scary to suddenly say you're doing a full 180 on your career path without any indication (since I'm a pretty private person even to my family). Also, my mum is the one with this 'idea' of who I am in her head and the scariest part is that she has no idea who I really am, what my interests are etc. I'm also more scared that the interests and passions I've developed in the past year, eg. an interest in sustainability and agriculture (which I've never shown interest in before and I kinda want to study agricultural science now) are going to be interpreted as a rash decision or a 'phase' since I'm only 19 turning 20 in a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm really, really honest I'm scared that I actually am in just a phase and when I'm in my 30's or older I'll regret not becoming a doctor/ having more motivation to do something that requires sacrifice and the 'hard life' to achieve. 

I'm so confused someone please help.",03Jun2020,2
614,"So I’m almost 9 months pregnant. This pregnancy has already been really overwhelming Because of covid and we’re in the middle of selling of our house. I have been having a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. We don’t have the nursery together, we are in the middle of moving our stuff and I just feel like nothing is well put together even though I’m so close to giving birth. My husband wants to participate in the protests. That idea has me really overwhelmed since the protests at times have become violent and I can’t be there with him because of being pregnant. I also don’t know how we would have the time since we need to get everything ready for the baby. I’m feeling really guilty for not wanting him to participate because I think its important to stand up for whats right and this is a big opportunity to do that. What do I do? Am I being ridiculous and selfish? I’m bad at setting boundaries and I really don’t know what boundaries are appropriate while pregnant so any advice is appreciated.",03Jun2020,4

617,"At first I thought living in lockdown mode was good for him. With the family at home he's been spending a lot more time out of him cage. He can hop around the house as he likes, and he spends a significant amount of his time playing with the cats.

But recently things have taken a darker turn. Cat-play has changed.

Cat-play has always been a slightly gentler variant of standard cat tag, where one cat will sneak up on the other, bap it with a paw, and then run off while the other gives chase. The cats go easy on the rabbit. Fur never flies, and they don't run off as far or as fast compared to when they're playing with each other. The rabbit isn't anatomically well suited to paw bapping, so he generally will head-butt the cats instead and then hop off under the couch.

Now we get to the part that prompted this post. If there are small children in the room, please cover their ears immediately.

A couple of days ago, after an extended game of tag, one of the cats was lounging in the sun. She didn't have a care in the world. The rabbit hopped out from under the sofa, made his way over, AND MOUNTED HER. He tagged her in the biblical sense, I mean he flat went after it. The cat, surprised, retreated to the office where the rabbit dares not tread. The rabbit, mission accomplished, went back to his usual spot under the sofa, his Twitter status updated to ""relaxed"". 

By the next day things had seemingly returned to normal. There was an undercurrent of tension in the house, but the cats (and the humans) had clearly seen the event as a one-off. We were all tragically mistaken. 

Repeat scenario from previous day. Humans working remotely, cats watching birds intently, rabbit plotting quietly.

And events unfolded very much as they had before, EXCEPT THIS TIME HE'S ON THE MALE CAT!

We are unsure of how to move forward. The cats are hurt, confused, and more than just a little embarrassed for the rabbit. They grew up together. They trusted him, and now this. The rabbit is oblivious. He's not even in denial. His attitude in the whole things seems to be: ""It's furry and stationary, I'm on it!""

How can we intervene to bring him back into the fold?

Should I be worried about his everlasting and immortal soul?",03Jun2020,3
618,"Both 21F. We were best friends as children. I don’t think I would call it best anymore as we don’t see each other. We talk about anything and everything we want on text. She use to answer calls about 4 years ago, not anymore. We understand each other deeply which I think is why we even have kept up taking with each other in the first place despite no physical interaction. Every single time I mention meeting up with her she ignores it. She doesn’t ignore anything else we talk about. I have casually, along conversations, sent her pictures and videos of myself ever since we have seen each other last and she won’t show herself at all. She has always been a quiet person, off to the sides but with each other we were free to do whatever say whatever type of thing. I can still see this come through in our conversation. I am thinking she might have social anxiety? I’m so confused as to why she would be ignoring anything with showing herself in any way. It honestly boggles my mind. Advice is appreciated.",03Jun2020,2
619,"A few things before I get started here.  1. This is a throwaway account and i'm a little shocked my username wasn't taken already.  2. I don't post much in general so I'm sorry if I sound like I'm rambling in this ask for advice.  3. I decided to post this here but let me know if there are better targeted subreddits that I should be posting this in.  I may post in r/family.  i don't know.

Anyway, to set the stage a little bit here.  I am in my 30s, I have a wife and two kids under 6 years old.  My wife and I are both employed and are currently working from home.  We are very thankful that we can work from home.  Our daycare is currently closed so my wife and I have been doing shifts between working and taking care of our children.  Basically my schedule is work, daycare, dinner, daycare, work, sleep.  My wife's schedule is daycare, work, dinner, daycare, sleep.  It's pretty tough, but we've honestly taken it in stride and have tried to appreciate our time with our children.  My work from home situation is fairly stressful.  I won't get into the finer details of it.  But suffice it to say that quarantine is not a nice vacation for our family.  Don't get me wrong, we do very much appreciate being employed during this time, having our health, having our time with our children, but it is still very stressful.

Okay now onto the advice piece.  Sorry. My parents tend to get insulted fairly easily.  But in all honesty, I haven't encountered major issues with them in a LONG time.  However, covid-19 has kind of opened up this can of worms of stress, and I get that it's a turbulent time for everyone right now.  My parents are high risk, and they've made it very clear that they are effectively taking very very little risk.  They have been at home and only at home since early March.  My wife and I decided to ask my in-laws about help with daycare for a week.  They are also high risk, but they were okay with us bringing the children up to their house for a week since all of us have been in quarantine and very careful for a long time.  My parents were adamantly against this idea, and I got in a major argument with them about it.  Ultimately, I mostly made amends with them over the course of a few days, though I think they were still kind of upset about the trip.  We did the trip.  My in-laws, wife, children are, and I are all healthy.  We come back and and my wife had a discussion with her parents about them coming down AGAIN to help with daycare in a couple of weeks and to celebrate my wife's birthday.  Here is where I openly admit that I messed up a little bit.  I didn't coordinate the fact that my wife's parents were coming down to visit again, but honestly I didn't consider my parents since they have been so strict about being at home.  I start texting my mom about something else the day before my in-laws come back down and she says something to the effect of ""needing to coordinate a quick visit for my wife's birthday and to see the kids"".  I mention that my wife's parents are coming down to visit and this is when I start getting the serious cold shoulder from mom.  She texts back saying that we are abandoning them and that they have no idea what's going on with us.  I respond apologizing for not immediately coordinating and mentioning that they are welcome to visit if they are comfortable.  But about 4 days later she's still not really responding to my texts or emails aside from snarky one liners.  The good news here is that I have an open and friendly dialogue with my Dad and found out through those conversations that they don't want to visit us unless we have had 0 contact with anyone for 14 days.  That was never coordinated with me either until this latest argument.  So obviously there was a two way coordination issue going on here.  I know I'm partially to blame, and I have apologized, and I'm not really getting any reciprocation from my mom, and that's frustrating in an already emotionally stressful time.

We are tentatively seeing my parents over father's day weekend, but I really am at a loss for how to handle the situation with my mom in the meantime.  I don't want to stress out my dad any further by putting my frustrations with my mom on him (he has to live with her).  Every time I text my mom it seems like she misinterprets what I say to be condescending and laden with attitude.  I know if I call my mom it will be awkward and potentially make the situation worse.  We are both very argumentative and emotional people.  I don't know how to not start a fire with her besides not saying anything, but that may be starting a fire too.

One option is that I could leave this alone until father's day comes, but I'm also kind of worried about my mom's emotional state.  Any advice welcome.  Thanks!",03Jun2020,2

623,"I’m in my 20s and i am the last child of three (I am the youngest) to live at home with my parents, and my boyfriend. My brother has lived out of home since he was 18 and went to uni and my sister moved out to live with her boyfriend as he lives a 50 minute drive away and she was spending more time there than at our home so that made sense. I feel like there situations of moving out are different to mine. 

Me and my boyfriend pay rent to my parents but we have also been saving in preparation to move out. I am so excited to have my own place with my boyfriend when we can buy a house, but I feel worried for my mum when we leave as my dad works in a shift pattern (5 x 12 hour day alternating with 5 x 12 hour night shifts) that would mean she would be alone for a good portion of her day when he’s on the night shift. 

This doesn’t sit well with me and I know it sounds stupid. She’s a grown woman who isn’t bothered at all by being on her own but I don’t like the thought. I don’t like thinking of her eating her dinner alone or being worried about drying her hair in an empty house. I worry for her that if she hears a noise in the night or someone tries to get into the house and she’s alone. 

I know eventually I am going to have to leave and I am looking forward to making that step but knowing that I’m the last one to leave makes it feel like I need to be extra delicate about it even though nobody is really too bothered.

Social media sucks. That is one thing we can all agree with. With all the recent events going on, it has taken a toll on my mental health majorly. It is not the events themselves I guess, but how people respond to them which absolutely takes a toll on my mental health.

I've been wanting to take a break from social media for a while now, but now there's a major issue happening that needs our voices. I've done what I can to speak out against racism and the murder of George Floyd with signing petitions, sharing resources, sharing events, donating etc. but I feel like that's not enough for some people and feel awful when I do think that...preventing me from doing anything else further. 

I want to take a break from social media so I can get my mental health back into shape and cause change, but I feel as if I do, then ill be ridiculed because of the light of the issue. I have struggled with depression and anxiety in the past and currently take medication for it, but I feel that the way some people are responding is making me think for the worst. I can't simply just ""ignore it"" because its such a hot issue right now, but I really want to improve my mental health too. I'm always thinking and trying to put things together, and I feel like taking a break from social media will help me with not trying to absorb a ton of overwhelming info and focus on how I can improve myself

628,"My Dad passed away from Cancer in February. It was a pretty sudden thing that we only found out about in September last year. We've sorted out most of the post-death business and taxes and whatnot, leaving us to deal with purely the emotional aftermath.

My mom was always an ambitious person, and before, she would always argue with my dad because she left their home country with him to go to Canada, and forfeited what looked like a really bright career. Now she feels as if she has lost everything. She's still trying her best to recover, going around and trying out new hobbies (dance classes atm), but it's pretty clear to me that she's doing it partly for my sake, to give me the impression that she's getting better. She has trouble sleeping at night and is always kind of tired in the day, and that worries me a lot. It doesn't help that family on my dad's side turned out to be terrible and didn't so much as hint that they gave a damn about him (they visited ONCE for half an hour when he was hospitalized and said some banal shit like ""we're sure you'll be fine! :D"" and left). So now, amongst the whole trauma of going through my dad withering away day by day and dying in our home (hospitals closed due to Coronavirus), she's heartbroken over my dad's family straight up abandoning him when he needed them most.

My family on my mom's side and my dad's old classmates all turned out great though, and provided us all the support my dad's family didn't and so much more. But, whenever I mention this my mom just gets more upset, because how can my dad's own family be so much worse to him than his inlaws / classmates?

I've gone off topic. I'm hoping I can help my mom determine what path she wants to walk for the rest of her life. One option would have been for her to just sit back and try her best to enjoy life. I know she won't be willing to do that though, because she wants some way to realize her self worth after losing both her career and her husband. Unfortunately, she's been in Canada raising me for the past (almost) two decades, so it's much harder for her to work or do business again now.

Honestly, I'm blabbering, but I hope I've given enough context on the situation. I just... don't know what to do to help.

To make it clear, I'm doing everything I can on my end to make things easier for her. I try my best in University and I think my mom is pretty confident that I'll succeed professionally in the future, so she doesn't have that worry.

Put all that negative energy into something physical but there's no money for that at the moment.

644,"So we live in a privately owned apartment above a bar. We moved in because we knew the previous tenants and talked with the landlord about moving in after they left. I never mind the noise from downstairs cuz I’m in my 20s and work an evening job so I’m usually up late anyway. It saved a whole lot of time and money. 
Initially the landlord said to not worry about deposit until our repairs were finished. We moved in in August and NO repairs were done until April and that’s only because I was constantly telling them they NEED to send someone to fix it. Our water from our faucets haven’t been clean the entire time either. We can’t even COOK with it. If I run it through a faucet Brita and then again through a Brita jug, we can drink it but I’m seriously apprehensive about if it’s ACTUALLY SAFE. 
Our new maintenance guy, WHO ACTUALLY DOES HIS JOB, said he’s looked and said it’s due to rusted lead pipes but can’t do anything without our landlord’s permission, which the landlord refuses to give because he INSISTS that the water is safe. Mind you my neighbor across the hall went to the hospital with SEPTIC a few months back from drinking that water and a number of us also have gotten sick from it! As far as I’m aware, in my state, I am allowed to withhold rent since such issues make my living situation unsafe, not to mention the repairs that took 8 months to even get around to included 2 broken window frame, a broken door frame, sagging cabinets, and water leaks. Not to mention that I noticed after moving in that the entire building is beyond repair. I’m certain they’re trying to slowly run all the remnants out but I’m not sure why. So much so that the bar owner from the bar downstairs isn’t renewing his lease with the landlord and is in fact moving out as well. We’re leaving when our lease is up in on August but currently the landlord is heckling me about the rent that I am legally entitled to withhold. I know my legal options but in the meantime, how do I handle my landlord’s heckling and constant attempts to guilt/intimidate me into paying rent for a place that isn’t safe?",03Jun2020,1

646,"Hey r/Advice! My family and I have recently come to the realization that my aunt has been sheltering her children from the outside world for their entire lives. And I mean heavily sheltered. All three of my cousins are now fully grown adults by law and have yet to experience the workplace, friendship, or romance.

The aunt is my father’s sister and was raised by two loving parents who were nowhere near as restrictive as this. In fact! My father has told me stories of how rebellious she was in her youth. Don’t get me wrong, my aunt is a loving parent and has raised respectful and well mannered children. 

The problem is that she has kept them protected from a lot of normal, everyday life experiences. So naturally, the children have developed some really nasty social anxieties and internalized stigmas. They tag along with their mother for grocery shopping and other general needs, but the extent of which has been very limited. Basically, they’ve been living in quarantine for all their life. The eldest being 35, the middle child being 26, and the youngest being 20 (who also has down-syndrome), have all yet to experience true friendship/kinship. The eldest two don’t have driver’s licenses and they express no interest in getting one. They also have no job experience or higher level of education and live off of welfare and/or disability funds? (Not too sure how that works.) The interesting thing about the creation of the internet, is that all three are well informed about local and national politics, science, pop-culture, and sports. However, this influx of information indirectly furthers their fears of being socially independent from their mother, especially since the Covid-19 outbreak.

t’s a very tough situation for my siblings and I, and we really don’t know how to approach this problem, especially since we want to respect our elders and by proxy our aunt. My father and his parents have expressed their disapproval of my aunt’s seclusive parenting, but the children have been sheltered for so long that its really hard to convince them to break out of their shells.

I want to know if there is anything we can do to console my cousins into taking their first steps towards adulthood. We are concerned that once our aunt passes, they will have a difficult time adjusting to life with their father. I am not looking for any legal courses of action, I just want to know if there are any good ways of getting my cousins to take control of their own lives.",03Jun2020,2

I honestly just don't know what to do. My parents are getting older so the idea of disowning them and not speaking to them for the years they have left before they die is hard to fathom. My family's racism is so ingrained that it is literally a part of their reality and how they view the world. I honestly don't think I can change it.

655,"I am a language instructor and at my workplace my manager and I seem to have completely differing views on what language is. We seem to take a different philosophical stance on the nature of language, what constitutes grammar and grammaticality and things like that. This is relevant for me to mention because sometimes It seems that he wants me to think what he thinks, even though I tell him that I can't think what he thinks, and then I give him reasons to explain how what he says doesn't work for me. When I give him reasons, he repeats his reasons without changing them. I then restate my position that that line of reasoning doesn't work. This has happened a few times, and I seem to kinda lose it internally when people restate their ideas to me without reframing or reconsidering how to say them to me, even though I state something like 'if you say things like this, I don't understand'. They just repeat their shit, what am I supposed to do as a professional in this situation with my coworkers? I genuinely don't know!

This last time that we disagreed I failed to point out that I can't make myself think things, I only think what I think and I dont know how to make myself think things that i dont think are true. What I mean is that I can't make myself think that god Is true, I can only allow myself to consider and contemplate god and eventually see whether I end up think God to be true or not.

Fortunately, I can still go to my manager when I need guidance on how to teach a particular thing or deal with a particular issue in the classroom. I always learn something from him and my colleagues, it's a good workplace overall.

But I wanna be better at not agreeing with others. Maybe even to get to the point of disagreeing quietly would be nice too, not to shut myself down but just to figure out how to do that, like, how to just sit back and accept that they can tell me what they think, and they can tell me what I should think, but at the end of the day not even I have control over what my brain decides to think sometimes so... like you can say whatever you want to me, but my brain will do what my brain does so why should I get upset about people telling me what to think? I still get upset though, and I worry that I am misinterpreting people sometimes, sometimes people just share their thoughts, and that's ok. Sometimes they want me to think things their way, that's ok too, I can't do much about that either

I donno man, what do you do apart from saying 'I will do whatever you want me and tell me to do, but if I don't find myself agreeing with your ideas then there isn't much that I can do unless you find a different way of framing them for me'.

660,"So.

Some background context. I’m a very emotional guy (24y) with the looks of not giving a fuck. But I do. So for a lot of people it’s a surprise when I tell them that I feel scared in social situations and that the only person I trust is my bunny. I don’t trust romantic relationships no more since my past exes and how difficult I am to deal with. I’m on AD’s and Pregabalin for my neurotic emotional thinking. That being said, lets proceed with the story.


I’ve known her since high school but we never actually met outside school. She was in Manchester on Erasmus (program for students to study abroad) and we started chatting. That’s when I realised I had to give it a shot and go on a date. 

Fast forward two years and yesterday, finally, our date happened. And my god did we have chemistry and laughs and great talks and wine. She gave me
this feeling of being completely OK with who I am and with all the psychological distress I go through on a daily. That’s when I realised I’d fall in love with her. Immediately. I made up my mind right there. But we end up talking about my dad (he has leukemia) and I get emotional.

So I’m trying to collect my thoughts and move on with the (so far) nice evening. I get curious and actually ask for her future plans, what’s she’s going for in life. She says she wants to move to Australia and start a new life there. She adds that that’s why she’s friend zoning a lot of guys.

I already felt rejection right there. So fast forward some hours and I’m right in the middle trying to explain to her why I feel what I’m feeling and that she obviously is not interested and that I’m going to lose my mind in endlessly loving her. So I tell her what I do when this happened in the past. I distance myself from a woman.  That’s what I do. I disappear from the moment I feel like I’m vulnerable. She found that very hard to accept and thought it was a shame that we couldn’t just be friends...

Rest I don’t remember clearly but we ended up hugging , her telling me that I should take my time and if I were to feel ready to engage in a friendship, she would be open to it. After that I left. 

Today I sent her a nice text to wish her luck and health and my appreciation for making me feel like I could be me and trying to explain why I was suddenly struck with emotion. 

She responded that she’s confused and needs time. And that she can’t forget how I talked about my thoughts and my ‘ghosting’ so she doesn’t know if she could be friends with me. Now I’m confused


I’m done. Like fuck me. Seriously. I feel like I stayed too true to myself for a first date. I hate this feeling. That’s why I’ve been avoiding women the past 5 years.

664,"I was originally supposed to get married and move in with my soon-to-be husband on July 26th. Due to the pandemic, we decided to move the wedding date, however the nearest (and safest) date we could get is August 15, 2020, which is over a year out. We were so crushed because we'd been waiting for this for so long, especially to start our lives together. We each live at home with our parents. My parents are very traditional, I come from a full Italian family so culture is really important.

One thing that has been an issue is the topic of moving in together. My parents always said I wasn't allowed to move in until I was married (which is now so far away). I am 24, almost 25(F) for reference. I'm not sure what to do, I've been wondering if I should just suck it up and try to move out anyway, or if I should just wait a year. While my fiance would be disappointed, he says he will support whatever decision I choose. I should mention I'm someone who gets a lot of anxiety in general.

If I move in now, it will cause issues between us and my parents. They threatened not to pay for the wedding and to cancel any plans for a bridal shower since they don't think it's necessary if I already have a bunch of things. They would be really mad at me for a long time and my grandparents would all be very upset by it too. I know people are going to say, ""theyll get over it"" or ""it doesn't affect them"", but I really like having my parents' support on things, especially for the first big step in my life.

On the other hand if we do choose to try to move in, we will have to find a place to live and shop for all furniture and everything (we dont have anything) during the pandemic, and potentially without the support and help of my family.

I've been mulling over the possibilities in my head a lot lately, and it just feels like it would be easier to wait a year, since we will be more used to living with the virus, my family will be supportive, I will get my registry items during the bridal shower, and we are getting married in a year one way or another. On the other hand if I do it now, there will be a rift between my parents and us and we wouldnt have their monetary or emotional support, just to be together a little bit sooner.

670,"Hi all,

I’m 27 (F) in the US. I applied for a job that I’m really passionate/excited about. I received an email 2 days after I applied asking for a phone interview. 

I responded immediately and the phone interview was scheduled for the following week (on a Tuesday). The phone interview lasted 40 minutes — the interviewer/hiring manager was very talkative and spoke about the role at length. We even talked about things unrelated to the role, so in the end, I felt very confident that I would move to the next round of interviews. He told me that they’d likely do interviews that week or the following, as they were moving pretty quickly. He said the whole process usually takes 3 weeks. He also said he was only interviewing 3 candidates.

I sent a thank you email an hour after our conversation. The rest of that week went by and I didn’t hear anything. I figured I’d hear something this past Monday, but nope. So, I sent a follow up email yesterday (Tuesday) as one week had past - asking if I was still being considered for the role and reiterating my strong interest in it. Again, radio silence. It is now Wednesday and I still haven’t heard anything.

I’m very confused because he had told me things were moving quickly. If I’m not being considered anymore, I would think he would just tell me? At the same time, I keep thinking no news is good news? Maybe something got delayed. I’ve just never experienced this much delay after a phone interview. Usually I hear back within 1-2 days. I’ve also never not made it to a second round of interviews after a phone interview. I don’t say that to be cocky, but I’m usually a very strong interviewer. I’ve always made it to 3 rounds of interviews, and I’d either get the job or not at that point. 

And it doesn’t make sense given the timeline he gave. I’m worried that maybe other candidates moved to the next round, and I’m a back up...but I would think if it was only 3 candidates to begin with, they would just interview me as well if they felt I could still be the right fit for the job.

I just have so much anxiety around this whole situation. I understand if I’m not the best fit for the job, but I would think the hiring manager would have the decency to let me know, especially if he was only interviewing a few candidates to begin with. It’s hard to move on when I feel like there might still be a chance.

Like just then he said ""I'm not going to be going to the girl in the shop every 5 minutes"". This is the first problem I've had that wasnt caused by him not knowing what he is on about since I got it and it's actually quite serious like i dont want to boil or freeze my snake.

This seems like a non-issue but that and everything else is just getting too me. I don't know what to do I just dont want to be here anymore. Like my father will complain at the slightest thing. Even non issues like not reading ""the litterature"" that the girl in the shop gave us. All 3 sheets gove conflicting advice and I dont even trust them anyway. 

Like what the fuck does my father know? He killed like 6 or 7 bearded dragons cause of his shitty care and the worst thing? We had them all for just a few months before they died and he has the balls to say that they died 18 months ago through no fault of his own? Fucking dickhead just didnt take care of them properly and they died.

I wouldnt even mind any of this is my dad wasnt so volatile. Like hes so quick to shout and get mad, far beyond anyone else I've seen and he has even threatened to and tried to have a fight with me on 2 separate occasions. I dont even know what's up with him. My mum is blinded by love or whatever though so she just thinks its cause we're so similar. Like no I'm nothing like him. I give a shit about not killing pets and I do research and I respect people I should respect and actually would like to do something with my like instead of forcing an autistic kid to lie to people just so he can look good to some rando.

680,"So I have been looking at a lot of different courses to do at home learning on like Edx and Udemy just some of the free ones to get an idea of what to do, but my brain doesn't seem to want to function as well with learning. I'm enjoying it but I'm not getting some of it for some reason and I'm not sure does it mean I'm just not that interested in that field then.
So been looking at computer science for programming and software testing, possibly going to look into cyber security. However on the other hand I love design and thought about being an architect but I feel to old to start as I'm 29, am I?
I'm just trying to find something I belong in.

681,"I may be addicted to sport... in a somehow bad way.

Hi, I started working-out at home when I was 13. I didn’t have any weights so I just did a lot of push-ups, crunches, pull-ups,... I bought weights when I was 14 and also started going to the gym regularly.

At this point I did at least 200 push-ups, 50 pull-ups,... per day. I sometimes got the comment I sport too much but I always ignored it or just said: “sport is healthy”

I kept doing more and more. At 15 I started drinking Protein shakes (I did a lot of research and asked people who know stuff about it). They all said it was completely save as long as I kept eating enough. I only drunk shakes after hard work-outs (2/3 times per week)

I worked-out at least 3 hours per day. I felt like I didn’t do anything productive if I hadn’t worked-out. I obviously didn’t train the same muscles every single day and I was careful with injuries.

I had an injury to my knee when I just turned 16. I couldn’t train my legs anymore and I needed to go to a physiotherapist. (The injury had nothing to do with working-out.) I still go to this same physiotherapist but he’s more like my personal trainer now.

I have quite a lot of cramps (at least 1 per weak) and my muscles are sore almost everyday. I can deal with it, cause the pain isn’t infecting my health. 

I talk a lot with my physiotherapist about what I should and shouldn’t do and he helps a lot. But I recently got a lot of comments on how much I work-out. Currently (because of quarantine) I work-out about 6 hours per day.

It hasn’t infected my health at all but I’m starting to worry. I’m now 17.

Edit: I’m not insecure about my body or something, I just genuinely enjoy working-out and getting stronger.",03Jun2020,1
682,"Hello! I(21f) work at an office job in insurance. the job seemed wonderful at first (I started about a year and a half ago), people seemed nice and the work wasn't terrible. 
Then my trainer was promoted, and the new trainer took over. She's a very nice woman, but easily overwhelmed and frustrated, I dont want to come off as mean because I do think they just put her in the wrong position which isn't her fault. but she is the absolute worst at her job. 
They literally chose her to be the new trainer because she got the least amount of work done. 
This trainer is unorganized, she tells me the wrong info regularly then laughs it off when she realizes she messed up. She has no idea what ive been trained and what i haven't because she doesn't keep track, so I keep getting in trouble because she's telling the boss that I've been trained on things that I haven't, and its her word against mine. The boss (or team lead) is also pretty new and still in her ""must micromanage and be in charge of everything but without actually helping anyone"" phase. I feel like im constantly getting in trouble for things I have no idea about. There is literally no communication between the trainer, managers, and work coordinators, so I'm often sent things I dont know how to do, ask for help from my trainer, then she CCs my boss and explains to me shes not going to help because I should already know. Shes also in charge of training 5 other people, theres literally not enough time for her to help us with things and im frequently behind on work that I need help on and then I get in trouble for that. I've tried explaining to everyone the situation I feel I am in but they do not care or listen, nothing gets better. I am constantly stressed that they're going to just fire me because they don't want to deal with this. My trainer also gets an attitude every time I ask for help which makes me really nervous to go to her, but I cant just guess through and mess things up. I asked if there were anyone else I could go to, and my boss told me that my trainer would set up a designated time for helping me. I went and asked my trainer about what time would work for her, she responded with ""let me ask (team lead/boss) how I should handle this"" then they emailed me and said that I should no longer need the trainer, even though I'm not even halfway through my training. I dont know if my trainer and boss are just forgetful and don't realize this, but I keep trying to explain what I've been trained on but my trainer says that I've been trained on other things and I have no way to prove that shes wrong. 
I just dont know what to do. I really need the money i make from this place, I'd probably have to work a full time and part time job to make up the lost money, but I dont know if I can handle the constant ""am i about to be fired"" feeling anymore. Nobody will help me or listen to me.",03Jun2020,4

684,"Hello! This is such a personal question that I deactivated my account and made a new one just to post this; I've never had a crush on anyone unless famous YouTubers or cartoon characters count. I've never had any fantasies that sexualize myself. I'm still disgusted about the idea of having sex myself, I feel like I never will (but that's just present me talking). I often watch NSFW videos, a lot of the main characters being slim women that look my age or older. I have a deep fear that my body and voice won't be the same as I grow. I want to look my age for the rest of my life, so I have a strict routine every day to take care of my skin and body, as well as trying to fall asleep when I become stressed (which is very often, as a person who has PTSD, Depression, and having lost two loved ones I knew my whole life to COVID-19 recently) The sap talk does have something related to what I was talking about originally. I'm afraid that I'm going to be watching the same kind of videos and looking at the same depictions in pictures that I'm looking at nowadays - as an adult. I can't recognize what is part of simple puberty and what could be something harmful. I've barely ever had a fantasy with anyone my age, just awkward, extremely short ones about my good friends that make me question everything while feeling incredibly uncomfortable (that is a teenage thing 100%). I usually just think of being with (by that I don't mean hooking up, just being slightly intimate) someone maybe 5 years older or less, maybe the same age, in a warm, cuddly relationship. That's normal, I suppose. But no matter how old I get, the thought of being with someone even remotely younger than me makes me nauseated and it makes me pray to every god in every religion to send down a bird to peck or gouge my eyes out. I've never had thoughts of going into dates myself that are beyond talking and mild things like holding hands and hugging. Nonetheless, I have a feeling that I will never have feelings towards anyone younger than me, at even just one year, honestly. I'm attracted to the idea of being like these women in pornographic films (you can see I'm dodging the word here lmao) and I don't know if that's contradicting or over the line. I sometimes wonder if it has anything to do with my mental health problems if it's a worst-case scenario, which it likely isn't.  Art is everything to me besides my loved ones, traveling, music, composing, singing, etc. and this might point to answers about my low-key obsession (but not exactly insecurity) over my looks, but I've come here to say 'I don't know', so I wouldn't have to go on that journey alone. **I don't know** if that'll work out. Good news is I'm getting a puppy.

685,"I'm not usually the kind of person to get scared of things like this, but I work in a small plaza and every other store is closed except mine and one other store. They had our windows boarded up on Monday and everything. A bunch of my co workers have called off and I really want to as well but I'm afraid to. I've called out two times in the past 3 months (mom has health issues). I only get 3 call outs a year. The protest hasn't started yet, but by the time it does it will be basically too late to call out. Also, I know there are peaceful protests out there but in my city there have been riots and the reason these people are protesting is because two local Highschool kids made a video mocking George Floyd's death, so I'm expecting it to turn into a riot. I really don't want to risk my safety over this job. If things go bad I have no way of getting out of there. I'm just so conflicted. Should I wait and see if things get bad, or should I just call out now? What do I even say? I feel so guilty calling out for some reason. The protest starts at 12 and I'm scheduled to work at 2.

686,"First of all, I’m French, so law, education and others may vary depending on where you live.
In this post you will read things that I’m not proud of. I was a psycho, partly because I’m bipolar, and I hope that I will be able to make it up one day.

To sum up 3 years of my life let’s say that after HS I was admitted into the best College of France (not really a College, we call it a CPGE but I’m simplifying), my rich parents rented a perfect flat near my school in Paris, I met a beautiful girl who was way older than me and who was astoundingly adorable with me and well, basically I had a perfect life.
But then I ruined it, took way too much drugs, played with my gf just because I felt untouchable, and ended up in the ER after one OD.
After that, my father (who has a huge network) found me a place in a great university, another great flat, and for a reason that I still don’t understand today, my gf stayed with me when she discovered that I was bipolar and that « it wasn’t my fault ».
Again, I ruined everything, I found the best friend that I could ever met in this uni, who was there for me when I ditched my gf, who was nice with me...
After months of drugs abuse, as well as harassment on my ex gf (I went a few times under her window asking her to take me back, and kicked her bf’s ass once) she couldn’t make it, she  slowly ghosted me after a while, and I think that in a state of half-consciousness I started to harass her with text messages because she wasn’t answering to my calls. After a final OD I ended up in a psych ward, alone.

Let’s skip 10 months will you? Last September I started to feel great on MMT and on my BPD II treatment, I went out with old friends, and 4 months ago I even founded a company. Even if I still feel alone I now have 2 employees and everything’s fine, but there’s a part of me that I want to erase. And this part may be incarnated by my first name. In France we have as much first name as we want, for example I have three, some have four, and we can switch the order easily after some paperwork. I like my second first name, and I was wondering if you guys think that changing my first name may be for me a way to move on. I mean I’m doing a lot of things to become a better man, I see a therapist, take my meds, am sober, I manage pretty well my company, I see new people, treat women with respect and even texted my ex best friend a week ago to ask her to forgive me, and she reacted pretty well, we talked a little bit and will have a cup of coffee when she will be able to come back from Germany.

But I don’t know if this is a good thing to become a total new person either, it has consequences on how people will see you so if someone has an advice..

Thanks a lot, I’m pretty lost, as always in my life for the last 4 years",03Jun2020,2
687,"3 days ago I found a ginger cat on my property. At first she didn't trust me. No hissing, but constant meowing and begging for food. She would run every time I went outside but would come up a few steps when she heard that I was putting food in her bowl. 

Yesterday, she and my indoor cat were sniffing one another through the screen door. They even played through the window. 

This morning she hissed at me and lunged towards me. She is sprayed all over the deck. Has destroy the screen door with her claws. Broke her food bowl and every time I try to step outside, hisses and growls at me. It's not even noon yet. 

When my significant other opens the door, she just runs away. 
I literally have done nothing to this cat (or any cat). In fact it was my idea to feed her. Which is why I now need to fix this. 

The animal control where I live is a joke. Not to mention I live on 4 acres of land where the cat can easily run away from the animal control people if they ever did come out. I took in the food bowl (can't get to the broken one without her trying to attack me).

695,"So, I'll try to make this short, but it's a pretty complex problem. (Baby's first reddit post wooooo)  


I (25) live with my parents. I'm the youngest in the family and it's basically been thrusted upon me to take care of my aging parents, as they're becoming less independent and able to take care of things around the house. My mom is disabled, my dad is old as dirt, and neither can work. Currently, my half-brother (47) lives with us too, and occasionally provides financial support (on the occasion that he's actually employed), as well as taking care of any work around the house that I can't take care of (only sometimes and with a great deal of complaining). That being said, over time, his alcoholism has basically taken control of his life and he's provided less and less for the family. My parents hate that he drinks and he hates that they're trying to control his life when he's a grown-ass dude.   


I've spent my teenage and adult years so far being an emotional crutch for my mother and being the only level-headed one in the family. I've realized recently, though, that I might have been groomed to stay at home with my parents. They've told me for years that they need me, that my mom especially needs me. That everything would fall apart if I left, so I haven't been in any hurry to leave. I felt morally obligated to care for my parents because none of my other siblings were taking up the mantle. I forfeited my life to cater to them.   


Recently though, I'm realizing that I don't want this responsibility. I haven't lived my life at all--I have so few experiences at my age. My whole life has revolved around my family for so long, I haven't done much for myself. But, even more recently, I'm being worn down by their closed-minded bigotry. My father is incredibly racist, my mom too but a little less so--and they're both incredibly homophobic. My mom uses religion as a means of control in a lot of cases--using my apparent ""relationship with god"" as a way to say that I'm not doing the right thing with my life or that I care about things that god discourages. Like, I support BLM because fucking obviously black lives matter, and they go ballistic every time I say anything. And I support LGBT+ rights, because I'm LGBT but I can't even imagine coming out to my parents. It would turn my life into a living hell. But that also means I haven't had time or space to explore my own sexuality/gender in a good environment and everything has come very slow to me because I can't talk to them about it.   


So all this being said, I've been unemployed for a couple months now since covid and right now I'm basically financially dependent on them until I can find a job--which is going poorly, I might add. I live in a small enough town that there's basically no-where to apply, and my unemployment is stuck in limbo. I gave my parents the $1200 check because they needed to pay bills for us to stay in our home, and it's kept them off my back about helping with bills until recently. I'm emotionally torn between my supposed obligation to help the family (as I've basically been brought up to believe), and my own need to get away from the toxic mind games everyone plays all the time. They're all horribly moody and passive aggressive so I spend a lot of time on guard or trying to placate everyone's feelings. It's becoming increasingly hard because I DO challenge their ""politics"" (It's not politics to fight for the rights of others but they would disagree I fucking guess).   


I feel like I'm wasting away. Day after day my soul is being ground into dust. My depression has only gotten worse with everything going on--to the point where it's worrying friends. I have a friend that suggested I move cross-country to where she is, but once again, I don't have the money for that and I'm a little reluctant because she's in love with me and I don't really have the same kinds of feelings for her so I don't want to give her false hope by suddenly moving in with her. I don't have the finances to leave--I have about $100 to my name and I don't have my own vehicle.   


TLDR;; I'm unemployed, have no vehicle, my future is looking incredibly bleak, and lately I feel like I need to move away from my family to get away from their racism and bigotry. Living in such a moody and hate-filled home has worsened my depression---but I know my leaving would devastate the family, if I could even get away. Am I supposed to just grin and bear it? Or is there a way to actually solve this?",03Jun2020,3
696,"I have three friends who are college-aged — two
girls and one man. They were walking in our local park the other day, and this 50 year old man starts telling them “Ive been looking for y’all; I met one of you last week and remembered your energy. I knew you guys were here way before I saw you”. He then proceeds to put his hand out and “read” them all. He apparently tells them some accurate characteristics about themselves. 

My friends were so intrigued that they exchanged contact info with this man and went to his home the next day. Apparently, he has two college-aged sons and a wife that completely support and believe everything he says. He proceeds to tell them things like he has the cure to the coronavirus, he time-travels, can read anybody, and has met aliens. He mentioned a blue and red Kachina; I looked this up and found that there’s something called the Kachina cult. 

This all sounds crazy to me, but my friend insists that it was extremely profound and a life changing spiritual experience. I am one of the most spiritual people she knows, and she desperately wants me to come back to meet him.

Her personality is perfect. But I’m on the east coast while she lives in the Midwest.

Plus, I know I’m gonna sound really shallow here but I’m not that physically attracted to her, and in my opinion while personality matters most, you also have to be physically into someone in order to truly want to be with them. I know that sounds dumb but that’s just my take. So it would seem that I probably shouldn’t date her right? But goddamn her personality is so perfect, I don’t know what to do. I also never had a girlfriend before, not because I’m particularly ugly, I’ve just never bothered to talk to girls, I have ptsd so my confidence is horrible lol, so that might be making me desperate?

708,"I have a friend who has been in a relationship for a year and a half

All the red flags are so apparent it is insane

Her parents hate him(very unjustly, he is poor and they are rich, he is older than her ETC) , she has 0 trust with him, anytime we all go out she calls him crying and he has too go home because she thinks he will cheat, he can’t have female friends, he can’t post a picture with a female, girls can’t post him on his birthday, but she’s allowed any male friend...

The relationship is so bad for his mental health and he’s turned too drinking and drugs and it is blatant too all of my friends that she is the main problem. He tried too justify her behaviour coz he is insanely in love but he needs help because he’s already attempted suicide, by taking a bunch of pills and going too sleep.

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to explain this to him without being a cunt as he loves her.

She literally is so contradicting and what applies to him doesn’t apply to her. For example they had a 3 week break and she talked too another boy who he knows LOVES her. And she done this purposely, my friend talked too no one. And she still even talks too this boy that loves her (as friends). I tell u if he done that it’s game over. 

She is not a bar person she’s jus severely immature and is Ruining his life. But he convinced himself she is his happiness. I’ve never seen him more fucked up than this past year and a half he’s been with her.

709,"My girlfriend and I are renting a room (for two months while we work over the summer) from someone we graduated with this year. 

He is a great guy, down to earth and has a lot of life experience (he’s 57). I look at him like a grandfather or uncle.

The only problem is that he’s fascinated by everything from the way the universe was conceived to how shoes were invented. So he can’t stop talking, it’s even hard to get a word into a conversation sometimes. 

One night we were hanging out in his shed (sound creepy but it’s like the ultimate man cave with surround sound, antiques, and a fireplace. Much bigger than any other shed) but he spent 3 hours blasting heavy metal and telling us stories about every band he played.

Any advice on how to politely decline a conversation? Or at least shorten the length of a conversation? I don’t mind talking to him but I enjoy my alone time.",03Jun2020,1

712,"I’m sorry but i just don’t know what to do. What to think or what to say.

I’ve been out of work because of the quarantine. I guess just spending 24/7 together has caused us to drift apart. We’ve been together almost 2 years and haven’t ever argued like this. We fight over literally everything. Even over stupid stuff, like when i put her shampoo on the bottom shelf, not hte top. So, i just figured i’d take an offer for work. My company needed a truck driver, i’m licensed to drive a truck so i took it. I thought a few days apart would be good for us.

Today, i came home. I thought i’d surprise her with flowers, but i told her i’d be gone a week longer then i actually would be.

But anyway, i came home but the door was locked. Even though her car was still there, and another car was parked on the curb. So i knocked, she came and let me in but started hugging me when she saw me. Like right away, I thought she really missed me. But that wasn’t it. I looked up and out of our bedroom, i saw, basically, a kid. He looked like he was someone like right out of high school. He was in his basically his underwear and trying to sneak out the backdoor. I was actually pretty furious, i didn’t know what i was thinking but i actually chased after him. But i couldn’t catch him, he got into his car and drove off.

I’m upset, not just because she’s cheating. But because it’s with someone so much younger too.

I demanded an explanation, she said it was my fault for leaving and that she just wasn’t attracted to me anymore. Because of the weight i’d put on since i’d been laid off from my old job. She said she just didn’t know what she was doing. That he messaged her on Facebook and started flirting with her, she’s been going behind my back and talking to him for over a month.

I yelled at her, demanded she show me her messages. But it wasn’t just the one guy, i saw several messages from 2 other guys talking about meeting up again. But then she switched it back on me. That doing this “Made her feel like a woman” and comparing my “Flabby” body to his “Defined” body. Then she started describing what it was like, i tried to tune it out but some of this stuff was just shocking. I was absolutely devastated. The last thing she said, was that the other 2 guys were this kid’s friends. He had been bringing them over for God Knows What. I just told her to shut up before she could tell me. I demanded she leave.

I mean, our sex life prior was fine, but since i put on some pounds, she basically had been “Dead-Fishing” me.

716,"I know it sounds petty, but he has had the view that people are capital and plans to become famous, an executive, or in politics. He could very well do that with his determination to succeed and  how he has manipulated me in the past .

My friend went off the deep end saying ""hang them all"" , ""bring back the death penalty now"" , ""hoodlums think they are making ""progress"" when really they just made more racists"", ""move to Kenya then if you don't want real justice"" . He has had eccentric views in the past and thinks of people as a means to an end. I fear that he could be in a position of power where he abuses others after college.

Him resorting to violence towards himself or others (he wants to buy an AR now) or suing somehow, him reaching a low where he can realize his narcissism is hurting him(pretty unlikely), or this blowing up in my face(extremely likely).

720,"To provide a bit of background context my friend (G) and I are good friends and back in January of this year he approached me asking whether I could tutor him and help with revision strategies, understanding complex concepts and recommending any helpful papers or books that could be used to answer coursework assignments from various modules. At no point during any of these face to face revision sessions did I let him look at my work or suggest appropriate answers, I only recommended papers or books that I found helpful in answering any of the coursework assignments. This can be seen from previous assessments that we have been assigned and no case of plagiarism or collusion was brought forward, as the nature of our tutoring sessions was purely discussing relevant materials for module exams and recommending papers or books I found useful in answering assignments. The only reason I agreed to tutor (G) is that as a friend I could see he was struggling with the material and understanding certain concepts. So I decided I would tutor him because it’s the least I could do as a friend and that by being able to teach a subject to someone else I would be able to further my own knowledge and understanding of the subject.

So, since January I have been tutoring (G) on a weekly basis with sessions lasting from a couple to several hours. These sessions were mostly based around revising the appropriate material for the up and coming exams and rarely touched on any aspects of coursework for modules apart from recommending helpful papers or books. When everyone went home due to lockdown restrictions, we agreed that we would continue the revision sessions via Zoom calls. In these Zoom calls we often used the share screen function so that I could visibly draw out diagrams that explained certain concepts and it allowed us to read and discuss the relevant material for the exams together. During a couple of these sessions in the weeks running up to the alternative assessment hand in date (G) asked for any helpful papers I could recommend for the first couple of tasks of the assignment as he was finding these early sections particularly tough. At the time of him asking this, the screen share function on Zoom was enabled as we had spent the previous hours drawing diagrams and making revision strategies. As I couldn’t remember the exact names of the papers I found helpful, so I opened up my coursework document and looked through it to find the papers I used. Its during this time of my document being open on screen share that (G) must have taken photos or screenshots without my knowledge or permission. From what I can remember I only had my coursework document open for less than a couple of minutes. In hindsight its now obvious to me that using the screenshare function on Zoom was not a good idea and this situation could have been avoided if I had turned off the screenshare function before viewing my coursework document. Although after several hours of using it I forgot about the screenshare function even being enabled, I think this error in judgement is largely down to human error and is a mistake that anyone could have easily made.

This is the only viable scenario I can think of where (G) would have had the opportunity to view my coursework document. I also believe that this scenario is very similar to taking a picture of someone’s screen in the library while the person has left the room for lunch or a toilet break.

I am extremely upset that (G) has broken my trust in him as I tutored him for free and had no personal gain from tutoring him and did the tutoring sessions out of friendship.",03Jun2020,5
721,"So, I'm 31, I still live at home. Not that I'm proud of that, mind you. Moving out is my primary goal. But I feel like I can't see a way to do that for myself.

Unfortunately, I've been a failure my entire adult life. I couldn't make it through college. I spent over ten years working crappy low paying retail and service jobs. Now I'm at least working a nice little office job, but I still only make $14.50 an hour. Which, from what I can see is just not enough to support myself.

And really, I can't foresee any way that I could significantly improve my income. I feel like I'm basically capped out. There's no ""career path"" for me. *Maybe* in a couple years, I could be making an extra couple dollars per hour, but how much will that really help?

I have no skills, abilities, knowledge, or affinities to anything that would lead to a more fruitful career. There's no upward mobility for me, that I can see.

Sure, there are temporary, short term things that might help a little. I could work a second job, but to me, that's short term because I don't think I can juggle two jobs for an indefinite amount of time.

The one thing I refuse is having a roommate, because I have major social anxiety. It'd be different if I were living with someone I knew or was close with, but I will not live with some random stranger.

723,"So as the title says, my place of employment was shut down in early March due to COVID-19. I am a bartender at a very popular restaurant in Mid-Michigan, and was doing SO great before shutdown. My boyfriend and I have been at our current place for \~3 years now, and we have really enjoyed living here. However, our landlord has plans to try selling her house so we have been looking for a new place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for unemployment on the same day that restaurants and bars were shut down, and have yet to receive any form of payment at all from the UIA. I have received $1200 as part of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance fund, but that was in the beginning of May and I havent received anything since then. I've done every trick in the book to get a hold of somebody at the UIA: I call at least 20 times a day, I've uploaded all of my documents they need to confirm my identity, I've protested the open non monetary determination, I've followed the multiple threads on facebook/twitter/reddit following UIA issues, I've reached out to state senators, I've even sent in a handwritten letter basically begging for somebody to look at my case. I was very patient for the first couple months but it's starting to really kick in how bad it sucks! I am honestly just relieved I don't have children during all of this!

We have been to a few showings for homes in the area, and although we meet all the qualifications for income and payment history, etc., I have no way of proving to them how much money I (should) make.

I have never come across a problem like this, as I have a decent credit score and have always been good at handling my money. I've reached out to HR from my work to see if they can write me a letter of some sort? I am honestly at a loss.

724,"In July 2019, my grandfather died from a massive heart attack. He was actually my grandmothers second husband, no biological relation of me, however, since the age of 2, when they became official, he raised me as if I was his own. In fact, both of my grandparents were literally my parents. My biological father has never had anything to do with me and my biological mother had a wide range of mental problems that it was through her choices as a parent she ruined our relationship by mentally, verbally, emotionally, abusing me until I hit 21. 
Anyways, my mother died in March 2020 (heart attack also) and I mean, I’m sad about it but also really relieved. 
It’s been bothersome to me that I have been more depressed about loosing my grandfather than I have my mother. I mean, it has really affected me in a way I never imagined. I have literally lost my father. I have been able to discuss this a little bit with my husband but, not in a way where I can get feedback on how to deal with such great loss to me. 
In ways that my grandfather’s death has affected me is- following after his death, every time I would dream about him and/or someone would talk about him, I’d wake up in the night having peed on myself (like a child does). I tried to control that by not drinking any water after 8pm and it helped. I keep having age-regressing days where I simply feel like a child and want toys to play with and to be treated like a child. I’ve began sleeping with stuffed animals at night (my husband doesn’t fight this, he allows it). 
I work a lot and really don’t have the time for any kind of counseling in person as many are open 8-5 and I’m at work during those hours.

732,"These are my main two questions so if anybody could give me advice, I’d seriously appreciate it.

Long story short, we met during quarantine at the beginning of April. Both guys, I’m 20, he’s 21. Ever since then we’ve talked or done stuff on almost a daily basis, there have really only been a couple of days where we just sent snaps back and forth because I was preparing for my exams. But basically, we’ve been getting to know each other or just doing random things together such as playing games or watching movies.

About three weeks ago he told me how he really liked me, I reciprocated and we opened up to each other, but because of the huge distance (Europe and Asia) and uncertainty of the future (moreso the latter), we both decided to think about it so we wouldn’t risk ruining our friendship and just continue talking as before. Everything has stayed the same besides a few texts here and there about how the distance sucks, how we’d like to spend time together in person and such, which we didn’t really talk about before.

This is where I’m starting to get worried. I had five days of exams last week during which we couldn’t really chat, but just exchanged a few snaps during the day so we could keep in touch. My exams ended on Friday, and ever since then I feel like it’s not been the same. Now, I am fully aware that the type of communication we’ve had is not sustainable for a long time, but I just feel really weird every time we finish talking.

We have a set time, usually two-three hours before he goes to bed and then we pick it up tomorrow as planned, but in the past couple of days we’ll just watch an episode or two of a show and then he’ll send “Anyway, I think I’ll go to bed soon. See you tomorrow?” and just leave. Or he’ll text me a bit earlier, then say he has to spend some time with his family (absolutely understandable) but then keep the conversation short once again afterwards, stuff like that which to me seems really out of place, we’ve barely talk for a full hour a day these past couple of days.

739,"hello. I am need of some advice.

As it says in the title, I \[M18\] will be going back to school after a 2 year long hiatus. There are a multitude of things that factor into why I was unable to attend school for 2 years, but that is for another time. 

**Background:** 

I have moved around my whole life every 2\~3 years. And when I say move around, I mean like different countries in different hemispheres. Despite the constant movement and getting accustom to seeing new and different faces every couple of years, I became a very shy and very introverted person. Essentially, by the time I was around 9yo and was starting to make strong friendship bonds with a select few people, the moving halfway across the world (literally) hurt me quite a bit. This was a time when iphones were still rare (at least where we lived), and emailing between 9-year-olds was just not realistic. 

After that, I started to fear the process of losing friends and going through the eventual hurt that accompanies with the realization of not being able to see them again. I started to distance myself from others and just avoided talking/interacting with anyone. The few people I did talk to were those I inevitably had to, i.e., sits next to me in the same class everyday. At first the thought of losing friendships kept me from talking to anyone and I was lonely at times, but I eventually got used to it and since it didn't really affect me in anyway (grades, happiness, etc.), I just didn't feel the need to make friends anymore. I was content with how things were.  

**Fast forward to now:**

Despite the circumstances of a 2 year absence from school I have really good grades/GPA, and it just so happens to be that the school I will be attending has the IB diploma programme (2 years), I will be attending starting from the new school year as a junior (11th grade). Keep in mind, I will be 18 as to where others in the same grade will be 16 or barely 17. 

I have my way with words with teachers/elders, and I always have good relationships with them. However, when it comes to people the same (or similar) age than me, I have no idea what to do.

I will most likely partake in at least one sport (to satisfy my cv/resume), but I do not have any preference in a particular sport. I occasionally watch sports (soccer, baseball, rugby, tennis), but not so frequently where I can call myself a fan of a team or a player. I have some games (both console and pc) but I rarely touch them because it's just not my thing. The books I read are mainly of philosophy and usually are on ""controversial"" topics ranging from the ideas of Chrysippus to Nietzsche (Used as an example). I like to debate on such topics, but from my experience not many people (let alone students) are informed enough in order to have an unbiased educational debate. I have no specific preference to music; I have a spotify playlist of about 100 hours long with music from nearly every genre and in multiple languages. I have pretty much 0 hobbies. All I do currently is study or lurk reddit, with music in the background.

I haven't really talked to anyone except my parents, in the past two years. I honestly don't know how to strike up a conversation with anyone really. I need some advice on what to do. 

I forgot to mention, the reason why I'm interested in making  friends is because there are a lot of opportunities for making connections. Mainly horizontal relationships. (Majority of graduates go to high-level uni/college and high-level companies)

740,"i got tinder recently and this guy messaged me first and sent a bunch of messages over the course of two days and i finally got back to him and we were really hitting it off. he asked for my snap and number and we talked for a few days and then he had to leave town for a bit and while he was gone we were texting 24/7. we hadn’t meet at this point but it felt like we had chemistry and the night he got back in town he texted me and we were flirting back and fourth and we planned a little sneaky link that night at his place. it went great we cuddled, talked, watched a movie and did some more and eventually i left and when i got back to my place he told me how happy he was to see me and it felt really good and natural. 

then we were texting and flirting more and we planned to go to a drive in movie and his friends party together. we linked up again a few days later to go see a drive in movie and it went good but it wasn’t as electric as the first meet up and the car ride back from the drive in was pretty quite which was a little awkward. then two days after we saw the movie we were gonna go to his friends party but the day of the party he didn’t text me at all and so i assumed he wasn’t into me anymore and i got upset but didn’t ask him about it cuz i wanted to act like i didn’t care and so i didn’t text him for a few days and then he texts me and says hey have u been good? and at this point i was over the party thing i was just happy he thought about me and i responded saying yes and asking if he’s been good but he hasn’t responded to my text and its been almost two days. 

i just wanna talk and see what he feels but i don’t wanna come off as over protective cuz ik we aren’t dating but at the start of us texting he told me he would delete tinder for me and that his parents would love me so i feel like im getting hella mixed signals and idk what to do like u think i should post on my story to get his attention or just talk to him straight up.",03Jun2020,1

743,"Hi I’m 20F and I have just finished university and  had the most miserable three years of my life and am likely to fail the degree. I transferred university half way through my course despite wanting to drop out and did my last year living at home. I found the first semester incredibly isolating and lonely (this got better yet I still moved bc my parents were convinced it was the area bringing me down) and hated the course. My parents were pretty against the idea of me dropping out of university, taking a gap year before university and insisted on me living at home. I have a very close relationship with them and believe all of this is because they have my best interests at heart but they have so much of an influence over me. I find it hard to go against them and am terrified of disappointing them that it’s lead to the point of doing everything they want me too so I can make them happy. 

My brother (19M) went travelling this year against their wishes but with their backing after he established his plan. He’s a lot stronger willed than me and also not as close too our parents and it had made me a little bitter that he didn’t have that same pressure to go straight too university. He is also obviously more independent.  

He said he still saw me as a child and doesn’t see me as capable of following my own decisions and he’s right .  A part of me holds resentment towards my parents even though the bottom line is I should be capable acting independently  regardless of their opinion. I’m angry at myself too and blame myself more than I do them. 

I love them both so much and just think my mum is protective over me because I’ve struggled with mental health in the past. 

I know I’m turning 21 this year and still have my whole life to live. I’ve also been saving whilst at home so I’ve got flexibility in maybe taking a gap year and travelling or something or moving out and renting a place. 

How can I let go of caring what they think of my life choices so much (knowing they’ll love me regardless) and let go of this anger,regret, guilt so I can move forward?",03Jun2020,1

749,"My title says it all, I’m 34, and since I was about 15-16 my dad has been addicted to smoking freebase cocaine/crack. When I was 14-15 my parents got divorced and my dad went off the rails, he shacked up with a nasty stripper and got himself addicted to crack.

He sold his multi million dollar business, and the properties they were on for next to nothing to keep partying, the businesses I was supposed to own after school, jerked out from under me, the family legacy just gone now I work minimum wage as an employee for the new owners.

My dad managed something after the sell to where he still receives around 100k a year for just sitting on his couch and doing drugs, I don’t know the specifics there but he gets plenty of money, my two sisters have disowned him but I just couldn’t, we were always really close, best friends, and he gave us an amazing childhood.

For the last 10-15 years I’ve been treated like a walking ATM, every damn day it’s “I need 20 dollars for my power bill” it’s always 20 dollars like that’s the magic number, he calls my work line, my cell and when I won’t give him money he makes my life HELL he will harass me at work, at home, he will call my crying saying he is hungry and hasn’t eaten in days,  and just play on my heart strings, it’s gotten worse the last year or so, he has  dry advanced COPD and won’t be alive this time next year. I can’t even go see him because his house is literally a crack house full of strange people, drug addicts and whores and they’re all sucking him dry like a tick but he refuses to see it that way and honestly why does it even matter if he’s going to die so soon? I miss my dad he cusses me out when I tell him I can’t give him money and it really screws with me emotionally, there’s so many layers to this I can’t type it all out, all the lying, the stealing and begging and I’ve always forgiven him but I’m just to my point to where I’m just used up I don’t even have anything to give myself anymore, I’m angry 24/7 at every little thing it hurts me so bad for my dad to call me and sound like death, and ask me for money and when I say that I don’t have it he will get irate with me and it makes me feel so horrible, I’m 34 and don’t know how he is doing or anything unless he calls me for money and I have to buy his time, if I want to go visit him or even take him to eat he will need 20-30 in cash and won’t go unless I pay him, and bring food back to his nasty ex stripper GF who hasn’t had teeth in 20 years. This shit is really effecting my profession my home life, my leisure time, I can’t even relax bc I worry about him but then I can’t sleep because he will call me all night and if I don’t answer his girl friend will start to text me about how he’s back in the hospital on the ventilator just so I’ll answer I’ve really really really been considering suicide lately for some reason, just so it’ll all stop. I can’t express how bad it hurts me to not be able to give him money, even if it’s for drugs and not food like he says. he will never understand how hard it is to say I don’t have an extra 20 to spare to my own pops. I’m tired of him bullying me into giving what I don’t have and I just want it to stop for good. Help me please anyone",03Jun2020,2

751,"i had finally gotten a job as a morning stocker at hardware store. it wasn't that bad most mornings id be completely alone and just stock the pallets as i was instructed. straight forward, some days there would be a lot of freight and it would feel exhausting but it was w/e i was hired for it and i did it.

now problem is female manager shows up some morning there is a guy and female. the dude was cool always complimented my work brought me food, bought me soda, etc. now the lady was always in a bad mood menopausal or something just her tone of voice and attitude never set well with me. anyways this morning she shows up i have three pallets full of boxes as im stocking i live a few boxes in one of the aisles that i will pick back up to break down later. this was first strike she gets on to me and explains how its unacceptable for there to be an empty box and i need to break them down and put them on the cart as i go. okay whatever? btw she said it very very rudely and demanding.

second strike customer wants some wire outside guy manager shows me how to measure/cut it for them so im like 'okay i know what to do im trained for this' so i take him out there only problem is he asks for entire spool (its heavy probably 300 lbs or so) so im like well lets go to my manager and she'll have them help you get it. he's like ya thats cool so we get her and she instantly demeans me in front of him 'for one that is not your job two you need to get me first and there is another empty box you left over there' the empty box was the one i was working on when the dude walked up to me and asked for wire.

third strike security camera is expensive they get stolen guy manager instructed me not to leave them on shelf and set them behind desk i do like that and she demeans me in her rude tone and says the boxes are in the way and can't be left there. i lost my temper cause doing as instructed and said dont talk to me your just a bitch. she gets GM and says 'he called me a bitch'

i was told to leave and i know i shouldn't have called her what she was im just wondering in the future this one hurt me i needed this job bad but for someone to talk down to me and treat me like that im not the type to just go with the flow im very hot headed and speak my mind which is a problem in that situation. should i have just ignored her and told the cool manager how she treated me or gone to the GM? i really wish i would've been wiser i lost my job i got fired for the first time ever and this is not the economy to lose your job in im pissed.",03Jun2020,0
752,"To clarify before I even start: I am pro-police but do believe there needs to be significant reform in the system as it is too sensitive of an institution to have “a few bad apples.” Alongside this, I think we need to bring major attention to the racism blacks experience in America without rioting and looting.

So over the past couple weeks, I’ve developed strong beliefs about the recent unrest due to the string of what seems like clearly racist incidents that have affected black people. My friends and I have had many discussions about it. Some of them have conservative views that won’t budge, which I completely understand and respect. However, they seem to constantly undermine the racism issue here as “blacks got their equality in the sixties,” “racism will always exist,” and “whites are discriminated against too.”

None of them have hatred towards other races, but seem to miss the fact that minorities are usually disadvantaged in this country. What is the best way to show this, alongside the reasoning for why protests should continue and what is truly being fought for?",03Jun2020,3

755,"My friend got married last month but because of quarantine had to just basically have the ceremony with the wedding party, very close relatives, and no guests. We are pretty close, initially (like right after getting engaged) she had talked about having me as a bridesmaid but had to limit the size of her party and I totally understood as she has many close relatives and friends and seemed really distressed about choosing. She had a really nice video made that my friend group watched together last time we met up (&lt;10 people). I already sent her a nice gift months ago before quarantine. 

She's having a reception to celebrate pretty soon and she did say that none of us have to go and it's no big deal if we cant make it, but I'm feeling very guilty about potentially not going. My state has been lifting restrictions for a few weeks and seems to be on the upswing but I have to regularly see my 65+ year old parents and am still worried about the risk. None of my other friends seem that concerned and are going.

756,"First of all, I'm not really good at this like talking to a big community, and still, I'm not that confident about my grammar (to be honest I think I'm so bad at anything that includes decision making). I hope that I can find the answer and that been bothering me all the time.

So I'm from the Philippines, and here the novel coronavirus cases are still growing dramatically. All the schools were shut down since the outbreak, and now all the schools are about to open this August I think. I don't know why it's kinda ironic that when are the virus cases are increasing now they have the guts to re-open the school after they stop school because of having 100 plus cases before. Isn't that too risky to participate in a class where the pandemic is still ongoing?  It's not an online class like a face to face class physical contact class.

Supposedly, I'm going to enroll for college this year but, many things that have been bothering me like, should continue to enroll this year? I might positive of coronavirus because of this or, should I enroll to the online class? It's kinda unfair for other people here in the Philippines that can't afford the internet or have the gadgets to participate in the online class, and I got a lot of friends that cannot afford the equipment needed for the online class.

 Now, is it really okay to enroll in a physical contact class in this time of pandemic? or enroll in an online class and feel guilty or sad because a lot of people will be left behind (specifically my other friends). I don't know what to do honestly. For now, the best option for me right now is this, talk or speak to a big community and hear all the responses and make a decision. I'll appreciate your response, sorry for the bad grammar, and to be honest, I'm shaking at the moment typing all of this.

757,"Where I would normally post this is not allowing posts right now, which is great but its going to be 90+ out and I have animals. So I was hoping someone could help with some advice on what to do.

This morning we had a power outage, it happened while the ac was on, and the power came on and off several times over about 2-3 minutes before finally staying off about an hour and coming back on. After it came back on the ac began this cycle where it turns on, runs fine for about 1-5 minutes, turns off for 1-2 minutes, turns back on and repeat. 

There is also a hissing sound when it is running and immediately after it is off but it goes away within a few minutes of being off. 

Filter is brand new. I tried turning the off at the breaker and back on again. The AC is about 1.5 years old. It was running fine before the outage, and for the brief time it is running the air coming out is quite cold. 

If it were an option I would call repair but with being out of a job the last 90 days its not really an option nor is buying a window unit which would not work well anyway because I have animals all over the house not just in one room and due to behavioral issues they cannot all be in one room.

I bought some easy levelers to fix that, and turned off 3 of the overused pipes to give them a chance to recover from over use.

771,"Tl;dr at the bottom

I know, I was stupid. I just didn’t know what to do.

This kid texted me one day (an acquaintance from my old school) asking to FaceTime while we paint. I said sure, but I was busy the next few days and told him that. However, he texted me every single day until the day I FaceTimed him.

I’m an introvert. I’m not bad at social interactions, and I do like talking to people. I just like developing friendships naturally and in person (I know, impossible at the moment because of coronavirus) and not by texting. 

Especially not every single day. 

Group chats going off every single day who include my best friends, who I click with amazingly? Of course! A forced friendship with a someone who you’re an acquaintance with, you have to be uncomfortably polite with (since they’re, ya know, an acquaintance), doesn’t click with your personality at all (you joke, he’s serious), and is a friendship only developed over text? Not at all.

I like developing friendships, but this feels super forced. He texts me every day. But he, on top of all the aforementioned things, he does things that drive me crazy.

He’d send good morning and good night texts, but when I didn’t respond (because I was legit busy or the fact that I don’t really reply right away because I wait until a better time where I can think about what I’ll say) he would send “good morning?” And “...” (I despise that with every ounce of my being.)

Here’s the thing, though. I kind of FaceTimed him in hopes that would be it. But he texted me every day since. I’m sorry, but I like low maintenance friendships and not to feel like I’m being suffocated with texts.

He one day told me, when I told him I’m often busy and can’t reply (loaded with schoolwork at the moment) he told me, “I’m gonna keep trying until you reply one day...” (verbatim!!)

I dunno.

I ghosted him so he would stop talking to me, or to cut it back (I’ll shamefully admit I want to cut it off completely with him, though.) 

My fear is that he doesn’t have any other friends to talk to (this sounds mean, but I’m genuinely concerned he won’t have anyone else to talk to if I stop talking to him. I want to be kind and keep talking to him for his sake, but I’m beginning to despise the “friendship” (acquaintanceship?) because I feel like I have to respond every day. 

He sends “...” and “?”’s at the end of his greetings so I’ll respond. When I apologize for being busy, he’s like “lol it’s fine,” but ???? It’s obviously not if he’s being rude about it.

How do I explain that I’m an introvert and that I don’t like to text everyday? Is there a way to explain how the “...” thing is rude?

Thanks in advance, Reddit!

Tl;dr: An acquaintance of mine texts me everyday, sends “...” or question marks at the end of his greetings to get me to respond, is driving me crazy, and I don’t really want a friendship with him. I want to respectfully tell him I’m an introvert who doesn’t like being texted everyday and that sending “...” is rude. How do I tell him?",03Jun2020,1
772,"Hey everyone, so this is going to be long and I apologize but any advice or opinion would be SO appreciated. 

I (23 F) and my ex (22 M) broke up 6 months ago. I take full responsibility, I was in a bad place, selfish, and instead of trying to get help and work on myself, I used my ex as an emotional punching bag until he couldn’t take it anymore. We were together 2 years and the final straw was when he found out I was talking to and hung out with my ex before him.

Quick background, my ex before him and I met at 17 and dated on and off until I was 20. He was abusive in every way except physically, and it got to the point where my family and friends were extremely worried for my health. Eventually I broke up with him, and Within 24 hours started dating my ex who this post is about. 

Clearly jumping from one long term relationship to another in a day is stupid, but I was 20 super hurt, and my ex this post was about was my best friend and I had already started gaining feelings so it just seemed natural.

Fast forward to now, my ex and I broke up but stayed on good terms. We both starting casually hooking up with other people. Then he started hooking up with my best friend’s friend and my acquaintance which hurt since she knew he and I had dated. Drama ensues and then things calm down. He and I were on good terms and even started hooking up secretly so our friend’s didn’t know. We had issues where he’d ghost me or lie but then apologize and it was all good, he said he forgave me and we were good. 
Well it all went to shit. 

A week ago he and I were suppose to hangout then he ghosted me, and admitted he was getting serious with “a girl” and felt guilty. Well we ended up having sex as one last “hoorah” before he and her made it official. Well midway through the deed he blurts out “I have a girlfriend” an official girlfriend. He asked if I “felt guilty” and honestly I think it sort of turned both of us on (gross I know). After it we cuddled for a bit, he told me he wanted to keeping fucking me but knew he shouldn’t, and I told him I wouldn’t let him fuck up his very new relationship. We agreed if we’re both single in the future we’d restart hooking up and left on good terms.

Well shit hit the fan. It turns out his “gf” is my best friend’s friend. When I found out o was livid because he lied point blank when I asked him. I felt disgusting, and I stupidly called him to confront him. Turns out she was next to him, saw my name, and he blamed me because “he had to tell her everything”. He blocked me on everything and that was that. I called him from a friends phone (yes I’m crazy) and told him I’m confused. We were good, and even agreed to see each other potentially in the future if he was ever single again and agreed we were still friends. He told me he’s moved on and and doesn’t love me anymore and I need to as well so he  am focus on his new relationship, BUT in the same breathe said he misses me and we’d speak and see one another again, then said either he nor his gf are mad at me (not sure why they would be since I didn’t know he had a gf until we were already hooking up).

Since then we haven’t talked. My friends are all livid, especially my bff, for me and for his gf. I don’t know what he told his gf but they’re still together and I’m heartbroken. I realized I still love him, and I know I fucked up but all the things he told me and the way we were I thought maybe he still loved me too.

I haven’t been able to eat and my mental health has gone to shit. Half my friends have said anything is possible and maybe one day he and I will try again, and it’s clear his relationship started off badly. My best friend said she thinks I should assume he has no feelings since he’s in a relationship, and we both need to move forward if we are to ever be friends again. Honestly I don’t think I can be friends if he’s with her and I doubt his gf would let us be friends. Everyone keeps saying he can’t have me in his life and focus on his new gf. Overall I know I need to move on, I know what he did is shitty, but I keep blaming myself for everything. If I had been a better gf maybe we’d be together still. If I had just admitted I still loved him earlier maybe it wouldn’t be too late. It’s hard to convince myself he has no feelings with all the things he told me and the way we were. I’m no angel in this scenario but I just want to move on. If anyone has advice please please tell me. I feel like I’m grieving something I lost but I lost it because of my actions, and I feel like I’m perpetually waiting for something that probably won’t happen.",03Jun2020,1
773,"My teeth alignment is deformed. I remember walking into the dentist's office at 14 and him calling over his student dentist, telling her to look at my teeth and how they're deformed. It was so embarrasing, humiliating. Now I feel self conscious by just smiling. Imagine Wallace, from Wallace and gromit. THATS my smile. Exactly that. 

I am 17f now, and am fully aware of the people (including staff at my school!) making fun of me. I have asked my dentist for braces each visit and he declined each time, but in the most recent visit he finally said yes, and referred me to an orthodontist. I got a latter saying I was on a waiting list, and that's it. My mum thinks they will call me once I'm almost 18, when I will be forced to pay money for braces. In the UK people under the age of 18 get them for free. 

It's so unfair because I have asked for braces every visit and he said no! 

Is there anything I can do get money for Invisalign? We're poor as hell, no way we can afford it. Smile direct club is cheaper but my teeth require lots of care due to the deformity. Please, someone tell me how I can get money! It's £3,500 maximum, and I really want them before university next year so I don't have to be known as the girl with the ugly smile anymore. I feel sad everytime I smile, because I know what the other person is seeing. I am willing to do anything to get this money. :(",03Jun2020,0
777,"Hey everyone,

I am a somewhat non-traditional student for med school. I was supposed to apply last year but ended up in legal issues and a bad mental space after an Emory dean sexually harassed me and said he would help me get into school if I did ""things"" for him. I walked away from it and reported him.

This year, I am sending out my application to both MD/DO schools.

The physician I currently work with is refusing to send his LOR to DO schools because he firmly believes them to be inferior. He doesn't want to be associated with them. I tried explaining but he doesn't care. I don't know how my stats would hold up without strong LORS. I have poured my heart and soul for the past year into this clinic, both in and out of office. If I didn't help him out of office (download youtube videos, setup house alarm system) then he would tell me ""Well, if you don't help me on this, then why am I inclined to give you a LOR"".

Dealing with this power dynamic is hard and I don't understand how these people got to these positions.

I get scared and avoid doing certain things because I don’t want people to perceive me a certain way. This issue runs veryyy deep To the point where I will go on my phone and make a list of things that I need to do to fix others perception of me and it can be over even minuscule things. For example, I posted a pop song that I liked but then I started thinking about how people would think I only listened to radio music and so I made a second post where I typed more than a paragraph talking about how people should have diverse music tastes. I don’t know what’s wrong with me I’m young and I know this is definitely having a bad mental effect on me but I can’t stop.

780,"Hi,

I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now to work through some insecurities, negative core beliefs about myself, and a few other personal concerns. It is still early on but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and adjustment disorder (from my childhood mostly).

I was going to post this on relationship advice but I thought it's not really about my boyfriend but about me and my emotions/overthinking.

I have always been very emotional, had a lot of insecurities, and am very good at overthinking situations. Recently, it's been affecting my romantic relationship, which is part of the reason I wanted to start therapy.

It usually happens two to three times a month. I'll be a bit insecure or uncertain of some things and either I won't get my way or a sarcastic comment will get to me that usually doesn't bother me, sometimes I'll just be emotionally hypersensitive without being provoked. Then I'll start taking different things that have been said to me or things my boyfriend hasn't done (he's not very emotional or sentimental, so sometimes I compare him to other guys, unfortunately) and putting them together and get myself all emotionally riled up. Which leads to a lot of overthinking and insecurity. Things like not feeling good enough, feeling unloved or forgotten. Feeling like a chore or burden to him. This leads to a lot of tears, sadness, and sometimes I will just isolate myself in bed and other times I'll be very irrational and bombard my boyfriend with calls or texts, trying to get some point across that he doesn't care about me or like me anymore, which isn't true but in the moment I lead myself to believe.

Basically, my extreme overthinking cancels out any good in my relationship for the days that I have these ""nervous breakdowns"" and leads to crying and resentment to my boyfriend when he has done nothing wrong.

Does this only happen to me? Am I having some sort of emotional outburst? Does anyone know what this is called?

I've learned some self-soothing techniques, but I only use them afterward when I'm tired of crying and feeling overwhelmed with my emotions. Often the following day I feel numb and like I don't want to interact with anyone.

I want some perspective on how I can prevent this and stop self-sabotaging my relationship with these outbursts that put my BF through the emotional ringer.",03Jun2020,1

787,"Hi, I am a 20 year old and am currently staying at home from the university because of the pandemic. My family is \*super\* religious, but I am not since I am agnostic (unsure) in my beliefs.

 This has caused my older brother to despise me because I do not have the same views as him; for example the other day, he said ""I'll never forgive you"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my mother has always pushed religion on us as kids, so she finds great satisfaction to know that their child (my brother) is super super religious.

 My brother puts on religious hymns REALLY really loud in the house, all day. If I say anything to him, he tells me to fuck off; I can't tell my mother to tell him to turn it down, because she likes the fact that my brother is being religious.

Since my brother is so religious, he also gets away with many things. He throws temper tantrums at my mother and father when he does not get his own way, but they forgive him because he is close to his religion. Another example would be that he plays the PlayStation until 04:00 with a loud volume, and my parents say nothing again, in the name of his closeness to religion.

My brother disrespects my father on a constant basis, which I do not like. He has an incredibly rude demeanour.

788,"[TL;DR: Caught between college, covid, and a hard place.] 

So I figured during highschool that I would join the army, but that fell through due to a preexisting condition. That's all I ever wanted to do with life as I come from a big military family, and didn't plan out my future as well as I should have, because I figured that was for me. 

I've never been a huge fan of school, but did quiet well in most regards. I was just really shy, and never did much outside of class, or hanging out with friends. I've always been 'the smart one', [98th percentile of IQ, and very creative]. After two years of reflection I think this contributed to being to me being arrogant, and stubborn when it comes to things I want to in life. 

I took a year off after highshool [circa 2019], but couldn't find any work, and with Covid, and all the other chaos, my chance's of getting a job are basically zero. 

My mom, and family have always pressured me to go to college, and two days ago my mom was crying that she was scared for my future, and wanted me to go to a local community college. The college is relatively cheap, but I don't know if it's the best use of time as it's not very prestigious. There are two other colleges I could go to: One in my city, and another in the state capital. The state capital college has two friends of mine who are about to be sophomores, and juniors respectively. I think if I busted my ass I could graduate in about two to three years with a four year degree by doing summer credits, and a lot of extra work, but that sounds exhausting, and as much I love my friends I don't want to be miserable just for a degree, and some friendly company. 

The things I'd like to study are Political Science, and Psychology. Though I'm knowledgeable, and passionate about these things, I don't know if I could handle all the extra stress in my life. Nore do I think these are money making degrees. But they might look good enough to a business to get my foot in the door? 

I'm depressed enough as it is sitting at home all day by myself, and barely seeing the outside world. I've also been anxious in the past, and I can't imagine it would get better. 

If I had a time machine I would absolutely go back in time, and apply for college when we could back in senior year, before I knew I wouldn't get into the army as a backup plan. But that's not realistic, so I have to figure out if I should wait out the chaos, or potentially bankrupt my family by going to a college that I don't care about, nore really think I could handle.

793,"My sister (12f) and I (16f) have had a tradition of playing video games together for 4 years. Recently she has started to involve her friend over FaceTime. She’ll FaceTime her friend for 7 hours a day and play the video games we used to play together. When she’s done playing with her friend she becomes too “bored” or “tired” of the game to play with me. I’ve tried to just join her and her friend but I’ve become a third wheel because the game only allows teams of two players.

795,"This will be a little bit longer and I am absolutely devasted. (Please do not post this anywhere else)

So I will start at the beginning. When I was 8 years old, my parents divorced because my biological father is absolute trash (he raped my mother over a time of 18 years and beat my siblings and me up + he was an alcoholic). Not long after that she met my step dad via online dating (he is okay but has some serious issues too). She decided to live with him 4 hours away from me and my two older siblings because our biological father manipulated us into staying with him and she was hurt. A few weeks later I decided that I wanted to live my mother so I left everything behind ( I was still 8) and lived with my  mother, my stepfather and his three sons. At that time my mother and my stepfather were fighting every day, shouting and screaming at each other. 

A year later my older sister (11 at that time) decided to live with my mother as well (my older brother didn't want to have any contact with my mother). So we lived together, my mother and my stepfather still fought very much. My step brothers moved all out at that time. 

2 years later my little sister was born, we all were really happy and adored her very much. My mother loved her too but from time to time she said that she didn't want another child anymore but being a child myself I didn't really paid much attention to it. 

Fast forward to 2020. My mother and my stepfather don't fight anymore, only little arguments. My older sister is about to move out I will too in about a year. But here is the problem - my mother smoked since she was 14 (she is now 48) and because of that she has a disease called ""smoker's leg"" which is a hardening of the arteries in the leg. And because of that she had to stay at the hospital for about 2-3 weeks in which she got a part of her left foot amputated. 
 
In these weeks my little sister slept in the same bed as my stepfather, my mother even suggested it, so she could sleep well. I don't know, they thought it would help her. (Before my mother got into the hospital, she said things like ""I will never get out of the hospital again!"" and cried before going to the hospital). So she got out of the hospital a month ago and since then my little sister wanted to say in my parents bed. At first my parents were okay with it but after two weeks my mother became really aggressive. She and I had a fight where she said that she won't take sh*t from us anymore and that we have long enough made a fool out of her.
Little things are enough to get her to scream at me or my little sister. 

My little sister had nightmares these past few weeks and lays every night crying in her bed. She cries herself to sleep every damn night and I am not allowed to do anything. My mother says that she is just spoiled and when I say that I want to go to the doctors with her, just for a check up, she gets mad and screams at me. My little sister is scared of our mother and isn't even allowed to cry. When she is afraid in the late evening/ night, my mother screams at her because she ""is just acting"" to get to sleep by my parents. 

But no, she tells me every day that she don't want to sleep in my parents bed, she doesn't want to think about creepy things but that she just can't help it. My mother wants to leave her all by herself even though she is scared. And she won't listen to my stepfather either, she just screams at anybody who tries to confront her. I am afraid of her and am about to cry every day I see her screaming at my little sister and emotionally abusing her. I can't anymore. My mother says she isn't going to damage her nerves anymore and that, if my little sister won't stop her behavior, that she will give into foster care (or something like that). 

I am devastated. My little sister cries at my shoulder every day and I can't to anything. Even if I try to talk calmly to my mother she is getting aggressive. I can't take it anymore, I even considered to call the child support but I am scared to break my family apart.

797,"Requesting advice, particularly from my Asian American and black/brown community:

Context: I work as a teacher in an urban environment, big city in America. Almost all my students are black or brown and we have a large contingent of minorities as staff and teachers. Lately, even while we are remote teaching, we have been talking about recent events and BLM. Our school system has responded with wanting to make changes for the next school year, including groups for 'black and brown teachers' and groups for 'white allies.' Intentions are good and it seems as though administrators at the upper levels are listening. Note that these 'upper levels' are mainly white folk. 

Important note: I am for BLM. It is not my day today to insist that 'all lives matter' or that 'asian lives matter.' I do not want to detract from this fire. I will lend all my voice to that cause.

More context: I want to ask the administration to include more people at the table as we make systemic changes for the next school year. As an Asian, I do not identify as 'black or brown' or as 'white.' Racism against Asians has skyrocketed recently and nothing has been done. Maybe not enough of us has been killed, our maybe we're expected to just get back in line. I want to ask that we target racism and discrimination at its roots. My students do not know how to interact with Asians and I still hear ""ching chong"" in the halls and have been asked ""where are you FROM?"" from even staff members. I am not Chinese.

[Coronavirus: what attacks on Asians Reveal About American Identity](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52714804)

I do not want to overshadow and sound like I'm saying, ""what about me?"" but I want our future to be bigger and not have to do this all over again. If we are to make a systemic change, I do not want the Asian voice, the Indian voice, the Native American voice, to be silenced.

801,"Hello, long time lurker first time poster. Sorry for length, I am not very concise.

I'm 26 and have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over 3 years now. We started dating in college, I work full time now and she is getting her masters. Early on in our relationship, even before we started dating, my girlfriend (24) became best friends with my younger sister (22). This meant a lot to me and I was so happy that two of the most important girls in my life got along to the point where their friendship didn't depend on my presence. They were truly such great friends and seemed to love doing a lot together.

About a year into my relationship, my sister also started a relationship with someone she met at work. He's a great guy, a little quirky at times but it was clear since the beginning that he is a great person for my sister to be with. They met at their common workplace, so even as my sister got busier between work and school, she was still able to see him. Understandably, as she got busier, she began to see my girlfriend and some of our collective friend group less often. I guess it bothered me a bit too because it felt like they were beginning to drift apart, but I understood why. And maybe I'm wrong but it seemed that for the most part, if she was going to see anyone during her available time, it was her bf and their friend group. The bf worked weird late hours in college and even now, so my sister uses that to say he isn't available to hang out with us, but their group would hang out consistently.

My girlfriend and her childhood best friend began to talk about my sister's absence more often, sometimes to each other and sometimes to me. And they would kind of drop hints to my sister about it. My sister told me this too, and didn't want to be given blame because she was working more and didn't have as much free time. I don't think my gf or the childhood best friend were being very understanding of my sister's new work/school grind. So basically I was hearing both sides, and both had good points but they weren't communicating to each other very well.

This is where the conflict begins. My gf, her best friend, and my sister all finally found a date where they could sleep over and catch up maybe a year ago. After it was over, my gf told me that they talked to my sister about how they were upset she wasn't coming around as much and was spending more time with her bf. My sister, however, described it more as her being cornered while they wouldn't let the topic go, even after my sister acknowledged and maybe apologized for her absences.

So my gf thought it was a good sleepover and didn't think anything of it, but my sister really didn't like that  conversation. And I'm not siding with my gf because it really does sound like they wouldn't just move on from the topic and my sister couldn't say or do anything to wrap it up and continue the sleepover.

I've pretty much accepted that they weren't on the same page but it's done and I feel like my gf and sister have started to get closer again. But when I visited my parents' house yesterday (sister still lives there), my mom was acting suspicious in our conversation and eventually said that my sister told her about the sleepover. My sister doesn't know that I know this. And my mom was making very rude comments about my gf who I thought my mom loved. Even after I told my mom that I didn't like how the sleepover was handled, my mom still kept complaining about my gf.

So I'm upset because my sister already vented to me and most likely her bf which is fine, but instead of only using us as a way to vent, and instead of actually going to my gf to talk about it, she instead went to my mom who is well known in the household for holding long-lasting grudges over anything that's bothered her at any time. And I'm sure she didn't go to my mom for advice because she never does. She just wanted to rant. It also makes me wonder if she shared this with our other mutual friends. I just think it's pointless and immature to complain about the issue with people that my gf also knows unless seeking advice to solve the problem.

I had planned to hang out with my sister after doing some work, but just said goodbye and left when I finished. My mom sent me a text later, sort of apologizing, but I think she mainly doesn't want me to tell my sister that I know she told our mom. It was also surprising because my sister complains about our mom regularly, so why would she confide in her?

What can I do to resolve this issue between my sister and gf, if anything? I really don't appreciate my sister talking to my mom about it when she never told my gf how she felt, and my sister is entirely aware of my mom's ability to hold grudges against anyone, including family. I just want my gf and sister to talk about it because it's unhealthy to hold onto it, and I am getting tired of my sister's tendency to still bring this sleepover thing up a year later. And she knows the harm it can cause by telling our mom. I don't like how my gf handled the conversation, but if she was never made aware that it really upset my sister, I cant expect her to do something about it.

TLDR: My girlfriend handled a conversation with my sister poorly, my sister won't let it go and at some point told our mom and never told my gf how she felt. What can I do?

1. Do you think they are being rude to me? I have asked them to chat in English, but they said that they use Mandarin since it is more comfortable for them. Moreover, the chat is less likely related to me.
2. If you think that this is normal and not rude, should I just stay silent and google translate each chat? Or ignore every chat in Mandarin.

803,"I sometimes find myself wishing that I could really let go of a lot of the anger I have. Now there are a lot of things people have done to me that don't bother me in the slightest. I for the most part don't really get involved in grudge holding over things that feel minor to me.

When someone stole a book of mine and then I finally got it back only to find out that it was all ripped up I just didn't really care. It was just a book and I could buy one. I was peeved in the moment, I will admit to that but I was not like fist-shaking angry over it.

The things I'm holding a grudge over are more about when someone usually in a position of authority, or someone bigger than me (in my school days) he does something that makes me or made me feel powerless.


I'm holding a grudge against my stepdad for all the times that he's explosively went off on me over something that if he would have just talked to me about in the first place there would have never been a problem.

I'm holding a grudge against the guy whose name I don't even remember because when I was about five years old I was in the store he worked at and I did something stupid as kids tend to do and he went off on me like I had just done something way bigger than what I had actually done. I playfully swatted him with a piece of paper, and he went off on me someone who is not even his own kid or even a kid that he knows as if I had just walked into the store and crapped on the floor.

When I say that I'm grudge-holding I don't mean that I'm just kind of upset I mean I've hit this point where I have this really cold anger, that is hiding this barely restrained explosive fury.

The worst part is that on some level I feel like if I ever did go off on one of these people I would be in the right about it. I have never been a violent person. I don't enjoy violence, and I've never pick any fights.

My favorite video game series is one that I enjoy because you can resolve things in a peaceful manner. The option to use violence does exist but you have the choice to resolve things peacefully in diplomatically.

But some part of me is like ""If you just knocked him on his ass one time when he got in your face would it really be that bad?""

I need to let it go these grudges before I eventually end up doing something that I regret. Regardless of how righteous I might feel in the moment of doing it I know that went all over I would feel horrible for the rest of my life.

The only person my grudge is hurting is me, and I recognize that intellectually but it's like my emotional side won't let go of it. It's almost like my emotional side wants something to be angry about.

All right sorry for rambling.

808,"This is probably more common than I think but I can’t quite seem to find the exact advice I’m looking for elsewhere.
Basically, I over eat. I binge, but I also literally over eat like if I have a meal I will eat past the point of being full even if I feel sick because I don’t want to waste food. I think it’s because of how my parents raised me and the fact I suffered from anorexia for a few years (still struggling but somehow still eat so much) 


I have put on two and a half stones in just over a year. It’s making me feel so awful about myself. I try to not eat as much but I just can’t seem to do it. All day I’ll think that I’ll eat until I’m full and then I’ll stop, but as soon as I’m eating my mindset will switch and I’ll feel the need to finish ALL of it. I’ll even save the ‘best’ for last so I know that I’ll be more motivated to finish it all?? What is wrong with me?? How do I stop? 
I already have a therapist but we have ‘bigger’ issues to work on... 


I just feel so lost 
I know bmi isn’t a legitimate calculation but mine is apparently over weight, ive gone from nearly underweight to over weight in just over a year.
I feel awful. 


 I’ve tried exercising to burn off the calories but I tried last week and literally five minutes in I had to stop because I felt like I was going to throw up (I have a phobia of feeling/being sick) and now I honestly feel too scared to try again.

809,"I’ve long enjoyed stories, especially wholesome or personal ones.

I saw plenty of tv/movies and played video games and read some books as a kid, went through an anime phase in high school, a webcomic phase in early college, a fandom phase in late college.

Every few years, I tire of the old medium. I’ve seen a good amount of what interests me, and the remaining stuff starts looking more obscure, problematic, or incomplete. So I dive into a new medium, full of new-to-me content.

At this point I don’t have a new medium. I don’t know what to do. 

I kinda want to give them up and put more energy to develop other interests. 

But watching/reading/listening was always so easy, and stimulating. I had grown up with the message that the arts were important. And there’s truth to that. But, it’s not like I’d be cutting the arts out of my life; I still read and listen to the news and talk and listen to music and dance. 

But it would be slower paced than the stories I’ve become accustomed to and have more IRL relevance than before. Kinda seems too slow and heavy sometimes...

I know so many people who keep watching tv. Or playing games. I feel a little out of place. 

And I sometimes find it difficult to change my entertainment habits.

In the end, I guess I’ve kinda made up my mind that I want to minimize my entertainment media habits and replace it with socializing, volunteering, hobbies, etc. I’m sure I could get more mileage out of entertainment media if I wanted, I just don’t want to...

811,"I've been with that person and he told me once that he would kill himself if we broke up. After more than a year i lost feelings but stayed with him because of that. I was very uncomfortable when he touched me or when we kissed but I let it happen because I didn't want to hurt him. so I was out of love and acting like I loved him was very painful. I just wanted to stay with him a little longer so he could let go of me slowly as i broke of contact slowly, that was my plan. 

So for a bit of backround, everytime I told him if he hurt me or did something wrong in my opinion he would say he hated himself until I said that I didn't mean it and he could go on doing it. Everytime we met it would be at his house and i would always have to come (later i found out it was, because he was too lazy... i felt pretty bad that I wasn't even worth a 15 minute way) Im not trying to say that he didn't love me. he did, i was the only person in his life that cared for him. he didn't have any friends. I am not the type to stay quiet when I think somethings not fair but when I said anything he would always say he hated himself until I felt bad. I don't think he manipulated me on purpose though and he did have a hard past.

Okay so i think i should put a trigger warning here. (rape)
One time we were on his bed (from there on things are a bit blurry wich is not a good sign...) and he started making moves to have sex with me. I told him to stop and that I didn't want to. He said something of the lines of that if i wouldn't he would be sad and that we didn't have sex in a long time. I still said no and he kept on telling me how sad i made him. i didnt want him to feel sad so i said okay. This is very hard to type out so sorry for the blurry details.
(end trigger warning)

So I kind of did say yes. I thought that it wasn't rape because of it but now I know it was...
I broke it off pretty soon after that. It was very harmful to stay with him alone but that incident wont go out of my head. The smallest things trigger me and i feel very gross. Everything reminds me of him. It haunts me and I don't know what to do. My friends know that this is going on but i really dont like talking about it too much because it makes me remember it.
I really don't know what to do or how to deal with this.

My family is also pretty religious. My mom has told me that, ""A's long as you live in this house, you are going to church!""

If you ""pass"" you get a signed peice of paper that gives you access to their sacred building, the temple. 

I know for a fact that if I tell the truth, I'm not going to pass and my family will wonder why and force me to tell. The priest my tell my parents also, or try to get me to ""push away those thoughts, since being lgbtq+ is a choice.""

What are your thoughts on a reasonable amount of time to check/respond to texts or messages?

Obviously it depends on a number of factors..but in this case let's imagine a long-term romantic relationship, together for a less than two years, living together a few months, during non-work hours.

The person being texted is finished with work and probably at home (maybe on their way home from somewhere--but they hadn't mentioned having any plans after work). Generally, they are a tech junkie (always use their mobile while on public transport, for example). They have phone, Ipad etc. at home that will receive notifications, and are active user of social media, news junkie, etc.

How long is reasonable for you? (the message doesn't even show as being 'read' either).

(More info:)

This has happened several times in the course of a few weeks. We haven't had this issue until recently; however, there have been changes to my work schedule and I am finishing later. In a few cases, I am on my way home from work and try to contact regarding plans for dinner or food in the house (usually to see if dinner will be made or if shopping needs to be done). In another case, it was a semi-emergency and I needed help. A few times it was just to let them know when I would be back (later than planned). Messages aren't even read or they are responded to as I'm walking in the door. And, when I talk about it, the answers are increasingly more defensive (starting with ""I didn't hear it"", then ""I was listening to a podcast"", up to ""I'm not checking my phone every 5 mins for you"", etc.). Is it unreasonable, in your honest opinion, for me to expect that the phone/messages be checked within 20 to 45 mins? In a few cases, I preemptively stated that I would be sending a message when I finished work to confirm dinner plans. I generally don't message a lot, but for logistics it seemed necessary in these cases.

The whole thing seems off to me, but I am wondering if I am unreasonable. I notice that their alarm/sound/whatever is very loud. I have noticed them ignore messages when we are together (in bed for example). But in general, it is difficult not to hear it from the other room. After several instances in a few weeks time, it seems a little intentional to me. This person can sometimes be passive aggressive, but they say it's just me being 'childish'. For me it shows a lack of reliability, and I wonder what I would do if I ever had a real emergency. Any thoughts are welcome. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!",03Jun2020,1

826," 

My husband and I have been married for about 3 months, together for 5.5 years, and have been living together for 1.5 years. We are both very different, but we (obviously) get along fabulously 90% of the time and we both love each other completely. Like most couples, we struggle with the division and responsibility of household chores and the corona-virus pandemic and quarantine has really exacerbated the issue. I deal with adult ADHD and intense anxiety so my brain is normally pretty scattered. I've never been a neat freak and growing up my room was always messy (but never dirty!). The clutter just never bothered me, as I always knew where things were. Now that I'm adult and living in my (our) own space, I've definitely gotten better about keeping things neat, but I still struggle to break the habit of cleaning up my clutter. My husband is a bit of a neat-freak and he's very particular about the way that the kitchen/dishes/floors etc are cleaned. He has his own method and he can get pretty meticulous. Our arguments revolve around him telling me that I don't ""help"" him around the house enough or that when I do help him with the cleaning, I don't ""do it right."" Often times I will do the dishes after I make dinner but he will stop me from doing them because I'm ""not scrubbing the right way"" or I'm being ""too sloppy"". I cook dinner most nights and I tend to use a lot of pots and pans. He will do the dishes after dinner, but he'll be upset at the state of the counters or how many pans I used. I think that he sees it as a personal affront to him, but in reality I just don't see the messes the same way that he does. I can tell that he subconsciously thinks that I ""don't care"" and just leave all the cleaning responsibility to him out of spite, but that's just not true.

I've tried to explain to him how my mind works (how I don't see mess/clutter the same way he does) and have asked him to communicate with me if he sees a mess I've made that bothers him. For the most part he understands, but I can tell that a deep resentment is building inside him. Additionally, we both lost our jobs back in March due to COVID-19, and his unemployment claim was accepted immediately but mine was denied for some odd reason. He has been earning more money during the past two months than he has in his entire life, while my income stopped completely. Needless to say, it stressed me out a great deal, even though he was more than willing to support me financially too. I finally had the opportunity to go back to work last week so I took the offer. I needed to go back to work partly for financial reasons (we are lucky enough to not be struggling *too* badly financially) but mainly for my own mental health. I do better with structure and routine, and being at home 24/7 with no real ""requirements"" of my time was taking a huge toll on me mentally. My husband has admitted to me that part of him thinks I am going back to work to ""escape"" him and to ""escape"" household chores, which is absolutely not the case. Work ***is*** an escape of sorts, but it's **not** an escape from him - it's an escape and solution to my rapidly declining mental health. I can tell that part of him is hurt that I chose to go back to work - as if he thinks I don't want to spend time with him, or that I'm bored of him (which is not true!)

It's not like I don't help around the house at all, either. I take care of grocery shopping and cook the majority of our meals. I pay for all expenses related to our dog and feed her before I go to work and when I come home from work. I do my own laundry, sweep/vacuum the floors when the dog hair starts to pile up, change the sheets on the bed, and make him a cup of coffee every morning, too. And most importantly, I have never and will never EXPECT him to clean up after me. I've never made a mess and deliberately left it for him to clean. He usually just cleans it before I remember or have had a chance too.  
I'm not looking to bash my husband, because I don't want to invalidate the way he feels. I'm sure there are ways that I can ""help"" him more, but I also know that my feelings aren't ""wrong"" either. I guess I just need to understand his perspective better. I want to find a way to communicate with him more effectively because we keep having the same argument over and over. Besides household chore issues, our marriage and relationship is solid, and overall we're both really happy. But I know that there's a lot more to these arguments that just ""the dishes"" so I'm looking for any help I can get. There's probably a lot more detail that I should have included, too, so questions are welcome.",03Jun2020,1

I am only 16 and my friend aswell, I posted before on an different subreddit about this, I said that he panics when he is with us and we smoke or drink (I am not a smoker, my friends understand me and dont force me to do that), even if he smokes and drinks sometimes, thats a little bit understandable but he is stressed out even when we dont.

We dont force him to do anything, we just tell him not to be so stressed for no reason, he is probably afraid that someone will see him and tell his mother but make no sense, because we go to secluded places when needed and he's not even from the town, he's from a nearby village.

When I posted on the another subreddit all the people told me to leave him alone and let him live his life and not to ruin a friendship because of alcohol and cigarettes, but this won't happen because we are really good friends. Everyone told me in that post that I am an asshole, even if all I want is to help him get rid of the panic and stress he has all the time, and that was the point.

And I wish it was just pestering, but year after year, from sixth to twelfth grade, it was ""you should try this, [sister] *looooves* it!"", ""if you and [sister] did this together, you'd be unstoppable"", ""[sister] has made *sooooooooo* many friends"", ""if you had stayed in band like [sister], you'd be going on the disney land trip too!""... it was sister this, sister that, never taking into account the activities I was in, but always just worshiping the activities my sister partook in. I actually resented those activities because they never said why *I* would like them, their argument for those activities was always that my sister liked them.

Flash forward to now. I'm 21, getting into new hobbies, starting third year of university in the fall, and everything is going back to my sister, except not that her activities are superior, but that they just flat out actually show any interest in her stuff. She has an absolutely aweful manager and just submitted her two weeks notice, so I get that she needs a bit of love and attention right now, like when she comes home physically and mentally exhausted, but it's like everything she does is still superior. 

She started making YouTube videos for kids at out church since we can't meet, and my mom absolutely gawks over them, she sends them to everyone she can, binge watches them, and she adores them. When I was in high school, YouTube was my dream, and I never got any support, and was told I had to wait until I was 18 to post onto YouTube. And when I did just that, my parents never encouraged me, my mom only ever said she watched them when I spent a year at Bible college because she missed me while I was gone- didn't care about my stuff, she basically just needed to hear my voice- which was a nice sentiment, but I want her to be excited for me with things in my life
Last week, I got the chance to enroll in an online Korean course. First class is tonight and I can't wait, learning Korean on my own is so hard, so I'm overjoyed to have this chance. All I got regarding it was my dad basically saying something to the effect of if it's free, you'd be stupid to not take it. But since that night that I first enrolled, I get excited every day, and my parents say to live in the present, not the future, that I'll be bored because I already know the alphabet and can read and speak several words.
Even back before quarantine happened where I live, we had to cancel a big event I was going to perform in, and my parents were going to go, and I thought ""finally! They might finally understand why I like these things and develop even a minor appreciation for my interests themselves, even if it's just that they stop asking me why I like it!"" Coronavirus got the event cancelled the day before it was supposed to happen, and I am still just trying to enjoy things without annoying them or getting into another case of explaining myself.

I don't want praise for pursuing the things I like, I just want them to be happy for me.

Bring in my auntie. She's mom's best friend, and she has been a big part of my life since I was born. I have called her twice in the last three weeks to cry about feeling distant because everyone who is excited for and with me and shares my interest are all locked at home and in some cases, another Country, and I noticed I have dropped conversation significantly when I'm with my family because I feel like I don't bring anything of value to the conversation around here.

My auntie is amazing! When dad said I'd be bored because of thefirat parts of my Korean course being things I already know, my aunt said I could get review and ask questions where I'm still fuzzy on things. She was telling me it was awesome and that I'd really enjoy it. While my dad says the sketch I drew of my friend's favourite singer for her birthday needs a haircut, my aunt has paid attention to my progressions with drawings and said he looked good.  
My mom is anti Harry Potter/anti magic but watches Howl's Moving Castle and wants to see it again but has admitted she's still opposed to me being a Harry Potter fan, I explained things to my aunt and we're planning a Harry Potter movie night because she's willing to give it a chance after I explain more than the witchcraft aspect of it.

Anyway, I have poured my heart out to her saying how I feel like garbage around here. Today she asked if she could talk to my mom about this, and that she wouldn't  if I said no. I asked her to wait because I'm trying to weigh out the results I expect.

Given the fact that I've said why I didn't do things or like things in the past, parents act engaged in my stuff for a while then all goes back to normal, and the pattern still goes on, I feel like me talking will result in another ""why didn't you tell us?"" before the cycle picks up where it left off for a third time. But if my aunt says it, I wonder if my mom will at least hear it from her, understand that I was hurt enough to need help that I clearly felt I couldn't get from her, but then knowing mom, she'll basically get on my case about why she had to hear it from my aunt and not me, and who knows what'll happen after that- probably just ""oh, I'm a terrible mother"" or sulking for a night before she either goes overbearing or back into the cycle. Who knows?

I just need advice on trying to work out which would probably be better for the long run. This pattern has gone on since I was like eleven. I want it to end, but I don't know whose voice is most powerful tonspeak up- mine or my aunt's.",03Jun2020,1
833,"My mom was throwing up, and coughing. Shes been fine for 3-4 days. Well, I'm always on her ass, because she rarely walks her dog. I didnt think much of it, but she left like an hour ago, saying shes going to go get my brothers dog, and take it to her friends house, so she can give the dog a groom. She said while shes waiting for that friend to get ready, she's gonna take her dog on a walk. I dont want her doing any of those things, seeing as she was sick 4 days ago, but then shell be like ""you always get on my ass for not walking my dog, but now your telling me not to?""

834,"I just graduated college, cum laude, with plenty of involvement for 4 years, friends, experiences, and so on. 

The beginning of the quarantine was fine because everyone was in the same boat as me. 

Now, I’m the only person in my friend group without a job. I can’t land any, even the ones I have connections for. 

Part of me wants to just take a break and not worry about getting a job right now — but when I start doing that, I get antsy and have no idea what else to do. 

I spend most of my days deciding what game to play or what show to watch. I have no real interests. My friends are busy and/or live far away. I get stressed by having no stress. I am losing my mind here. 

For someone in my position, is it better to just keep pushing and find a job, or take a month or so long break of figuring myself out, taking up hobbies, etc...because I’m losing my patience and feel I need to take a step back.

840,"More specifically my tongue is burning so much!

Last week my tongue slowly started to build up a burning sensation, it's all over and incredibly annoying. I thought I had burnt it on some hot food. It's been a week and still burning, I wen't to the pharmacy and he said it could be oral thrush.. So I have Daktarin. I'm not convinced it's thrush for sure because my tongue isn't super white - although I did scrape it, and I used random objects so probably got a bit dirty :/

Previously my mum had bought me sooo much, so much snacks, generally milk bar white chocolate and I ate the entire bag, family sized bags about 2 of them day after day :/ so it's a lot of sugar, anyway, the milky bar usually gives my mouth a dry feeling and a bit uncomfortable on the back of my tongue. I still continues eating more chocolate, white chocolate, cookies, biscuits.. immense amounts of sweets.

I'm wondering if this could be a factor as to why my tongue is burning? I just thought of it today.. yesterday i ACTUALLY ATE MORE CHOCOLATE, because I didn't link it..

I've read about burning mouth syndrome.. I hope to God, and all great forms its not this because I've been depressed for a week I can't imagine dealing with it for years.. I don't think I fit the criteria.. I'm a 23 year old relatively healthy (except the week-ish of eating family sized chocolate.. sorry)

If anyone has any insight I would be SO grateful, I'll continue to take the gel just in case and I', going to stop eating chocolate from now..",03Jun2020,1

So, in the 5th grade, my teacher did this cool project where you write yourself a letter, which he would send in the mail 10 years later. Problem is that I have moved to a different state, so I decided to try to contact him via the elementary school. Apparently I was a little too late because he retired last year. I want to get the letter badly, but I don't know how to reach him. I don't know if he responds to his school email account, so idk what to do. My older and younger sibling also want the letters, so they have asked me to try to reach him. In elementary school, he told us that even if we moved, that he would be able to reach us. Yet, it's been a year overdue for my older sibling, so I'm pretty sure he mailed it to the old address. Any advice would be appreciated!!!

848,"How do I get back into a relationship with my (M25) partner (F25) of 9 years?

A few weeks ago, my then partner of 9 years comes to me saying she doesn’t know if she loves me.  After some discussion over a week period, I went away for 2 weeks so she could think. We broke up the day I got back this week.  

She came to these conclusions from several things: when I’m away she doesn’t miss me, whilst our sex is good/fulfilling she doesn’t wish to engage in sex with me, she things I lack the ambition to plan activities (Including holidays, day-to-day dates), also I don’t pick up the slack in the house (especially when we recently moved into a property and herself and her Dad did most of the work).

Now, I’m not disputing any of these things, especially the criticisms about me.  I know they’re true - especially the effort toward dates.  I had anxiety issues a few years ago, which she greatly helped me through, but until the last year or so I found it difficult to do anything new.  However, last year we went on holiday abroad for the first time since my anxiety started.  This was my biggest fear and we did it, and I really enjoyed it.  What I lack mainly is the ability to show my girlfriend that I actively want to do these sort of things - including more adventurous stuff like hot hair balloon rides etc.

I’ve tried telling her these things (all of them) will change because they’re a really unflattering bit of my personality that I’ve picked up since having anxiety - often finding myself procrastinating and putting things off.  Or having that gut instinct to say no to new things, even though I know I’ll enjoy it.  We’ve done a lot more in the last 12 months...but 99% planned by her. 

She says she can’t believe I’ll change because I’ve said before I will - but I’ve never had such a kick up the backside as genuinely thinking we’ll break up for it.  I want to be clear - these changes, I want for myself...not just for her.  I want to be more outgoing again and I want to enjoy life.  But, she doesn’t understand why I’ll change now and she seems worried that if I do, it’ll not be a proper change that will last because it’ll just be for her benefit not mine.

We broke up the other day, and since, apart from sleeping arrangements, nothing has changed.  She keeps mentioned things like me calling her pet names still etc. And she seems to be distancing herself from our relationship entirely.  A long history of being let down by family, she often puts up barriers when she’s hurt and I think she’s partly-doing that now.  Before she broke up with me, she received advice from her only friend (and from Reddit) which basically told her that being bored of a relationship is normal at this stage and the thing is to work on it...but she didn’t like that advice.  She was also told on Reddit how I was too good for her - and that really got to her from what I could see.

As for what we’re planning to do - we’ve said we want to stay close friends although we’re not sure what form that takes.  As for living arrangements, until we know what’s happening with lockdown/jobs etc. We’re loving together currently and potentially after medium-term.  One thing we seem to not fault is our friendship

Although - and this is a separate question - how would you define a friendship within a relationship if you take away all the sex etc.?  They feel different still to a normal friendship.  My girlfriend is adamant that the strength of our connection/friendship doesn’t matter but I’m adamant our chemistry does matter when you’re looking at how good we are together.

So - what do I do now?  I want to prove to her, or make her realise that we can work (as I really think we can) but do I move out temporarily at least so she misses me, or do I stick around and show her these changes as a friend?

It’s difficult and sounds cliche but I’m asking for advice and the only two people ‘get it’ are me and my girlfriend.  I truly believe we make each-other happy (and actually, she hasn’t disputed that) but it feels like she’s removing herself from a relationship based on things that can be fixed and I really want to show her otherwise.  I know none of these attempts

850,"(Mobile post, please don't bite)

I was considering going to a Black Lives Matter protest in Houston, but as a white male I want to be careful to represent that I'm not there to showboat, or have fun protesting. This is a serious issue, I don't want to go to have fun, I want to support my friends, family, and even the strangers in my city who are persecuted everyday.
However, I was considering bringing my camera. It's nothing high-grade but its portable, and it's dslr, and I want to do what I can to spread the word and help out anyone who needs photos. I intend to share them for free online, as well as send them to anyone who asks me. I don't pretend to be a professional, and I'm sure there are tons of journalists and photographers out there, but I feel like there can't be too much record of these moments. And I, wether out of unluck or ignorance, haven't seen anyone else repping free photos unless they post them on twitter. Would taking photos be a good or bad idea? I'm really not sure, if I'm being insensitive, have at me.

As an aside, I just want to say that, whereas I can never fully understand the lengths at which POC are persecuted, I have experienced racial persecution, and the idea of having to live your life based off the expectation of hardship simply because of your race is something no one should ever even partially experience, I'm so sorry, I don't know what else to say.

Tldr; should I take and freely share photos at a protest in support, even though I'm a white male.",03Jun2020,1
851,"I (22F) am very supportive of the current protests and Black Lives Matter movement. I've been very vocal on social media including donating money, signing petitions, making calls and sending emails, etc. I live with my parents, who have been acting supportive, but clearly are not. My dad stopped talking to me about everything because I got angry at something he said the other day and walked away from him. When I talk to my mom, she acts supportive to a degree. I try to educate her on things that she doesn't seem to understand, but she shuts me down very quickly, implying that I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm so young. I've honestly mostly stopped trying with her because it's exhausting and I'm not getting anywhere. 

For the most part, she acts like she's in full support (with some reservations) of the protests while she's talking to me, but when my dad calls from work she moves to another room and speaks in hushed tones. I just heard her on the phone with one of my aunts (again, in hushed tones) making some pretty racist remarks. Like, ""If they all just stayed in school maybe this wouldn't keep happening,"" ""I get that you wanna make a point or whatever but enough is enough,"" etc. I'm honestly just so shocked and blown away that I went to my room to get away from her. I don't even know how to address this. It's bad enough that she made these remarks to begin with, but I know she's gonna turn around and contradict herself to me.

I know that my parents are not bad people. Obviously they have racist tendencies, but until this point I thought they were just microaggressions that I could try to work on over time. Now I feel like I'm being manipulated by my own mother because she's acting extremely two-faced, and I'm so beyond angry at the things I heard her saying. I'm an only child, so I don't have any siblings to talk to about this. I know there are much bigger fish to fry right now, but I feel so helpless and angry.

Context: I like being alone. If I could spend the whole week without having to talk to another person, I would be happy. I would rather spend a day poor in the woods than be filthy rich among society. Yet, my overseers in work and at my church are constantly pressuring me to “reach out” and to be a more extroverted person.

The issue: I do not want to change. I am happy as I am. The process they want me to go through sounds uncomfortable and not worth the effort. Yet, I understand why these others are pressuring me. It is justifiable that I would be a more useful person to their objectives if I was more outgoing. And I can not deny that the creed I believe in requires it’s members to love other people. It could be considered dubious as to whether I am “practicing what I preach”, as it were.

The question: As concise as I can put it... I am having a hard time discerning if I am making excuses not to change or taking a stand for my own personality. What would your objective opinion be on this? I realize my overseers are just trying to be helpful. While I am not actively harming anyone by my behavior, I can appreciate that one must step outside their comfort zone to grow at times.

864,"Backstory/Lore: I am a high school junior and I am studying networking and software development. I used to work on hardware in elementary and middle school repairing computers for my family and friends. My father used to be an IT guy, (that’s all he says he was when we ask about his job) but I’ve never seen him go to work since I was 8 years old. I’ve also never seen him work from home, he’s always either gardening, or shopping, or watching TV. My mom has two jobs and one of them she’s created her own job that pays from commission. (Graphic design)

My father owns this ancient HP Laptop he got in 2013 and he refuses to upgrade or buy a new one. This has led to some problems in the recent history. He decided to upgrade our internet after I mentioned once how we have so many devices and that the bandwidth of the current internet was too weak. So he decided to upgrade. Recently his computer has been “rejecting” the new internet speeds, it won’t let him connect and the connection is always unstable. So I knew what the solution was, I had to uninstall the current network driver and then re-install it because it was completely outdated. I did that and it worked until recently.

Today, he had network problems. He found out after my sister had to do a Zoom meeting for her school and the computer wouldn’t connect. I knew all the solution was he had to restart the computer. And it would automatically reconnect because the network was saved in the system cache. I was going to go and help her but alas, he had reached the computer first. 

Now I knew what was going to happen next. The world’s slowest computer diagnostic. He went for the old fashioned troubleshooter in the control panel. And it came up saying it needed to connect again to the internet. So he slowly typed in the password and it didn’t work like I knew it wouldn’t. After that he tried it again and again until I sort of hinted that I had a solution. He ignored me as always and continued with his bullshit solutions that never work and take forever to complete. 

Eventually he plugged it in to the Ethernet jack in the office and he said some bullshit on how the network was still active and that is when I absolutely made me go insane. I told him to give me the computer and I restarted it and sure enough as soon as it came back on, it was connected to the internet again. 

Afterwords he began to blame all the troubles on me, saying that I FORCED him to upgrade the internet (I literally only mentioned once at dinner that the wi-fi had gotten significantly slower since we added more devices to the network) and that it was worse than the internet before. He also accused me of “hacking” our router and creating unnecessary “shortcuts and solutions”.

I was not expecting gratitude from him, but I definitely did not like getting an earful of bullshit on my behalf because I fixed the computer in 60 seconds compared to his useless method that takes almost 45 minutes to an hour.

I don’t know what to do and I feel like if I just handled everything technical like setting up the WiFi or computers then we would have significantly less problems. My father’s solutions to problems are outdated and ineffective and he isn’t seeing it that way. 

I hope someone is willing to give some advice on how to suggest solutions to him or how to handle these situations in the future because I guarantee this is not the last time and it will not be the last time for a while.

865,"I currently have a Note 8. It's dated but still does the job perfectly (I wouldn't change it). Work offers an iPhone XR. There's no phone options : no Android phone, nor dual-sim...

Whatever I choose, they provide the phone.

My two options are 

1 : Migrate my number to work phone. 

2 : Get a new number an keep my phone.

One thing's for sure is I don't want to carry 2 phones. 

iPhone looks good but there's a couple of games I'm invested in (socially and financially) that I wouldn't install on a work-managed phone. Maybe it would be a good occasion to play less, especially on work time (ie bathroom breaks)...

Also I could redirect calls from one to the other (not sure what direction would be best) and only keep one with me.

So far I'm leaning towards getting a new number, I figure it's the choice with the most options.
The downside is I'll have to pay to keep my line. It's not that expensive and the data is quite useful (mostly for the kids, when we're on the go).

On the other side the work phone also comes with data and since it's pooled with A LOT of people, I've been told I could go over the theoretical 2 Gb limit without problem. 

What do you think?

Edit : I use Whatsapp a lot. With friends, wife, etc. Not sure how it would react on a forwarded number...",03Jun2020,1
866,"I am a very introverted 16 year old, and the quarantine isn't helping my social skills. I need them now more than ever as Im going to go to a new school next year. Now me and my other future classmates have a what's app group and I want to make a decent first impression. Every message I write on the group is checked a million times by me, and then even after sending it, my face gets really hot and I feel a sudden heat stroke. Before the quarantine I remember I was getting better and better by hanging out with my friends but now everything's got to shit.

868,"I am a 22 year old student(F) abroad. I left my home country about 3 years ago to go study. I am graduating in a few weeks and I have received an offer to work in a big firm, initially for a year. However, I don't know if I should accept the offer and stay here in this country.

I have not had the best teenage years and the experiences that I have been through during those years have emotionally scarred me. My parents got divorced when I was 8 years old- which I accepted because I thought maybe it would make things better as it had come to the point where they were arguing everyday and my dad was sometimes violent. My mom(47 now) and I moved in with my grand parents after the divorce and I would spend the weekend at my dad's every two weeks. After a while they started dating again and did not prepare me for it. Now my 10-year-old self was quite confused about it but I accepted it as I just wanted their happiness. Some three years later my dad met someone and she and I got along pretty well. Well at least I thought things were going pretty well, I found out later that they got married and no one told me about it. I was not even invited to the wedding. Later on my dad casually talked about the wedding and I pretended it was okay. When i turned 15 I got in an argument with my dad (because he was very controlling and got very distant) and didn't speak with him for years, up until earlier last year. We then got into another argument and now we no longer speak to each other. But that does not matter for now.

When I was growing up my mother was very strict, I was not allowed to see my friends for too long and was supposed to spend my free time with her. Whenever I would get back home later than 4 p.m my mom would get very angry at me. I did not have much privacy while growing up as my mom would snoop around my room to find stuff. There has been multiple occasions where she has found my personal diary(ies) or went through my text messages behind my back. I was rarely allowed to close my bedroom door and was never allowed to lock it. I was not allowed to have a boyfriend when I was a teenager so I had to keep my relationships secret. When I was 17 my mother found a picture of me on my ex-boyfriend's social media and questioned my about it, before I had the chance to reply she told me to tell him to delete the picture and then block him, to which I obliged.

As all this was really affecting my mental health and this was reflected in my secondary school grades, I had to beg my mother to allow me to let me go abroad to study(after finishing secondary school as I new I would not be able to continue studying in that environment). It took months for me to convince her but she finally agreed but told me that I had to come back as soon as I had finished studying to take care of her and expenses. My mom is in good health other than the fact that she is very overweight. Last year I had the opportunity to work a year in industry before my last year of university. It would have been an incredible chance for me to gain some experience and save some money. My mother refused to let me go forward with it. Later after much begging she accepted. I applied to around 5 places at the time and my mom shouted at me for not getting a job and said that she had wasted so much money on me. Later on she guilt tripped me into giving up my search for an industrial placement and to this day I still regret it.

As much as I want to accept this job, I do not want my mother to be alone. Though she does have her brother, and my grand parents as well as her cousins. She got into arguments with her cousins and doesn't really like to talk to them. She cannot stand living with my grandparents as they are too ""overbearing"". So she built a house for me and her to live in, even after I get married I am supposed to live in that house. She even told me where my baby's room would be. Now she wants me to come back home and use my salary to finish the a house I never even asked for. Now bear in mind that I do not mind helping out my mother financially, after all she brought me up. But my issue is that god damn house. My mother never remarried. She dated 3 guys before though but then the relationships did not work out. Two years ago when I told her to try to find someone she could date, she shouted at me and told me I had lost my mind and told me I was just like my father.

I am afraid of her reaction when I tell her I got an offer for quite literally the job of my dreams. I also have a boyfriend at the moment and I am afraid to let her know about that because during this whole industrial placement situation a year ago, she told me to go find a husband and get married and that she would no longer speak to me. So I am genuinely scared of her reaction. Please help me out. Of course, I am not asking you to make a decision for me but to advise me. I don't know if my judgement is clouded at the moment and I can't seem to make a choice.

I had a friend months ago ask me about being roommates when I moved from there but I didn’t think it would be any time soon but we’d revisit it. 
Roommate found out a month or so ago she was pregnant. 
I revisit this with my friend she says she wants to save money and stay at home with her parents (can’t blame her.) Another friend agreed to move in with me about a month ago but is now saying she’s moving in with her boyfriend in January. I personally don’t care about that part but she has been pretty adamant about not moving in until they are married. 
My dad has an apartment with my uncle who MIGHT move out so that’s a possible option. 
I could live with my sister but her home is disgusting and she’s asked me before to move out because her ex girlfriend who was still living there didn’t want me living there. Not to mention it’s almost an 45 min to an hour from where I work and go to church and all that jazz.

They are placing 5g masts to control our minds
The sheep don't even notice what's going on

Hi, I am new to the hobby and have had my freshwater 20 gallon tank for 7 weeks now. I started cycling with three cories and everything seemed to be going just find. I was checking the water and performing small water changes each week and siphoning up gravel. I thought given the timeframe, the acquarium was cycled so I added more fish to the tank about 2 weeks ago (one dwarf gourami and 5 bloodfin tetras). I noticed a few small white spots on the gourmai and was monitoring this closely and though he was acting normal, I treated the tank with Ick Guard. A few hours later, about half of the fish were either on their sides or swimming erratically. I quickly removed them from the tank-- luckily everyone survived and they are swimming normally now. I tested the water in the tank and it was extremely toxic with ammonia at 4.0 ppm and 8.8 ppm PH. I removed about 70% of the water from the tank, which brought the reading down to 2.0 ppm with the 8.8 ppm PH. From reading online, this seems to be the ammonia spike and that my tank in fact was not close to being cycled. I also changed the filter medium a few days before the crash and I'm afraid I removed the good bacteria that started to develop. My thought is to keep the fish out of the tank until it has properly cycled, ammonia levels dropped and nitrates have formed (if you have other advice here, it is welcomed). I bought a bottle of Tetra SmartStart 3 days ago to introduce good bacteria into the acquarium but the reading each day has been the same ammonia 2.0p ppm with 8.8 ppm PH. My fish are now in a very temperate holding tanks so I'd like to get things set up properly and as quickly as possible to get them back into the acquarium. A few questions: 1) Should I leave the water in the acquarium as is or drain the water/or do a water change to reduce the ammonia and PH? 2) Should I buy a produce to introduce more bacteria or give the tank more time in the current situation in the hope the good bacteria develops and the ammonia goes down?

Any advice you have here would be greatly appreciated and helpful. Thank you!",03Jun2020,1

And 2 adidas shorts, iPhone X case and a VS tote bag/beach towel bundle from a seller on Friday.

Okay so listen and please don’t call me or anyone mentioned in this story a bad animal parent. Sunday, the 24th, my brother took his two dogs, me and my dog to a marsh. His dogs ran around in the water and tall grass while mine, a short fat little thing, kept to my side. Throughout the day I was picking ticks off myself and the dogs. 

When we got home we did a tick check and didn’t find anything. Well we are all blind cause throughout the whole night I kept finding ticks on ME not any of the dogs. We checked all the dogs repeatedly and we couldn’t find anything. In total that night we found 19 flipping ticks. We put tick stuff on the dogs and cleaned and bleached my room. 

Well, yesterday I woke up to something crawling on my leg. I realized it was a tick and I showed my brother and we burnt it and thought, well flip. We checked his dogs again because his dogs went to a river shortly after and thought it was from that. Found a tick on one of them, got it removed and thought we were finally done. However as this story title suggests, we weren’t. Today I woke up and went to turn over, I happened to touch my face and I felt a tick. I pulled it off and burnt it. My mama woke up and I told her all about it. Something to note is that I have really bad anxiety and having all these ticks was making me lose my mind. I was shaking and rocking in our chair while constantly itching myself. 

My sister woke up and we were telling her about it and I went to pet my dog.l for comfort. Who we had to this point found zero ticks on. I felt something squishy and started freaking out. We put Vaseline on it and pulled off a huge tick. I didn’t take any photos cause we wrapped it in a paper towel. It was about the size of a quarter. My sister checked her over and found 2 MORE the same size as the first one. They had clearly been on her since we went to the marsh and had been feeding really well. Then about 10 minutes later I was petting her and I found another one. So my sister pulled it off and once again, it was the size of a quarter. 

So I’m panicking really bad. We have had multiple ticks in our house, specially in my room, and my poor old dog has had these 4 massive ticks feeding off of her for awhile. She has all her shots and had tick stuff on her, the tube stuff the vet gives you but, is she gonna be okay? It will be hard to tell if she shows any signs of lyme diseases or other tick diseases because she is an old dog and already shows some of the core symptoms like joint swelling and fatigue. I’m really worried and I don’t know what to do. She has an appointment with the groomers and my brother is gonna bring home some tick spray for the yard but what should we do?? 

Please please don’t call me a bad owner of my dog for not noticing sooner. I really did check her and I didn’t feel them and I didn’t see any. I don’t know how I didn’t see or feel them when they got that big because I had been loving on her and holding and cuddling her that whole time. I’m sorry. What do I do? Also how do I take care of my room since I had the most ticks in my room and on me and my dog who are always in my room? Im total my dog had 4 ticks on her, possibly more, I had 9, and I found 3 crawling in my room.",03Jun2020,1

904,"So little background, when i was in school (2 years ago to be more precise,) i met a girl (lets call her blonde)and we were friends until like 5 months ago, stopped talkjng unfollowed on inst, no calls, no texts, nothing. And i have a gf for 4 months i think maybe a little bit more.

So today i was sleeping and my other female friend(boxer) called me and asked me if i want to come to school to sit and talk because we barely meet face to face,and after that i planned to meet with my gf.
I came and the blode was sitting with her we had small talk, and i mainly chatted with the boxer, the blonde was sitting in her phone almost all the time, then after like 30 min she left didnt even say bye to her, after that a few more friends came and we were sitting for like an hour after the blonde left. After that i met with my gf walked her home and gone home,
8pm i get a call from blondes bf friend, and he started asking what i did at school today i said was sitting with friends, he said ""i heard you try to flirt with blonde"" i actually laughed inside and said hell no why would i, then he said dont come near her, i said ofc man and hanged.

10 min later the boxer calls me and says he called her too  and they try to find who i am and where i live(honestly no idea why they thought i was flirting with her considering im not talking to her for like 5 months, and where they got my number)

Put simply they are pretty dangerous and i have heared of them throwing molotovs in windows, stabbing to them is not a big deal either, and they probably wont get arrested because of connections, so they only reason they searching for me is prob to beat me to half death, stab me or somethifng along those lines.

I have no idea why they think that and 0 idea what to do,cant call back because thry called from hidden number, and tbh i dont care if thry just beat me i just dont want my gf of family get involved, tomorrow the boxer will talk with the blonde to ask wtf happend, so yeah what you think i should do?

I could clearly see people uncomfortable tbh, compared to normal days, and even a coworker who wouldn't speak to me all day. At the end of my shift my manager came to me and said, and im paraphrasing a lot:

""As a manager, as a coworker and as a friend, Im concerned for your safety. I don't want you to be targeted or harassed. In your own time, things like this are ok, but at work... you should just not.""

I wasn't assaulted or anything as a child, I don't know why I don't like it. Now I'm 18 and it is a bit better, but not much. I can now hug people without instantly freezing, for example. If the contact is announced, I have almost no problems anymore. I also have a boyfriend, so I am not completely unable to touch any human being.

But if someone touches me unannounced, I will freeze and my brain just stops working. Even if it is my boyfriend, I will flinch and freeze sometimes, but with him, it is very rare. I told my friends and family members several times that I don't want to be touched, but they forget it every time because everyone else is okay with it. Some make fun of me for being ""on the spectrum"" (which I am not) and try to touch me just because they think it's funny how I just stop talking mid sentence since my brain has a ""sensory overload"" and stops working. And also because they think I should stop overreacting and act like a ""normal human being"".

It also hurts me a lot that I have such a problem with it. I love people, but because I always keep my distance, everyone thinks I am frigid and don't care. Some straight up told me that I ""don't have feeling anyways"".

And it is really not caused by trauma or anything. There were times where my borders were crossed, but I had this problem before.

924,"This is a long one, but please please please try to understand.

This is something that I have only confided with a mental health therapist on the phone. I did not specify any details of what happened, and will continue to shield some things.

Last summer, I did something truly reprehensible, disgusting, awful, criminal, and embarrassing. Because of this, as well as the criminal nature of what I did, I will not disclose the specific detail of what I did. I will refer to this as 'THING' or 'SOMETHING' in this post. In addition, I have recently made this reddit user account to distinguish from my primary reddit account.

Last summer, I attempted to do something, and I backtracked out of doing this thing. One day later, I returned to the scene to attempt once again and was caught by three people who belonged to a group who catch people who attempt this. They took a video of when they caught me, and I was clearly distraught and disgusted with myself and was crying my eyes out as I was watching images of my family and friends in my head flash by. I allowed them to check my phone for whether I have any past history of this, and obviously I did not. We chatted for about 2 hours about what I did, and the consequences, and I really did tell them the truth that it was not who I am, and it was something that is untoward my character. They must have looked at my phone thoroughly and found nothing that proved I did this before, and my 'something' only occurred over the past few days really. was a process of a few days and I had no history of this at all. Compound this with me telling the truth and me looking so obviously saddened and distraught, they asked if I could provide money - initially 1500 but I said I couldn't. They pulled out a link to a loan website fairly quickly (does this suggest that they have asked this before of others?) but it turned out that I was not eligible. Luckily, I was getting paid that evening, and told them this. I also told them that I would be able to take out cash from my credit card as well. I said I have to meet my dad (which I did actually) in the city for drinks. Before I went, they wanted a video of me admitting what I did, which I ashamedly gave. I think/assume this was because in case i wasn't able to provide the money. Also, they wanted something of mine - so I gave them my driving licence (I didn't drive but it was identification) One thing they stressed was that they did not want a bank transfer and only cash - was this to prove to their superiors that nothing happened and a cash flow wouldn't be traced back to me? I don't know. Problem is that they told me that they had backup from their group close by, and would call them in if needed. The police were not around at all, thank god. I didn't see this backup ever so I'm not sure whether this was made up or genuine.

After I left them I went back home, changed and went to the city to meet my dad for drinks. Along the way I think I took out money from cash machines using my credit card. On the train journey there one of them called me via a private number and asked about the money. I said I would be able to get some today and the rest tomorrow. They said to meet them at midnight at the scene which I did - I arrived there at 11.30pm and waited for an hour before I received their call (perhaps they were deliberating). How I survived that night from the journey home, frantically looking around the house for money, for my credit card, changing, making the journey to the city, sitting with my dad, and then taking the journey back to the scene directly after. I don't know how. I felt worse than sick. I felt like a dead man walking.

I met the same three people at midnight, I gave them a few hundred, and told them I could give the rest tomorrow. I did in the end, through the credit card and the pay from work. When we met up the next day, at 1pm (?) I waited at the same place as last time. They called me and they said to meet atop a pedestrian bridge that had a highway beneath it. This was in the open and it was a fair height up, and I was worried they would push me off the edge. I said I wasn't comfortable with that and they persuaded me to get up there. I gave them the remaining money (cash ofc). I think I ended up giving 1000-1200 in the end, and they said that would be fine. I was so so so so scared about the video being released and I insisted on a handshake, which they gave. Why was it on the bridge? For the backup to see I gave the money? I don't know. I also kept insisting to give my driving licence, but one of them said they forgot it. I was unhappy and thought was that a sign of things to come? Could i trust them to not post the video? After departing I texted if they could send a taxi to near where I lived with the licence, they said they couldn't find it and it was lost in the van or something. I applied for a new one AND we moved house 7 miles north in the time between the incident and now, so the address would have changed.

I have one of their phone numbers (a proper number, not a private number), but haven't texted them since the day after it happened. I'm not sure whether it works, but should I text? The therapist said to wait until more sessions are conducted. In a month or two I will be approaching a year since this happened, and the group's website posts videos of when they catch the culprit. The last video uploaded was the day before my incident took place - and the youtube video upload date corresponds with the date posted on the website - so the group posted on their website on 5th March (for example) and the youtube channel also posted on 5th March (for example). Therefore there is no delay between the website and the youtube channel. I have also checked out their other media platforms and no video is published. So once they upload anything they will upload .

They do pieces about 'closed cases' - people who have been bunged up for attempting as I did. Many have past histories of doing this as well. What is uplifting to me is that they have closed cases from September and October - AFTER my incident. So they are not inactive and do upload some things. They just haven't uploaded any videos of people being caught since the day before my incident. They also have a database and the names from previous videos appear on the database. My name is not on there, and I do not want to be associated with that AT ALL.

**why they won't upload:**

**- it's been 10 months, and if they would have done they would have done so by now.**

**- since my incident, they have edited their 'closed cases' page with things from September and October last year - after my incident so they are not inactive. They are also fairly active on twitter and facebook, retweeting news.**

**- i paid the money and promised them i would**

**- my character and my history - whether they could judge my character in 2 hours of conversation is debatable, but what cannot be denied is my lack of history with doing this.**

**- my age? I am fairly young.**

**- they gave me their word**

***why they could upload:***

***- what I did/was trying to do was utterly reprehensible and awful and disgusting, so why wouldn't they upload?***

***- I attempted to do this a day after i backtracked.***

***- the most recent uploaded video is a day before my incident.***

***- they could upload a few years in the future.*** **But why would they wait? If they wanted the police on me they would've done so by now?**

Between the summer and winter I knuckled down and generally thought about what happened a few times a week. It took a toll on me and my social life but I was fairly level headed and I knew what I did was disgusting. But I carried on with my life, with a bit of me dead inside.

Between January and February I found someone and we dated for a bit. That really took my mind off this, and I really only thought about this once a week, if that. Then she ghosted me and I thought that the group had somehow got in contact with her to alert her of what happened last summer. Fortunately, she reached out to me and explained why she broke it off and gave me no indication whatsoever that the group contacted her. We remain FB friends.

My fears at the moment are that it's approaching the year marking my incident. Another fear is that if they do not post now, will they post later when I'm a tad older or very old? I don't know if they've deleted the video. I paid with money, they gave me their word, and we haven't talked about it since. I also told them repeatedly that I will be living with myself for the rest of my life with this hanging over me, I may never have a normal life with this, and I may have a mentally taxing life forever. This is true, but I tried my best to tell them that I have and will pay for what I did, both financially and mentally. They kept saying it's ok and it's alright, but I don't know if it's deleted.

The lockdown was exacerbated my thoughts about this. Every day I wake up I have this 5 minute period of just relaxation, and then I have the thought of the video being posted. I type my name in google and nothing untoward appears. I go on the group's website and the same video from 1 day before my incident last summer remains there.

I understand that this mental health strain is what I deserve what attempting to do what I did last summer. I deserve it more than anything.

But what do I do? Do i contact them? Do you think the video will be published? I know this is a lot to ask but I am crying as I write this. Please, I beg of you. If you have any questions or are puzzled by what I have written, feel free to ask - I will not answer specifics about what I tried to do.",03Jun2020,1
926,"I’ve had a past with body issues for sure. Even went to my psychologist for it once. Not entirely sure what’s the cause and what’s the effect but I really wasn’t nice to myself or overweight people. I would constantly think to myself “you really don’t need to eat that” when seeing someone overweight eat. But somehow I was also bullying myself by saying that. I’m not overweight, I don’t even think I can be considered chubby. I really used to think of myself as very heavy. I would be surprised when I was in the shower and looked down and saw my feet, as if I shouldn’t be able to. 

I would meet overweight people and think horrible things and then I would go straight home and tell myself the exact same horrible things. I honestly thought I needed to let it out on someone but I’m not a bully so I kept it inside. Kinda like the cliche “he’s bullying the gay kid cause he’s in fact a closeted gay himself”? 

Generally I think positively about myself and I started doing it with my weight as well. It got a bit better. Then I started seeing a boy and I sort of got my heart broken but not really. It was really overwhelming, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t be awake, I had to be high at all times. It lasted for almost a full month so I obviously lost a bit of weight. Then I got over it and started eating somewhat normally again.

The part that worries me is that I wake up and get off on the fact I haven’t eaten yet. I look at my stomach in the mirror and I really get off on the thought. But I love my body now and I’m pretty sure I gained everything I lost. It’s like I’m seeing it for what it is for the first time in a really long time. I really went from looking in the mirror and thinking “you’re attractive but could lose some weight” to “holy fuck you look so good I can’t believe it.”

Then I just sat on my bed now and thought “hey I only ate this today” and felt good about it. 

My question isn’t if it’s normal to get off on yourself, because I’m pretty sure that’s just the shock of my mind doing a 180 for the first time in I can’t even remember. My question is if it’s normal to get off on the fact of not having eaten yet? And not having eaten much? Making it my goal to not snack at all? 

I’m not a very hungry person, I can’t really focus on being hungry as weird as it sounds. I just get moody and think “oh hey I should eat”. So I’m not exactly starving myself... I think? Thoughts?

928,"My husband (24M) and I (24F) received an inheritance when his grandparents passed. We are now trying to decide what would be the wisest use of this money.

We put down 10% on the house when we closed on it one year ago and currently pay $1600 a month towards our mortgage.

935,"I (M, 25) struggle to find a job that is good for me. Troughout my life I changed professions several times. Everytime I was dissatisfied with the job I was doing I looked for another one that might satisfy me instead.

Recently I realized everytime I was looking for another profession I always said to myself it has to be something I'm passionate about. But over the course of time I also realized that I'm not really that passionate about something that I wouldn't want to do anything else. I came to the conclusion that maybe not everyone has to have a passion to be happy in their job and that I might be more successful in finding a suitable profession if I knew what I was good at. (In short, looking for something that suits my strengths rather than my desires)

So I thought about my strengths, weaknesses and preferences in order to find professions where I could unfold my potential:

- I don't like talking in front of many people
- I prefer routine over ever-changing circumstances
- routine is good but repetitiveness bores me
- I'm not good at working under pressure
- I'm somewhat good at cheering people up
- I'm good at expressing myself (at least in my native language which is German)
- I'm a good listener
- I'm empathic
- I would neither describe myself as very communicative nor shy
- I don't like making choices with big consequences
- I prefer working with small groups of people or on my own over having to work with bigger crowds
- a friendly and harmonic environment is importamt to me
- I like financial stability (who doesn't, I know... but I probably prefer being employed like most other people than being self-employed)
- I'm somewhat sensitive
- In my leisure time I read, do sports, play videogames and watch movies

Can anyone help and tell me what professions suit that character/skill profile?",03Jun2020,1
936,"I am trying to maintain work, school, and family projects all at once but I can’t succeed. I constantly get talked down by my parents because I am unable to hold all the responsibilities at once. I try my hardest to keep a balance of all three, but I always let one fall at the end. My parents have always been hard workers who can do everything, but I am nothing like them. My father is in the same boat like me, but he seems to have no problems.

My parents are trying to build a car dealership which is great, but of course my family is not paying someone to do the labor work he has my the family to do that. At first I had no problem in helping them, but as time went by I had focus more on my school and work. I began to miss workdays with my family which pissed them off and later they began to bombardment of how irresponsible I am to not have time to help them. I am a full time student who works full time as well, I barely have time for myself. At most i play one hour a day and continue my study. I am asking for some advice on how to better my time for all three. I am not very smart which is why I spend a lot of time studying, I have to work to pay my bills, and my family is trying to build a business which I wish to be a part of one day.",03Jun2020,1
937,"Back when I was younger in grade school I didn't care about others, health, wellbeing, emotions. I got what I wanted I lied to people to teachers got suspended and expelled on death threats, as I got older mainly in highschool I met someone close.

I also had adhd but on as 3rd diagnosis a different doctor said I didn't and took me off meds, so I started daydreaming getting close and being human stopped manipulating stopped lying to get small things I stopped it. Right now I think I finally broke out of this haze this day dream this fairy tail.

It took me 5 years but I still just morals now, I want to go back to how I was when I didn't. To how I was before in grade school it seems easier. Although I don't know how to do so does anyone have any advice for it

Edit: look I'm not trying to be an edgelord even if that is what I sound like I just don't want to be depressed, angry, or even happy just neutral, buddhism shares a similar principle in holding things in an equal value but for me I just want to loose the way the current me is and idk how",03Jun2020,1
938,"I was all pumped to get my haircut today. 
It had grown pretty long and I knew I wanted to chop a good bit off. 
I thought I explained to the hairstylist exactly what I wanted and the length I wanted. As she was cutting, I realized it had gotten shorter than I originally wanted it to be. Ahhh. What can you say or do at that point, right?!😬 

Anyways, she was all finished and I thanked her. 
As I walked out the door, I felt so disappointed.
It was about 2 inches shorter than I wanted it to be. 
This has happened to me before, with other stylists, when I come out with a haircut that’s just shorter than I wanted. 

Maybe I need to just say a trim next time, so they won’t cut too much off. Ugh. 

Anyways... I can’t say I hate, but I don’t love it. 
I wish I did. It might grow on me in the upcoming weeks. We’ll see.

941,"So I’ve been going to this maths teachers tuition for 8 years now. He’s taught my siblings, and many of my cousins. So my family has known him for about 10-15 years.

Firstly, he has a good track record. Most student he teaches, they gets A’s

My opinion about him : he’s an arrogant little shit. He says he is the best, and even demands his students to call him ‘Master’ (which I’ve never done, nor will I ever)
He’s always talking about how he has to ‘save the day’. One example he gives is - when people apply to universities, they ask him for help. “Oh so many people come to my house and ask me for my help, there’s usually lines of people, all waiting for me”
Another example he gives - “ a girl’s grades were getting bad, and she had a lot of family visiting her house. Her mother came crying to me for help, she didn’t know what to do, then I spoke to her father, and he said he didn’t know how to tell his family to stop coming. So one I day I went to their house and sat down. They all sat in a circle around me while I talked, and I told them that they need to stop, so this girl could focus”

Firstly, what sort of dad doesn’t have the balls to tell his family to stop coming to his house because his daughter needs to revise, and secondly, wouldn’t the family know??

The guy has pictures of himself hung around his house holding all these trophies. 

“So many people come for my help”

Imma be honest, he’s getting fewer and fewer people joining, and he lets people join, teaches them, gets the money from teaching them, and then 6 months before the exam, if he thinks they will do shit, he’ll make an excuse to kick them out.

One of my cousins left him, because of how arrogant he is. I mean, that cousin dropped doing maths, but the guy is just so full of himself. My sister also went to him, and he always says how my sister is the perfect student; this means that he has a lot of hope for me. 

My parents also doesn’t like him. None of the family like him

What he also does is try to make lessons funny, so he will make jokes which aren’t even funny, and loads of people laugh at them. I’m the only person who doesn’t laugh at his jokes, and he takes notice of this. 
I just want him to bloody teach, enough with the shit jokes man, I’m paying to help myself excel, not hear about your failed comedy career. 

Loads of people laugh because they are scared of him. One thing he does, is shout. If you get something wrong, or don’t know anything, he’ll shout at you. He claims he doesn’t shout at somebody for not knowing answers, but he does; also, he doesn’t give people time to work questions out. 

But, I’m not gonna lie, when I was younger, I was a really dumb kid, like I didn’t understand anything with maths. So my school teachers would scream and shout in my face, so shouting won’t faze me. (Then I moved school, and had a new maths teacher, who actually cared about students, and then I sorta became good at maths)

That brings us to now. A few months ago my GCSES (UK Exams) got cancelled, because COVID, so I didn’t need to attend classes. I intend on doing Alevel maths, and he told me and a few other classmates.

He would teach alevel classes over Skype, and I asked whether I can just attend in September, and he said no, because he’s teaching now, and doesn’t want to reteach all the content again (However, hes said one of my classmates is coming in September, and will “cover up all the classes he’s missed”)

This is in March, 
So he teaches me my first lesson, and then asks whether I can also do tomorrow evening, and I say I can’t do evenings, he asks why, we have a little argument, and I say I’ll come another day. So ever since then, I’ve been doing these classes during the day. He said that “when schools open up, and you go back to school, classes will be in the evening” but, since my exams got cancelled - I’m not going back to school until September. 

Today he messaged saying classes are now in the evening, from 7-8:40pm. I’ve said I wouldn’t be able to attend, and he said why (firstly, I don’t need to explain myself to him) but I said I help make dinner, and eat it during this time. Then he said, “you’ll have to leave the tuition”, I then asked whether there is another day he can do, and he said he can’t do during the day because he has to teach at school (what school, the guy is like 70 years old, and only year 6 (grade 5) is going back to school)

I don’t want to do evening classes, because who wants to work in the evenings, I’m tired man, it’s not convenient, and it’ll be hard to focus, plus I just don’t wanna do evenings. 

So  he ultimatum is, that I leave, or I attend evening classes. Ultimately, I’m probably going to attend evening classes, BUT, he knows (in the most humblest way I can say) I’m the smartest in the class. I know and he knows it. When he’s shouting at the class because they don’t know the answer, I’m always the one to raise my hand and answer it.  I carry the class. 

Just had to get this off my chest, what do you think of the situation",03Jun2020,1
943,"Hey everyone. I will try to keep this short.

Some years ago while I was 20 I went to a party with my friends. At the time I had a boyfriend who I'm still with. I used to be quite friendly with guys but always made a point about telling pretty much every guy I met that I was taken (I did not want them to get the wrong idea). In retrospect I could have toned down my personality a bit as to avoid these types of situation.   


I talked to my friends boss and his friend most of the party. I remember talking about my boobs (I know this is inappropriate now) but not openly flirting or anything like that. I was and am used to my friends where we speak about anything openly. Anyway I got quite drunk. I asked my friend if the people I were talking to were ""good guys"" and he assured me that they were. Later in the evening we (me and boss) went to the bathroom together (I never used to go alone at parties). The details of what happened are quite blurry but I remember him coming on to me very strongly (trying to touch and talking really suggestive/dirty). I got out of the bathroom and sat down for the rest of the party. 

&amp;#x200B;

When he and the other guy left I told the rest of the people there and they kinda glossed over it. I have never talked to my friend about this after the party. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very afraid of meeting the boss again and avoid every interaction this can happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really need advice as to how to define what happened to maybe be able to let it go. I don't know how to brand it or how to talk about it and I don't know if I should take it up with my friend again if it is not a big deal. Please help me, how do I get closure?",03Jun2020,1

945,"I've been married for 2 1/2 years, and together with my husband for 4 1/2. For context, I am 44 years old, and he is 50. 

We should probably never have married. He is a tradesman (A/C) and I have a master's degree. We rarely have intellectual or spiritual discussions, and he is largely emotionless - not sure if this is normal - he's Hispanic.

I've kept in touch with a friend from grad school, who lives outside of Buffalo (I'm in Orlando), and he's been a great sounding board for me. I have been considering leaving my husband for him, so I can have a deeper relationship with a partner. To make love, not have sex. To be in love. To have desire for someone because I'm attracted to them intellectually.

It would be a huge gamble to take - quitting my job, moving, finding a place to live (I'm a homeowner), and renting an apartment. Then of course I'd have to find a job, which can be hard for me due to my job hopping and mental illness (Bipolar Disorder). I'm properly medicated and I'm in therapy, FWIW. Any advice? Everything is telling me to stay put in Florida, but I'm not in love with my husband. I care about him, I don't desire him.

947,"I live in an apartment complex alone with my cat. I like to let her out on the patio when she wants to go out (I live on the top floor) and because I’ve been working from home I’ve been doing it quite often.

Well one evening while I’m out for a smoke my neighbor approaches me from her patio and immediately starts asking about my cat. She says she sees her from her window (when my cat is outside) and likes to talk to her. She *really* wants to take my cat out for a walk and asks for my number.

Now... things I’ve noticed about my neighbor since she’s moved in next door:

-She usually has most of her windows open throughout the week.

-She has quite a few plants on her patio as well as a fire pit that I’ve seen her use outside.

-She leaves fruits outside (watermelon/pineapple)

-She has a stripper pole

-The rare times I’ve seen her out on the patio (either lounging or tending to her plants) she’s wearing a g-string bikini

I know those last parts sound like I’m perving on her but I swear I’m not. I’m simply making observations that will actually tie in later here in a bit.

So I’m curious and she’s actually quite fit and attractive so I agree since it might be good for my cat and so that I can get to know her. Mind you, she hasn’t asked much about me. In fact, I had to introduce myself and ask for *her* name. No big deal though, just another observation.

Anyways we meet outside on the ground by the plants and trees. I have my cat on a harness and leash and it’s around noon next day, so sunny and hot. I share that I’ve taken my cat to the vet to get shots for possible allergies and she immediately responds, “No! She just needs to be outside in the sun!” Hmm, okay... getting anti-vax vibes but whatever.

She then tells me that she’s outside a lot doing yoga and meditation (she looks heavily tanned) and she claims other people’s dog run up to her cause they sense her energy... uh huh...

She asks if she can hold the leash to my cat and I oblige. We get to talking more and I find out she leaves those fruits outside so that they can absorb the sun rays... She’s also saying that the heat will kill viruses when I show concern about my cat getting sick (cause she’s mainly a house cat).

So at this point I’m noticing all these red flags about her. She’s obsessed with the sun and quite frankly she’s coming across as very ego-centric. My cat starts to pant in the shade and comes to me so I decide to call it (we were out for 30min or so) and as we’re returning to our homes she’s asking if she can take my cat out for walks by herself in the future. I told her I’d think about it...

So what can I do about this? I’m obviously not comfortable with her, someone I just met, taking my cat out for walks. She asked today if she could do so before she had to head out and I just told her my cat was asleep. Is there a way I can tell her I don’t trust her without making her feel bad?

TL;DR - My neighbor is sun nut-job obsessed with wanting to walk my cat while it’s sunny and I don’t trust her but I’m not sure what to tell her without insulting her. What to do?",03Jun2020,2

950,"How do you deal with lazy people living with you? 
My elder sister is 28 this year and she never once helped with the household chores. She recently came back from the States because of covid and she has never once helped to wash the plates or even do her own laundry. My mum would always catch her forgetting to off the light, the fan, or even locking our house gate. Every time when we pack food, she would just leave her box on the table and metal spoon in it. Doesn't even bother to throw it in the dustbin. 
When we placed the takeaway plastic below the items with sauce in case of spillage. She would give an excuse that the plastic bag to throw her box away is being used. I once ate super fast and left the box in the plastic bag thinking oh maybe this time she would help to throw the rubbish away. No. 
She did not even put the box in the plastic bag. My sister has a bad habit of drinking one sip of water out of the bottle and leaving on the table and the water just smells foul. She has another bad habit which is placing her used surgical mask literally anywhere. On the dining table, kitchen, study desk, sofa anywhere you name it you would see her soiled mask. Like it's so disgusting and unhygienic. My mum and I don't understand her behavior.  
Sometimes when my mum catches her not turning off the fan, she would take a picture and send it in to the group chat lol. My mum sometimes would embarrass her especially when she is on the phone with her friends or boyfriend by going into her room and nag at her. 

Can someone please give me some advice on how I can deal with this lazy person?",03Jun2020,2

956,"The title pretty much says it all but I’ll give you more backstory just in case.

So my parent dog (a Yorky terrier mini)gets awful eye buggers that solidify making it impossible for her to open her eyes without someone cleaning them every single morning. The eye buggers are so bad that if they aren’t soften with some warm water first she cannot open her eyes even if someone manually separates them.

This is a problem because it doesn’t allow her to move around freely. She is constantly hitting walls and obstacles and has to walk very slow at all times. She also gets very confused when she hears loud noises as she cannot see what’s going on.

Note: I usually clean her eyes with a warm green tea bag as napkins tend to make the matter worse and she seems to find warm towels too harsh.

Recently I’ve been house sitting my parents house and the dog as well. As I have lots of time on my hands I’ve been cleaning her eyes every morning and applying some dog eye drops prescribed by a vet. However, no matter how clean I leave them she always gets them as bad as before the next morning. 

It hurts me a lot to see the dog like this specially because as I clean her eyes I can see a pretty thick layer of buggers that cover her eye ball. My parents have accepted that the dog is blind as they don’t have enough time to clean her eyes every day. Also, given that the dog is around 13 years old they think it’s normal.

Im not sure if there’s anything I can do for her to get a more permanent solution as I cannot really afford the vet for her and neither do my parents. 

I also cannot take the dog to my own house to take care of her as I don’t have the room for her (I rent a room in my boyfriend’s parents house and they own a big Labrador puppy that’s exited all the time).

973,"I work as a fraud investigator for an insurance company. Last year I was extremely overworked and kept asking management if they were going to hire an additional investigator to help cover my territory. Ultimately they did, but it was by downsizing another department (still a fraud investigation department) And took one of the guys from there and made him my new counterpart. I did my best to train him, mentor him and explain that in this new role timeliness and a sense of urgency were important.  I thought that there were other people who would have been a better fit for this position and I was not consulted with regarding this new “help“.
Since that time I have gotten multiple complaints from People stating that they were not satisfied with his work product and although it was specifically about him, I feel like it is hurting my specific department.
Should I bring this up to my superior? I have tried to tell the new guy to do things a certain way but it doesn’t seem to be taking.

They want me to work at a small business chain owned by a family friend but I have numerous traumatic memories surrounding that place. I have PTSD and this place triggers these traumatic memories as well as nightmares and occasionally sleep paralysis. But my parent doesn’t really gaf. Whenever the subject comes up they accuse me of being ungrateful and say that they’ve offered for me to work there but I don’t want to because “it’s not good enough” despite my counselor, therapist, psychiatrist, caseworker, and family therapist as well as me all telling them multiple times that I don’t choose to not work there but really it’s more like I CANT because of the amount of trauma it brings back for me. My sibling is working there now and it’s really upsetting to see them get to do this and make money and be praised etc. while I can’t. I’ve had many offers to work at different places and I really want to but my parent keeps refusing to let me take them up or coming up with some sort of reason for why it won’t work.

986,"This is hella long, just a warning. It’s like a shitty life story, so TL;DR at bottom if you’d like, if not, then enjoy I guess. 

So I’m 14M (15 in 3 days) and live in Canada. This paragraph is all for context, so if you don’t want to read this then you don’t have to. My parents separated in March of 2017 and announced they were getting divorced in November of 2017. Of course I was devastated, and fairly pissed too. Just for some background, my dad is a cheater. I don’t go around telling people this because it’s personal, but nobody I know has my Reddit so this should be fine. Anyway, so he’s cheated on my mom multiple times, and even had a baby with another woman behind my moms back by accident when I was 4, and the woman almost convinced him to leave us and start a family with her. My mom kept forgiving him but finally gave up after he did it again (cheated, not the baby part) and he refused to end the relationship. Makes sense, right? Anyway, so they separate and yadayadayada. Well, me being the snoopy 11 year old I was, found out he had cheated when I overheard my parents arguing after their separation. They tried to keep the convo hidden from me, but I overheard and confronted my mom later who had to bring in my dad to tell me (and my older brother who I told after I became suspicious) after he had just left before that. Anyway, my dad used sentences like “she allowed herself to become pregnant” and bullshit to make himself seem like a good guy when explaining to us what happened. Years later I found out he was planning on lying to us until my mom made him tell us everything, as she doesn’t believe in lies, and my younger brother still doesn’t know any of this. So of course I hated him for a while, but things got better, then worse... so here we are now. 

Here’s where things kind of begin. So less than a year after separation, my dad gets a girlfriend. Of course, he doesn’t tell us, and I found out by reading a gross text on his phone about how she loved making out with him and all that shit. I almost texted her back calling her a whore and stuff (I know... I was angry, but I didn’t do it), and my dad got pissed at me that I “snooped” even though he asked me to use his phone for directions and it popped up at the top. Don’t remember much directly after that, but fast forward to last year. Things start getting shitty between us. Firstly, I should probably mentioned that he took us all out for dinner right after the separation and trash talked my mom behind her back to all of us, and when I started crying and asking him to stop, he screamed at me to screw off. Anyway, he’s started name calling again last year. He’s called me an asshole and he’s told me to burn in hell when he doesn’t get what he wants. He even called me a coward because I didn’t want to visit him when covid started (he’s an emergency doc and is exposed to a lot of it). He also knows I hate his girlfriend (I don’t have a good reason.. just instinct), but doesn’t respect my wishes and puts her before me. He rolled down the window to talk to her when she drove by our car multiple times, he brings her and her kids into our backyard while I’m at his home, he gives her kids the praise and attention that I should be receiving (talks about how he’s proud of them, how great they are, etc. ) and when I tell him how he talking to her with me present makes me uncomfortable, he says that not talking to her would be “inhumane and hurtful” (does he not get it? he’s literally doing that to me...). I even set a boundary when we were attending my grandfathers funeral in March that she doesn’t come near me and introduce herself to me. He said he wouldn’t do that to her or ask her to do anything like that, but luckily my mom was there when I asked him (she came to the dinner to tell us about the death) and told him he has to respect my wishes, so he said he would talk to her. Now, I don’t trust my dad anymore, and I’ve got good reasons not to, so I knew something bad would still happen. Firstly, I could already tell this woman was a bitch (sorry) once the funeral started, as she was rubbing my younger brother in front of my mom to make her jealous, and was making sure he was warm and comfortable at the funeral (she already knows my brothers and they’re fine with her). She was also joking with my older brother in front of my mom. Who would do any of that? I knew I was next... I would be her next victim. So, I spent the whole burial beside my mom and wouldn’t leave her side, as I knew this woman wouldn’t dare approach her. It worked! Sort of... all was fine right until the end. I was with my grandmother and my mom when my mom stepped into the car to leave. Showtime! I was about to get in the car too when suddenly, out of nowhere, she appears! What a fucking surprise! She introduces herself and makes it very clear she’s dating my father, and then expresses her condolences even though I SPECIFICALLY asked my dad to tell her not to. And, as you can probably guess, when I confronted my dad about it, he rubbed it off. He said it was fine and she wanted to be nice and blah blah blah. Unbelievable. Now, this is only my relationship with my dad. I’m not going into detail, but he is HORRID to my mom too. She wanted a nice, friendly divorce, but he wants otherwise. His girlfriend is a lawyer, so we already know she’s giving him all sorts of ideas to make her life a living hell, and to get her out of the picture for good. He’s now trying to take everything from her. He’s forcing her to sell our house (I grew up in it) just because he owns half of it and wants the money, he’s put our family in debt and put it under her name so she has to deal with it and pay it off (she doesn’t work... she’s a stay at home mom, and it’s a lot of freaking money). Also, now that my brothers back from university, he’s somehow got him living at his house now and is trying to find ways to pay less child support to my mom (again, she doesn’t work), and now I barely get to see my older brother, but maybe we’ll save those details for another post. 

So you’re probably wondering... okay, we get it, that’s a lot of shit. What do you need advice with? Everything. He’s asked my mom to sell the house right around my birthday (fucking jerk move), and I’m the only one who knows about it in my family, other than him and my mom, so I feel like I’m the only one who can stop it. I’m supposed to move on and build a relationship with him, but I hate him so much! How can I make things better when I hate him so fucking much... I’m lost. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried talking with him about these things and telling him what I’m upset about, but knowing my dad he’s not going to fix anything because nothing is his fault and he always finds a way to defend his actions or shift blame. It’s impossible to talk to him too because it’s like talking to a wall, he doesn’t listen. We’re going to try family therapy, but some how our family therapist ALWAYS takes his side, saying things like I should get over the girlfriend and start a relationship with her, or that I need to move past the things he’s done to hurt me so that I can accept him and start moving on. I’ve always wanted a kind, fun, normal dad, but I’m stuck with a narcissistic asshole. I’m sorry if any of this sounded harsh and somehow offended you because I should respect my father, but how can I? He’s the worst man I know. So, what do you suggest I do? Thanks for reading, sorry that it was long. The only possible good I can take away from this is that I’m going to be the father that I’ve always wanted... for my kids. 

TL;DR: My dads a cheater, a liar, and a narcissist. He got a girlfriend after divorce, and now puts her and her kids wishes ahead of mine. He hates my mom, who’s an amazing, friendly, kind woman (and a stay at home mom), and is trying to take everything from her (house, putting his debt under her name, taking my older brother) even though she’s never done anything to him. I’m expected to move on and fix relationship with him... but I hate him and nothings been working. Need advice. Thanks.",03Jun2020,1

They're both mentally ill (depression + ocd) and totally neglect their flat. The last time I visited them I couldn't even find a clean plate to eat from and there is dust everywhere. It's repulsing me and I try to avoid their flat.

Last time I visited them, I realized how bad they are doing. They're both ill and making each other worse because they have to deal with each other's mental illness. Also, they didn't really chat about any normal topics but just about death and how unfair the world is. Idk, it just wasn't a healthy conversation.

I'm making my own money now and I'm obviously not planing to move in with them again. However, it makes me nervous to know that I don't have a place to ""crash"". I'm wondering at friends who visit their parents regularly, sleep at their house and stay over the holidays. Their parents have clean flats/houses and they actually spend time with their parents and cook/eat together. I have never really eaten together with my parents since I learnt to cook for myself. I just feel really lost. I wish I had normal parents to whom I could return in case something happens or if I just want to chill for a few days.

Of course I'm an adult and have to care for myself. However, I envy people who could just live with their parents for a few weeks/months if something goes wrong (e.g. they change studies in college and move back home for a few weeks or they went through a bad breakup and return home for a few days. I just really wish I had that 'backup' and sense of family. I don't even trust my parents because they're both mentally ill and can't even properly care for themselves. I know they love me and I love them but I'm just not comfortable around them/in their flat.

998,"Backstory:

I'm an Asian immigrant. I went to school here in the states on and off in 2000s. In 2013 I came back, finished my school and got my first job in the states and been living here ever since.

I have a pretty weird sense of humor, pretty offensive and sexual at times. However, I only make these kind of jokes with people I'm comfortable with. 

During my first job, I was pretty close with some of my co-workers. They made fun of me for being Asian and my accent. I was and still am okay with that. One of them was an African american older gentleman (10 years older than me). I called him ""blacky"". In my limited English vocabulary and my limited understanding of American culture (esp African American culture), I called him blacky as a term of endearment, a cute nickname. He never called me out on it. He called me Panda and Girl (I'm a gay man). This was our dynamic and this was the dynamic with few other co-workers that I was close with as well. The other co-workers were not black, but we'd still make racial jokes of each other and they'd made fun of me and my Asian background/accent. 

Eventually he and I left the company and went our separate ways. Our last contact was 5-6 years ago. And yes, I still referred to him as Blacky and he was like ""Girll.... how are you"". I didn't think much of it at the time and life went on


Years went by, I never thought of him or that conversation again. For the past few years, I have assimilated more into American Culture. I've made more black friends and have had much more conversation of the history of racism in this country. I have much better understanding of the history of African American in this country now.

For the past week, with what's been going on, I have read a lot of news about racism against African American. All of a sudden, he popped up in my head and the nickname I gave him. Everything just came rushing back. I was horrified and am still horrified by what I called him. There was def a language and cultural barrer but it was not an excuse for me to do what I did.

Now the guilt lingers on. I am part of the problem black people are facing. He was the only black person I've ever called ""blacky"".I am absolutely disgusted at myself for ever calling him in that. It wasn't endearing, it was degrading. 

I've also started noticing more and more how Asian in Asia tend to make fun of black people for the color of their skin. Some Asian countries still do blackface as part of their comedy sketch.

Do I know better now? 100%. Absolutely.  the guilt is eating me up. I wanna call him up and apologize but after 5-6 years with no contact, would this be even a good idea?

1013,"Hello reddit I need some advice on fixing a garage door.


So what happen is that the torsion spring on my garage door had broken and cables had snaped on my garage door.

My garage door isn't in the best shape we've had it for about 15 years.


So I called up a garage door repair company and apparently they quoted me $900 to repair it.

They told me apparently that they couldn't just replace the springs and the wires.
That they would also have to replace the track and the rollers on the garage door.


So I was wondering would I be able to just do the repair myself if it's just a broken spring and cable.

I've seen a video on YouTube that makes it look really easy but is there something that would make it really difficult for someone like me to do 

The garage door I have  uses a bar to tighten the springs on the door. If that give you any context on what door I have.

From what it looks like I could get the parts for around $150 unless I'm mistaken.

The parts I would need are a
- .225 x 2 x 27 torsion spring
-a pair of 7 feet garage door cables 
-tools to help with the repair 


While I understand the tracks are bad and would cause the rollers to pop out. I feel like I could probably do that at a later date to get that repaired.  my main focus is just getting the garage door to open and close.


I feel like that guy is definitely over quoting me. 
And after researching it it looks easy.

So I do the repair myself or so I consider having the repair company do it?",03Jun2020,1

I have an ex who broke up with me around february, nothing really crazy happened in the breakup and she said she really wants to stay friends. I agreed. Of course things were hard after that but we managed to somehow work things out and somewhat be friends. Quarantine started and we were talking a lot through the phone. But eventially we takled less and less untill we completely stopped talking. After quarantine we had to see each other again and stuff got weird between us. Our talks became less of a talk and more of an awkward little conversation. Talking to her feels awful and fake at the moment and its really stressing me out, I dont like it and I actually prefer us not being friends than whats happening now. I really want to just settle things and tell her its weird and I cant really handle it, but at the same time I cant even send her a text message because im somehow afraid. What should I do?

1018,"In my family, we receive gifts for graduation. I  told my father that I really wanted him to give me a watch when I graduated high school. In my mind, having a nice watch is the symbol of being an adult. Both of my older siblings were gifted nice watches when they hit certain milestones, and I wanted to be a part of the family tradition. I also thought it'd be nice to have something to pass down to my children, like an heirloom. 

Just as I asked, my father gave me a very nice watch. I loved it. I wore it often, except in situations where I was scared it might get stolen. I took good care of it. However, once I moved out of my college dorm room freshman year I lost track of it. I had combed through my room several times before moving out and didn't see it - but I also had no memory of putting it away. It's like it vanished. I haven't seen it since.

It's been over a year since that incident and I have not managed to track down the watch. Part of me believes it must be buried somewhere - but another part of me is painfully aware of the amount of items that I've donated as I've moved from place to place in the past two years, and how the watch could possibly have been hidden in one of those items. So chances are, its probably long gone. The guilt of losing has been eating away at me - it was one of the most important things I've ever owned.

My dad has asked a few times why I'm not wearing my watch and I just lie to him and tell him that I want to keep it safe at home. I know the right time to tell him would have been when I lost it - but he barely respects me as an adult as it is, even though I'm 20 and have living on my own for two years. I was scared that this will just convince him that I'm not responsible enough to take care of anything important - and I still am. So I procrastinated until I was sure that it gone, because I didn't want to go through this whole thing and then find it buried underneath a pillow two weeks later. Then, I just kept putting it off.

I know I have to tell him eventually, but when? And is there a way to do it without seeming like an incompetent child who doesn't care enough about their belongings to keep track of them?",03Jun2020,2
1022,"Title says it all. This situation involves my girlfriend and a separate friend of hers 

Months ago all 4 of us (me, my friend (M), my gf and her friend (F)) were really good friends. We played videogames together and had a jolly time. 

Then my friend decided to show his true colors to everyone. He started doing unwanted advances on my gf and her friend. So all 3 of us decided to cut ties with him. Luckily me and my gf live in a different city as both of our friends, so our safety was relatively guaranteed. 

However, he said that he was going to come and live in the same city as me and my gf. That same day we spoke with a police officer. She said that all 3 of us needed to make it clear in text that we didnt want to have any sort of contact with him again, and if he contacted us again, we would proceed. And so we did, and for the last couple of months, our minds were at ease. We blocked him in some social media apps, but not all, so as to give him a ""chance"" to contact us.

Today I checked my phone's blocked messages (apparently my samsung phone saves messages from blocked numbers?), and there I saw it, on may 25th, I received a message from him.

""I heard you lost your job and you have to move, need any help?""

My heart skipped a beat. Hes offering help? Does that mean he's already in the city? If I respond, would he be able to triangulate my location? 

I'm fucking scared man. I know the answer is obvious, call the police right? With everything happening around the US right now, the last thing I want to do is be with a police officer (I'm latino).

1024,"Anxiety, depression, low self esteem, abuse, leukaemia and a breakup

As outlandish as it might sound those are all things Ive gone through within the last few years, right now I’m 16 and I have no goals or even any motivation to make one and I feel lost, like I’m wandering around in life without a purpose. My anxiety and depression mostly stem from my abusive father whom I lived with for most of my life, he left two years ago now after an incident with the police, but he’s not the only reason, all throughout my time in school I’ve been bullied. There isn’t one year of school I can think of where I didn’t have a bully. One time it was a girl and it’s crazy how much shit you get for hitting back, even from teachers. Ultimately these events led to me leaving school altogether and now I’m legally homeschooled but I learn fuck all (not that I even have the motivation to when I get the opportunity). 

March last year I was diagnosed with AML which is a form of leukaemia particularly rare for my age, as you can tell it didn’t kill me but who knows, might still happen. I was stuck in hospital for 6 months straight, only being allowed to leave for two days at the end of every month. So in six months I left the hospital for a grand total of 12 days, not even two weeks. After all the treatments and whatnot I was left as frail as a dry twig and still to this day I haven’t fully recovered. Also me being in hospital placed my mum and dad in the same room once again which led to conflict. Couldn’t even put their differences aside for their half-dead son. 

Take a guess how many of my “friends” texted me in that whole time. Ten? Five? Nope, one. One single person that entire time told me I’d get through it, and out of everyone it was my ex (I’ve only had two partners). More people asked if my mother was okay. “Forget about the boy with cancer, how’s his mother?” Ridiculous.

The most recent shitty event in my life however was my breakup which happened last month. We ran out of things to talk about during the quarantine and she said she needed to “work on herself” which is the most cliché breakup line out there. So now on top of all the prior bullshit I get that awful unloved feeling, like I wasn’t good enough. No matter what you say in those situations, you won’t be spared from that feeling. Didn’t help much when my “four months together” event on my calendar popped up like a week after we split. 

To cap off the shitshow, I nearly offed myself with bleach. The bottle was in my hands but I’m too much of a pussy which for the first time ever was arguably a good thing. I guess I’ve just had enough. I really don’t want to live anymore. Coming here was sort of a last ditch attempt at some positivity in my life but I’m not expecting much. At this point idk what can help me. If anyone tries to make me feel better then I appreciate you, you’re a good person but if you pass this over I wouldn’t blame you. It’s a long read anyway. I guess I’ll put a tl:dr then. 

TL:DR - all of these events combined have left me feeling worthless, helpless and aimless. Kinda wanna kms. I’d just like some help or advice.",03Jun2020,1

And me and this girl starts dating and almost immediately when I did this my friend starts acting really strange she doesn't respond on the phone, and when she does she ends the conversation as fast as possible.

Yesterday my girlfriend messaged me about a debate topic we have between each other which usually ends in argument because of our differing views. It got to the point where she was crying and messaging 'Im sorry I can't do this anymore', and 'I'm so Sorry' and 'It hurts me the way you think'. She said 'I cant do this anymore' a fair bit, and when I asked her what she meant and if she were ending the relationship over our difference in views she never specifcially said no but just said 'Im so Sorry' so i interpreted it as she was ending the relationship. Tbh i don't know how else to interpret that but that is another advice post haha.

So then I get really pissed off thinking that after all the stuff weve went through she would end it over that. (Up to this point we had just exited a break which was her idea and I've stuck with her through mental health issues so it upset me that i thought she would end it over something seemingly as insignificant as this). So the message I sent her says things like :'The relationship was always secondary to you' 'You always put yourself first and never consider my feelings'. but the worst thing I said was 'I loved you, I thought if wed stick through our differences it would turn out great' Because I said 'Loved' instead of 'Love' Tbh I don't know why i said Loved. When I sent this i was completely shut down and was incredibly apathetic, so i sent her that in order to be mean, even if I feel as though those things were true to an extent, I shouldn't have said it in such a harsh way. (There was a lot more little things but those were the main ones)

After this she was broken, because I'd apparently misinterpreted the situation and said those things for no reason. How do I earn back her trust because now she thinks that I think all these negative things about the relationship? and how do I make it up to her seeing as though I said so many horrible things?

1057,"My problem is that i constantly depend on my relationships with other, like i'm always thinking 24 hours a day about the relationship i have with others, i really want to fix this, like not making it something that is always on my mind. By always thinking about my relationship with others, i'm not focusing on other things, and i constantly feel jealousy, anger, lack of affection etc... I'm always imprisoned by my thoughts and it's so painful not to be able to get rid of this. I, most of the time, have difficulties to focus on the present moment because of that. For example i constantly feel the need to fall in love with other girls because i don't find life worth living if you don't have someone to love (and this is only one of many examples that are constantly present in my head), lot of people told me to try to focus on myself but i don't know how to do that because i've never done it before... If anyone can help me, i'll be very grateful",03Jun2020,1

I’ve been dating a guy for almost 2 months and while we’re intimate he tells me he loves me (like a lot!!) how he’s so in love with me, how he loves me more. The whole thing. 

I asked him if he really meant it, so I would know if it’s just something he’s saying during sex or if he really feels it. He told me over and over that he means it. 

I sent him a text after that yesterday saying I love you and he responded with “Babe those words are strong” and “I say them sometimes during sex just cuz they come out, I don’t wanna rush saying that you know?” 

I’m honestly heartbroken right now... I don’t know if I’m over reacting or what, that that hurt me so bad to read.",03Jun2020,1
1060,"So I have been friends with this girl for like 2 years. Recently, she started acting a tad weird and started saying stuff to me that I didn't ask like what she was eating etc. I messaged her a week ago saying if she had feelings for me and she said that it is a solid maybe...more to yes but she needed time to reassure her feelings for me. Recently, we were talking about it and she asked me if I would be wanting to date because she was scared that I would be jumping into something that I am not ready for (I have never been in a date). She said she would let me know when she is ready.
I got two questions?
1) how likely do you think we would start dating from this
2) what should I do in this situation...like not message her at all, give her space and let her think and when she is ready, she will message me?
Also, I oughta point out that this will be a long distance relationship if that helps
Thanks a lot guys. A friend of mine mentioned that I am really close to having my first relationship and...I am both scared and excited but I need opinions because I don't wanna screw it up",03Jun2020,1
1061,"I’m a 21 year old male and I’ve lived in the same apartment for two years. My roommates and I started out fine but things went south when my roommates gf started hanging around more. She befriended my other roommates gf and they formed a pretty mean spirited clique of people (all 21 btw for context). It started subtly at first but it soon became pretty clear to me that anything I had to say whether it be a joke or anything of interest was unwelcome. As time went on she got more aggressive to the point of actual yelling and insulting. At one point she drunkenly started berating me at a party and I had had enough. I haven’t spent a second with them since then and things have been remarkably positive. But for my fourth roommate they have not been. The other day everyone was sharing their relationship experiences and when he thought he could share she called him disgusting and harassed him into leaving, accusing him of TMI. We’re all moving out soon and I can’t help but wonder because neither of us ever figured out: How do you stop someone like that?",03Jun2020,3

Anyway I’ve been going through community college and planning to transfer to a 4 year college after and I’m majoring in the film industry.

1067,"Towards the end of March I was laid off from my job of which I had done for about 3 Years. It was because COVID-19 made it so the company I worked for which is a printing company had barely any new orders coming in. They said it was only temporary but we are already in June and they say it is still going slow.

From the time I was laid off I applied for unemployment, of which I have received nothing so far. I have also been applying for new work too. Of which none have hired me when they have sometimes told me over the interview that I'd be perfect for the jobs. I'm getting really frustrated.

In the meantime I was able to get signed up for delivering food with UberEats and DoorDash but they don't provide benefits, and the pay and work isn't consistent. I also have been working part-time at an amazon warehouse since November but its in the evenings and I'm not permitted to get more than 30 hours in a work week with them. I'm doing good to even get 20 hours from them.

And to top it off. Before all of this happened I had gotten engaged and had planned to be married in May. Now May is gone and my Fiancee is upset because I haven't been able to get something and its been putting a strain on things because me having full-time work and benefits is a requirement for us from her Mom because her Dad passed away a year before we met, and its one from her too because we need to be able to pay the bills together when married and have stability. We even had it figured out for living conditions. That's all gone now.

I have my Bachelors in Fine Art and went to school for making games and 3D animations but its been so long since I worked on my portfolio that I feel like I'm behind. I'm at a loss on what to do and I'm frustrated because I feel like my life has been put on hold until I can get this resolved. I know people who are younger than me who are married, have kids, full careers, and they have their own place. Yet here I am, 30, living with my grandparents, and feeling like a failure at life because I can't get started now.

I don't know what to do. Can anyone please give me some advice and/or maybe point me in the right direction?",03Jun2020,1
1068,"Hey, is there a way to convince her I am eating enough? I researched the subject in multiple sites and apps and used reliable sources. But, my mom remains unfazed and says it is all 'bull'. She is making me eat a weight gain diet ('or I won't grow'). I used to be overweight (did my research) but according to her, I was a 'perfect weight'. I ate almost 4000 calories a day back then and she wants me to eat that again. I actually eat a normal amount of food for someone like me (1800-2200 calories) and I am growing faster than I did when I was overweight. I have an average bmi. My doctors have never complained about my current weight but my mother tried deleting all of my food apps since 'they were making me anorexic'. I don't want to lose weight, I just don't want to gain weight. She says that since we eat differently now that her biggest fear is me losing weight. I actually could lose 30 pounds and still be ideal. I am NOT trying to though. I eat plenty. I just don't want to eat so much that I feel sick. If I ate like that now, I would be crying from the stomach aches and sickness. No, she is not abusive or anything, just closed minded and misinformed. I just want to know what to do. I don't want to do anything disrespectful since I refuse to waste food, I just don't know how to tell her that I don't need to gain 100 pounds to actually grow.

1070,"I've been wondering whether or not to post this on here for a little while, now, although it's gotten to the point where he's genuinely putting threats against our lives whenever he's upset.

My brother is 12, and a high functioning autistic person. Or at least, I would think he's high functioning.

He has a phobia of cheese. Not holes, like Swiss cheese, or anything. Just normal cheese. If we even say the word, he'll fly into a fit of rage and scream, hit, bite etc. We have to hide cheese behind vegetables in our fridge, and if I have pizza, I have to put a paper towel over the plate, and run as fast as I can upstairs so he won't see.

Today, he's found some type of meal with cheese in out fridge, and is not that pleased, to say the least. He's threatened my life with scissors, waved a knife at me, keeps saying ""I want my mother to get coronavirus and die"" and has deleveloped a nasty habit of calling my mum the n word, ""black bitch"", 'black whore"" amongst other things, including screaming that he's a cannibal and is going to shoot us and eat us. In detail. 

Is there any way I can continue to cope with this? He attacked my dad not too long ago whilst he was driving us back home, and a woman ended up calling the police as our dad had to physically drag my brother out of the car and onto the pavement to stop him from hurting us. The police handcuffed my dad and we had to explain that my brother attacked us so they wouldn't arrest him.

Could anyone give me some coping mechanisms to get through each day? I'm extremely depressed due to him, and my mum forgives him every time he has an outburst. I'm becoming more and more suicidal with every day that passes, and I can't stand this. I know he's autistic, but as I mentioned before, he's very high functioning, other than his phobia of cheese and the fact he's emotionally attached to his stuffed animals. He'll threaten our lives if we accidentally brush past his robes, because he thinks they're real, and feeds them his food and gives them water everyday.

TL;DR My 12 year old autistic brother has become increasingly violent. He has a phobia of cheese, and he must've seen some today, because he's extremely enraged. He keeps trying to find scissors because he says he ""wants to kill"" us, and has written the n word all over his bedroom walls and door. I'm becoming depressed, and I need ideas on how to cope.

I would like to mention I've already had a physical altercation with him where he grabbed a (normal) knife because I had angered him, and he wouldn't let go.",03Jun2020,1

My dad is pretty nice. The only part that's not nice is the teasing. He pokes me (Which I HATE being poked. It's a 'no thank you' from me.), he teases me for how I say ""Stop"" when I ask him to stop, ect.   


Oh? What was that second thing? Yeah, I tell him to stop. He replies with ""Staaahhhhhpppp\~"". It's getting me really angry. Today I literally snapped at him to stop. He isn't taking the signs. The worst part is when I did snap at him, he said something like ""You need to be nicer, you'll never know when I'll be gone and you'll never be able to talk to me again."" AND THEN he made me do chores which he should've done for not stopping whenever I've asked him MULTIPLE times to stop. It makes me tear up when I get home because he won't stop or even take the signs that I'm getting annoyed and I want him to stop.  


Last year, I've talked to him about this. He was teasing me and I told him to stop, as usual. Then I snapped like I did today. He did the usual thing where he got angry at me for snapping. Not my fault you made me annoyed. After a bit of silence, I said ""You need to stop when I tell you to. It's not nice when you do this."" And guess what? He never stopped. He just got angry.

We met through friends while I was overseas and were instant friends. We laughed together, talked incessantly, he took me and a mutual friend somewhere he loved, and it was really great! I really liked him because he understood me well, we had a lot in common, a lot that was different about us. He was able to have deep and philosophical questions, but was able to goof off a lot. 
The last few days before I was about to go home, he told me that he was in love with me and wanted to marry me. That he was ok to take it slow. I told him “I like you too, even if we have only known each other a few weeks. For now, no, but maybe in the future, I’d consider it.” 
I went home and tried to keep up with him by private IM, but he didn’t respond a lot on that, and it felt one sided. He liked most of my SSN, and commented on a lot of stuff, but that was it. 
Forward to one year, we met again and were happy (but nervous) to see each other again. It went well, but then we had a pretty bad misunderstanding. Due to language barrier issues, he interpreted by a conversation we had that I was “uncomfortable” being around him now. He avoided me and didn’t talk with me for the rest of my time there, and I felt really hurt and angry. We didn’t leave on the best of terms. 
His sister came and visited me this autumn and we had a fantastic time! In a conversation, she mentioned: “he thought you were uncomfortable with him, and so he stopped talking to you.” 
After I assured her I wasn’t uncomfortable, rather hurt that he was so standoffish, she understood. 
Recently he’s been on my SSN again and trying to have lengthy conversations on my feed (even posting a video of something fun we did together). But he never tries to contact me privately?

1081,"Hey,
so I basically had some mental health related Problems all throughout my life, first in grade school where I then also visited a psychologist, but dont remember much from that, again and again over the last couple of years I had some suicidal and other similar thoughts.

I recently have started to visit a psychologist again, as my friends also told me that although they are always there for me and i frequently talk to them if i dont feel so good, they cant help me the same way a professionell can.

However now the current problem:
Im starting to not feel good about going to a psycholigist, not that perticular one, but in general the thought of having to go there on a regular basis and overall the whole thing just gives me more anxiety and I overall have a bad feeling about it.

I mostly pin it down to the fact, that my thoughts and stuff are really sudden and for me it feels pretty useless to talk about things that havent happened or were some time in the past and it helps me personally way more to just talk to my friends whenever I have these thoughts and also have Problems really recall what exactly was going on in my head. 
I also dont like to have these strict times for appointments and in general feel forced to do something every week or something similar, which is made worse by the fact that I often dont want to talk about this stuff and having fixed appointments just seems not productive.

My parents argue quite a bit; they’re not really right for each other, but realized it too late. I’ve tried to get them to see from each other’s point of view etc, and some days it feels like I’ve made some difference, and other days it feels like they’re too old to change and I’m wasting my time. *But I don’t feel like I can give up because I might be helping*

I realized this might be a problem when I saw some posts about the protests and had an idle daydream about being super rich and somehow helping. I think I light have a problem with ego or something?

Deep down I think super highly of myself, but I hide it from everyone because I don’t want to seem pretentious. I know I hide it well because my parents scold me sometimes because they don’t think I’m ambitious enough, which isn’t a particularly high bar for them.

I think that might have something to do with my desire to help everyone, along with my belief that I can. Hell, I’m 16 and I think I can somehow help my family with their money problems. I truly believe this, and failing at it is giving me grief, just like with everything else.

I know that ESAs have become more popular and more and more landlords are skeptical about ESA. I know that they have fewer regulations since they do not service animals, but they are protected under the FHA. I want total visibility with my new landlord but I do not want to be denied up front (I have had a few landlords tell me that they are full a day after explaining about my ESA).

I  have a letter from my therapist and I am registered with the disability resource center (DRC) at my University. I have two guinea pigs that live in their cage in my room -- and will not be a danger/bother to the other tenants. I know that there are a lot of fake ESA and I do not want to be denied because of my animals. I could provide the phone/email of my current landlord and they can vouch that the ESA has done no damage to the apartment. 

What time in the process should I tell the new landlord I have an ESA (before or after I sign the lease)? (I do not want the landlord to feel tricked into accepting my ESA, if I were to give the paperwork after I have signed the lease.)

1087,"So I have been married for a while now. I have always got along with my in-laws. Recently, my sister in law had been expressing her social and political views in the black lives matter movement. I absolutely hate that she uses the wrong hash tag... I tried to explain to her how what she was saying was offensive and against the movement and she decided to call me racists towards white people. I tried to explain to her how what I say wasn’t racist and she completely shut me down. She kept calling me a racist. what makes it worse is that I’m part white, but because I’m a dark tan color, she never acknowledges that I’m white. She seems to always “forget” that I’m white. I love everything I am including white, so I would never say anything to offend my family in this cause... but alas, my sister in law says I’m racist towards white people.

To make matters worse, her husband (my husband’s brother) defends her like she has a huge chain around his neck. He thinks I’m racist towards white people (forgetting that I’m white...) and defends her views. I feel so sick being around them. Anytime their name is mentioned, I want to vomit. They make me sick with their privileged mindset. Neither one of them has been discriminated against based on their skin color or apparently have eyes to see it happening around them, so they don’t understand the true meaning behind this movement. 

I don’t know what to do because my husband and his brother are close. My sister in law and brother in law have a daughter that I love with all my heart. It hurts me that they are going to corrupt her innocent little heart with their ignorance. I want to be able to go to their house and see their daughter and ONLY HER but never have to talk to them ever again if I’m being honest... 

By the way, my “racist comment” was this:
By saying “all cops are good” today, you can say the equivalence was the same as saying “all white people aren’t racist” back when MLK was protesting. Though these statements are 100% true, no real change will be made if we accept that statement and move on without encouraging any change. So basically I accept that not all cops are bad and not all white people are racist. I know that with all of my heart. However, that’s not enough today. Change is needed.

I personally have never known someone who had killed themselves or know someone who is connected to a person who have suicided, but that was before my aunt who passed. It was so surreal when I heard the news. 

My mom thought of her SIL as such a kind person, she even thinks that she was kinder than her own brother. She broke down in tears when she heard from my uncle, and soon after that she told my dad then me, the oldest. Anyways, my mom and her siblings are trying to find a way if there is a chance that it could be foul play. I dont know exactly what it means but I think theyre thinking it has something to do with the company’s fault. My aunt worked in a ship and they found her dead in his room. From what I heard, the evidence showed that she apparently was ready to go, she stowed all of her belongings away etc. And this was during the middle of his work hours. My mom thinks that she couldnt have gone that route because she was such a nice person, that she wouldnt do it to himself. That she would think of others. And that she seemed alright. She keeps on crying and talking about this to my dad from what I overhear. But my dad is sort of upfront about stuff like this, with a very lecturing type of tone.

He says that although things may seem unbelievable, he can understand why my aunt had done this. He’s been working in the ship for more than half of her life, barely sees her kids and own family. But my mom refuses to think so.
I sort of agree with dad but maybe I can help my mom and talk it out with her in a much more gentler manner. Although, I’m not really knowledgeable in why things like suicide happen. Do you guys know why people might go through that route even though they seem happy on the outside. I would like to help my mom and my family as much as possible through days like these. 

Any and all help will be great thank you!

tldr: my mom thinks my aunt is so kind at heart and alright that she would never think that my aunt would suicide. my dad is very upfront about the facts and reality i wanna talk about it with my mom as best as i can.",03Jun2020,1
1091,"I have this friend from work. We have been friends for about a year now. I am not a social person, and its very normal for me to keep minimal social contact with people.  This friend texts me like 10 times an hour, and expects me to have one to two long phone call everyday. Very unlike me. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I don't respond, they become dramatic and start writing quotes on social media on how their close friends are stabbing their back and abandoning them, lots of quotes that  I know are directed at me (though they never mention me). They always correspond to when I dont respond. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I ghost people for a few days. I am not social, and everyone know that. I decided to abandon them today completely because I need some time alone. The friend went nuts, posted like 25 tweets in less than 10 minutes, sent me texts that I am ignoring them and stuff.

1092,"So here’s the story: A girl that I roomed with my freshman year of college moved into this apartment complex and after about 10 months of living there, she had to move back home to Miami and texted me one day asking if I wanted to sublet from her. She knew I had been looking for an apartment and when I asked her about how she liked living there, she told me it was great. Said it was super spacious, really quiet, great amenities, Yadda Yadda. I asked her about the roommates and the only thing she said was “They’re nice. But they all generally keep to themselves.” 

So here I’m thinking, this is perfect. She says she loves the space, her roommates aren’t bad, the rent is cheap. What a win, right? No. 

I didn’t get to see the apartment before I moved in (The apartment was near my university and was 3 hours away from where I was living at the time due to COVID). The apartment that I was shown was this beautiful model of the space. Nicely furnished. Super clean. Gorgeous. I knew I’d be really happy in the space. 

Flash forward to move-in day. I pack all of my stuff into a U-Haul and drive 3 hours to get to my new place. I’m super excited. I walk in and I’m greeted with a dirty, dusty, grimy, dingy living room and kitchen. The baseboards and walls are supposed to be white, but are instead black in most spots with dirt and scuff marks. The floors leave your feet black. The kitchen is covered in dirty dishes, grease splatters all over the oven and the microwave. The fridge reeks when you open it, enough that it makes me want to vomit. There is black mold in the shower, water stains on the ceiling. Everything is just disgusting. 

So instead of moving into my room and unpacking, I had to scrub everything down. Then move my stuff into my room. Then unpack. Next order of business was to try to make space for myself in the shared kitchen. There was no way I was going to put my dishes and cookware in that kitchen in the state it was in. It took me 2 days to clean every appliance inside and out, mop the floors twice, clean the inside and outside of the cabinets, etc. It is very obvious to me that these girls do not care about their space. They’ve both lived there for over a year and the common space has not been decorated or cleaned in that time. And it would make sense considering the level of grime covering everything. 

After cleaning, going out and spending money to decorate the living room and kitchen, rearranging the couch and tables in the living room to make it more LIVABLE, I got not one single “thank you” or “it looks nice” for slaving away to clean the messes that THEY made. Instead, they told me to put everything in the living room back where it was because they liked it better that way....

What do I do? Should I call the complex and ask to move? I’m by myself here right now and I have so much stuff that it seems almost impossible to get out. I don’t know these girls well enough to ask them to clean and am scared to get off on the wrong foot with them by offending them by telling them that the place is disgusting. 

This is my first apartment and I was so excited to live there. The place is really nice. Everyone gets their own bedroom (4 bedrooms), their own private bathroom, and their own walk-in closet. The appliances are pretty nice. The cabinets and countertops have a few chips here and there. It’s really not awful. It would just be PERFECT if it were clean and nicely decorated. I’m scared to live here for an entire year with people who don’t care about the place they live. 

TL;DR My new apartment that I just moved into is disgusting and dirty. Roommates haven’t cleaned once or decorated a single thing in the year they lived here. I’m the only one who has cleaned.

Addition: I’ve only been here for 3 days now. I don’t know how old my roommates are but I think they are in grad school.",03Jun2020,1

1096,"My older sister (B) is 20 and I’m 14F

For as long as I could remember, she’s always hated anyone who was older than her or acted like they were in charge. Like, she would always fight with my oldest sister (E) over the littlest things. Like today, E asked B if her clothes were in the washing machine so E could put her sheets in. B said no and E asked her if she could put them in or if E could go ahead and put her clothes in. E said this in a regular tone, and B got mad at E. 
This resulted in a 15 min screaming match with E, B, and my Dad. I tried to keep the peace for a moment, but B wasn’t having it. She can’t handle it when someone asks her to do something. 
For 14 years, I’ve watched my parents and my sisters walk on eggshells around her. My other sister (A) and I were always her favorites because we were younger, and therefore not in an authoritative position.
With all of us in the same house for the past few months, I’ve been waiting for a big fight to break out, and the one today was a big one. 
With B, you can’t just talk to her after a fight, you have to wait a few days. Over XMas break, she yelled at me for moving her clothes from the dryer, then she said I was “out to get her” because I moved them. 
I just can’t handle anymore fights. B always escalates them into these big things for no reason, and acts like the victim in a victimless situation (like the laundry fights I described). I don’t know how to talk to someone who is less mature than 9 year old me. She has completely shut down and is refusing to talk to anyone. 

How can I make these next few months together less tension filled?

1098,"F21, don’t want to be older, scared to grow! Is 21/22 meant to be any different mentality wise from a 19/20 year old ?
btw I’m not talking responsibility wise but more I guess in general mentality wise!
I rather be 20 tbh since it’s in the middle of 19 and 21.

Ever since I turned 21 a few months ago, I’ve been depressed.
Not that I’m old , I get I’m young. But the idea that I’m 22 end this year and then 23 next year is making me feel overwhelmed!

Now I’m not talking responsibility wise. 
I’m working, I study, Help out around the house (yes I still live with my parents, more a cultural thing and it’s not really common around my area or maybe I just went to a very cultural high school) 
But just to make it clear I’m not living off them! I’m happy to be with them for now and so are they! 

At the same time I’ll miss them allot when I have to leave them in a few years when I’m married!! 
They do so much and I feel so greatful !! 

Marriage is another thing that overwhelms me allot too! I’m in a serious relationship for almost a year and bit and I love him allot and do see us in the future!! But I’m more someone that’s just likes to live at the present than focus allot of on the future ? Is that bad ??? Maybe because he’s my first serious relationship! 
but I’m getting overwhelmed as time goes by!! I’m scared that one day I’ll have to get married and it had nothing to do with my boyfriend it’s literally just the idea of it! Like the idea of bills, work stress, maybe having blood pressure but this time instead of having blood pressure about my favourite show ending, having blood pressure about real situations!! Like what if i end up in divorce ????
The only thing that excites me about marriage if the dress and food Lol! I don’t think I’ll be ready to be married until I’m deadass 27-28 !! 
Btw my boyfriend knows this and he just laughs and tells me “babe we young, why u even stressing about marriage now and that it will be when we both are ready in the future” 
Luckily my boyfriend isn’t the type to focus on that right now as we are young but I’m noticing most people at 20s in relationships are already thinking about marriage or the future future! I also have ROCD which makes this worse. My Brain will start telling me if I don’t see a complete future then I’m sticking around !! But I’m not I just feel overwhelmed to think that deep for now ! We are both young and yes I want him in my future but I don’t wanna think too too deeply as I also feel like 21 is still young! I mean it’s a age which is also just “legal” in few countries !!
The only future I can think about is my degree 

My friends are also very similar in mind set as me! Sometimes we think if we even act our age or not lol. I mean I still pretty much act 17/18 ?  Nothing’s changed. Like I’m still studying , working and going out to different places. I pretty much am a living meme and I guess I’m still a bit dumb. My uni environment I’m around I guess is also still very similar to high school in a way (ofcourse it’s also very different) 
which doesn’t bother me at all but is it meant to be that different other than we have more better teachers, flexible classes and study wise. But I’m talking about the environment in general. 

Just last week me and friend heard an odd bird noise, we started making the noise back and then it went back and forth. This went on for 5 mins lol! Later on we paused and were like wtf are we actually immature or are we just thick in the head and retarded! Like there was also this one time not long ago me and my friend literally thought we wanted to start a rap career because of our boyfriends lol. The only difference was we were thinking if we sound half decent and just dressed up all boujie we can be “famous” 
We ended up recording in my boyfriends studio lol. He just laughed and thought it was an adorable phase but surprisingly was encouraging at the same time lol. My friends boyfriend just laughed and face palmed himself lol. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m fine the way I am and said I’m over analysing my self and that to just be my self. He said he finds my phases whether it’s realistic or not adorable and funny. 

When I’m home I relax, Netflix, cry or fan girl over my shows. Vent about random stuff to my boyfriend. Think about my eyebrows and nails half the time. Like is anything else meant to be different ? 

I always thought it wasn’t until 25 or 26-27 when maturity sort of hits but right now i don’t feel different at all !! 

I just wanna be young, maybe start a YouTube channel, I still wanna study more and be a student until I’m 25! I still wanna try new course! 
Tbh I still wanna be a bit dumb, I still hope my friends and I can still be living memes. I still wanna relax and eat my mums food as well as spend time with my family every weekend! I don’t want them to treat me any different when I’m older ! Is this normal ?

I’m “adulting” but I’m scared to be “adulting adulting” if that makes any sense! 

Other than that when I’m at work I’m professional , mature, still a bit of a meme at times I have dumb moments but I manage my self. I study , get good grades ! 
I buy my own stuff, help out, be spontaneous! 

I don’t know if it’s bad I wanna take another course as well after I finish this one ! 
At the Same time I’m conflicted between two things I wanna do in the future 
It’s either beauty or business management! But I also wanna try out a realestate course !!!

1099,"I am mixed race. He married a WOC (not black) for fuck’s sake. But he’s still a racist, he’s still on the police’s side. He sees the George Floyd as a man who tried to resist arrest, and the police did nothing wrong because “they were only doing what they were trained to do.” Though I doubt he would ever have the courage to say it in the face of someone who is black. 

I want to protest so badly. But my stomach is in knots over how he will respond because I feel that I would not be able to hide it from him. He is not violent, but he is verbally abusive. He has a bad temper and is a mean-spirited person.

1101,"So I'm (23M) asking how would/should handle this.

The guy (24M) (white small town person) makes a post about that shows pictures of articles and statistics to present how police brutality is equal for both sides. His graph is from Statista and the articles are from unknown sources. There is text below it that begins with sympathizing with the protests, Floyd's family, and knowing why people of color are upset due to the death per capita. Then he says ""but it is time to focus on lives at hand. All lives matter because God created all of us equal. Do not let the media divide us children of God.""

Well I tried talking to him explaining more about the reason of the death per capita as his graph is bad. I start off by showing population differences and statistics, but since he ""did"" due diligence, he blew it off kinda.

This is how the conversation went after:

Him: I didn’t post to debate. Others have stated their opinion so I stated mine. Honestly didn’t even read what you sent. And if you knew what per capita meant, then you would have saved yourself a lot of time lol..

Me: Well if you knew you used a German website to back your information then you'd knew that it wasn't reliable bud. Lol I'm an accounting major about to graduate so I know what per capita means. And it's no debate, I was telling you before you make people very upset.

Him: I used multiple sources? 4 in fact. And I have freedom of speech as well? I literally said we were all created equal. If their feelings get hurt then that’s very odd. I haven’t had one African American or anybody from another race message me lmao.. only one Caucasian.

Me: Lol Not everyone confronts people about this kind of stuff. Most people just watch and begin to think of you differently. Yeah, you have freedom of speech just like everyone else, but words do have a price bud. You'll figure it out.

1115,"I (15M) and my best friend (16M) were very very close for the past 8 months. I've only known him for less than a year, but he quickly became the closest friend I've ever had. Before my problems with him began, he (like any really good and close high school friend) believed that our friendship would last the rest of high school and beyond. He even told me that he wants me to be the best man at his wedding (a bit premature, I know, but the sentiment still was there). 

I became so close with him that we constantly said ""love you"" to each other every day (platonically of course) and I really enjoyed that. It felt nice to hear and say exactly what we felt without shame, and I truly did feel loved. One day, he told me that he wants to stop saying ""love you"" to me. I, still attached to us doing that, made the mistake of just leaving the conversation and not saying how I felt about it until much later. By the time I came back and tried to tell him that I didn't want to, he had firmly made up his mind. Part of the reason that he made up his mind was because he had another friend months before that basically manipulated him. That friend made him say ""love you,"" so us saying it to each other reminded him too much of that, I guess. 

But after he told me that his mind was made up and that he didn't think he'd change it (although his mind can easily be changed about certain things, but this didn't seem like one of them). I had to respect his decision so I didn't press him further and I just felt sad. I had realized that I probably was turning into his former friend (which I knew would be terrible and make him not want to be friends with me), and the pressure of that with everything else threw me into a depressive state. 

I told him about it, and a couple other close friends of mine and they all helped. I expected that, out of all of my friends, my best one would check up on me and see how I was doing often. But he didn't, he treated me normally. He has a lot of experience supporting depressed people before, and they've asked him to treat him normally. That helped them the most, so he did the same to me. He told me that, so I just went along with it. My mistake there was not telling him that it would help if he'd ask how I was doing, but I didn't and I just kept it inside. 

Weeks later, it got better. I got out of my depressive state and I was getting over the fact that him and I wouldn't say ""love you"" to each other. I thought things would finally turn around. Then, one day, I was feeling particularly stressed and I decided that I wanted to vent all my problems to him just to release frustration. I made the mistake (again) of telling him after weeks that it hurt me when he didn't check up on me. I wasn't even mad over it in the first place, but in the heat of saying all of my frustrations, I just let it slip. Now, I know that was a stupid thing to say. He was just trying to help me in the best way he knew how, and I didn't tell him the way I wanted to be helped so it was really my fault...

For the rest of the time I talked to him that night, he seemed in a normal, fun mood and I thought everything was fine because he didn't say anything was wrong. But the next day, he told his girlfriend (who I'm also close friends with) that it really hurt for me to say that. And that he feels like it's a ""chore"" to help me with my sadness and it's overwhelming. 

I tried apologizing to him that night, and the next morning. But he just wasn't responding and he just needed time to think. His girlfriend contacted me again and said that I periodically overwhelm him when I talk to him about my problems, which confused me. If he had a problem with it the entire time, why didn't he say anything? I would have stopped. She also said that I've been toxic and just had a negative vibe. She said that both she and he needs space from me. 

Since then, I haven't spoken to him. I've told a couple friends about the situation (one of which is a close friend of both me and him). She offered to talk to him for me, but he hasn't responded to her yet. I know that I am to blame for a lot of this, maybe all of it. Obviously, if I tell a friend that they did a bad job at helping me (even though I didn't tell him how I wanted to be helped), he would probably be angry. But I can't wrap my head around the fact that he said it was a "" chore"" to help me. And that he used his girlfriend to say what he didn't want to say to me in person. I'm prepared to take the full blame for this, and prepare to prove to him that I'm willing to fight and change for our friendship because he means that much to me.

1120,"A few years ago the local Les Schwab (only tire/brake place in a small college town) tried to rip me off. My cars brake lines got air in them so I took it in for a check, the guy tried to tell me I needed my brakes completely replaced in the front. 

I had just replaced them myself before moving to the town, so I knew that was a blatant lie, he then tried to tell me he didn't want me driving the car. After some arguing I took the car to my father-in-law's and found out a simple gasket had sprung a leak, it cost 1.50 for a new gasket. 

My friend's car recently has been having brake issues and the first thing we did was make sure the front brakes were fine, he needs new brake pads and that is about it. 

He took it to Les Schwab and they told him the exact same thing, he needs a full replacement for all brakes in the front of the car. 

They even gave him a quote for new tires (which he needs) and quoted him an extra 40 dollars per tire to put in a new ""tire pressure sensor system"". 

His car has never had a tire pressure sensor system and doesn't even have a light for it, I called them out on this because my friend didn't notice, the guy basically told us ""that's the quote, take it or leave it"". 

This is really the only tire and brake place in town, we called a Les Schwab 2 hours away and their quote was around 800 for tires, new brakes, balancing, and all that jasz compared to the local one's 1200. Keep in mind, Les Schwab is supposed to do balancing and stuff for free when you purchase the tires from there. 

I tried to haggle with the guy, pointing out the flaws, but he wouldn't budge. 

His car definitely shouldn't try to make the trip, but honestly this is a small college town, people are tight on money. Does anyone have advice for how to handle this situation tactfully?",03Jun2020,1

1123,"Note: I originally  made this for r/askdocs but got no feedback. I'm also too emotionally exhausted to rework this post to fit here better. I'm hoping someone here can provide me with some ideas/insight into how I can be truly helpful to my friend. 

**Demographics of my Friend**

Age: 31

Gender: Female

Height: 5'1""

Weight: 110lbs

Medications: Unknown

Medical Diagnosis: Crohns

Psychiatric Diagnosis: Depression and Anxiety

Duration: Roughly 70 days with Sudden Onset

**The Psych Holds**

Let me start by saying this situation is so fucked up. I don't know what to think or do anymore. The past 70 days have been a nightmare. In 70 days my bestie has been on at least 10 psychiatric holds. That is an average of a 3 day psych hold ONCE A WEEK for the past 70 days and it seems no one in the medical community cares.

**Case Facts**

Here are some facts about her case:

1. My friend has their PhD in psychology from a very reputable university
2. My friend is NOT yet licensed in the state of CA to practice psychology
3. My friend has a minor history of depression and anxiety. Other than that their is no real psych diagnosis
4. This behavior is brand new and only started 70 days ago.
5. My friend has Chron's Disease
6. My friend considers themselves emotionally stable and 'never better/free'
7. My friend has been acting out sexually
8. My friend smokes A LOT of Marijuana
9. My friend is NOT on hard drugs
10. My friend is suffering from extreme insomnia and will go routinely go roughly 3 or so days without sleeping

**Manipulation**

My friend knows exactly how the system works and they're using it to manipulate their way out of these holds. My friend thinks they are fine, never been better, etc. and the first 5 times it was like, ""okay. sure."" However, now it's been upwards of 10 psych holds at 6 different hospitals and getting more dangerous.

**Book Smart not Street Smart**

Each time my friend is released from the psych ward they are left with no plan or rather no plan that they are willing to follow. My friend is currently homeless and let's be clear, my friend is not built for living on the streets.

This is becoming terrifying at an alarming rate.

**Delusions &amp; Paranoia**

My friend has been homeless/sleeping in parks and cardboard boxes that they described to me as, ""the taj mahal of housing"" and they are convinced they are famous and being targeted by the police for ""speaking out""

**Robbed, Raped, and Tortured**

They have been robbed, sexually assaulted on numerous occasions and during one of the sexual assaults they were burned with cigarettes. During one assault they were dosed with PCP and Meth against their will. It has been reported to the police and a rape kit was done for this particular incident.

**Not Medication Compliant**

They have no spare clothes, they're wearing hospital scrubs/gowns they got from the psych wards. They have no cell phone, no job, no money, no identification, no insurance, and their Crohn's has been causing them physical problems as well. They are not taking their medication including meds for their Crohn's and my friend has lost 30-40 pounds in 70 days.

**We're NOT on Good Terms**

I told her early on that she needed mental health help my friend flipped out on me and blocked me across all social media platforms and  has refused to speak with me. Until last mid-last week.

She showed up at my doorstep one day in the evening last week. I let her spend the night. Despite it putting my health at risk due to COVID-19 (*I'm immunocompromised*) .

Despite my hospitality, she spent the night/day berating me, talking a mile a minute, cursing at me, making contradicting statements in the same sentence, and refused to look into getting housed at a shelter.

**The Threatening Standoff**

She threatened me with my kitchen butcher knife when I was pleading with her to accept mental health help. All of us, her mom, childhood friends, and myself are willing to chip in financially to get her help. She vehemently refused this offer .

I had to call 911 &amp; keep her calm. It was NOT easy and there was a tense stand off until police arrived.

**It All Started Suddenly**

This is not the friend I've known for the past 10 years. It's an entirely different person.

It is so unlike them and it all came on suddenly. I can almost pin point the date in mid-march when the switch flipped so to speak.

**Restraining Orders**

her ex has filed a restraining order against my her due to all the viable threats she was making towards him.I'm considering doing the same thing, unfortunately and it breaks my heart to watch this all go down.

**Sharing Information**

Her support network has provided the hospitals with texts, emails, and even a few medical records that we've been able to collect. We've even got video evidence of my friend stating their homicidal/suicidal threats and they STILL keep releasing my friend after the 72 hrs are up.

**What in the Actual Fuck**

It's all making me very confused and I'm starting to wonder what in the actual fuck is wrong with these psych units that they keep letting her out? She's been at some of the best psych units in the country.

**Questions I Have**

I'm wondering if there is anything more I can do for my her? How many 5150's will it take to warrant at least a 14 day stay? Is there anything more I can do?

**No One Seems to Want to Intervene**

It seems like no can or will intervene until my friend is seriously injured, makes a clear attempt to take their life, harms someone else, gets arrested for some petty crime like stealing food or trespassing, or worst of all ends up dead.

**Insight Warmly Welcomed**

It's just scary to watch and some insight into what can be done would be amazing.",03Jun2020,1
1124,"Let me first put it out there that this is by no means defamation of character as each and every incident was documented and recorded by either news articles or screenshots of his own tweets.

To give the most context the professor in question is Mike S Adams, a criminal justice professor at the university of North Carolina Wilmington. This isn’t outing him in anyways like I said it is public knowledge. Here is the wiki article and the news article written about him:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article119809563.html

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Adams_(columnist)


Many people have tried to get him fired for his horrible behavior and sadly he is protected by both free speech laws and tenure. Even now there is a petition with thousands of signatures already. Like I said before most of his actions have been documented and examples of such can be found here:

What I want to do is print this information out in a detailed format and have a call to action on it if he’s not fired by next semester. It will be put on public boards that people can put flyers on or laid out on tables in common areas so it won’t be disrupting the campus. So what I really want to know is if there are any legal implications of doing so or if there is a way to work around it if there is.

[edit] for those who chose not to look at the links he was going to face consequences for his past actions but he sued the university for violating his free speech.",03Jun2020,1
1126,"I’ve been with my husband for several years. We dated for a couple years, got married and have been for a few years and are now expecting our first child. The only truly bad thing, is my husband’s friend. 

My husband’s friend is.. honestly really scummy. About six months into my relationship with my husband, my husband asked that I stay with his friend for the night while he was working his night shift. It was the middle of winter and we were basically living out of his car. I was uncomfortable but I was cold and young and exhausted so I agreed. 

I woke up to his friend’s arm across my throat and hand over my mouth while he assaulted me. I completely shut down and waited for him to be finished. Once he walked away, I pulled on my pants and left. 

Ever since then, his friend has been very sexually open about me. He asks my husband for threesomes, he asks my husband for photos of me naked and in compromising positions, he asks for stories about me, he’s asked to watch us, he send my husband pornographic photos with things he wants to do to/see done to me, and comments on my body constantly. I’ve asked my husband to get him to stop, but my husband asks like it’s a burden for me ask that of him and is very reluctant to do so. 

His friend comes over to spend the night with my husband and I to hit the bars and things often. He comes over while my husband is still at work and bothers me. He grabs me by the throat and forcibly kisses me, shoved his hands down my pants or up my shirt. He once got so angry that I wouldn’t sleep with him, he threw me to the ground and held me there by my throat while he ripped off my pants. He’s tried a few more times and succeeded a couple times. 

I keep begging my husband to drop him, that he’s a bad influence and I don’t want him near me or our unborn child, but he seems reluctant to do so. 

I don’t want to have to talk about what happened to me. Is there anything I can do before it comes to that? Even typing this out I feel like I’m going to break down and it’s been ongoing for years. What do I do?",03Jun2020,1
1127,"Hello, I’m moving this Friday out of my boyfriends house that I’ve lived in for 4 years. We’re basically inseparable but live in a toxic environment as our room mate makes me very angry constantly. She purposely does things to piss me off and has no regard for anyone but herself.

I feel terrible that my boyfriend will still be living in this environment and I will miss him so much. I sound dramatic as I’m moving 8 minutes away, but it stresses me out knowing we won’t be going to sleep together every night and just our routines will change.

1128,"I'm in kind of in a pickle where I am not  able to take a day off but due to a personal emergency I absolutely need  to tomorrow morning. I  was wondering if anyone could help me. I work at a hospital and they  only have one entrance open in the morning where all employees entering  have to get their temperature scanned by a forehead thermometer (they  aim it really close to your forehead like a gun and take the temp  without touching you.) If you have a temperature (I believe 100 F or  above) you are sent home.  I've only found a couple conversations  specifically talking about faking a forehead thermometer and not a normal oral thermometer, and I was wondering if anyone here please knew how to fake  it for sure. If putting a hot pack on my forehead right before I leave my car to walk in would work, or blasting the heat in my car on the way  to work, eating spicy food, ANYTHING. I know theres probably a time  limit the faked temperature would work so I would do any of this parked  at work right before I walk to the door. This isn't just me not wanting  to work, this is a very important personal emergency. Please help if  anyone knows what would work. Thank you.

Oh  and as I side note, I remember one time a few weeks back I got my temp  checked and the nurse said ""wow you're cold"" (I think it was around 97.5  or something) and I laughed and said I had my AC in my car blasting on  the way to work even though it was kinda chilly outside, so I could  maybe see that as a sign that the AC hitting my face couldve effected my  temperature reading.",03Jun2020,1

 I do not understand what is wrong with me but I have never had anyone that actually cares about me. Even my family really doesn’t. So it should come as no surprise that I haven’t been able to form a romantic relationship either. I have tried and tried and tried and nothing has made me good enough and I don’t know what else I can do. I’ve lost 80 pounds, I bought a car, I have a job, I go to college, I’m good socially, I have done everything within my power but nothing has changed. It is impossible to put in to words how demoralized, depressed, and hopeless I feel when I think about how hard I’ve worked for nothing.

I always told myself that when I grew up that when I got a girl friend and eventually a wife that I would be better than my parents and I’d be in a healthy relationship. Instead I’ll never get that chance, the only reason that makes sense to me is that I have to be even uglier than I already thought I was. I just refuse to look in mirrors or look at pictures of myself, I can’t stand how fucking putrid I am.

I feel like I have no reason to keep pushing forward. I can’t deal with feeling like this every day anymore. I always told myself that it would get better one day, but every day I get closer and closer to graduating college and despite how hard I’ve worked I’m not any closer to having an ounce of worth. I just wish my life was over. I don’t want to wake up anymore when I know that it’s always going to be this way. I’m always going to be disposable filth. I’m never going to be able to spend the holidays with people who love me, I’m never going to be able to celebrate any accomplishment I could have had with anyone because I’m worthless. I can’t just keep going when I have this in the back of my mind every single day.",03Jun2020,1

1131,"For years now i’ve wanted to join the police force to become a detective or possibly a dog handler. I am currently studying a criminology with forensics course at university to help with this goal. However, I am also painfully aware of how some police have treated minorities, and now with all the George Floyd protests and riots, I am in a very confusing place mentally.  Everywhere I am seeing people saying things like “there are no good cops” and “all police officers are racists, no exceptions”. Now, i am from the UK and while it’s arguably not as bad here as it is in the states, i would be lying through my teeth if i said it was perfect here. The two main reasons i am so confused are this: 1, i am an extremely empathetic person and seeing so many people and families hurt by racist and corrupt police breaks my heart and is making me question whether a should join a career that hosts people like this. and 2, i have always had the mindset of being kind to everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity etc. i was raised in a very open and accepting family and have spent my life being the same, so i do not love the idea of being called a racist pig simply for working within a certain field. I am so disgusted by the actions of the police involved in all the racist and discriminatory acts that have ever taken place, and do not associate myself with them in the slightest. However, i have spent years  going down a path hoping to become a detective, and am spending money, putting myself in debt for a university course for it. i have no idea what i’ll do in my future if not this. so my question is, should i abandon this career goal and if so, where do i go from there??",03Jun2020,1

1138,"Reddit I need advice.

I (18F) became fwb with, let's call him Kevin (17M) after my friend Jane (17F) broke up with him. What's worse I think I'm starting to really like him

Background (optional but would be helpful to read)

I became friends with Jane by a mutual friend Layla (17F). Layla and I go to school together while Jane goes to a different but we meet at their Church I recently join. Around the time we met, Jane and Kevin just started dating. Initially I saw found him cute but once Layla told me that they were dating I completely lost interest. I like Jane a lot. She is outgoing, sweet, energetic, and one of the coolest people I've ever met. So I didnt think much of Kevin when we first met. He was also energetic, sweet, funny, dorky. An all around great guy. I should also mention they were both leaders of their church groups. I'm the opposite of them. I'm quiet, introverted, likes to be alone, and loves to help people.

So they dated for 4 month but Kevin had a crush on her 4 months prior. He was absolutely obsessed with her to the point everyone saw it as unhealthy. When they were dating all he could talk about was her. Went layla, kevin and I would hang out every so often, he would only talk about how cute Jane was and how much he lived her. And me being the weirdo that I am I loved hearing about it. I just love love. So he would just go on and on and I would just sit there and listen enjoying it. 

Well Jane and Kevin broke up for reasons that's too long for me to go on and he was an absolute wreck. The day she broke up with him he even collapsed and was taken to the hospital. Days after that he would breakdown, cry, and smoke weed and drink with his other friends. I didnt see him during that time but I would hear it all from Layla. A week before they broke up, I was also dumped. It wasnt my first time being dumped so I knew how to get through it myself.

I felt so horrible for him. I knew what he was feeling and knew how hard it was to go through that alone. Although we didnt know each other well, I felt like I had to reach out and help him through it. He needed a friend that would listen to him and let him cry and not make him feel bad about being sad.

So I did.

We would go out and talk and drink sometimes. We were both party drinkers and had often had drinks together before the break up so it wasnt anything new. One night though we got pretty wasted in my car. We were talking about random stuff then we started talking about relationships and the best things about them. I cant remember who kissed who first but one thing lead to another and I'm sure you can guess what happened.

The day after I felt absolutely horrible. Not just for Jane but also Kevin. He was going through a hard time and what happened could have really messed him up some more. I talked to him that day and made sure he was okay. He was completely fine but we both unconsciously agreed not to tell anyone and we just let it slide and tried to forget all about it. 

Three days after that night, we go drinking again in his room late at night. We laughing and having a great time then he kisses me. I dont know why I kissed him back that night but I did. I stopped this time, still drunk off my ass, to let him know that what we were doing was wrong. He said that it felt right to him, that he was single and so was I so there wasnt a problem, that he wanted me so badly. I caved. And we went round after round for hours! He made me feel on top of the world and for 3 months he continues to make me feel that way. 
 
After that night we agreed to be fwb but as time went on we really became best friends. I helped him everytime he was at his lowest. I listen and held him when he broke down. When I felt like the world was against me, he was right there holding my hand. Acts a lot like a couple but we both agreed that we dont feel that deeply for each other and that we can only remain friends. We even plan on moving in together and is currently saving up for our own apartment. We spent almost everyday for 4 months together hanging out, talking, smoking weed, cuddling, messing around, laughing, and just being happy. He told me I've helped him so much and that he couldn't live without me as a friend. He not obsessed with me and he learned that his feelings for Jane was unhealthy and hes slowly but surely is getting over her but still loves her dearly.


Reddit, I dont know what to do. I cant admit to myself that I might be falling for this guy because sometimes I would get a sense of almost clarity and think that no way I like him that way. But I love hanging out with him, and I love holding him, I love when he text me, and I love the way he makes me feel. Like I'm important, sexy, cute, cared for, cared about, and everything I've never felt before from anyone else. Hes helped me as much as I've helped him and we just work like that. Hes built up my confidence and self esteem that had been long shattered by guys dating me, getting bored, then dumping me.

I dont know what I feel honestly. I dont want to loose him and I know we are absolutely not in the right state of mind to even think about going that far in our relationship but I don't know what to do with my feeling anymore. They keep changing on me.

1139,"Hi, Reddit. I’ve recently (think a few minutes ago) made this account, because I’m so fucking confused as to how I can help my friend, if I even can. (Sorry for any formatting, btw, I’m on mobile) 
Her and I are long distance pals (She lives in the states, and I live in the U.K.) and We’ve been friends for 3 years. She’s one of the most strong, and genuine people I’ve EVER met. We argue, sure, but I love her to pieces, and I always will.

Anyhow, I’ve just found out today that she’s lost her dad. I’m not sure how he’s died, I didn’t want to press too much, but I think he passed today. I never knew him, but she occasionally talked about him. He seemed like a great dad. 

I’m giving her space, and plan on checking up on her often, because I want to make sure she’s safe, and doesn’t feel like she’s alone in this. 
I’ve also got a bunch of pictures, and videos of things she likes, and plan on sending them if she ever needs a distraction from what she’s feeling. 

I’m going to be completely honest with you all, I have NO IDEA what else I could do.
Is there more I could do? 
Is just being here enough? 
Why do I feel so... guilty? 
She’s helped me through some of the darkest points in my life so far, and I feel like I’m doing nothing to help her in hers. 
I’ve told her that I’m here for her when she’s ready to open up about it, but it just doesn’t feel like enough?

1140,"Sorry for the long post. I have tried not to make this into an angry rant and have tried to make this cohesive as possible. I can answer any questions anyone has but i could really use some help in figuring out what to do and/or how to go about things.

I have 3 roommates. Roommate #1 is my brother and before we moved in it was well established that any problems would go through him as roommate #2 was his friend(at this time there were only the 3 of us total). In January Roommate #2 lost his job and was unable to pay rent, food, and internet. Those last two are the problem. My brother has been paying his share of the rent since January and i had been paying for food and the internet is in my name. I had been doing this with the understanding that i would be payed back as soon as he got a job. Around this time my brother stopped paying his share of the food and internet. A month goes by or so and we are no longer getting food together and sharing but i am still owed a large amount of money at this point, about $150 each. At this time roommate #3 moves in. Now, i'm not a clean person. Never have been. And i was hoping my brother would help me break my habit of just not cleaning by pushing me to clean but he never did (hell my brother and #2 were slobs as well). Roommate #3 on the other hand is a clean freak. #1 and #2 adapted quickly to this as they are all friends. I have not. I told #3 when he moved that he owed me $15 per month for internet which is a bit less than an equal share because i am nice and its easier for me to keep track of.

To try and keep this post reasonable ill skip some of the finer details. This is now the 3rd month of #3 living here and i haven't seen a penny and he is now refusing to pay up for this month or the past two. His reasoning was he has been doing most of the cleaning around the house and that he feels that its only fair that he ""charges"" me for it. *Not once* has he said anything about this in the past nor have we agreed to anything. I still want my money. He is outright refusing to pay unless i do my fair share of work around the house. I have said multiple times that i am willing to do house work and that i just need to be told before hand that they would like me to do X and Y this time. I dont mind. Not one bit. I understand that in some way shape or form i contribute to the general mess around the house and i do not mind cleaning. But again they have never asked me to do anything. They have taken care of things far more often than i normally would so i didn't feel the need or want to go out and do things on my own.

I have thought about going into the router setting and blocking all devices excluding mine in an attempt to get them to pay me back but i figured i would try and find other solutions to the problem first. The router is in my brothers room and he could easily just unplug it to spite me even though its my fucking internet. All i want is to get my money back. I feel like i have been plenty patient with #1 and #2 and its just gotten abused. I mean, $400 between the two of them. That's a lot of money.",03Jun2020,1
1141,"So I like fire, I like lighting fires (in fire places and fire pits mostly ) and I love playing with matches.

I’ve always made “jokes” where I’ve mentioned how easy it would be to burn down a house and have secretly wanted to burn something like a house down for over a year.
I can play with a lighter for ages and normally have to hide them from myself so I’m not lighting plastic over and over again.
I really enjoy going up to people and quickly lighting and dispelling the lighter to scare them.

Whenever I’m holding a match/lighter I always think about holding it to the carpet and letting it go.
I know that it probably wouldn’t do much and I would need to light a better spot but I can just imagine it spreading and getting bigger and better.

My friends always joke that I’m obsessed with fire and might burn down a house eventually but idk if they are joking or actually worried.

I’m now super confused and don’t know if my fire fascination is normal or not.",03Jun2020,1

1146,"I have been incredibly outspoken on supporting the #BlackLivesMatter movement and worldwide protests online, and I absolutely love to see that a wide, wide majority of my friends and family are doing the same. I participated in yesterday's blackout online and have been retweeting and tweeting more than I have probably ever lately.

I live in a small town where I don't have transportation of my own (it's kind of a long story). I'm also currently unemployed due to the pandemic. There are some small, peaceful protests that I would love to go to, but due to not having a ride, I have missed a few of them. I am 100% going to one tomorrow, but I see my friends donating literally thousands of dollars to foundations and making sure to go to literally every protest and rally and I feel like ""wow - I'm not doing enough!""

The truth is that as much as I support the protests, they are very depressing for me to watch and I can only take so much of it before it becomes emotionally exhausting. These past few months have been such a whirlwind that I'd just like to see something great for a change. I am definitely not one of those people who can just nonstop talk about what's going on right now, I need a breather.",03Jun2020,1
1147,"I feel trapped. I feel so completely and utterly lost about what I want to do with my life and I’m torn. I just graduated college and ended a two year toxic relationship. I live with my parents since I am looking for a job but every single job I apply for turns me down. The jobs I had lined up are no longer hiring due to covid. My parents are putting pressure on me to find a professional job and get married (especially to have kids) and it all makes me feel sick. I don’t even know if i want kids. I’m only turning 21 tomorrow. Most of my friends suck. I feel extremely judged every time I post something on my social media. A lot of the people who are my “friends” have actually treated me like shit for a long time but I’m trying to be a nice person and give them second chances because they claim that they changed. I hate knowing them.

I feel like shit about everything and want to completely start over. My sister is in the military and let me drive 12 hours to come stay in her apartment and clear my head while she’s on duty. I feel so happy and not stressed out being alone. Even on the drive over I just wanted to say fuck it and live in my car. I don’t know if that’s just a childish thought though. My dad thinks I should live with him and save up money until I find a job which I agree is a smart decision. I feel so stressed out and unproductive there though. One of my younger sisters who lives with me is very challenging. She’s 18 but acts younger than my 10 year old sister. She has messed with me during online job interviews, constantly wakes me up in the middle of the night and doesn’t respect my personal space. I love her but it’s really adding to the stress. 

I’m sorry this is an emotional, scattered rant. I don’t know what to do. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation Id love to hear about it.",03Jun2020,1
1148,"Hi, I’m looking for some advice. So pretty much I get sad over everything these days and I don’t like it for example I could be in a really happy mood and then an example could be if someone Dosent respond back to a message I will all of a sudden become really sad and not want to do anything, is there anyway to stop this?

1150,"I need an outside fridge, just a small chest freezer for my meat birds. I do not have any room in my house AT ALL, and so my only option is on the back porch. 
I live in Louisiana so it is EXTREMELY humid and almost always pretty hot. So an outdoor freezer will be prone to rusting and stuff. 
We’ll be having a porch done later this summer, and we need to look into having another freezer soon. Just a small one would be find. 
Do any of y’all have any recommendations?",03Jun2020,1
1151,"I was attempting to purchase a PS4 Pro on offer up because I'm a bit low on funds and wanted to avoid paying $400+tax for a brand new system. Enter in OfferUp which was suggested by Google when I was searching used or refurbished PS4 Pros. 


The first person to answer was a user by the name of 'Dre', from the Bronx, who agreed to sell me his system for $210 claiming he didn't need it anymore. He refused to leave without recieving half payment on cash app, which I STUPIDLY provided after extensively telling him I was skeptical. He assured me he would arrive in 40 minutes. 


The time passed. I blow up his phone with no responses. I assumed it was a dead deal because there was half an hour without communication. Then he calls me assuring me he is now in fact on the way and he'd arrive to me in 30 minutes. On this call I told him not to waste my time, if he wasn't coming just end it here as I don't want my hopes up. He assured he was coming. 


Then he blocked me.


I know it is near impossible to get Cash app to do anything to help the people who use their app, but is there any other way I can proceed? I've never been a 'call the cops' guy for several reasons but the phone call assuring me he was coming has incensed me. How can i, at the very least, ensure that he cannot do this again ti anybody else? 

(Also if there are any sites to get a decently priced used/refurbished ps4 pro, I'm all ears)",03Jun2020,1
1152,"Im 20 and i live in the UK so there are basically no spiders apart from big bastard hairy harvest spiders. Theres currently one in the corner of my room and ive spent the last hour and a half trying to throw things at it or coax it away. Im not scared of much but this inch sized spider is literally making me shake with worry. They dont even bite and i dont understand it.

The worst part is ive got a place at a uni in australia and have made plans to move there for at least a year. I also love travel and southeast asia is top of my list to go to next. my weird brain has now decided that if i cant deal with this spider then how am i supposed to live the next few years of my life that ive planned out?

Sorry if im not understandable rn its just im literally terrified of it for no reason and this fear is starting to make me angry.",03Jun2020,1

1155,"Kind of a complicated situation. My girlfriend's roommate banned visitors from their apartment starting in mid March due to the pandemic. We did not anticipate this situation going this long and my girlfriend has become frustrated with her roommate for this and other reasons. 

Over the past few weeks her roommate has become more lax with their ""rules"". Her boyfriend came to surprise her for her birthday and the first thing he does is hug her even though this whole no visitors thing was his idea. A few days ago the boyfriend said he couldn't stay at his parents anymore due to some family arguments so he asked his girlfriend (my gf's roommate) to come get him and drive him to his apartment. 

My girlfriend and don't know how they handled that. More frustrating is that the boyfriend was out of state a week or two ago and met with people ""outside his bubble"" even going to a restaurant. On top of that he could have taken public transit back to his apartment or asked one of his siblings for a ride. 

I've been having socially distanced visits with my girlfriend once a week for the past couple months but after all this nonsense from her roommate we hugged the last 2 times I came to see her. My girlfriend recently lost her job and is obviously tired of her roommate so her plan is to relocate to her family's beach house for a couple months or so. She said she may go later this week, and I would have off for a couple days. I'm debating asking if I can come with her even though that would be totally ""breaking the rules"". 

I don't wanna upset my girlfriend and make her feel pressured to say yes or to completely go against her roommate's wishes. But of course, I really want to be with her.",03Jun2020,1
