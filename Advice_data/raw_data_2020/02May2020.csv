0,"Hey y'all wondered if any folks could give me some advice on connecting to old friends. These folks in particular were my old high school/ 6th form buddies (i'm from the UK) essentially when I moved from highschool onto 6th form (the 6thform is part of the highschool so everyone I knew at the time went there for convinience's sake) and in that one year in what was meant to be two years of essentially continued learning with my closest peeps, My relationships disintergrated befoer my very eyes.

Some folks I thought up to that point were my cloest buds made new mates and turned on me very quickly, thats not me being jelaous (although I very much was)  like all they did was spread rumors and talk behind my back, I never got invited out with them anymore. As a result of them leaving I ended up screwing up the friendships I had left, three of them to a massive degree ( don't want to overshare but it was a pretty serious situation that I wasn't the root cause of but I played a part in the issues that came after) and the last two months of that year I spent a lot of my free time and study periods with headphones in, listening to music all alone. Got to a point where I had this REALLY crap day and my mum wanted to take me to the doctors but I basically just shut down and would not move from my bed, she went on my behalf and was told I might have social anxiety but unless I sat down with them myself it would be like a theory I guess

That combined with me failing my lessons all bar one which was my only time I felt good about myself ,and a few things from being a kid which I didn't realise had damaged me as such meant a strongly worded email to the head of my 6th form saying ""I'm out, peace"" in short.

I'm happy to say these days I am a lot better, I've made peace with the damage I could rememdy, I still have bad days but non where I consider the worst things to do being a viable option. I guess you could say I'm in time of reflection, the previously mentioned damage from being kid is on the mend but I still have days where I think about the freinds I wished I still had, it gets to a point where I think I see them when i'm out or I see someone who looks like them and I just can't stop thinking about them for the rest of the day. Might be the social anxiety saying ""hey remember the time you F\*\*ked up, good times""

Filled with guilt over the freindships I trashed and as a result i blame myself for the more toxic freindships turning toxic despite all the evidence pointing towards me not being in their life like they were in mine (if that makes sense) :/

The thought of reaching out has crossed my mind before but either somethings come up and I forget about it or I talk my self out of it. I did manage to message one of these people before on their birthday but sadly they've ghosted me which sucked. I dunno whether to reach out to the guys I majorly messed up with, I want to but with the damage I caused I don't think it'll bring anything good. One of them I think kinda dumped social media completely cus they deleted their accounts and I can't find them anywhere, I know their mother from my aunt but I  feel like it would be weird to be like ""hey you don't know me but I knew your kid, whats their number?"". I think the rest I just gave up on but its the fear of not getting a response I reckon. The toxic freindships I think I might just try to forget about but a part of me really wants to get closure on it cus as much as they didn't help the situation I still feel like I was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Sorry for the long ted talk biography but does anyone have any advice they could give me on what I'm going through, maybe a place to start? Like I said I'm going through a time in my life where due to things going on around me, I don't want to live with these kind of regrets so any adive at all would be massively appreiciated! :)",02May2020,1

So every interaction i have with him has him mentioning something to get a response out of me regarding corona, so it's been bitter, he locked himself in his room because he got a temper boiled up on him due to all this and it being ""fake"".

12,"Oh man I am a complete and utter emotional mess right now. I don't know what to do. I feel like I am going insane and I am doing things because of how out of control my emotions have gotten, and I need some serious advice. Please help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have developed feelings for my best friend. I've had feelings for her for a while now (about 2 months). She already knows this as about a month and a half ago I told her and she basically said she needs to get things figured out. However at the start of April, she has started giving me a lot of signs that she may have things figured out. She started saying how she loves me practically every single day, she was spending a lot of time texting me probably easily 50-100 messages almost every day. Then all the texting seemed to stop, and things are dwindling.

I have become so attached to her in a really unhealthy way and I led myself to this point and I want to get out of it. I am going to be honest and reveal some of the things I have done because I want everything to be transparent. Recently, she's taken hours to reply. We'd be having a convo that would be going back and forth rather rapidly then all the sudden.... radio silence for the next few hours. Sure she could be busy, but I checked her insta and it said she was active.... it made me feel uneasy. Because I realized that she just doesn't want to talk to me. I don't know what I did. I am so lost. Then I see her chatting up away with her other friends and it does make me jealous. 

I DO NOT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY. but I just do. I want to be free of this. It's painful. It hurts. My emotions and feelings are getting the best of me, and I try to live life without her being so present, but I get to a breaking point and I just beat myself over this. I asked her last night if she hated me, and well she was very... confused. She iterated that she still loves me and adores me, but I dont know what to feel and know. Do I tell her my worries or do I just try my best to just stop texting her and move on?",02May2020,1

My boyfriend and I got together through an affair on both our parts. We have since both left our marriages and also personally repaired our friendships with our former spouses. My boyfriend and his ex wife were together for many years, and therefore the families are very intertwined. They are remaining close friends and would like to continue some transitions, with myself and her new partner being added. I know, sounds crazy but we are all trying to make the best of the situation my boyfriend and I’s indiscretion got us into. 

So, to where I need advice!  

He’s asked me to reach out to his ex wife, via text. Thinking it would be best if we talked and saw each other again, just the two of us... Before we are put in the situation with family and kids around. That way if anything goes south, it stays private. But I have no clue what to say, or where to start. 

How do you text someone whose life you turned upside down and try to be “friends” or whatever you want to call it. 

We haven’t spoken since shortly after everything came out, and it wasn’t pretty. But it’s been over a year since then, and I believe everyone has come to terms with the new situation.

22,"Studies have shown that when it comes to short-term attraction, women prefer to date hypermasculine men with the dark triad personality traits:

Never heard the expression *""treat them like dirt and they stick like mud?""* That's because certain guys can get away with treating women like crap and they come back for more. For some reason, being a selfish, emotionally unavailable jerk is attractive to women. It creates a desire in women to prove themselves by transforming this badboy into boyfriend material. I've seen it happen time and time again. It almost always ends in tears, with women getting pumped and dumped, abused or trapped in toxic relationships, but like moths to flame they can't help it.

Dating studies have also shown that when it comes to rating male attractiveness, women consider 80% of men ""below average"". Most men will be able to attest to this. If you don't have male model goodlooks, women won't even notice your existence. That's why ""looksmaxxing"" techniques don't really make much of a difference if you aren't genetically blessed in the first place.

It's not ALL about looks. As I said, if you have superficial charm and a badboy persona you can attract women without being the bestlooking guy on the planet. Also, women (especially later in life) will look for a provider to settle down with, usually a beta-male to fund her preferred lifestyle. Generally, women are not physically or romantically attracted to guys like this, it's simply a marriage of convenience.",02May2020,1
23," My phone is my dad's old phone with all the data wiped. At least I thought so until I went to the voice memos app and saw that there were still recordings on there. I thought what the heck, and listened to them thinking it was no big deal, until I listened to an unnamed one where a family friend was telling my dad that his best friend was having sex with others in his house, and know that he is married and has two children who I knew very well. I could hear my dad crying in the clip and it explains why our families haven't been in that much touch. The part that sickens me is that I have seen my dads best friend in gatherings after the date in that clip, and he is still married and his children are also grown up. I think my dad didn't do anything with this information because he was best friends with this man; They had been through a lot together. Should I keep it to myself?

To give you an idea of it, we met through an online forum on a topic we were both into and talked for a long time before anything more happened. It took a long while to even disclose ages, but young me was very idealistic in the ""age is just a number"" -sense, to the point where I insisted that everything is totally fine because we are in love, so why wouldn't it be? She was struggling with a lot of issues such as incredibly low self-esteem, (undiagnosed) major depression, drinking as a coping mechanism, self-harm, still living with her parents, unfulfilling job, being religious and liking women, you name it. It was my first real relationship and the first time I had realised I was bisexual so in this time of self-discovery I was convinced everything was possible and that my love and complete commitment to her will make everything better and that I would give up anything for this relationship and would not let her down like others had before me.

The relationship ended after about one year and a half, after several episodes of my parents finding out, prohibiting any contact, me going behind their back with a burner phone, them finding out again, and finally them giving me an ultimatum that finally worked. I was in my last year of high school back then and did not want to give away their support for my future. It did damage the relationship with my parents for a long time, because it took me more than a year to realise they had been right and that the relationship had been toxic for me. However, even after realizing it, it was still thinking along the lines of: ""You were right that it was toxic but I wish you had let me realise that by myself without forcing me to end it. Good conclusion, bad process.""

When thinking back about it, I have never seen it as abusive, but more as me being terribly naive and idealistic to get into it. I always think sure, it was a mistake, but back then I thought I was in love so whatever that was (i guess infatuation?) it meant that I was all in. After all, I was choosing it. I was the one promising to never leave when my ex was telling me to leave her because she's worthless. I was the one who insisted I loved her when she was saying that nobody could ever love her. I was the one who cried for weeks after I had to cut all contact and even reached back for closure a year later, after I had moved to another for university, just to offer some closure (since I had gone directly no-contact after my parents' ultimatum).

Now I am not so sure anymore? I don't know how to feel about it and I don't understand why it still bothers me to this extent even though so many years have passed. I live in another country, my relationship with my parents is great, I am in a long-term relationship with the most amazing partner, I'm successful in my studies, everything is working out fantastically. 

The only problem is, from time to time, sometimes once or twice a week, otherwise not for a few months, something accidentally reminds me of my ex, which gives me a really weird feeling physically. It's a feeling of complete repulsion, like I might throw up, combined with a slight pressure in my chest area, lightheadedness and sometimes nausea. It has not gotten to a point where it negatively affects my everyday life, but it is definitely not pleasant. To give you an example, the first time it happened was over a year ago when I was running an experiment in the university lab. One of the participants looked very similar to my ex, which gave rise to the intense feelings of discomfort that I described and made it really difficult to spend the coming two hours running the experiment on her.

I can usually deal with it by just actively ""throwing"" it out of my mind but then I end up being bothered for a longer time simply because... Well, I am technically over it, so why is this bothering me so much to the point that I am getting horribly uncomfortable somatic symptoms?! 

Hence why I am posting here because I would really appreciate some advice from an objective person who has never heard this story before. Has anyone else ever experienced something similar? Do you have any tips on how to manage it? How to process everything so that it does not bother me to this extent?

Some final notes in case there are questions:
1. Not from/in the U.S.
2. I know therapy is the go-to solution but I cannot afford it right now since I'm still studying (and therapy here is only free for like really bad disorders).
3. I am however studying psychology so definitely have some access to knowledge on the subject and some tools through that. I think I somewhat understand it rationally. My bodily reaction is just not rational and it just makes me very confused.",02May2020,1

Ladies. I dyed my hair at home (bleach?) it’s came out extremely light and has a yellowish tint to it. I started at the ends as my roots had grown out and I wanted them the same colour so I done ends first and then the roots. This worked out PERFECTLY except I overestimated the size of my roots and now I have an inch of orangey yellow around my head just below my scalp (close to the scalp is the same as the ends) I don’t know what to do. 

It’s obviously patchy some is fine but some part are darker some are more orange etc and the hair overall is a lot lighter than I expected but looked ALOT darker and more orange with the dye on. 

My question to you is what do I do to fix this? I’ve seen about getting a toner but I’m worried as 1)I’m not sure how it will go if it will level it all out as some parts are patchy some aren’t and 2) what colour I would get. Also I’m not sure whether to put a darker dye on but I don’t want to go too dark and don’t want to end up with the same situation but just darker hair. 

Is there any advice? I can’t go to a salon and they’re all closed (lockdown) and when they aren’t I can only go 1-2 times a year as the ones close to me charge £200 just for half a head of highlights and a cut and unfortunately it’s something that’s classed as a big “treat” for me to do. I just need some advice on what to do to manage this. 

Yes I’m well aware I shouldn’t have done this but I’m 22 and apparently never learn. If it makes any hairdressers feel better I am myself facepalming too and also laughing at the barbie girl looking thing in the mirror with the orange stripes.",02May2020,1

32,"Hey, I'm a 19 M, trying to figure out what to specialize in with the rest of my life and I'm trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. I have terrible commitment and trust issues, and it's infiltrating its way into my life choices. I am trying to decide on my favorite activities. My choices are screenwriting, singing, comedy, economics, coding, and political theory. I would consider my self fairly skilled in all 5, but if I've learned anything from my economics studies comparative advantage is essential for succeeding in life. Right now I'm going to a b list University studying economics and computer science. I have a prestigious acting and singing scholarship which is helping me pay for school, also I compete in screenwriting competitions which are also helping with the financials. In addition, I like to code algorithms that trade stocks and bonds to keep my money invested.

My instincts though are telling me to focus on one thing. I have no idea what to focus on though there is only so much time in a day, and I can not accomplish every goal I wish too. I find myself getting easily overwhelmed with the tasks I have before me and barely anytime to talk to friends, form meaningful relationships, or work on my physical/mental health. Just trying to see if there are any other people going through the same type of situation I'm going through/ have gone through this situation and what they've done. Not that I'd base my entire decision off of somebody else's input. However, these decisions can really make or break my career. I want to be successful and I want to obtain my worth in life. But I'm not sure if I should focus on per se economics right now, make money then sit comfortably with that money in the performing world. Or if I should just perform and do all the financial and coding activities on my break/side time.  Just looking for some perspective or if somebody thinks I should go to a psychologist with my trust issues that somebody here can point out. 

Anything input would be nice. Just try not to say cliche societal blanket statements like ""college is your best option"" or ""Go with what your heart wants"". While appreciative, Disney quotes will not help me make life decisions.",02May2020,1

35,"Hello, apologize if I posted in the wrong community; I considered posting this to AskDocs but it isnt exactly a medical concern (yet?) so...

About a year ago some pipes burst in my apartment. It went unnoticed for a while because it happened during in my roommates' room while they were gone for break. Once it was found, the extent of the flooding was pretty severe (walls and ceilings were opened, carpets were replaced, we were all stressed). The flooding even reached a bit to my room, which is adjacent to hers.

Fast forward to now, my roommate and I have been smelling a musty odor near the same places the leaky pipes were. We already contacted management, but they arent able to come out to check it due to covid-19 safety measurements. No biggie, there is no sign of leaking--outside of the walls at least.

My main concern is, is it okay for us to be smelling this odor? I try to keep my windows open all day now, but the smell still lingers. I might be going crazy, but I think the smell has been getting stronger too.

TL;DR: Strong musty odor in apartment, possibly (not confirmed, maintenance cant come out to check) from leaky pipes that burst a year back. Is it endangering my health by breathing it?",02May2020,1

49,"So well call this girl Y, and Y and I have both had struggles with mental health. However, she ended up turning to nicotine, and it’s starting to affect her health. I’m talking like her lungs hurt and stuff. Bad. So I love her with all my heart but *god*, I can’t fucking stand when she talks about nicotine. She’s literally two years younger than me, and already addicted. It’s sad. Whenever she smokes I tell her she should probably stop. For example, yesterday she was complaining about her lungs- and then reached for her juul. On one hand, I’d like to believe she’s tryna get help like she’s saying, but also with her nonchalant attitude towards it, and how she says “lol idc” when I say she shouldn’t order a new one, it just seems like she’s doing the bare minimum effort as if it’s supposed to solve itself.  I haven’t been addicted to nicotine so I don’t know what it’s like, so I don’t wanna tell her what exactly to do beyond what I know, but it’s just worrisome how little of a shit she seems to give. I had to literally explain that we can’t care more about her health more than she does, and that we don’t want to have to be forced to walk away from her because of her issue spiraling out of control, and it taking a toll on us.

60,"I LOVE my family. I dont think many people LOVE their families, or are as attached to them as I am. This, I have come to find out is especially true with my friends. Maybe this is partially because  I am yet not financially stable, so my dad helps me out a lot, but I honestly would give anything for them, even if I had a job. Im a 20 year old male, college dropout, and I dont know what Im gonna do with my life yet. 

The problem is that my friends, in this one friends group I have(the one im closest with, and have spent most time with), all either are financially stable, or just despise their families. When I say despise, I mean literally one of my friends dad beats him with a belt sometimes. So I understand why he hates him. 

During these corona times, I have forced myself to stay inside and not socialize a lot. This is mostly because my mom has asthma, and several other allergies, making it almost a guaranteed risk of mortality. 

Of course as the title says, my friends dont care about this.Thet go out as they please, like there is nothing going on, and shame me for caring. 
Today they planned on drinking and smoking in a friends basement, and invited me. I agreed this time, so we where gonna be 7 people, in a tiny, smoke filled basement. But then suddenly they say my friends brothers friends is going to be there too, so we where going to be atleast 10 people there. I told them I was not coming, and they started going batshit in the groupchat. I then said that I dont care what they say, and that I care too much about my family to take risks like that. This only made them more heaty and some of them made inappropriate ""comedic"" insults(stuff like I like my family so much I have incest with them and shit), and it made me sick.
I then thought to myself these people can go to hell, and said this "" I said my piece, and I will piss sideways on anyone who doesnt respect my decisions"". I translated whats in quotation word for word from swedish, so I know it sounds weird. After that, one paricular friend, who is the one I have most problems with, continued a bit with the comedic jokes, then it stopped. Only he continued. Guess the rest understood I was furious, but he obviously didnt care.

Was this smart on my part? Could I have said something else? Or was it right? What should I do know. Should I cut my ties with them?",02May2020,1

72,"I had expressed interest about somebody (Friend) before I got with my current boyfriend. Friend said he didn't know how to feel about me, and to give it some time. I got with my current boyfriend and Friend and I had sometime where we didn't talk often.

I've been.... at odds with my current boyfriend. At first, when I started dating him, he was lukewarm and, at times, a bit cold. It was obvious I had more feelings for him than what he felt towards me. He's expressing more romantic attraction to me, but I'm not sure how to take it. I'm not sure if he's going to keep being less of a douchebag, if he's going to continue to be genuinely more affectionate, or if he's just saying it to keep me from leaving, or if he's just going to revert back to being a dick. And, to be honest, I'm starting to lose interest. I wouldn't say I'm not attracted to him anymore, but the feeling I had when we first started dating has waned a bit. He's a good person. He's put up with my bullshit, and has stayed faithful and loyal. I'm tired of the fact I have to seek out his affection, to ask him to hold hands or kiss. It's a little disappointing.

Friend has already been affectionate and romantic despite us not even dating, or me even signifying a want to date him. Friend is honest with his feelings, saying that he wants to be more than friends, that he wants to hold hands and hug, and do more as time goes on. He said all this, but he said he doesn't want to ruin my current relationship. He says he wants to respect my current relationship, and that he said he liked me to get it off his chest. 

I'm in love with my current boyfriend, but I don't know if he feels the same way. Boyfriend has said he'll be less of a dick, that he'll start treating me better in public. I don't know if he will, though. People have said for me to leave him, but I don't want to. People have sincerely asked me if he's abusing me. He isn't, but it's concerning that people have noticed how badly he treats me in public. And technically, from what it seems to be, the only reason he's treating me better is because I've told him people think he's abusing me and that people have seen how badly he treats me.

Do I leave my current relationship, somebody who is lukewarm in public, slightly more affectionate in private, for somebody who would show affection, hold my hand, hug me, without me prompting him? Boyfriend has been a dick to me to the point of his parents calling him out on it. Boyfriend has shown more interest in his video games than with me, and it took an ultimatum for him to realize that a girlfriend, an actual person, should be more of a priority than a video game. I'm in love with him, and I honestly don't know whether I should continue to be with him and hope that he'll treat me better. He makes me so happy when I see the side of him that cares, but I wish I didn't have to prompt him to do the simplest romantic actions. I wish he didn't huff when I ask to hold hands, or ask for him to hug me because I feel sad.

TL:DR - I'm in love with and dating a dick, and somebody who isn't a dick asked me out. Who do I pick?",02May2020,1

Never heard the expression *""treat them like dirt and they stick like mud?""* That's because certain guys can get away with treating women like crap and they come back for more. For some reason, being a selfish, emotionally unavailable jerk is attractive to women. It creates a desire in women to prove themselves by transforming this badboy into boyfriend material. I've seen it happen time and time again. It almost always ends in tears, with women getting pumped and dumped, abused or trapped in toxic relationships, but like moths to flame they can't help it.

Dating studies have also shown that when it comes to rating male attractiveness, women consider 80% of men ""below average"". Most men will be able to attest to this. If you don't have male model goodlooks, women won't even notice your existence. That's why ""looksmaxxing"" techniques don't really make much of a difference if you aren't genetically blessed in the first place.

It's not ALL about looks. As I said, if you have superficial charm and a badboy persona you can attract women without being the bestlooking guy on the planet. Also, women (especially later in life) will look for a provider to settle down with, usually a beta-male to fund her preferred lifestyle. Generally, women are not physically or romantically attracted to guys like this, it's simply a marriage of convenience.",02May2020,1

I thought what the heck, and listened to them thinking it was no big deal, until I listened to an unnamed one where a family friend was telling my dad that his best friend was having sex with others in his house, and know that he is married and has two children who I knew very well. I could hear my dad crying in the clip and it explains why our families haven't been in that much touch. The part that sickens me is that I have seen my dads best friend in gatherings after the date in that clip, and he is still married and his children are also grown up.

86,"So well call this girl Y, and Y and I have both had struggles with mental health. However, she ended up turning to nicotine, and it’s starting to affect her health. I’m talking like her lungs hurt and stuff. Bad. So I love her with all my heart but *god*, I can’t fucking stand when she talks about nicotine. She’s literally two years younger than me, and already addicted. It’s sad. Whenever she smokes I tell her she should probably stop. For example, yesterday she was complaining about her lungs- and then reached for her juul. On one hand, I’d like to believe she’s tryna get help like she’s saying, but also with her nonchalant attitude towards it, and how she says “lol idc” when I say she shouldn’t order a new one, it just seems like she’s doing the bare minimum effort as if it’s supposed to solve itself.  I haven’t been addicted to nicotine so I don’t know what it’s like, so I don’t wanna tell her what exactly to do beyond what I know, but it’s just worrisome how little of a shit she seems to give. I had to literally explain that we can’t care more about her health more than she does, and that we don’t want to have to be forced to walk away from her because of her issue spiraling out of control, and it taking a toll on us. Again, I adore her, but it’s just stressful to watch her borderline self sabotage. So AITA for feeing this way? Or should I take more thought into it?",02May2020,1
87,"My sisters are two 3/4 and four 3/4. They are my fathers and my step mothers kids, so half siblings. I have some but minimal contact with my father because of some trauma he caused when I was a child, and no contact with my step mother because she abused me &amp; lied to the family about what she did to me. I also have a teenage brother who lives with them who I’m friends with. 
 When I lived with them me and my sisters got along, I helped the babysitters &amp; played with them everyday. But once I turned 18 I moved states to get away from the issues at home, but I miss being able to contact them. I don’t want them to grow up and forget my face. My step mother is very over protective and if I were to FaceTime them through my little brother my step mother would freak out. I can’t do it through my father, because he would put her on the call, and its still hard for me to call my father.
 Is there any way to contact them without seeing my step mom that I haven’t thought of?",02May2020,1

After that school year was up I spent the whole  summer researching the stock market online and reading books by people who are day traders. 
I chose to go to a state university to study finance but after first semester of sophomore year I felt like I wasn’t learning anything useful so I took a semester off to find a different school. 
I ended up going to a university in my state’s capital cuz I though that would be a good place to learn more about trading with all the big investment firms in the city. 
Well I am about to finish my first full year at the new school and I feel as if nothing has changed. What angers me is that I learned more about the stock market and how to trade in the one summer of research I did myself than I have during five semesters at college.

I've been.... at odds with my current boyfriend. At first, when I started dating him, he was lukewarm and, at times, a bit cold. It was obvious I had more feelings for him than what he felt towards me. He's expressing more romantic attraction to me, but I'm not sure how to take it. I'm not sure if he's going to keep being less of a douchebag, if he's going to continue to be genuinely more affectionate, or if he's just saying it to keep me from leaving, or if he's just going to revert back to being a dick. And, to be honest, I'm starting to lose interest. I wouldn't say I'm not attracted to him anymore, but the feeling I had when we first started dating has waned a bit. He's a good person. He's put up with my bullshit, and has stayed faithful and loyal. I'm tired of the fact I have to seek out his affection, to ask him to hold hands or kiss. It's a little disappointing.

Friend has already been affectionate and romantic despite us not even dating, or me even signifying a want to date him. Friend is honest with his feelings, saying that he wants to be more than friends, that he wants to hold hands and hug, and do more as time goes on. He said all this, but he said he doesn't want to ruin my current relationship. He says he wants to respect my current relationship, and that he said he liked me to get it off his chest.

I'm in love with my current boyfriend, but I don't know if he feels the same way. Boyfriend has said he'll be less of a dick, that he'll start treating me better in public. I don't know if he will, though. People have said for me to leave him, but I don't want to. People have sincerely asked me if he's abusing me. He isn't, but it's concerning that people have noticed how badly he treats me in public. And technically, from what it seems to be, the only reason he's treating me better is because I've told him people think he's abusing me and that people have seen how badly he treats me. He's treating me better because he wants to improve his image.

Do I leave my current relationship, somebody who is lukewarm in public, slightly more affectionate in private, for somebody who would show affection, hold my hand, hug me, without me prompting him? Boyfriend has been a dick to me to the point of his parents calling him out on it. Boyfriend has shown more interest in his video games than with me, and it took an ultimatum for him to realize that a girlfriend, an actual person, should be more of a priority than a video game. I'm in love with him, and I honestly don't know whether I should continue to be with him and hope that he'll treat me better. He makes me so happy when I see the side of him that cares, but I wish I didn't have to prompt him to do the simplest romantic actions. I wish he didn't huff when I ask to hold hands, or ask for him to hug me because I feel sad.

TL:DR - I'm in love with and dating a dick, and somebody who isn't a dick asked me out. Who do I pick?",02May2020,1

Students will still walk (thank goodness), but seats will be placed six feet apart, everyone will wear masks, all speeches will be pre-recorded, and the principal etc will be social distancing as well.

Though the event itself isn't my concern, it's a part of the ""problem"" for me. The thing is, I've had a heck of a hard four years and I need something to make myself feel some solace in the fact that I did it and am moving forward. I need something to let go of the past I've gripped onto for so long. I've come up with a few ideas, but they seem to fall a bit flat, especially with our the ability to see my friends.

I'm struggling with this, so I can only imagine how those without ceremonies feel. So, Reddit, how can I move on? How can those without ceremonies leave the hell-hole known as high school goodbye once and for all?",02May2020,1
114,"I LOVE my family. I dont think many people LOVE their families, or are as attached to them as I am. This, I have come to find out is especially true with my friends. Maybe this is partially because  I am yet not financially stable, so my dad helps me out a lot, but I honestly would give anything for them, even if I had a job. Im a 20 year old male, college dropout, and I dont know what Im gonna do with my life yet. 

The problem is that my friends, in this one friends group I have(the one im closest with, and have spent most time with), all either are financially stable, or just despise their families. When I say despise, I mean literally one of my friends dad beats him with a belt sometimes. So I understand why he hates him. 

During these corona times, I have forced myself to stay inside and not socialize a lot. This is mostly because my mom has asthma, and several other allergies, making it almost a guaranteed risk of mortality. 

Of course as the title says, my friends dont care about this.Thet go out as they please, like there is nothing going on, and shame me for caring. 
Today they planned on drinking and smoking in a friends basement, and invited me. I agreed this time, so we where gonna be 7 people, in a tiny, smoke filled basement. But then suddenly they say my friends brothers friends is going to be there too, so we where going to be atleast 10 people there. I told them I was not coming, and they started going batshit in the groupchat. I then said that I dont care what they say, and that I care too much about my family to take risks like that. This only made them more heaty and some of them made inappropriate ""comedic"" insults(stuff like I like my family so much I have incest with them and shit), and it made me sick.
I then thought to myself these people can go to hell, and said this "" I said my piece, and I will piss sideways on anyone who doesnt respect my decisions"". I translated whats in quotation word for word from swedish, so I know it sounds weird. After that, one paricular friend, who is the one I have most problems with, continued a bit with the comedic jokes, then it stopped. Only he continued. Guess the rest understood I was furious, but he obviously didnt care.

Was this smart on my part? Could I have said something else? Or was it right? What should I do know. Should I cut my ties with them?",02May2020,1
115,"I’m posting this so I can get my thoughts together before I go to my parents and for advice if you have any. 
So I went to college to study finance because when I was a junior in high school I took a business class and it had a small unit on the stock market and I became fascinated by it. After that school year was up I spent the whole  summer researching the stock market online and reading books by people who are day traders. 
I chose to go to a state university to study finance but after first semester of sophomore year I felt like I wasn’t learning anything useful so I took a semester off to find a different school. 
I ended up going to a university in my state’s capital cuz I though that would be a good place to learn more about trading with all the big investment firms in the city. 
Well I am about to finish my first full year at the new school and I feel as if nothing has changed. What angers me is that I learned more about the stock market and how to trade in the one summer of research I did myself than I have during five semesters at college. 
I also feel as if my mental health is deteriorating cuz I’m just stressed and anxious all the time and I struggle to sleep at night cuz I’m thinking about the next big assignment or how I just got a bad grade or whatever. 
I guess I’m asking for advice on how to convey this to my parents cuz they pretty much have their minds made up that I need to get a degree.

I've designed a lot of tattoos for me over the years, looked back on some and re-drew them, looked back over some and decided they didnt have enough meaning so i scrapped them and spent a lot of time thinking over the ones that remain and i'm 100% sure i'd be happy to get any of them becuase they mean so much to me personally, they're mine, original designs with personal meaning.

But i brought up the topic today and my parents (neither have tattoos) basically said i can get them as long as they're out of sight, to which i argued that i don't see much point in having them when i wont see them often and that i'm proud to show off any one i will get.

I mentioned the hand tattoo i'd been planning and drawing over and over on my hand for years and they both said that i shouldn't get it, that tattoos look ugly and scummy, and my dad tried to make some point over how i will change and regret it but i know i wont and my mum then said how i might be 18 and able to get tattoos but that doesn't mean she cant kick me out if i do.

It just upset me, it feels disrespectful (not only to my judgement and designs that ive spent days on each time) mostly becuase its my body, and i believe my ideas, thoughts behind it and designs are exactly what i want, and if in some way my opinion just completely turns (in a way it never has, ive never doubted all the designs and plans i have remaining despite some of them being first sketched up years ago) then i'll accept it and regret that tattoo, thats fine, becuase it will still have the meaning it did before and it will still be something i made.

129,"TLDR: I get paid about $2000 every month to home share with my autistic brother but my parents don’t want him with us full time as they want control. Which I get and support. Should we give them the $2000 we get or should we keep it and use it for bills? 


 My (23F) husband (26M) and I recently started doing a home share program with my autistic brother so he would not lose his funding through the government. Basically we get paid about $2000 a month so that he can keep getting money from the government. Once you lose this money it’s nearly impossible to get back and even though he is okay right now he could need it in the future so we agreed. 

Edit: I just wanted to explain my relationship to my parents as well to see if that adds perspective. 

My mom and I have a strained relationship. I love her so much but we were abused by my moms second husband badly and I was very angry at her for a long time for not leaving the situation. I have a relationship with her now but it’s very basic. We text and sometimes go for walks but still has an odd feeling to it. I was told by a therapist this is normal for child abuse victims as they don’t develop the same love and connection as kids who come from more secure families. I can’t talk to her about anything serious though as she tells my current step dad everything and than he ends up lecturing me about it. I don’t have that level of comfort confiding in her I would love to have. 

My step dad. This is a tough relationship for me. On one hand I think he is an awesome guy. My mom loves him. He is hard working and has good morals. He stepped up to the plate with my brother and I am grateful. He has also helped my husband and I in many ways. The bad side to this is I am very afraid of him. Due to the trauma I suffered as a kid I find a lot of men terrifying to talk to. (I was sexually abused as well). My step dad came into our home when I was 16. I think he and my mom started talking when I was 14. I felt very uncomfortable from the beginning. I had not dealt with the fact that I was sexually abused by both my past step dad and my ex boyfriend. He came in with force and took over the dad role very quickly. My mom became subservient to him and basically only does as he says when it comes to dealing with my brother and life in general. I don’t think he means to be this way and I would love to have a good relationship with him but as of now I can’t talk to him. I can’t control my emotions around him as I break down fast. He once called it crocodile tears and that really affected the way I saw him. At first I thought it was me and than I realized it was also him that was the issue. There is no way I’ll probably ever have the confidence to have this talk with him so it’s just awkward and I don’t visit often. 

At first it was all good. He came and stayed with us half the month for the first month of this arrangement. We got the money and used it for bills. I felt fine with that. 

My parents stopped that as they wanted full control which I 100% understand. I am only 23 and am not ready to deal with my brother full time. I expect one day when they retire if they become unable to take care of him or he is unable to achieve independence I will become responsible which again I am 100% for. I love my brother and I want to help. 

We had a conversation recently, before I knew this wasn’t how it was meant to be set up (my brother being with us half the month wasn’t suppose to happen) and we had a talk with my step dad. He seemed very angry as if we were deceiving him for extra money. As much as the money does help, I am also helping them and in my mind I was doing the right thing. It was a very accusatory conversation where I felt I was being talked down to. I felt so bad because I was so worried I’d mess something up and now my parents thought we were doing something wrong because I misunderstood what I was supposed to do. I was told by my mom to call and what to say and it went from there at the beginning. Now they are acting like I’m stealing? I wasn’t happy.

Now we are still getting that $2000 a month as it’s direct deposited to me as per the original arrangement made with the program person we did the home share through. The lady on our case knows full well he isn’t actually staying the full month or even half the month anymore but only some weekends (although not lately due to the world wide issue going on). 

She mentioned in the meeting we might just figure out what to do as a group with the $2000/month but we didn’t not discuss actually giving them any. This money is money received like through a job for taking on responsibility and not part of the money my brother gets from the government. This is also paid through the government directly to me. 

My husband thinks since we made this agreement and my parents have not brought it up that we should just use it for bills and savings. I personally feel weird using it as we are not fully doing what we are getting paid to do. It’s also not our fault this isn’t happening though. 

Should we give the money to my parents every month? Or should we just keep using it for bills? AITA in this situation?",02May2020,1

I had not dealt with the fact that I was sexually abused by both my past step dad and my ex boyfriend. He came in with force and took over the dad role very quickly. My mom became subservient to him and basically only does as he says when it comes to dealing with my brother and life in general. I don’t think he means to be this way and I would love to have a good relationship with him but as of now I can’t talk to him. I can’t control my emotions around him as I break down fast. He once called it crocodile tears and that really affected the way I saw him. At first I thought it was me and than I realized it was also him that was the issue. There is no way I’ll probably ever have the confidence to have this talk with him so it’s just awkward and I don’t visit often. 

At first it was all good. He came and stayed with us half the month for the first month of this arrangement. We got the money and used it for bills. I felt fine with that. 

My parents stopped that as they wanted full control which I 100% understand. I am only 23 and am not ready to deal with my brother full time. I expect one day when they retire if they become unable to take care of him or he is unable to achieve independence I will become responsible which again I am 100% for. I love my brother and I want to help. 

We had a conversation recently, before I knew this wasn’t how it was meant to be set up (my brother being with us half the month wasn’t suppose to happen) and we had a talk with my step dad. He seemed very angry as if we were deceiving him for extra money. As much as the money does help, I am also helping them and in my mind I was doing the right thing. It was a very accusatory conversation where I felt I was being talked down to. I felt so bad because I was so worried I’d mess something up and now my parents thought we were doing something wrong because I misunderstood what I was supposed to do. I was told by my mom to call and what to say and it went from there at the beginning. Now they are acting like I’m stealing? I wasn’t happy.

Now we are still getting that $2000 a month as it’s direct deposited to me as per the original arrangement made with the program person we did the home share through. The lady on our case knows full well he isn’t actually staying the full month or even half the month anymore but only some weekends (although not lately due to the world wide issue going on). 

She mentioned in the meeting we might just figure out what to do as a group with the $2000/month but we didn’t not discuss actually giving them any. This money is money received like through a job for taking on responsibility and not part of the money my brother gets from the government. This is also paid through the government directly to me. 

My husband thinks since we made this agreement and my parents have not brought it up that we should just use it for bills and savings. I personally feel weird using it as we are not fully doing what we are getting paid to do. It’s also not our fault this isn’t happening though. 

Should we give the money to my parents every month? Or should we just keep using it for bills? AITA in this situation?",02May2020,1

139,"I LOVE my family. I dont think many people LOVE their families, or are as attached to them as I am. This, I have come to find out is especially true with my friends. Maybe this is partially because  I am yet not financially stable, so my dad helps me out a lot, but I honestly would give anything for them, even if I had a job. Im a 20 year old male, college dropout, and I dont know what Im gonna do with my life yet. 

The problem is that my friends, in this one friends group I have(the one im closest with, and have spent most time with), all either are financially stable, or just despise their families. When I say despise, I mean literally one of my friends dad beats him with a belt sometimes. So I understand why he hates him. 

During these corona times, I have forced myself to stay inside and not socialize a lot. This is mostly because my mom has asthma, and several other allergies, making it almost a guaranteed risk of mortality. 

Of course as the title says, my friends dont care about this.Thet go out as they please, like there is nothing going on, and shame me for caring. 
Today they planned on drinking and smoking in a friends basement, and invited me. I agreed this time, so we where gonna be 7 people, in a tiny, smoke filled basement. But then suddenly they say my friends brothers friends is going to be there too, so we where going to be atleast 10 people there. I told them I was not coming, and they started going batshit in the groupchat. I then said that I dont care what they say, and that I care too much about my family to take risks like that. This only made them more heaty and some of them made inappropriate ""comedic"" insults(stuff like I like my family so much I have incest with them and shit), and it made me sick.
I then thought to myself these people can go to hell, and said this "" I said my piece, and I will piss sideways on anyone who doesnt respect my decisions"". I translated whats in quotation word for word from swedish, so I know it sounds weird. After that, one paricular friend, who is the one I have most problems with, continued a bit with the comedic jokes, then it stopped. Only he continued. Guess the rest understood I was furious, but he obviously didnt care.

Was this smart on my part? Could I have said something else? Or was it right? What should I do know. Should I cut my ties with them?",02May2020,1

152,"TLDR: I get paid about $2000 every month to home share with my autistic brother but my parents don’t want him with us full time as they want control. Which I get and support. Should we give them the $2000 we get or should we keep it and use it for bills? 


 My (23F) husband (26M) and I recently started doing a home share program with my autistic brother so he would not lose his funding through the government. Basically we get paid about $2000 a month so that he can keep getting money from the government. Once you lose this money it’s nearly impossible to get back and even though he is okay right now he could need it in the future so we agreed. 

Edit: I just wanted to explain my relationship to my parents as well to see if that adds perspective. 

My mom and I have a strained relationship. I love her so much but we were abused by my moms second husband badly and I was very angry at her for a long time for not leaving the situation. I have a relationship with her now but it’s very basic. We text and sometimes go for walks but still has an odd feeling to it. I was told by a therapist this is normal for child abuse victims as they don’t develop the same love and connection as kids who come from more secure families. I can’t talk to her about anything serious though as she tells my current step dad everything and than he ends up lecturing me about it. I don’t have that level of comfort confiding in her I would love to have. 

My step dad. This is a tough relationship for me. On one hand I think he is an awesome guy. My mom loves him. He is hard working and has good morals. He stepped up to the plate with my brother and I am grateful. He has also helped my husband and I in many ways. The bad side to this is I am very afraid of him. Due to the trauma I suffered as a kid I find a lot of men terrifying to talk to. (I was sexually abused as well). My step dad came into our home when I was 16.

My boyfriend and I got together through an affair on both our parts. We have since both left our marriages and also personally repaired our friendships with our former spouses. My boyfriend and his ex wife were together for many years, and therefore the families are very intertwined. They are remaining close friends and would like to continue some transitions, with myself and her new partner being added. I know, sounds crazy but we are all trying to make the best of the situation my boyfriend and I’s indiscretion got us into. 

So, to where I need advice!  

He’s asked me to reach out to his ex wife, via text. Thinking it would be best if we talked and saw each other again, just the two of us... Before we are put in the situation with family and kids around. That way if anything goes south, it stays private. But I have no clue what to say, or where to start. 

How do you text someone whose life you turned upside down and try to be “friends” or whatever you want to call it. 

We haven’t spoken since shortly after everything came out, and it wasn’t pretty. But it’s been over a year since then, and I believe everyone has come to terms with the new situation.

The article was about Harry potter plot holes and there were quite a lot of them. Some were minor holes and errors, but there were holes that were really big, putting the whole storyline in question. 

I was shocked and searched the internet for a while. most people said that although HP series is a lot of fun, there are many continuity errors in the book, probably more than other famous fiction series. I was disappointed. 

I like stories a lot. I like plunging into a new world, feeling with the characters, enjoying foreshadowings and twists. and I have great stories to look forward to, such as novels like ‘A song of ice and fire’ and video games like ‘to the moon’. 

But after I read the article, I feel like I cannot enjoy those anymore, because I know that there will be at least one minor plot hole in the story and maybe a big one too. I was bothered by the fact that no matter how exciting a story is, there will be illogical events happening in the story and it will bother me to not enjoying it.

159,"To start, I am very fortunate that my state and district is even having a ceremony. I know most people aren't, so I feel really blessed to have that opportunity. However, I feel that the feeling of ""being ripped off"" isn't mutual to either situation. In short, my district is having the graduation on the day it was originally planned (after moving the date to two possible dates in June and July, which caught many people off-guard) and having it in a big arena where parents will watch on from cars (one car per graduate). Students will still walk (thank goodness), but seats will be placed six feet apart, everyone will wear masks, all speeches will be pre-recorded, and the principal etc will be social distancing as well.

Though the event itself isn't my concern, it's a part of the ""problem"" for me. The thing is, I've had a heck of a hard four years and I need something to make myself feel some solace in the fact that I did it and am moving forward. I need something to let go of the past I've gripped onto for so long. I've come up with a few ideas, but they seem to fall a bit flat, especially with our the ability to see my friends.

I'm struggling with this, so I can only imagine how those without ceremonies feel. So, Reddit, how can I move on? How can those without ceremonies leave the hell-hole known as high school goodbye once and for all?",02May2020,1
160,"I recently read a article about Harry potter, one of my favorite series that I read 6 years ago.

The article was about Harry potter plot holes and there were quite a lot of them. Some were minor holes and errors, but there were holes that were really big, putting the whole storyline in question. 

I was shocked and searched the internet for a while. most people said that although HP series is a lot of fun, there are many continuity errors in the book, probably more than other famous fiction series. I was disappointed. 

I like stories a lot. I like plunging into a new world, feeling with the characters, enjoying foreshadowings and twists. and I have great stories to look forward to, such as novels like ‘A song of ice and fire’ and video games like ‘to the moon’. 

But after I read the article, I feel like I cannot enjoy those anymore, because I know that there will be at least one minor plot hole in the story and maybe a big one too. I was bothered by the fact that no matter how exciting a story is, there will be illogical events happening in the story and it will bother me to not enjoying it. 

What should I do? Is there some stories with no plot holes? or should I ignore the minor ones and just enjoy the flow?

I am soooooo bothered about this. Please give me advice :(",02May2020,1

(I'm on an art course, i run insta art accs, i make comics and i'm practising tattooing) I've just always loved tattoos, ever since i was a kid, the idea that my creation could be displayed permanently and not just as a pen design on my arm was always amazing.

I've designed a lot of tattoos for me over the years (and for others), looked back on some and re-drew them, looked back over some and decided they didnt have enough meaning so i scrapped them and spent a lot of time thinking over the ones that remain and i'm 100% sure i'd be happy to get any of them becuase they mean so much to me personally, they're mine, original designs with personal meaning.

But i brought up the topic today and my parents (neither have tattoos) basically said i can get them as long as they're out of sight, to which i argued that i don't see much point in having them when i wont see them often and that i'm proud to show off any one i will get. (I also plan chest tattoos and such, but personally i think tattoos can be tasteful on any part of the body as long as you know and understand what will look good placed where)

I mentioned the hand tattoo i'd been planning and drawing over and over on my hand for years (that i'd got a lot of compliments on, including by then) and they both said that i shouldn't get it, that tattoos look ugly and scummy, and my dad tried to make some point over how i will change and regret it but i know i wont and my mum then said how i might be 18 and able to get tattoos but that doesn't mean she cant kick me out if i do.

It just upset me, it feels disrespectful (not only to my judgement and designs that ive spent days on each time) mostly becuase its my body, and i believe my ideas, thoughts behind it and designs are exactly what i want, and if in some way my opinion just completely turns (in a way it never has, ive never doubted all the designs and plans i have remaining despite some of them being first sketched up years ago) then i'll accept it and regret that tattoo, thats fine, becuase it will still have the meaning it did before and it will still be something i made.

I already have an Associate's in business that has done absolutely nothing for me. I dropped out of University long ago with 50% of a fine arts degree completed. I've been working as a waitress since I got my business degree and feel very skeptical and disillusioned about college. I know this might be my only chance to get a real career. 

My question is, should I finish my art degree since it's quicker or should I start from scratch and get a degree that could actually get my a real career? I am interested in healthcare, teaching, biology, nutrition.. is there any degree along those paths that would give me a sure shot at a career within 4 years? I won't be able to afford any extra schooling.

And I think the reason I don't like the idea of being made fun of is that I don't like the idea of being a victim of harassment.

The only times I did get teased was for dumb shit I said/did (which wasn't a lot), and it only lasted for a day. In other words, I'm not constantly getting teased. I was never assaulted physically, so thats out of the question. Am I being bullied if I get teased for a day and then everyone stops?

Now, my family isn’t exactly fundamentalist.

Maybe I can find Bible verses on pride and humbleness and use them as examples as to why I’m not “proclaiming my faith to the world,” or something like that.

I LOVE my family. I dont think many people LOVE their families, or are as attached to them as I am. This, I have come to find out is especially true with my friends.

Im a 20 year old male, college dropout, and I dont know what Im gonna do with my life yet.

The problem is that my friends, in this one friends group I have(the one im closest with, and have spent most time with), all either are financially stable, or just despise their families. When I say despise, I mean literally one of my friends dad beats him with a belt sometimes. So I understand why he hates him.

During these corona times, I have forced myself to stay inside and not socialize a lot. This is mostly because my mom has asthma, and several other allergies, making it almost a guaranteed risk of mortality.

Of course as the title says, my friends dont care about this.Thet go out as they please, like there is nothing going on, and shame me for caring.  
Today they planned on drinking and smoking in a friends basement, and invited me. I agreed this time, so we where gonna be 7 people, in a tiny, smoke filled basement. But then suddenly they say my friends brothers friends is going to be there too, so we where going to be atleast 10 people there. I told them I was not coming, and they started going batshit in the groupchat. I then said that I dont care what they say, and that I care too much about my family to take risks like that. This only made them more heaty and some of them made inappropriate ""comedic"" insults(stuff like I like my family so much I have incest with them and shit), and it made me sick.

I LOVE my family. I dont think many people LOVE their families, or are as attached to them as I am. This, I have come to find out is especially true with my friends. Maybe this is partially because  I am yet not financially stable, so my dad helps me out a lot, but I honestly would give anything for them, even if I had a job. Im a 20 year old male, college dropout, and I dont know what Im gonna do with my life yet.

The problem is that my friends, in this one friends group I have(the one im closest with, and have spent most time with), all either are financially stable, or just despise their families. When I say despise, I mean literally one of my friends dad beats him with a belt sometimes. So I understand why he hates him.

During these corona times, I have forced myself to stay inside and not socialize a lot. This is mostly because my mom has asthma, and several other allergies, making it almost a guaranteed risk of mortality.

Of course as the title says, my friends dont care about this.Thet go out as they please, like there is nothing going on, and shame me for caring.  
Today they planned on drinking and smoking in a friends basement, and invited me. I agreed this time, so we where gonna be 7 people, in a tiny, smoke filled basement. But then suddenly they say my friends brothers friends is going to be there too, so we where going to be atleast 10 people there.

199,"I'm 17 and i plan on getting atleast 1 tattoo the day i turn 18 becuase they've always been amazing and important to me, they just hold so much value, mostly becuase i spend a lot of time drawing and doing art in general. (I'm on an art course, i run insta art accs, i make comics and i'm practising tattooing) I've just always loved tattoos, ever since i was a kid, the idea that my creation could be displayed permanently and not just as a pen design on my arm was always amazing.

I've designed a lot of tattoos for me over the years (and for others), looked back on some and re-drew them, looked back over some and decided they didnt have enough meaning so i scrapped them and spent a lot of time thinking over the ones that remain and i'm 100% sure i'd be happy to get any of them becuase they mean so much to me personally, they're mine, original designs with personal meaning.

But i brought up the topic today and my parents (neither have tattoos) basically said i can get them as long as they're out of sight, to which i argued that i don't see much point in having them when i wont see them often and that i'm proud to show off any one i will get. (I also plan chest tattoos and such, but personally i think tattoos can be tasteful on any part of the body as long as you know and understand what will look good placed where)

I mentioned the hand tattoo i'd been planning and drawing over and over on my hand for years (that i'd got a lot of compliments on, including by then) and they both said that i shouldn't get it, that tattoos look ugly and scummy, and my dad tried to make some point over how i will change and regret it but i know i wont and my mum then said how i might be 18 and able to get tattoos but that doesn't mean she cant kick me out if i do.

It just upset me, it feels disrespectful (not only to my judgement and designs that ive spent days on each time) mostly becuase its my body, and i believe my ideas, thoughts behind it and designs are exactly what i want, and if in some way my opinion just completely turns (in a way it never has, ive never doubted all the designs and plans i have remaining despite some of them being first sketched up years ago) then i'll accept it and regret that tattoo, thats fine, becuase it will still have the meaning it did before and it will still be something i made.

I just feel they're making a judgement over something that isn't their problem at all

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle it? I dont want to make them disappointed like they said they would be if i got any without consulting them but i also know they'd tell me not to get half the tattoos im planning on getting if i ask first.",02May2020,1

212,"I've made some really stupid decisions lately. I'm 14F and this boy (let's call him Anthony) is 15. It all started when he commented on my post about my crush. I later asked Anthony to dm me. I think we talked on Reddit for a week. Idk why but I told him that I liked him. Ik it was pretty stupid to tell him that. He said that I can have his insta if I want to. And I agreed. We both followed each other there. My insta bio includes the high school I go to and my snap and a link to my VSCO.

Anyways it was really late when we started following each other. So I think we dmed each other for an hour there and got to know each other. After that, I went to bed and said that I'll talk to him tomorrow. The next day, I texted him hi and he also replied with that. After 2 hours or so, I blocked him. Idk what went through my mind but I just blocked him. I ended up unblocking him after 4 hours. I apologized to him for blocking him and stuff. 

I think he got really mad at me since I blocked him or he was probably mad bc of a different reason. After apologizing several times, I ended up dming him that I have a crush on him even though I didn't. It was the most stupidest decision I could have ever made. I asked Anthony out just so I could move on from the boy who I had been crushing on for 6 months. Anyways, Anthony obviously rejected me. 

Idk when he started threatening me that he'll report me to the local police. It was either that day or the next. Idk why I got scared when Anthony said he'll report me. I think I got scared thinking my parents will find out that I'm texting a boy (btw I'm not allowed to text boys). But, there was no point of getting scared since I didn't lie about anything. Anyways I asked Anthony if he wants to talk to my best friend and let's call her Emma. He agreed. So, I ended up telling Emma about everything that happened. Emma later dmed Anthony and she was honestly being really rude to Anthony. She also threatened to wack him in the nuts. Btw she didn't mean anything she said. I think Anthony later realized that I didn't lie about anything. But, he said he'll still report my friend.

Anthony and I didn't talk for a week or something. But, a question was bothering me a lot. I wanted to ask him why he gave his insta if he didn't trust me. So I ended up dming him and he replied. He answered my question and asked me to leave him alone.

I was going to leave Anthony alone. But, this fucking creep dmed me saying his dick is hard bc he is thinking hard about me. So, I sent Anthony ss of the entire chat. Anthony said that he dmed the creep. When I asked him what he dmed the creep, I think Anthony asked me to leave him alone. Me being stupid I started dming him whenever I received dms from creeps.

Let's fast forward to the most recent creep. Let's call this creep Jason. Jason is 23 and he's a doctor. So I created a post on a subreddit in which I said I wanted to give up in life. Honestly, my life is a mess right now. But I clearly mentioned in that post that I'm not courageous enough to commit suicide. Anyways Jason found my account from that post. And he dmed me for a few days. I told Anthony about Jason. I also sent Anthony an ss of the post in which Jason found my account. I think Anthony dmed that guy. But, Anthony later asked me to leave him alone bc of personal reasons. And that's when things changed.

That day, Anthony created several posts on his reddit account about me. Those posts were half fictional. Idk but that actually made me really mad. So I dmed him about it. I asked him why he did that. He said that he was worried about me. Anthony ended up thinking that I'm suicidal. I told him that I'm NEVER going to commit suicide.

From that day, he started being really nice. He said that we both can talk. So, I took it's been a week or something since we were talking normally. Yesterday, I mentioned to Anthony that I recently started using discord and that I'm only in one server. Anthony later asked me to send a link to that server so he could also join that. I sent him the link and someone immediately joined the server. Anthony told me that the link didn't work and he doesn't want to join the server anymore.

And guess what. This morning I found out who the person was who joined that server. It was Anthony's brother. Let's call him Edward. So, Edward ended up talking about me and Anthony. He didn't know I was on the server. So, Edward was basically asking for advice on that server about his brother (Anthony). Edward said that he is really worried about Anthony. I told Anthony that his brother joined the server I'm on and that he's talking about us. Anthony asked me to ignore him. I just decided to reply to Edward's messages on the server. I told Edward that he should report the girl (me) to the police and he should block her on his brother's phone. Edward said that he can't steal Anthony's phone.

Edward later ended up dming me on Reddit. As I told you guys earlier, Edward didn't know I was on the server. Anyways, so Edward asked me to stop talking to Anthony since Anthony has a lot going on in his life. So, I agreed. I told him that I won't talk to Anthony anymore. I later dmed Anthony on Instagram and told him that we should stop talking. So, Anthony agreed. He later blocked me.

A few hours later, I made a post here saying how I have trouble moving on from people and stuff. Idk how but Anthony ended up seeing that post. So as a result, he unblocked me on Instagram. Told me why he blocked me even though I already knew that. He told me to not message him.

Anthony later made posts about me saying how he feels guilty about all this. I was actually really annoyed when I saw those posts. So I asked him to stop making posts about me and that he shouldn't be guilty at all. He said that he needs advice and that he's shaking bc of all this. And I told him I feel the same way about all of this. 

Now I'm not going to bother him anymore. I feel like crying right now. I'm honestly the worst decision-maker. I regret doing everything I did. Idk what to do anymore. I do want to apologize for every single thing I did. But I can't. I don't want to bother him anymore. I just feel horrible. This whole situation has given me a severe headache. Bc of all this I'm having trouble focusing on my online classes. Anthony believes that I'm obsessed with him even though I'm not. I've never had a crush on him. Idk how to explain things to him. My best friend already hates Anthony a lot. So I can't ask her for any advice on this situation. Emily asked me to stop talking to Anthony since the time she dmed him. But, I still didn't listen to her. None of my other friends know about this. I feel like a terrible person right now. Idk how to apologize for my actions. Anthony is probably going to get really mad if I apologize.

Guys please help me out and give me advice. Any advice would be appreciated.",02May2020,1

That day, Anthony created several posts on his reddit account about me. Those posts were half fictional. Idk but that actually made me really mad. So I dmed him about it. I asked him why he did that. He said that he was worried about me. Anthony ended up thinking that I'm suicidal. I told him that I'm NEVER going to commit suicide.

From that day, he started being really nice. He said that we both can talk. So, I took it's been a week or something since we were talking normally. Yesterday, I mentioned to Anthony that I recently started using discord and that I'm only in one server. Anthony later asked me to send a link to that server so he could also join that. I sent him the link and someone immediately joined the server. Anthony told me that the link didn't work and he doesn't want to join the server anymore.

And guess what. This morning I found out who the person was who joined that server. It was Anthony's brother. Let's call him Edward. So, Edward ended up talking about me and Anthony. He didn't know I was on the server. So, Edward was basically asking for advice on that server about his brother (Anthony). Edward said that he is really worried about Anthony. I told Anthony that his brother joined the server I'm on and that he's talking about us. Anthony asked me to ignore him. I just decided to reply to Edward's messages on the server. I told Edward that he should report the girl (me) to the police and he should block her on his brother's phone. Edward said that he can't steal Anthony's phone.

Edward later ended up dming me on Reddit. As I told you guys earlier, Edward didn't know I was on the server. Anyways, so Edward asked me to stop talking to Anthony since Anthony has a lot going on in his life. So, I agreed. I told him that I won't talk to Anthony anymore. I later dmed Anthony on Instagram and told him that we should stop talking. So, Anthony agreed. He later blocked me.

A few hours later, I made a post here saying how I have trouble moving on from people and stuff. Idk how but Anthony ended up seeing that post. So as a result, he unblocked me on Instagram. Told me why he blocked me even though I already knew that. He told me to not message him.

Anthony later made posts about me saying how he feels guilty about all this. I was actually really annoyed when I saw those posts. So I asked him to stop making posts about me and that he shouldn't be guilty at all. He said that he needs advice and that he's shaking bc of all this. And I told him I feel the same way about all of this. 

Now I'm not going to bother him anymore. I feel like crying right now. I'm honestly the worst decision-maker. I regret doing everything I did. Idk what to do anymore. I do want to apologize for every single thing I did. But I can't. I don't want to bother him anymore. I just feel horrible. This whole situation has given me a severe headache. Bc of all this I'm having trouble focusing on my online classes. Anthony believes that I'm obsessed with him even though I'm not. I've never had a crush on him. Idk how to explain things to him. My best friend already hates Anthony a lot. So I can't ask her for any advice on this situation. Emily asked me to stop talking to Anthony since the time she dmed him. But, I still didn't listen to her. None of my other friends know about this. I feel like a terrible person right now. Idk how to apologize for my actions. Anthony is probably going to get really mad if I apologize.

Guys please help me out and give me advice. Any advice would be appreciated.",02May2020,1
214,"I've made some really stupid decisions lately. I'm 14F and this boy (let's call him Anthony) is 15. It all started when he commented on my post about my crush. I later asked Anthony to dm me. I think we talked on Reddit for a week. Idk why but I told him that I liked him. Ik it was pretty stupid to tell him that. He said that I can have his insta if I want to. And I agreed. We both followed each other there. My insta bio includes the high school I go to and my snap and a link to my VSCO.

Anyways it was really late when we started following each other. So I think we dmed each other for an hour there and got to know each other. After that, I went to bed and said that I'll talk to him tomorrow. The next day, I texted him hi and he also replied with that. After 2 hours or so, I blocked him. Idk what went through my mind but I just blocked him. I ended up unblocking him after 4 hours. I apologized to him for blocking him and stuff. 

I think he got really mad at me since I blocked him or he was probably mad bc of a different reason. After apologizing several times, I ended up dming him that I have a crush on him even though I didn't. It was the most stupidest decision I could have ever made. I asked Anthony out just so I could move on from the boy who I had been crushing on for 6 months. Anyways, Anthony obviously rejected me. 

Idk when he started threatening me that he'll report me to the local police. It was either that day or the next. Idk why I got scared when Anthony said he'll report me. I think I got scared thinking my parents will find out that I'm texting a boy (btw I'm not allowed to text boys). But, there was no point of getting scared since I didn't lie about anything. Anyways I asked Anthony if he wants to talk to my best friend and let's call her Emma. He agreed. So, I ended up telling Emma about everything that happened. Emma later dmed Anthony and she was honestly being really rude to Anthony. She also threatened to wack him in the nuts. Btw she didn't mean anything she said. I think Anthony later realized that I didn't lie about anything. But, he said he'll still report my friend.

Anthony and I didn't talk for a week or something. But, a question was bothering me a lot. I wanted to ask him why he gave his insta if he didn't trust me. So I ended up dming him and he replied. He answered my question and asked me to leave him alone.

I was going to leave Anthony alone. But, this fucking creep dmed me saying his dick is hard bc he is thinking hard about me. So, I sent Anthony ss of the entire chat. Anthony said that he dmed the creep. When I asked him what he dmed the creep, I think Anthony asked me to leave him alone. Me being stupid I started dming him whenever I received dms from creeps.

Let's fast forward to the most recent creep. Let's call this creep Jason. Jason is 23 and he's a doctor. So I created a post on a subreddit in which I said I wanted to give up in life. Honestly, my life is a mess right now. But I clearly mentioned in that post that I'm not courageous enough to commit suicide. Anyways Jason found my account from that post. And he dmed me for a few days. I told Anthony about Jason. I also sent Anthony an ss of the post in which Jason found my account. I think Anthony dmed that guy.

I think he got really mad at me since I blocked him or he was probably mad bc of a different reason. After apologizing several times, I ended up dming him that I have a crush on him even though I didn't. It was the most stupidest decision I could have ever made. I asked Anthony out just so I could move on from the boy who I had been crushing on for 6 months. Anyways, Anthony obviously rejected me. 

Idk when he started threatening me that he'll report me to the local police. It was either that day or the next. Idk why I got scared when Anthony said he'll report me. I think I got scared thinking my parents will find out that I'm texting a boy (btw I'm not allowed to text boys). But, there was no point of getting scared since I didn't lie about anything. Anyways I asked Anthony if he wants to talk to my best friend and let's call her Emma. He agreed. So, I ended up telling Emma about everything that happened. Emma later dmed Anthony and she was honestly being really rude to Anthony. She also threatened to wack him in the nuts. Btw she didn't mean anything she said. I think Anthony later realized that I didn't lie about anything. But, he said he'll still report my friend.

Anthony and I didn't talk for a week or something. But, a question was bothering me a lot. I wanted to ask him why he gave his insta if he didn't trust me. So I ended up dming him and he replied. He answered my question and asked me to leave him alone.

I was going to leave Anthony alone. But, this fucking creep dmed me saying his dick is hard bc he is thinking hard about me. So, I sent Anthony ss of the entire chat. Anthony said that he dmed the creep. When I asked him what he dmed the creep, I think Anthony asked me to leave him alone. Me being stupid I started dming him whenever I received dms from creeps.

Let's fast forward to the most recent creep. Let's call this creep Jason. Jason is 23 and he's a doctor. So I created a post on a subreddit in which I said I wanted to give up in life. Honestly, my life is a mess right now. But I clearly mentioned in that post that I'm not courageous enough to commit suicide. Anyways Jason found my account from that post. And he dmed me for a few days. I told Anthony about Jason. I also sent Anthony an ss of the post in which Jason found my account. I think Anthony dmed that guy. But, Anthony later asked me to leave him alone bc of personal reasons. And that's when things changed.

That day, Anthony created several posts on his reddit account about me. Those posts were half fictional. Idk but that actually made me really mad. So I dmed him about it. I asked him why he did that. He said that he was worried about me. Anthony ended up thinking that I'm suicidal. I told him that I'm NEVER going to commit suicide.

From that day, he started being really nice. He said that we both can talk. So, I took it's been a week or something since we were talking normally. Yesterday, I mentioned to Anthony that I recently started using discord and that I'm only in one server. Anthony later asked me to send a link to that server so he could also join that. I sent him the link and someone immediately joined the server. Anthony told me that the link didn't work and he doesn't want to join the server anymore.

And guess what. This morning I found out who the person was who joined that server. It was Anthony's brother. Let's call him Edward. So, Edward ended up talking about me and Anthony. He didn't know I was on the server. So, Edward was basically asking for advice on that server about his brother (Anthony). Edward said that he is really worried about Anthony. I told Anthony that his brother joined the server I'm on and that he's talking about us. Anthony asked me to ignore him. I just decided to reply to Edward's messages on the server. I told Edward that he should report the girl (me) to the police and he should block her on his brother's phone. Edward said that he can't steal Anthony's phone.

Edward later ended up dming me on Reddit. As I told you guys earlier, Edward didn't know I was on the server. Anyways, so Edward asked me to stop talking to Anthony since Anthony has a lot going on in his life. So, I agreed. I told him that I won't talk to Anthony anymore. I later dmed Anthony on Instagram and told him that we should stop talking. So, Anthony agreed. He later blocked me.

A few hours later, I made a post here saying how I have trouble moving on from people and stuff. Idk how but Anthony ended up seeing that post. So as a result, he unblocked me on Instagram. Told me why he blocked me even though I already knew that. He told me to not message him.

Anthony later made posts about me saying how he feels guilty about all this. I was actually really annoyed when I saw those posts. So I asked him to stop making posts about me and that he shouldn't be guilty at all. He said that he needs advice and that he's shaking bc of all this. And I told him I feel the same way about all of this. 

Now I'm not going to bother him anymore. I feel like crying right now. I'm honestly the worst decision-maker. I regret doing everything I did. Idk what to do anymore. I do want to apologize for every single thing I did. But I can't. I don't want to bother him anymore. I just feel horrible. This whole situation has given me a severe headache. Bc of all this I'm having trouble focusing on my online classes. Anthony believes that I'm obsessed with him even though I'm not. I've never had a crush on him. Idk how to explain things to him. My best friend already hates Anthony a lot. So I can't ask her for any advice on this situation. Emily asked me to stop talking to Anthony since the time she dmed him. But, I still didn't listen to her. None of my other friends know about this. I feel like a terrible person right now. Idk how to apologize for my actions. Anthony is probably going to get really mad if I apologize.

Guys please help me out and give me advice. Any advice would be appreciated.",02May2020,1

Yesterday, I mentioned to Anthony that I recently started using discord and that I'm only in one server. Anthony later asked me to send a link to that server so he could also join that. I sent him the link and someone immediately joined the server. Anthony told me that the link didn't work and he doesn't want to join the server anymore.
And guess what. This morning I found out who the person was who joined that server. It was Anthony's brother. Let's call him Edward. So, Edward ended up talking about me and Anthony. He didn't know I was on the server. So, Edward was basically asking for advice on that server about his brother (Anthony). Edward said that he is really worried about Anthony. I told Anthony that his brother joined the server I'm on and that he's talking about us. Anthony asked me to ignore him. I just decided to reply to Edward's messages on the server. I told Edward that he should report the girl (me) to the police and he should block her on his brother's phone. Edward said that he can't steal Anthony's phone.


Edward later ended up texting me on Reddit. As I told you guys earlier, Edward didn't know I was on the server. Anyways, so Edward asked me to stop talking to Anthony since Anthony has a lot going on in his life. So, I agreed. I told him that I won't talk to Anthony anymore. I later texted Anthony on Instagram and told him that we should stop talking. So, Anthony agreed. He later blocked me.


A few hours later, I made a post here saying how I have trouble moving on from people and stuff. Idk how but Anthony ended up seeing that post. So as a result, he unblocked me on Instagram. He told me why he blocked me even though I already knew that. He told me to not message him.


Anthony later made posts about me saying how he feels guilty about all this. I was actually really annoyed when I saw those posts. So I asked him to stop making posts about me and that he shouldn't be guilty at all. He said that he needs advice and that he's shaking bc of all this. And I told him I feel the same way about all of this.


Now I'm not going to bother him anymore. I feel like crying right now. I'm honestly the worst decision-maker. I regret doing everything I did. Idk what to do anymore. I do want to apologize for every single thing I did. But I can't. I don't want to bother him anymore. I just feel horrible. This whole situation has given me a severe headache. Bc of all this I'm having trouble focusing on my online classes. Anthony believes that I'm obsessed with him even though I'm not. I've never had a crush on him. Idk how to explain things to him. My best friend already hates Anthony a lot. So I can't ask her for any advice on this situation. Emily asked me to stop talking to Anthony since the time she texted him. But, I still didn't listen to her. None of my other friends know about this. I feel like a terrible person right now. Idk how to apologize for my actions. Anthony is probably going to get really mad if I apologize.


Guys please help me out and give me advice. Any advice would be appreciated.",02May2020,1
225,"I've made some really stupid decisions lately. I'm 14F and this boy (let's call him Anthony) is 15. It all started when he commented on my post about my crush. I later asked Anthony to dm me. I think we talked on Reddit for a week. Idk why but I told him that I liked him. Ik it was pretty stupid to tell him that. He said that I can have his Instagram if I want to. And I agreed. We both followed each other there. My Instagram bio includes the high school I go to and my snap and a link to my VSCO.


Anyways it was really late when we started following each other. So I think we texted each other for an hour there and got to know each other. After that, I went to bed and said that I'll talk to him tomorrow. The next day, I texted him hi and he also replied with that. After 2 hours or so, I blocked him. Idk what went through my mind but I just blocked him. I ended up unblocking him after 4 hours. I apologized to him for blocking him and stuff.


I think he got really mad at me since I blocked him or he was probably mad bc of a different reason. After apologizing several times, I ended up texting him that I have a crush on him even though I didn't. It was the stupidest decision I could have ever made. I asked Anthony out just so I could move on from the boy who I had been crushing on for 6 months. Anyways, Anthony obviously rejected me.


Idk when he started threatening me that he'll report me to the local police. It was either that day or the next. Idk why I got scared when Anthony said he'll report me. I think I got scared thinking my parents will find out that I'm texting a boy (btw I'm not allowed to text boys). But, there was no point of getting scared since I didn't lie about anything. Anyways I asked Anthony if he wants to talk to my best friend and let's call her Emma. He agreed. So, I ended up telling Emma about everything that happened. Emma later texted Anthony and she was honestly being really rude to Anthony. She also threatened to wack him in the nuts. Btw she didn't mean anything she said. I think Anthony later realized that I didn't lie about anything. But, he said he'll still report my friend.
Anthony and I didn't talk for a week or something. But, a question was bothering me a lot. I wanted to ask him why he gave his Instagram if he didn't trust me. So I ended up texting him and he replied. He answered my question and asked me to leave him alone.


I was going to leave Anthony alone. But, this fucking creep texted me saying his dick is hard bc he is thinking hard about me. So, I sent Anthony ss of the entire chat. Anthony said that he texted the creep. When I asked him what he texted the creep, I think Anthony asked me to leave him alone. Me being stupid I started texting him whenever I received direct messages from creeps.


Let's fast forward to the most recent creep. Let's call this creep Jason. Jason is 23 and he's a doctor. So I created a post on a subreddit in which I said I wanted to give up in life. Honestly, my life is a mess right now. But I clearly mentioned in that post that I'm not courageous enough to commit suicide. Anyways Jason found my account from that post. And he texted me for a few days. I told Anthony about Jason. I also sent Anthony an ss of the post in which Jason found my account. I think Anthony texted that guy. But, Anthony later asked me to leave him alone bc of personal reasons. And that's when things changed.
That day, Anthony created several posts on his Reddit account about me. Those posts were half fictional. Idk but that actually made me really mad. So I texted him about it. I asked him why he did that. He said that he was worried about me. Anthony ended up thinking that I'm suicidal. I told him that I'm NEVER going to commit suicide.

227,"Recently, a good friend of mine went off the radar and has gone completely silent towards me and the entire friend group we share.  Well, it's an exaggeration to say that he's gone completely ""silent"" but he talks and interacts with others a lot less now.  This isn't the first time he's done this, like a few months ago he got into a relationship with another guy in the friend group and just completely attached to him. 

I pointed this out back then, and we got into a bunch of arguments which placed quite a strain on us and just caused both of us to feel uncomfortable around each other for quite some time.  But ever since they broke up due to the boyfriend ghosting him, he was devastated for a month or so and I stayed around still to try and least provide him some comfort or distractions to help him get through his obvious tough time.

We were on a good track, we were talking every now and then and he interacted with the group a lot more.  I thought we were perfectly fine until now, now he's found someone else to be attached to and has already admitted his feelings and all that (This ""someone"" is someone relatively new to both me and him, we've known him for about 3 weeks).  Normally, I would be fine with this but he's doing it once again, completely neglecting others that still care for him.  He's always found someone new, fell in love with them instantly, admitted his feelings to the other person, all in the span of a single fucking week.  

We've talked about this before, and he has acknowledged that this is an unhealthy thing to do.  But day by day, he seemingly gets even closer to the new guy even though we've discussed this a million times before.  

I like being apart of my friend's life, he was someone I relied on back then when I was going through some rough times with my health.  To see him go once again and replace me and the friend group with a single person just hurts a lot.

So what do I do? I'm honestly so lost and confused at the fact that he's done this again even though he's explained to me that he tends to do this to new people.  I know that this is his mental problem as he dealt with loneliness in his past, and I want to support him with it.  But at this point, it just hurts to watch as he slowly gets closer to another person that he's known for about a week despite me giving him my best effort like he gave me his best effort back then.

I want to leave so I can gain some independence, but then again I want to stay because I genuinely believe that he's a good person when he doesn't abandon people like this. Any advice would help, thank you for reading.",02May2020,1

233,"Recently, a good friend of mine went off the radar and has gone completely silent towards me and the entire friend group we share.  Well, it's an exaggeration to say that he's gone completely ""silent"" but he talks and interacts with others a lot less now.  This isn't the first time he's done this, like a few months ago he got into a relationship with another guy in the friend group and just completely attached to him. 

I pointed this out back then, and we got into a bunch of arguments which placed quite a strain on us and just caused both of us to feel uncomfortable around each other for quite some time.  But ever since they broke up due to the boyfriend ghosting him, he was devastated for a month or so and I stayed around still to try and least provide him some comfort or distractions to help him get through his obvious tough time.

We were on a good track, we were talking every now and then and he interacted with the group a lot more.  I thought we were perfectly fine until now, now he's found someone else to be attached to and has already admitted his feelings and all that (This ""someone"" is someone relatively new to both me and him, we've known him for about 3 weeks).  Normally, I would be fine with this but he's doing it once again, completely neglecting others that still care for him.  He's always found someone new, fell in love with them instantly, admitted his feelings to the other person, all in the span of a single fucking week.  

We've talked about this before, and he has acknowledged that this is an unhealthy thing to do.  But day by day, he seemingly gets even closer to the new guy even though we've discussed this a million times before.  

I like being apart of my friend's life, he was someone I relied on back then when I was going through some rough times with my health.  To see him go once again and replace me and the friend group with a single person just hurts a lot.

We've talked about this before, and he has acknowledged that this is an unhealthy thing to do.  But day by day, he seemingly gets even closer to the new guy even though we've discussed this a million times before.  

I like being apart of my friend's life, he was someone I relied on back then when I was going through some rough times with my health.  To see him go once again and replace me and the friend group with a single person just hurts a lot.

So what do I do? I'm honestly so lost and confused at the fact that he's done this again even though he's explained to me that he tends to do this to new people.  I know that this is his mental problem as he dealt with loneliness in his past, and I want to support him with it.  But at this point, it just hurts to watch as he slowly gets closer to another person that he's known for about a week despite me giving him my best effort like he gave me his best effort back then.

I want to leave so I can gain some independence, but then again I want to stay because I genuinely believe that he's a good person when he doesn't abandon people like this. Any advice would help, thank you for reading.",02May2020,1

I’ve (23m) been working with this girl (23) in an office with just the two of us for almost a year now. We are quite different people, but have built up a great rapport and we call each other friends. 

We’ve been working from home for about a month now, and have been messaging every day. We are each often the last person the other messages before bed. The conversation is mostly banter, and sharing daily stuff that’s happening in our lives. We have the occasional deep and meaningful conversation as well.

I like this girl, I appreciate her friendship, and I am attracted to her. I don’t think we are long-term relationship material however. As I said, we’re just different people. 

But I would absolutely be up for being friends with benefits, or being somewhat physical. The thing is, i don’t know how to broach the subject. 

If she doesn’t want anything more than friendship, then I don’t want to scare her off or make things weird for her. Yet I also have no idea currently if she’s into me enough to want to try that, and so I’d like to gauge her interest somehow. 

So, how would you recommend I go about this?",02May2020,1

252,"I've made some really stupid decisions lately. I'm 14F and this boy (let's call him Anthony) is 15. It all started when he commented on my post about my crush. I later asked Anthony to dm me. I think we talked on Reddit for a week. Idk why but I told him that I liked him. Ik it was pretty stupid to tell him that. He said that I can have his Instagram if I want to. And I agreed. We both followed each other there. My Instagram bio includes the high school I go to and my snap and a link to my VSCO.

Anyways it was really late when we started following each other. So I think we texted each other for an hour there and got to know each other. After that, I went to bed and said that I'll talk to him tomorrow. The next day, I texted him hi and he also replied with that. After 2 hours or so, I blocked him. Idk what went through my mind but I just blocked him. I ended up unblocking him after 4 hours. I apologized to him for blocking him and stuff.

I think he got really mad at me since I blocked him or he was probably mad bc of a different reason. After apologizing several times, I ended up texting him that I have a crush on him even though I didn't. It was the stupidest decision I could have ever made. I asked Anthony out just so I could move on from the boy who I had been crushing on for 6 months. Anyways, Anthony obviously rejected me.

Idk when he started threatening me that he'll report me to the local police. It was either that day or the next. Idk why I got scared when Anthony said he'll report me. I think I got scared thinking my parents will find out that I'm texting a boy (btw I'm not allowed to text boys). But, there was no point of getting scared since I didn't lie about anything. Anyways I asked Anthony if he wants to talk to my best friend and let's call her Emma. He agreed. So, I ended up telling Emma about everything that happened. Emma later texted Anthony and she was honestly being really rude to Anthony. She also threatened to wack him in the nuts. Btw she didn't mean anything she said. I think Anthony later realized that I didn't lie about anything. But, he said he'll still report my friend.
Anthony and I didn't talk for a week or something. But, a question was bothering me a lot. I wanted to ask him why he gave his Instagram if he didn't trust me. So I ended up texting him and he replied. He answered my question and asked me to leave him alone.

I was going to leave Anthony alone. But, this fucking creep texted me saying his dick is hard bc he is thinking hard about me. So, I sent Anthony ss of the entire chat. Anthony said that he texted the creep. When I asked him what he texted the creep, I think Anthony asked me to leave him alone. Me being stupid I started texting him whenever I received direct messages from creeps.

Let's fast forward to the most recent creep. Let's call this creep Jason. Jason is 23 and he's a doctor. So I created a post on a subreddit in which I said I wanted to give up in life. Honestly, my life is a mess right now. But I clearly mentioned in that post that I'm not courageous enough to commit suicide. Anyways Jason found my account from that post. And he texted me for a few days. I told Anthony about Jason. I also sent Anthony an ss of the post in which Jason found my account. I think Anthony texted that guy. But, Anthony later asked me to leave him alone bc of personal reasons. And that's when things changed.
That day, Anthony created several posts on his Reddit account about me. Those posts were half fictional. Idk but that actually made me really mad. So I texted him about it. I asked him why he did that. He said that he was worried about me. Anthony ended up thinking that I'm suicidal. I told him that I'm NEVER going to commit suicide.

From that day, he started being really nice. He said that we both can talk. So, I took it's been a week or something since we were talking normally. Yesterday, I mentioned to Anthony that I recently started using discord and that I'm only in one server. Anthony later asked me to send a link to that server so he could also join that. I sent him the link and someone immediately joined the server. Anthony told me that the link didn't work and he doesn't want to join the server anymore.
And guess what. This morning I found out who the person was who joined that server. It was Anthony's brother. Let's call him Edward. So, Edward ended up talking about me and Anthony. He didn't know I was on the server. So, Edward was basically asking for advice on that server about his brother (Anthony). Edward said that he is really worried about Anthony. I told Anthony that his brother joined the server I'm on and that he's talking about us. Anthony asked me to ignore him. I just decided to reply to Edward's messages on the server. I told Edward that he should report the girl (me) to the police and he should block her on his brother's phone. Edward said that he can't steal Anthony's phone.

Edward later ended up texting me on Reddit. As I told you guys earlier, Edward didn't know I was on the server. Anyways, so Edward asked me to stop talking to Anthony since Anthony has a lot going on in his life. So, I agreed. I told him that I won't talk to Anthony anymore. I later texted Anthony on Instagram and told him that we should stop talking. So, Anthony agreed. He later blocked me.

A few hours later, I made a post here saying how I have trouble moving on from people and stuff. Idk how but Anthony ended up seeing that post. So as a result, he unblocked me on Instagram. He told me why he blocked me even though I already knew that. He told me to not message him.

Anthony later made posts about me saying how he feels guilty about all this. I was actually really annoyed when I saw those posts. So I asked him to stop making posts about me and that he shouldn't be guilty at all. He said that he needs advice and that he's shaking bc of all this. And I told him I feel the same way about all of this.

Now I'm not going to bother him anymore. I feel like crying right now. I'm honestly the worst decision-maker. I regret doing everything I did. Idk what to do anymore. I do want to apologize for every single thing I did. But I can't. I don't want to bother him anymore. I just feel horrible. This whole situation has given me a severe headache. Bc of all this I'm having trouble focusing on my online classes. Anthony believes that I'm obsessed with him even though I'm not. I've never had a crush on him. Idk how to explain things to him. My best friend already hates Anthony a lot. So I can't ask her for any advice on this situation. Emily asked me to stop talking to Anthony since the time she texted him. But, I still didn't listen to her. None of my other friends know about this. I feel like a terrible person right now. Idk how to apologize for my actions. Anthony is probably going to get really mad if I apologize.

Guys please help me out and give me advice. Any advice would be appreciated.",02May2020,1
253,"This is a confession and a request for advice. TL;DR at end.

Context:
I'm in my final year of university, about to be a high school science teacher. I'm student-teaching this semester. It's stressful, but I'm learning a lot. Then COVID happens.I don't have to be anywhere. My therapist stops sessions. I can't see my students. Cue massive depressive episode. For me, this means lots of suicidal thoughts and planning, not able to do anything hard (so, I can wash laundry or do simple assignments, but not really clean or do anything that requires lots of thought). I just stop responding to emails, stop 'teaching', don't do assignments. After a couple weeks, I'm feeling better. I get back on track. I even get some antidepressants after googling ""fastest way to get antidepressants"" and paying $100 for an internet GP. I get approved for Medicaid, which I've been trying to get for 2 years.  I start 'teaching' and doing assignments. Then another downturn.
Confession:
I'm supposed to graduate May 8th, but I haven't done key assignments required for that to happen. My professor knows, obviously, but I'm not able to tell anyone in my life about this. So I need to get shit done now or I'm not graduating. But every time I decide to start, the depression takes over. Like, ""What does it matter when you'll be dead by fall? Let's think of specific ways to make that happen"". It's a recurring problem, an easy out. But I get so worked up that I decide to cope with some distraction. I don't know how else to keep myself safe.
Advice needed:
Finishing my assignments will mean that I have to contact people AGAIN asking for help and owning up to my mistakes. The guilt is strong. I don't feel worth their help, and what will I do if this whole situation happens again when I'm a real teacher? And what's even the point of struggling through this when the more satisfying thing is just to carry out my suicide plan? I don't know. I guess while I'm lucid enough, do you have any tools to help me do hard things?

TL;DR: Supposed to graduate university, depression is fucking it up. How do I do hard things? Is it worth it to do hard things?",02May2020,1

255,"In the past, I did some pretty dumb things (which was caught in a photo and kinda went around the whole school), and I got teased for it for a day before everyone stopped. I've disappointed parents, as well as teachers in the past. Idk why, but I get offended pretty darn easily. And I think the reason I don't like the idea of being made fun of is that I don't like the idea of being a victim of harassment.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask classmates, and they tell me that its just jokes, and that people aren't constantly talking about me. They also say it was just a funny pic that everyone laughed at for a day before forgetting about it. They also tell me that I need to learn to loosen up a little, stop making a big deal out of things, that I think way too deep into things, and that I need to learn to stop getting wrapped up in every little thing and just learn to let go.

&amp;#x200B;

The only times I did get teased was for dumb shit I said/did (which wasn't a lot), and it only lasted for a day. In other words, I'm not constantly getting teased. I was never assaulted physically, so thats out of the question. Am I being bullied if I get teased for a day and then everyone stops? Idk if I'm actually getting bullied, or I have some serious persecution complex going on.

And I don’t think it’s totally because of the morphine but it feels like her mental health is totally derailed, she does nothing but sits at home, has no friends or anything and I honestly don’t know what to do cause she won’t do anything to ever help herself. I’ve told her so many times to go to a therapist and she just won’t do anything for herself and it hurts me.",02May2020,1
257,"So, ever since I was a child, I’ve had maladaptive daydreaming issues. Maladaptive daydreamers are people who can either intentionally or accidentally fall into daydreaming that takes up hours and days of their lives. It’s not like regular daydreaming, it’s an addiction and for me, I’m pretty sure it stems from having a broken family and a life that I hope for but don’t have. It’s dissociating from real life but knowing you’re daydreaming. It’s hard to catch yourself before you fall into one. 

These daydreams are extremely vivid. It’s like sleep paralysis without the paralysis. Like waking up, and still dreaming but aware of the physical things in front of you but you’re in a whole different world. You can still communicate with people and seem normal but in your head, a whole world is happening.

Anyway, I’ve clung to the idea of having a happy family because our family is extremely broken between all of us. Someone doesn’t like someone, someone refuses to be around someone, physical abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, belittling, lying, stealing, no one will own up to their faults, etc.

From 5 years old, I’ve always had a family in my head that gets along. And I still cling onto it, but I’m slowly getting out of these daydreams and what I’m doing to get out of them is working. It’s a coping mechanism and when I moved in with a different relative, they used humor to cope, so I instilled that too. Anyway i moved back in with my grandparents and they have unsolved trauma.

Bianca (fake name): physically abusive, PTSD, Diabetes, control problem. Belittling.

Ellie (fake name): emotionally needy, overreacts, screams from her stomach (neighbors hear), throws tantrums in public and screams to the point where there’s no words coming out. She’s blamed me for what Bianca has done to her. Belittles my problems. Lies and is hypocritical. 

When I was 13-17 years old, Ellie would call me and complain about things Bianca did to her. She always cries and is in misery constantly. From the minute she gets up to nighttime. There are days where it’s not as bad. But her misery is actually misery. Not sad sometimes. She overreacts and cries and I can’t even call it screaming. It’s from her stomach type of loud. It makes me shake. When I was a child I shook, as I got older, I didn’t even flinch, but now it makes me shake again. When she’s upset, she knocks things over, bangs as hard as she can on these cheap wooden doors, and stomps as loudly as she can as she is with everything she has in her, screaming. &amp; one thing about this is, she admits that she’s scared I’ll leave her, but I do want to get an apartment and come see them everyday and help them pay for things.

But she says she’ll die if I leave. &amp; Bianca told her that if I leave, then so is she. So that kind of ruins my plan of helping them. I know Bianca will go to one of her bad influenced friends and stay with them. One of her friends that is straight up MEAN to Ellie. Despite what Ellie does, she is NICE to Bianca’s friends and they still treat her as if she’s not even there. Yet, she pays most of the bills in the house. I’d hate to have someone who treated me like crap under a roof that I pay the bills for. Both of these women are good at heart, but have horrible habits. 



Btw, no physical abuse is happening since I’ve been here. I’m safe. &amp;  I’m fine, I just need to know what to do. Because I’ve realized there’s a certain lifestyle that I want to live and certain things I have to do to take care of myself. However, when I’m lying down in my room, it’s so easy to let yourself be spoiled but today, i realized i was in bad shape and needed to get myself a job. I’m not leaving because it’s difficult to stay with them. I love them to death, but I don’t want to end up like my biological mother who died from an overdose and got in fist fights with Bianca and Ellie used to just take it but then started fighting back. I always let Bianca scream hurtful things at me, and I’m surprised I haven’t taken a hit yet since those two did and I don’t want to stick around for it. I also keep letting Ellie get away with the things she does by caving in to her. &amp; I allow myself to sit around all day and have no income. It’s rough all over. &amp; I know I haven’t had it the worst. I’m in no way trying to sound unappreciative because I give them so much credit all the time, even before I moved in with them. I didn’t move in with them to use them. I moved in with them because I was always able to be myself around them and I wanted us to be a happy family and take care of them. But I found out I had anxiety and anxiety was stopping me from getting a job. 

Should I move out and see them everyday and risk Bianca leaving Ellie? Because I know it’s gonna hurt them. I definitely am going to pay them back for everything they’ve done for me. I’ll probably even stay a little longer and get a job for sure to help them with bills. &amp; make sure they stay healthy. Any advice or observations?",02May2020,1

259,"LOL HELP

I've spent the better part of my 20s trying to be likable because I hate drama, gossip and disagreements. I would smooth over issues and apoligize for things I didn't feel responsible for just to keep my anxiety at bay.

WELL

I decided to finally stand up to my roommates who I felt like unfairly teamed up against me. There was some drama about paying certain bills that they had originally excused me from paying as I wasn't staying at the apartment during COVID and was moving out that month. Then they went back and said they didn't mean to excuse me from the whole month (even though that's what they had originally said).  When I stood up for myself and questioned their logic (not in a rude or unkind way) they told me not to pay and ignored my texts of reconiliation. I even offered to pay the next day if they thought it was the fairest option and they still didn't reply. 

The issue is we work together and they know a lot about my personal life. I don't trust that they wont try to stir the pot with my personal relationships. I've vented to them about people who are close to me and can see them twisting my words to drive people against me. Now they have unfollowed me on social media (like mature adults do).

I can't stop anxiously thinking that they are going to find a way to ruin my life lol. I don't know how to deal with these types of scenarios.

I think that they're getting sick of me, but I also know that I have a hard time believing people genuinely like me so there's a significant chance that it's all in my head. Should I ask them about it? If so, how? I've lately been trying to limit my presence in our discord calls but I don't want to appear cold if they're fine with me, but I also don't want to inflict myself on them if they really are sick of me. 

My options are basically:

1. continue to hang out with them as if nothing's wrong

2. give them some space

3. ask if I've done something or they're just tired of me

Several people asked me how I lost all the weight. I always told them boiled eggs and swimming. That has taught me to love my body but because of quarantine I have gain back some weight. I still love my body my thighs having gottin bigger and my butt has gottin bigger and softer😂. But I lost my abs and my face has gottin fatter.

263,"Right. So I have spina bifida and can’t walk. My sister broke her ankle a few weeks ago. Recently she found out it didn’t heal properly, and she had surgery to fix it a week ago. She’s on crutches, but she says they hurt her arms. My mom said that she can just use my wheelchair around the house. I’m very opposed to this. First off, my wheelchair is custom fit for me. I also absolutely need it to get anywhere, I can’t use crutches. (In therapy I’ve been able to walk short distances with a walker and braces but that’s absolutely not practical outside of PT). So when I’m in bed if my sister just takes my chair, I’m stranded there and it’s shitty. If she wants to get her own wheelchair I don’t care, but she doesn’t have the right to use mine when I need it more.

268,"To start, I am very fortunate that my state and district is even having a ceremony. I know most people aren't, so I feel really blessed to have that opportunity. However, I feel that the feeling of ""being ripped off"" isn't mutual to either situation. In short, my district is having the graduation on the day it was originally planned (after moving the date to two possible dates in June and July, which caught many people off-guard) and having it in a big arena where parents will watch on from cars (one car per graduate). Students will still walk (thank goodness), but seats will be placed six feet apart, everyone will wear masks, all speeches will be pre-recorded, and the principal etc will be social distancing as well.

Though the event itself isn't my concern, it's a part of the ""problem"" for me. The thing is, I've had a heck of a hard four years and I need something to make myself feel some solace in the fact that I did it and am moving forward. I need something to let go of the past I've gripped onto for so long. I've come up with a few ideas, but they seem to fall a bit flat, especially with our the ability to see my friends.

271,"TLDR: I get paid about $2000 every month to home share with my autistic brother but my parents don’t want him with us full time as they want control. Which I get and support. Should we give them the $2000 we get or should we keep it and use it for bills? 


 My (23F) husband (26M) and I recently started doing a home share program with my autistic brother so he would not lose his funding through the government. Basically we get paid about $2000 a month so that he can keep getting money from the government. Once you lose this money it’s nearly impossible to get back and even though he is okay right now he could need it in the future so we agreed. 

Edit: I just wanted to explain my relationship to my parents as well to see if that adds perspective. 

My mom and I have a strained relationship. I love her so much but we were abused by my moms second husband badly and I was very angry at her for a long time for not leaving the situation. I have a relationship with her now but it’s very basic. We text and sometimes go for walks but still has an odd feeling to it. I was told by a therapist this is normal for child abuse victims as they don’t develop the same love and connection as kids who come from more secure families. I can’t talk to her about anything serious though as she tells my current step dad everything and than he ends up lecturing me about it. I don’t have that level of comfort confiding in her I would love to have. 

My step dad. This is a tough relationship for me. On one hand I think he is an awesome guy. My mom loves him. He is hard working and has good morals. He stepped up to the plate with my brother and I am grateful. He has also helped my husband and I in many ways. The bad side to this is I am very afraid of him. Due to the trauma I suffered as a kid I find a lot of men terrifying to talk to. (I was sexually abused as well). My step dad came into our home when I was 16. I think he and my mom started talking when I was 14. I felt very uncomfortable from the beginning. I had not dealt with the fact that I was sexually abused by both my past step dad and my ex boyfriend. He came in with force and took over the dad role very quickly. My mom became subservient to him and basically only does as he says when it comes to dealing with my brother and life in general. I don’t think he means to be this way and I would love to have a good relationship with him but as of now I can’t talk to him. I can’t control my emotions around him as I break down fast. He once called it crocodile tears and that really affected the way I saw him. At first I thought it was me and than I realized it was also him that was the issue. There is no way I’ll probably ever have the confidence to have this talk with him so it’s just awkward and I don’t visit often. 

At first it was all good. He came and stayed with us half the month for the first month of this arrangement. We got the money and used it for bills. I felt fine with that. 

My parents stopped that as they wanted full control which I 100% understand. I am only 23 and am not ready to deal with my brother full time. I expect one day when they retire if they become unable to take care of him or he is unable to achieve independence I will become responsible which again I am 100% for. I love my brother and I want to help. 

We had a conversation recently, before I knew this wasn’t how it was meant to be set up (my brother being with us half the month wasn’t suppose to happen) and we had a talk with my step dad. He seemed very angry as if we were deceiving him for extra money. As much as the money does help, I am also helping them and in my mind I was doing the right thing. It was a very accusatory conversation where I felt I was being talked down to. I felt so bad because I was so worried I’d mess something up and now my parents thought we were doing something wrong because I misunderstood what I was supposed to do. I was told by my mom to call and what to say and it went from there at the beginning. Now they are acting like I’m stealing? I wasn’t happy.

Now we are still getting that $2000 a month as it’s direct deposited to me as per the original arrangement made with the program person we did the home share through. The lady on our case knows full well he isn’t actually staying the full month or even half the month anymore but only some weekends (although not lately due to the world wide issue going on). 

She mentioned in the meeting we might just figure out what to do as a group with the $2000/month but we didn’t not discuss actually giving them any. This money is money received like through a job for taking on responsibility and not part of the money my brother gets from the government. This is also paid through the government directly to me. 

My husband thinks since we made this agreement and my parents have not brought it up that we should just use it for bills and savings. I personally feel weird using it as we are not fully doing what we are getting paid to do. It’s also not our fault this isn’t happening though. My husband thinks since we are all benefiting it’s fine to keep it. 

Should we give the money to my parents every month? Or should we just keep using it for bills? AITA in this situation?",02May2020,1

275,"I’m going to try and keep this short. When I was somewhere between 10-14 my mom and I lived with one of her boyfriends. He was really awful to us and would kick us out all the time, accuse my mom of cheating on him, punched me in the face twice (maybe more that I don’t remember), made me eat dog food, washed my mouth out with soap, and had me do chores like cleaning the entire house with bleach twice and vacuuming the entire house morning and night. 

I remember once we were in the living room and he said he wanted to wrestle with me when my mom wasn’t home. I remember during the “wrestling” he pulled my pants down twice. I don’t think he did anything else though, but now that I look back on it this was really inappropriate for a little girl. 

There was also a time where he said I did something bad and he needed to beat me with a belt and told me to bend over the bed and take my panties off. I know my mom wound up coming in the room and nothing resulted of it. 

I also remember once he lectured me about masturbating being evil and said he recorded everything I do at night through a webcam on the computer. I was too young I think to really know what any of that meant, but it makes me feel uneasy when I think about it now. 

I don’t know what to think about it now. My mom ultimately left the guy, but she called me tonight (I’m 25 now and live with my fiancé) and told me that the guy happened to call into the medical office she works at to see about becoming their patient.

Today is May 1st and this company is saying they can’t offer me a refund and only a voucher. My home state has a stay at home order that prohibits non essential travel until June 10th.

285,"Recently, a good friend of mine went off the radar and has gone completely silent towards me and the entire friend group we share.  Well, it's an exaggeration to say that he's gone completely ""silent"" but he talks and interacts with others a lot less now.  This isn't the first time he's done this, like a few months ago he got into a relationship with another guy in the friend group and just completely attached to him. 

I pointed this out back then, and we got into a bunch of arguments which placed quite a strain on us and just caused both of us to feel uncomfortable around each other for quite some time.  But ever since they broke up due to the boyfriend ghosting him, he was devastated for a month or so and I stayed around still to try and least provide him some comfort or distractions to help him get through his obvious tough time.

We were on a good track, we were talking every now and then and he interacted with the group a lot more.  I thought we were perfectly fine until now, now he's found someone else to be attached to and has already admitted his feelings and all that (This ""someone"" is someone relatively new to both me and him, we've known him for about 3 weeks).  Normally, I would be fine with this but he's doing it once again, completely neglecting others that still care for him.  He's always found someone new, fell in love with them instantly, admitted his feelings to the other person, all in the span of a single fucking week.  

We've talked about this before, and he has acknowledged that this is an unhealthy thing to do.  But day by day, he seemingly gets even closer to the new guy even though we've discussed this a million times before.  

I like being apart of my friend's life, he was someone I relied on back then when I was going through some rough times with my health.  To see him go once again and replace me and the friend group with a single person just hurts a lot.

So what do I do? I'm honestly so lost and confused at the fact that he's done this again even though he's explained to me that he tends to do this to new people.  I know that this is his mental problem as he dealt with loneliness in his past, and I want to support him with it.  But at this point, it just hurts to watch as he slowly gets closer to another person that he's known for about a week despite me giving him my best effort like he gave me his best effort back then.

I want to leave so I can gain some independence, but then again I want to stay because I genuinely believe that he's a good person when he doesn't abandon people like this. Any advice would help, thank you for reading.",02May2020,1
286,"Idk what's going on. A few weeks ago, I logged  in the irs website and seen that my money was sent to an unknown bank account.

287,"**Question**: From your perspective, would you want to be informed if your friend-of-sorts was going to cease all contact with you\*? \[\*if you don't really hold the relationship in a high regard\]

**Perspective**: I have this friend (of sorts, I suppose) who I don't want to know anymore, and I intend to vanish from their life as of today. I basically vanish from peoples lives professionally, and usually do so just by distancing myself overtime until there is mutually no communication. However, I really feel that it is best for me to cut this relationship off immediately. 

Here's the thing: Most of the time, the people whose lives I vanish from are those who have shown they aren't particularly ""good"" people (lame word choice), and so I never feel inclined to inform them that I won't be in their life anymore. However, this person is an authentically great human, and I have this sense that I should show him some respect? But then I think that it's totally nonsense to receive a message like ""Hey, I think it is best that we remove ourselves from each others lives. Let's pleasantly agree to never talk to each other again."" I have pretty strong confidence that he won't mind this happening (that be, the ceasing of our communication), I just don't know if I should actually communicate my intention with words. I'm caught between wanting to show him respect and thinking that telling him of my intention is a unnecessary thing to do.

288,"I’m sure these kinds of questions are really common here, but I’d love some advice on this. 

I’ve (23m) been working with this girl (23) in an office with just the two of us for almost a year now. We are quite different people, but have built up a great rapport and we call each other friends. 

We’ve been working from home for about a month now, and have been messaging every day. We are each often the last person the other messages before bed. The conversation is mostly banter, and sharing daily stuff that’s happening in our lives. We have the occasional deep and meaningful conversation as well.

I like this girl, I appreciate her friendship, and I am attracted to her. I don’t think we are long-term relationship material however. As I said, we’re just different people. 

But I would absolutely be up for being friends with benefits, or being somewhat physical. The thing is, i don’t know how to broach the subject. 

If she doesn’t want anything more than friendship, then I don’t want to scare her off or make things weird for her. Yet I also have no idea currently if she’s into me enough to want to try that, and so I’d like to gauge her interest somehow.

I'm 23 and my 6-year tenure at university is about to come to a halt and I'm pretty sad and scared. It was originally supposed to be 3 years but in the final year of my first degree, I was arrested and convicted of a drug charge. At the time I was very unmotivated and had a 50% average grade. Biggest mistake of my life. This was a major life event and caused me to realign things. It motivated me to go back and study something new to expand my career options (first degree was finance so no hope getting a job in finance with a record!). Went back and did computer science and data science and have boosted my grades to 76% average. Anyway.. I guess I'm just scared to leave.

308,"So I used to be friends with this person.  So throughout the year I knew her,  she would constantly complain about her relationship with her boyfriend, she would rarely tell me the good points about him, so I wondered why she decided she stay with him. Some of the bad points included he has no job, he didn't graduate from high school, he was a former gang member, he visits clubs and posts photos on IG of all the women he's hanging out with, without her being there... 

Eventually, one day she told me that her boyfriend was involved in human trafficking. He basically was hired as a driver for a gang that sexually exploits South East Asian women. Before this, he had no income so he saw it as easy money.  

She asked me for advice, and I straight up told her I would reconsider being friends with her if she continued to date this person.  I said this as more of a way to try to make her wake up and use her head.  I also saw it as disgusting how she could wear jewelry he bought for her when she was fully aware of where the money came from in order to buy it. 

Well, she decided to stop being friends with me. 

I kind of still feel angry about this, especially when I thought I was trying to look out for her.  And I have no idea if her boyfriend is still exploiting these women.

I have developed feelings for my best friend. I've had feelings for her for a while now (about 2 months). She already knows this as about a month and a half ago I told her and she basically said she needs to get things figured out. However at the start of April, she has started giving me a lot of signs that she may have things figured out. She started saying how she loves me practically every single day, she was spending a lot of time texting me probably easily 50-100 messages almost every day. Then all the texting seemed to stop, and things are dwindling.

I have become so attached to her in a really unhealthy way and I led myself to this point and I want to get out of it. I am going to be honest and reveal some of the things I have done because I want everything to be transparent. Recently, she's taken hours to reply. We'd be having a convo that would be going back and forth rather rapidly then all the sudden.... radio silence for the next few hours. Sure she could be busy, but I checked her insta and it said she was active.... it made me feel uneasy. Because I realized that she just doesn't want to talk to me. I don't know what I did. I am so lost. Then I see her chatting up away with her other friends and it does make me jealous. 

I DO NOT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY. but I just do. I want to be free of this. It's painful. It hurts. My emotions and feelings are getting the best of me, and I try to live life without her being so present, but I get to a breaking point and I just beat myself over this.

313,"Just a bit of backstory.

My Mom passed during my sophomore year of highschool.  There was a couple girls I liked but I was dealing with her death. A relationship isn't something I wanted until I was around 23.

I am inexperienced and very oblivious to flirting. I've gotten a bit better since then. I am able to get numbers pretty easily. Hung out with women/coffee or lunch with just myself and them (don't consider it a date but some of my friends has said it probably was). That being said I'm not bitter or angry. My problem with women is definitely on my end.

315,"Hey, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So here’s some background of our brotherhood/friendship. I’m an 18 year old guy and met a guy who I referred to as my family until now when I was about 6. Let’s call them John just to make it easier. Where I lived, all the kids would just be outside on the street all day and night playing and doing whatever. This is how I met my best friend John. We were super close and best friends for a long time, up until now. We were basically family. He’s a couple years older than me, and we always called eachother family and were basically brothers. I think he’s spent more time with me and my family than my sister has. He has even worked for my dad and my whole family liked him. 

Anyways, I never saw this coming. He was always a typical guy, going outside playing and doing crazy shit. Eventually he got into drugs and trapping, and was big ups in the city we live in. Even though he was changing and doing crazy shit, he was always himself around me. (Not putting on the gangster act) and we remained super close friends, but of course we both referred to eachother as family. So with all this COVID-19 stuff going on, he was in quarantine with his girlfriend. Everything was as usual, we were both doing our own things. Then tonight, he told me that he’s cutting me off from everything forever. He told me that had talked with his girlfriend and has figured out that he is actually bi. At first I thought he was joking, so I was joking around, but he assured me that he was serious. He convinced me (I won’t say how, but I know he is serious). He said that all this time he did think what he felt for me was brotherly love, but he has learned now that it was actually feelings. He loves his girlfriend, so he is cutting me off. Anyways, as hard as is this for me, I don’t really know what I’m writing this for. Maybe just to vent. 

Has this happened to anyone? It feels as if I’ve lost a family member that I am close to or something. It just hurts because I thought I really had a life long best friend, but it turns out it really wasn’t a mutual friendship. I never suspected it at all, we were boys and would do everything together. Nothing sexual at all, I’m the straightest person ever. Should I go and tell my parents? Why am I even writing this I don’t know what advice I’m even asking for? Do any of you have any advice that you could tell me even though I am still in shock that this is even real and don’t really know what to ask for advice on?",02May2020,1
316,"Tl;dr: got offered a chance at a dream job in my field. It would be awesome for me to learn the field and the job. The only catch is that it isn’t in my home country but London, England. 

To give context in the past year and a bit the UK (more specifically Ireland or England) has come up so much in my life. Especially in regards to living and working. 

I thought it meant doing a year abroad but with my degree it wouldn’t allow me in my last year. So last summer I did an in-country language program to sooth what I thought was a travel itch. 

Should also not I’m not based in USA. 

But it has come up again in a different way. Since I have graduated I have been working on my application through a job portal and hit the button that allowed employers to see it even though it wasn’t 100% done. 

Well I guess someone saw it and called me up this morning and offered me to work in London, England for minimum two years in my exact field of work. The difference if I were to stay in my home country that there are two posting for my whole state or I work part-time/maternity leave. Or I move states where the pay is worse and the cost of living is more and there are a few more jobs (last I checked 10 posting for my field). 

I have been looking into the company and they seem really good. I do recall meeting them at a career fair my uni hosted so they’re no a scam. The reviews are good and they offered to set me up to talk to someone about the program who is currently in a similar field of work. I haven’t said yes or paid for anything yet. I’m just looking in and talking with them about it. 

It seems too good to be true. I am getting over a recent break up that has been harder to deal with since I can’t leave my flat. Am I crazy to actually consider taking the next step in this process?",02May2020,1
317,"I did something really stupid earlier this week-this is an alt account. I'm in a college town and schools closed due to quarantine but I'm stuck here as an international student. I decided to make the absolute dumbest decision I've ever made in my entire life and look up escorts in my area online. I found a site and texted someone on the site who said they'll be there, but got stopped by the police. 2 days later I received a text from someone saying he is the ""head of the company"" and told me that she got arrested and I had to pay up or else he will kill my entire family. I gave him everything in my account and then he said he wanted more. At which point I blocked him and changed my number. He doesn't know my address, I don't think he knows what my face looks like, but I think he saw my name (only) from the payment method I used. before I blocked him and changed my number I texted him that I left the state and would leave the country tomorrow (that was yesterday), I don't know if that did anything to threw him off my trail but I'm hoping it did. Two days later no word. Most of my friends have gone home (so no one can really identify me here in case), there's a cop in my apartment complex and it is a very residential area, and I've been here for a month and going crazy (probably why I did what I did). Went online and found out there are some scams like this, at this point I'm hoping that it is one. What do I do?",02May2020,1
318,"Hey, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So here’s some background of our brotherhood/friendship. I’m an 18 year old guy and met a guy who I referred to as my family until now when I was about 6. Let’s call them John just to make it easier. Where I lived, all the kids would just be outside on the street all day and night playing and doing whatever. This is how I met my best friend John. We were super close and best friends for a long time, up until now. We were basically family. He’s a couple years older than me, and we always called eachother family and were basically brothers. I think he’s spent more time with me and my family than my sister has. He has even worked for my dad and my whole family liked him. 

Anyways, I never saw this coming. He was always a typical guy, going outside playing and doing crazy shit. Eventually he got into drugs and trapping, and was big ups in the city we live in. Even though he was changing and doing crazy shit, he was always himself around me. (Not putting on the gangster act) and we remained super close friends, but of course we both referred to eachother as family. So with all this COVID-19 stuff going on, he was in quarantine with his girlfriend. Everything was as usual, we were both doing our own things. Then tonight, he told me that he’s cutting me off from everything forever. He told me that had talked with his girlfriend and has figured out that he is actually bi. At first I thought he was joking, so I was joking around, but he assured me that he was serious. He convinced me (I won’t say how, but I know he is serious). He said that all this time he did think what he felt for me was brotherly love, but he has learned now that it was actually feelings. He loves his girlfriend, so he is cutting me off. Anyways, as hard as is this for me, I don’t really know what I’m writing this for. Maybe just to vent. 

Has this happened to anyone? It feels as if I’ve lost a family member that I am close to or something. It just hurts because I thought I really had a life long best friend, but it turns out it really wasn’t a mutual friendship. I never suspected it at all, we were boys and would do everything together. Nothing sexual at all, I’m the straightest person ever. Should I go and tell my parents? Why am I even writing this I don’t know what advice I’m even asking for? Do any of you have any advice that you could tell me even though I am still in shock that this is even real and don’t really know what to ask for advice on?",02May2020,1
319,"Sorry if this is badly written. It's my first post ever on reddit. For whatever reason, I don't get drunk or at least never have even after drinking a whole bottle.

In order to deal with intense pain from 3 days of corporal punishment, I have run to alcohol because I have higher than a normal sense of pain and frankly am unable to complete even basic tasks.

320,"I am happily married with wonderful kids and an overall good life. Every now and then (more often these days) i feel that need to reach out to my past friends (Guys and gals both) and ask for forgiveness to all those who played a significant part in my past life. I dont even know what I would apologize for but i just feel like I should. Perhaps for not being as close now or through the past years? I was not Mean to them, in fact I was pretty Close to each of them back (some even best friends through various stages of my life) then but over the past 25-35 years They have all drifted away. With barely any contact except for an occasional hi or hello message.  Am I incorrect in feeling like this?",02May2020,1

322,"Its been nearly 6 years since my father passed away from a brain stroke and I cant seem to forget him or stop dreaming about him. I know it sounds cringy but in my dreams we are usually playing soccer, going on rides, etc stuff that we never did irl.

He was in the military so he was away from home from the most part of his life so it was just me and my mom. Even when he came back once a year, he was a reserved man and didnt talk much to anyone. We never got to bond with each other, tbh he was almost like a complete stranger to me, it was always my mom who did all the stuff that my dad was supposed to do.

Even after all that I have been dreaming about him every single day (whenever I get dreams) since 2014 and it really fucks me up for the rest of the day. 

But the thing is I cant talk to my mom about it because she is extremely superstitious and thinks the devil is trying to trick me by appearing as my deceased father in my dreams (she warned me about having dreams about stuff like this not long after he died). And we dont talk to to mom's family and I havent talked to my dad's side of the family for over 12 years. 

I dont know what to I have nowhere to vent about this and my mental health is deteriorating and I dont even think there is any solution to getting the dreams to dissappear.",02May2020,1
323,"I met this person when we were in kindergarten. I’ll call him Barry. Barry was so nice up until sixth grade he started becoming a jerk. He kept making fun of me for my height and other things. He makes fun of me and my other friends. Today he asked me on Xbox,  “Are you still my friend?” I answered him, “I don’t know” because I didn’t know how to answer.

324,"Hi everyone,

I'm potentially going to be moving at the start of June and I need some advice because nobody is really helping. I've looked at a few places and one of them seems too good to be true for my first time living alone. I don't know if I should take the risk because there seems to be nothing wrong, but at the same time I don't know if that's the smartest decision. The place will be just myself and is allowing me to have my dog, and it's recently remodeled. Is there certain things I should be looking for when I tour this place in person for the first time? Any advice would help.",02May2020,1
325,"In one semester of community college 7 years ago I knew a guy named Joe. We both took creative writing at a community college. This guy was really chill and humble. He told me he ""turned his life around"" and was always saying ""I need to think more positive"". This is what I really needed. I had been home schooled and I have autism and had a lot of anxiety issues at the time. The big mistake I made with Joe is I didn't exchange contact information.

At the end of the semester he had gotten a job at Jimmie Johns about 5 miles up the road. He would bike up there from his apartment across the street and use makeup to cover up a tear drop tattoo under his eye. The last day of our class was May 6th 2013. He walked away, down to the intersection. He was dressed up in a button down type long sleeve shirt and slacks like he had a job interview. I assumed I would go to the Jimmie Johns and reconnect with him there. Big mistake.

I went to Jimmie Johns a week later and the workers there told me he quit about a couple weeks earlier. I was very disappointed but felt I would see Joe again. He told me he wanted to take Spanish but I never ran into him on campus. That summer semester I met a new best friend who was my best friend until 2018 when we had a falling out and parted ways. After a year and a half of mourning this friendship I found another new best friend in a guy called Duane when I began a new job last August. But I havent gotten a hold of him since he was fired about a month ago. Duane hasnt returned my texts and he got himself into some legal trouble (Thats for another post). I went on an LOA from work and had all this time on my hands thinking about my friend and the past. So thats when I began to think about Joe again.

I had Joe's last name but he is nowhere to be found on social media. He had two mugshots up online though one from 2011 the other from 2012. I recently began trying to gather up all my police records to help in my disability case and I decided since I had Joe's name and his DOB (from the mugshot website) I would try requesting his police records to see if I could find clues to his current whereabouts. He wasn't listed as an inmate in the department of corrections so I know he is not in jail in this state. I paid for the records and they came in.

Two of the records from 2007 were purged (he was 15 then). I had two records from 2011 and two from 2012. There was one incident where he was pulled over for speeding (60mph) and he admitted to the cop he was taking medication for his ""bi polar disorder and anxiety"". Then there were two incidents which lead to his mother filing an order of protection against him. She said he was under the influence of ""spice and bath salts"" and was punching the garage door lock and the walls of the house. She also said Joe wrapped a towel around his neck and threatened suicide.

Then I also got a police record from another city nearby. This was 4 months after our final class in September 2013 when he got pulled over after leaving a known drug house. The officer didn't have a female officer to search the ""persons"" of the two girls with Joe and did not find any drug paraphernalia except aluminum foil . They let him go.

The final record for Joe of any kind was in December 2013 when he went to the courts and ""squashed"" a warrant. There was no details given beyond that and I am wondering did Joe die in December 2013 and thats why the warrant squashed? Or was he institutionalized? Maybe he moved. But its crazy he just disappeared and as a guy who now would be like 28 isn't on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. He just disappeared. 6 years and 4 months and counting there is no trace of him online anywhere.

Now I know people might say ""Why do you care so much?"". Well because Joe was a good friend for those 4 months we were in that class. And reading about him struggling through addiction makes me really worry. Given the details I provided what advice would you give me? How do I find out what happened to my boy Joe?",02May2020,1
326,"He made me feel so small just so he could feel big. It made me question myself and my performance. It made me feel even more tired than I already am, and that leads to hopelessness. 

I was eating healthy and sorta sabotaged my diet a few days ago. Because of this. I feel down in general and then this happened. 

There is a lot in my life that’s good, but a lot missing as well. I realized it wouldn’t take much for me to fall apart. Someone wouldn’t even have to try that hard. 

I just feel like nothing is going anywhere. 

I used to smoke weed and abuse substances in general but then I quit over a year ago. I have been having thoughts of going back. That wouldn’t help at all. But I still want to do it. I haven’t because I am living with family right now and I wouldn’t want to do that in their house. But it scares me because I wonder if I would fall apart the minute I was on my own.",02May2020,1
327,"I am f22 and I recently had to move in with my mom and her husband of 1 year. They were together I think 2 years before they got married. We would always have dinner together and go places so me and my siblings could also get to know him. So I didn't grow up knowing him and this is the first time I've lived with him.

When they were dating I noticed a few things about him that didn't sit well with me. I talked to her about them and she made excuses for him that maybe for in certain situations, so I let it go.

Now living with him, and with being in quarantine, I see him more and I still see things I don't like, including the way he treats her. I'm positive that he isn't physical, but I think there is a lot of verbal abuse happening. I say ""think"" because I'm not sure at what point you call it being verbally abusive rather than just being an asshole.
He is constantly raising his voice and saying things, sounding like he just wants to start a fight over silly little things. He also is constantly interrupting her and saying things that make her feel bad about herself.

I feel like a guest in their house and don't know what to do. Any advice on how to talk to her and make sure she is ok?! I can tell that she knows this is not right and that she is being drained emotionally. I just want her to be happy and it makes me sick to think of her being stuck in this relationship unhappy for the rest of her life.


\- he's lived alone for a long time and he has a certain way he likes to do things. he will get so upset at her for the smallest things that don't matter. To me it feels as if he is still treating it like this is still only his house and she is just a guest so she doesn't get a say in anything.

My mother has helped me make all of my important decisions in the past year and is on board with me changing schools, but due to legal custody they both have to agree. He isn't allowing me to change schools and whenever I try to talk to him he tries to convince me into coming to his house to have an ""adult"" conversation. I do not feel comfortable going to meet him, even if he has someone else there. He refuses to hear me out and will not take anything other than what he wants. He refuses to attempt to understand my valid reasons and doesn't give me any reasons as to why he is refusing my request. I don't know how to convince him to listen to and agree to what I am saying.

I'm 16, all of my life people have told me im ugly, im annoying, and thay no one likes me, I was especially told that by my big sisters

On my 8th birthday I was diagnosed with type one Diabetes and after I got out (maybe a month or so) of the hospital and when I went back to school, I was isolated. What I mean is that during recess (I was in 3rd grade at the time) when I went back to all my ""friends"" acted weird like they only gave small awnsers to my questions about what I had missed when I was gone. And then one short girl who I wasn't friends with told everyone else that they should go play, and when I tried to follow she pushed me out, I tried again and again to be with my supposed friends but she always told me to go away and eventually told me no one likes me. After that I spent most of free time either trying to get friends and failing or crying, according to my mom I would come home everyday crying, so when I was in 4th grade she put me in homeschool. I was in homeschool from 4th to the fall half of my 7th grade, when the spring half came I wanted to go to the local middle school (this was when I was living in my home town in CA which doesn't have the best schools) so I got over whelmed and wanted to go back to homeschool. My family moved to a different city in CA and I spent my 7th to my fall half of 9th grade, then my mom started dating, and next thing I knew my mom forced me and my little sister to move to Indiana with her... I think 5th(or maybe 6th) boyfriend at the time.. can't remember if that exact...
Anyways we moved and I started public school. Everything was...okay, the schools system wasn't great but the people there were fine. And then summer came when my mom had her 7th(or 8th) boyfriend and we moved... into his makeshift apartment on his parents property. He was a creep and my mom found out after two months being with him. Then she had a small thing right before he next ""boyfriend"" where he was also homeless and we had to stay in his car garage (he's a car mechanic), but the month the school year started we got a house right behind the high school, and of course I had to go. I only had one friend and through that friend I meet a guy who was perfect (no perfect but you get what I mean). I liked him and I was later told by said friend he liked me to, but I was scared to confront him because no one likes me no one ever has and ever will. I have a different post about that situation but it didn't end well. The school like every school I've been to had its... quirks? Issues? They had a requirement that you had to take a speech class in order to graduate, of course I cried when I gave my second speech (the first time i had support so I guess it was fine??) And that after winter break the school changed every students schedule, like if you had science for first period you wouldn't have that same class after winter break. And that set something off in my mind, so I decided that I needed just one last break from public school in order to wrap my head around everything, mabye once I go back i can be normal have more friends, give that guy the chance he absolutely deserved. But I couldn't because my mom had us move again into a moble home park in the next town over. Everything broke after that, I can't be normal I can't stay in one place for even a full year I can't do anything. But I went to the local high school, junior year, where pretty much every knew each other from kindergarden or at least before middle school. I tried to make friends and the two people who ""know"" (they probably don't anymore) of my existence dont care they never did.

So now I give up I was never ment to have anything normal if I did then it's been gone and dead for 8 years, after summer I'll be going back to homeschooling and probably kill myself if I ever graduate. Hell even if I don't graduate that same outcome will occur anyways. I'll probably move again by that time if patterns have shown anything but I don't care I don't care anymore

335,"Long story short, my niece has not been having a great week. This afternoon she lost her youngest sister (8) in a car accident. Her father and older sister (23) are in poor condition and may not make it as well. She's a wreck right now, but I've been giving her space since the rest of the family has been in her face since it happened. Also, her 21st birthday is tomorrow. I was originally going to gift her some bath bombs but after today's events that seems kind of... not great.

She's a mother of one and works full time, a seven-month-old boy. If I could I'd spend some time over at her place, maybe cooking or taking care of the baby while she does what she needs to but in this current social climate that's impossible. I still want to gift her something considerate, to let her know that things are going to be okay.",02May2020,1

I was able to give one but not the other. Anyways, I saw on social media that her fiancé had put together a surprise get together with my friends and did not invite me. I don’t want to start drama but I’m so hurt. I feel so excluded and I don’t know if I should talk directly to her fiancé about it or just leave it alone. Please help.

As a result of COVID-19, school has been cancelled and everything is online, but I literally cannot find it in me to care. I have missed two-weeks of school work and I feel so nonchalant about it. This is my future. I need to care, but I just don’t – even the things I am passionate about haven’t been enough to get me out of bed. I just scroll through social media in bed for hours (until 6 AM) because it’s easy. It doesn’t take energy or work. I eat, SLEEP, social media, repeat.

I was recently assaulted multiple times back in March and going through the legal process of trying to do something about it, the thing is a lot of stuff upsets me. I cant watch the same crime shows anymore especially ones about women being raped and murdered I just can’t. I can’t listen to my dads jokes anymore about women it just makes me uncomfortable. 

There was one he posted a joke about Joe Biden and it was a joke about sexual assault. I told him to take it down and it took us an entire fight until he just took it down but he wouldn’t talk to me at all the entire week. It made me feel awful, I felt like I wasn’t asking for much. It’s just when I see stuff like that it automatically makes me feel sick and I’m anxious for the rest of the night, I start crying.. I just don’t even want to think about it or hear it. It hurts knowing my dad thinks that kind of stuff is funny. I thought they finally understood to just stop it. 

Today he had made a joke along the lines of woman being in the tied in the back of a trunk, It just made me feel uneasy because I already expressed how much this stuff effects me and just the fact that he thinks it’s funny. The whole ride home I just felt upset and still do. Although what happened to me isn’t to that extent I just don’t find stuff like that funny anymore, well I never did but I can’t just “laugh it off” anymore. I know if I say something it will cause an argument but he doesn’t understand that this stuff hurts me and once I start thinking about it, I can’t stop. 

On top of this, just last saturday we had an unexpected death in my family someone who I was very close too and I’m still trying to cope with that. 

I’m just upset all around and I don’t want to fight I just want someone to know that i’m stressed out. How can I express how I feel once again without starting an argument? I don’t know how to make my dad stop being defensive with me and just listen. I always try to stay calm but he just starts yelling at me and I feel worse. If someone has any advice for me please let me know. 

I tried to tell my mom but she just told me that’s just the humor they grew up with and I know she still hasn’t told him anything. If anybody can help me cope please let me know. Thank you.",02May2020,1
345,"Hello everyone! I will be graduating college in less than 1 week with a degree in psychology and plenty of lab experience with many accolades under my belt. In the next week, I also have a final in my pharmacology and toxicology class, of which I am essentially guaranteed an A. I am told how much I do and how ""great"" of a person I am, yet I feel inferior to everyone. I don't feel I deserve a degree, a girlfriend, to be published, etc. How do I get over this feeling of inferiority? Sometimes it gets so bad I just lay down and get absolutely nothing done which, in turn, makes me feel worse, not better.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!",02May2020,1
346,"My gf and I attend the same college but she has gone home since classes were switched online. It’s been almost 2 months since we have seen each other and we both miss each other a lot. I really want to go visit her but haven’t been able to as her family have been taking social distancing measures. Since it’s been a while now and since social distancing measures seemed to start to loosen up a bit (with businesses opening) I want to ask my gf’s mum if I can go visit them. 

I get along with her family really well and have stayed over at their house before. I’m just looking for some advice on the best way to go about it since I don’t want to come out pushy or anything like that. Also, I would visit them just for the day (drive there in the morning and then drive back overnight) as i know that having me over more than just a day might be a bit stressful since my gf’s parents are working from home. 

Thanks in advance for any advice, I really appreciate it! :)",02May2020,1

349,"So I was confronted by the professor for cheating on an exam. 
Here’s what happened.
Someone told the professor I cheated with 3 other people on an online exam. The professor looked at our exam and tells me we have the same answers, I told him I did not take the exam with the other people, and I showed him a pic of my work to show I actually worked it out. And the problem that the professor says we have the exact same answers is posted on chegg... FYI I did it differently however, 2 other classmates that have not been accused of cheating did the exact same work as myself on the problem. The multiple choice he claims myself and the others have the exact same results, however I can’t check if it’s true because I can’t look at my exam and neither can they. I don’t know what else to do. I’m suppose to graduate in a week and the professor told me he’ll think about it and hasn’t gotten back to me. I’m freaking out! What do I do?!",02May2020,1
350,"I’ve posted about this before so I’ll make it short. I (23f) have been with someone (25m) for six months. During a fight about love he reluctantly said he loved me and then said it again the next day. We decided to reset the moment. Essentially he took it back the next weekend when I said it to him. Said he felt pressured the first time and isn’t ready to say it yet. So we broke up. Then two days later we got back together.

After a lot of thought I realized I shouldn’t be with someone who doesn’t feel the same way. I resent him now because he misled me. But I’m really lonely during social distancing and he’s been the only person I’ve seen (we don’t live together) and the sex is good. Idk what to do?

TLDR; boyfriend said he loved me during a fight about love then took it back the next weekend, we broke up but just got back together and I’m too upset to be with him but I’m lonely during social distancing and I want to have sex so not sure if I should just hold off on the breakup until it’s over?",02May2020,1
351,"Hi, so as the title says I’ve been getting recruited by a college and it seems to fit me in every way, but today on a meet with them some of the athletes talked about their Greek life. I looked it up and the college has one of the largest Greek life programs in the nation, and a lot of people have talked very negatively of it.

352,"So I am pursuing a financial degree because when I was a junior in high school I took a business class that had a small unit about the stock market and I became fascinated with it. I spent the whole summer after that school year doing online research, watching YouTube videos, and reading books written by day traders and hedge fund managers etc.
When I started college I knew I probably wouldn’t be learning about the stuff I wanted to right away. But after first semester of sophomore year I decided to take a semester off to look for a different school because I still hadn’t learned anything related to the stock market or trading. In fact the research I did myself helped me in quite a few of the classes that I took.
I ended up choosing a college in a big city cuz there are a lot of big financial companies ,specifically investment firms and the like, located in the city so I thought the school might be a bit more focused. 
Well I am about to complete my first year at the new college and I don’t feel like I am any closer to learning about what I wanted to since I started college. What really frustrates me is that I have learned more from the one summer of research I did myself in high school than I have in five semesters at college. 
I went to college cuz I thought it would teach me more that I wouldn’t be able to learn by myself and cuz everyone told me the only way I could be successful is if I get a degree. 
My parents pretty much have their minds made up that I need a degree and a few weeks ago when I tried to suggest I was thinking about dropping out they told me they would make me pay rent if I did (I moved back in with my parents after I transferred)
I guess I would like advice on how to have this conversation with my parents cuz I’m expecting it to get a little heated.

356,"Hey, I'm a 19 M, trying to figure out what to specialize in with the rest of my life and I'm trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. I have terrible commitment and trust issues, and it's infiltrating its way into my life choices. I am trying to decide on my favorite activities. My choices are screenwriting, singing, comedy, economics, coding, and political theory. I would consider my self fairly skilled in all 5, but if I've learned anything from my economics studies comparative advantage is essential for succeeding in life. Right now I'm going to a b list University studying economics and computer science. I have a prestigious acting and singing scholarship which is helping me pay for school, also I compete in screenwriting competitions which are also helping with the financials. In addition, I like to code algorithms that trade stocks and bonds to keep my money invested.

My instincts though are telling me to focus on one thing. I have no idea what to focus on though there is only so much time in a day, and I can not accomplish every goal I wish too. I find myself getting easily overwhelmed with the tasks I have before me and barely anytime to talk to friends, form meaningful relationships, or work on my physical/mental health. Just trying to see if there are any other people going through the same type of situation I'm going through/ have gone through this situation and what they've done. Not that I'd base my entire decision off of somebody else's input. However, these decisions can really make or break my career. I want to be successful and I want to obtain my worth in life. But I'm not sure if I should focus on per se economics right now, make money then sit comfortably with that money in the performing world. Or if I should just perform and do all the financial and coding activities on my break/side time.  Just looking for some perspective or if somebody thinks I should go to a psychologist with my trust issues that somebody here can point out. Or maybe perhaps they see a career option that I'm just not seeing where I can mesh all of my skills.  

Any input would be nice. Just try not to say cliche societal blanket statements like ""college is your best option"" or ""Go with what your heart wants"". While appreciative, I do not think propaganda-like and Disney quotes(respectively) will help me make correct life decisions. (Side Note: This a throwaway account)",02May2020,1
357,"Honestly - it's near impossible to make this brief, but I'll do my best. Do I stand a chance in a grade grievance hearing? The director of disability services has been on my side and said that my rights were violated. Still - he has reached out to my professors and has received no response. He said it is ultimately up to them to make a decision - if it's unfavorable, I will have to file an official grievance. This process is so much worse when trying to go through it while the school is closed due to covid. Help :/

I got diagnosed with ADHD on June 29th, 2019. I have been undergoing  treatment consistently and have had long discussions with my doctor on  ways to cope with my learning disability. My PCP &amp; I decided that  the best plan for me during exams was to skip questions  that are in any way ambiguous to me and come back to them at the end of  the exam. This is so that I am not distracted by questions that I don't  know and can go through questions I *do* know with a clear thought process. This strategy has been  successful for me, evidenced by my success in N4. On our first exam,  which was on pen and paper in class, I did well (86.1%). In our 481  class, Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ had a long conversation with us  regarding accommodations. She said we would not be able to use  accommodations on the NCLEX if we did not use them at some point during a  BSN program. If we have a learning disability and have just been trying  to work around it during the program, now would  be a good time to utilize disability services to receive the  accommodations you deserve.   
 

After our first exam, in which I used the entire time allotted, I  realized I really could have benefited from even just another 20  minutes. So, a few days later, I went to talk with Dr. \_\_\_\_\_ after class and asked her what I would need to do to get accommodations  through disability services. She told me she thought this was a great  idea for me and was happy to know I was considering accomodations  because she ""noticed I was very fidgety and seemed quite nervous"" during  my exam. She told me I would need a note from my  doctor and to take it to accommodation services (I later found it this  is not what I needed to do, but I was able to fax my doctor the actual  form that needed to be filled out, and he faxed it back). So, I  completed the process correctly and then received  my faculty letter via email a few days later. When I received the  letters, the chaos of COVID-19 began. Obviously, classes moved to  online, clinical was canceled,  and the school was closed. I emailed the  faculty letter to Dr. \_\_\_\_\_ in pdf format.  
 

On the second exam, which took place online with a respondus lockdown  browser, I didn't do as well (64.5%). On our final exam, we were not  able to go back to a question once it had been submitted (i.e. we could  not advance to Q2 until Q1 was submitted, and  could not go back to previous questions). This was never disclosed  prior to the exam. We did not know we would be unable to review  questions until we opened the exam (and our countdown for the exam  started). I have went through every single email, canvas announcement,  etc. and it was never disclosed to us. I have re-watched every single  TEAMS video closely, and again, they did not disclose the new format. I  also discussed with other students, who confirmed we had never been  told, and the instructions when we opened the  exam were unclear/ambiguous. 

\*\*as a side note, I do have every single canvas announcement &amp; email  screen shotted, I have screen recorded (with audio) the instructions  for the final exam, and have screen shots from conversations with other  students. All of these documents are saved to a  folder on my laptop. I don't think I can include them in this post :(\*\*

My professors have said they did accommodate me as directed and that my  accommodations only specified extra time (time and a half) for exams.  These accommodations were provided to me before any of the pandemic  chaos started. When I had discussions with my doctor  in January about the accommodations/test strategies that would work  best for me, it was students &amp; professors understanding that all  exams were to be on pen and paper in the classroom. Exams in N5 have  never been online until this semester. So obviously, when  my doctor and I had these discussions, I didn't know (none of us did)  that exams would at some point be given on a question-by-question basis  and be unable to review previous questions (how is that possible with  paper exams?). If I had known these events would  occur, sure, maybe it could have been something I discussed with my  doctor to get more specific accommodations. The point is that I didn't  know this is how our final exam would be given until I started the  actual exam. Even our second exam did not lock us  out of questions. There was no way for me to know in advance that this  new format would be in place.   
 

My professors have emailed me that I am .3 away from the 77% average,  and that I would need to retake the class. When I asked for a virtual  meeting, they agreed. Speaking with them was virtually useless and they  did not take any of my concerns into consideration.  My virtual meeting with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (chair) also proposed no solutions, stated that she agreed with professors decisions, and only  suggested a grade grievance if I was still unsatisfied. Dr's \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ actually can both be seen rolling their  eyes and laughing as I expressed my concerns. When I confronted Dr.  \_\_\_\_\_\_ about laughing/smiling, she responded ""Oh no, I'm not laughing  at you, my husband is just putting a dish in the dishwasher and he is  leaving now"". This is also concerning to me.  Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_ husband was in the room while I talked to Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_  and Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, disclosing information about my learning disability and  adjustment disorder. I know that there are extenuating circumstances at  this time, but just like we are expected  to test in a room completely alone, I would expect that professors are  held to the same standard, especially when a student is  disclosing/discussing confidential medical information. I am obviously  not a law professional, but I do suspect this may be a violation  of FERPA. Students are held to a very high standard regarding  professionalism and confidentiality, and I think these high standards  should also be expected of the faculty.   
 

The syllabus also includes some  gray areas that are vague and not specific regarding the examination  grading policy. I printed out the handbook and syllabus and deeply  analyzed them. I sent an email to Dr. \_\_\_\_ and Dr.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_  (I also CCed the chair of nursing and the dean of HHS)  earlier this afternoon expressing my findings through text and also  attached pictures: my grades displayed on canvas, highlighted portions  of the printed syllabus, and the math I did to calculate  my exam average that is directly according to what is stated in the  syllabus.",02May2020,1

360,"I'm 26 and a bit  of a recluse (especially now with the pandemic). I'm attractive enough  to get a lot of attention whenever I leave the house, but I'm shy and  act like a meek little boy. Once in a blue moon, I'm very confident and  outgoing, happy with myself and in those moods I have gotten wherever I  want to with women.  


I had a shit childhood and adulthood with  lots of traumatic events, but recently I've turned things around economically  and gotten in great shape, along with kicking off my depression and low  confidence for the first time EVER through long term professional help. I'm ecstatic.  


However,  whenever I'm put ""on the spot"" I act like I always have. Today, I was  queuing in a line outside and some really cute girl was giving me a nice  flirty smile as she walked by (and ignored everyone else in the line,  she was definitely checking me out)  


Instead of returning the smile, I just  instantly turned my head and looked somewhere else.. I would have loved  to return the smile. Seriously girls have literally catcalled me and I don't know what to do.  


This is just a small example with no big  consequences, but these type of simp shy reactions are ruining many  chances I have with women even if they come up and talk to me. How do I  get over it and be the confident guy I always wanted to be?",02May2020,1
361,"just tonight my parents decided to drink, my mom is supposed to keep my father from getting too drunk, but instead she just lets him get loaded to the point that he is currently vomiting in the bathroom, my dad doesn't even get that drunk very often, most of the time it's just on his birthday, but it's almost like my mom was encouraging it. My sister came upstairs to talk to me and give me earbuds so I don't have to hear him, she told Mom to not let this happen anymore, and mom said she didn't like it either. Now my sister and I are just getting really mad and can't calm down especially since we're both squemish. Im afraid that if my mom doesn't learn how to care for her husband, he could become an alcoholic.",02May2020,1
362,"TLDR: I get paid about $2000 every month to home share with my autistic brother but my parents don’t want him with us full time as they want control. Which I get and support. Should we give them the $2000 we get or should we keep it and use it for bills? 


 My (23F) husband (26M) and I recently started doing a home share program with my autistic brother so he would not lose his funding through the government. Basically we get paid about $2000 a month so that he can keep getting money from the government. Once you lose this money it’s nearly impossible to get back and even though he is okay right now he could need it in the future so we agreed. 

Edit: I just wanted to explain my relationship to my parents as well to see if that adds perspective. 

My mom and I have a strained relationship. I love her so much but we were abused by my moms second husband badly and I was very angry at her for a long time for not leaving the situation. I have a relationship with her now but it’s very basic. We text and sometimes go for walks but still has an odd feeling to it. I was told by a therapist this is normal for child abuse victims as they don’t develop the same love and connection as kids who come from more secure families. I can’t talk to her about anything serious though as she tells my current step dad everything and than he ends up lecturing me about it. I don’t have that level of comfort confiding in her I would love to have. 

My step dad. This is a tough relationship for me. On one hand I think he is an awesome guy. My mom loves him. He is hard working and has good morals. He stepped up to the plate with my brother and I am grateful. He has also helped my husband and I in many ways. The bad side to this is I am very afraid of him. Due to the trauma I suffered as a kid I find a lot of men terrifying to talk to. (I was sexually abused as well). My step dad came into our home when I was 16. I think he and my mom started talking when I was 14. I felt very uncomfortable from the beginning. I had not dealt with the fact that I was sexually abused by both my past step dad and my ex boyfriend. He came in with force and took over the dad role very quickly. My mom became subservient to him and basically only does as he says when it comes to dealing with my brother and life in general. I don’t think he means to be this way and I would love to have a good relationship with him but as of now I can’t talk to him. I can’t control my emotions around him as I break down fast. He once called it crocodile tears and that really affected the way I saw him. At first I thought it was me and than I realized it was also him that was the issue. There is no way I’ll probably ever have the confidence to have this talk with him so it’s just awkward and I don’t visit often. 

At first it was all good. He came and stayed with us half the month for the first month of this arrangement. We got the money and used it for bills. I felt fine with that. 

My parents stopped that as they wanted full control which I 100% understand. I am only 23 and am not ready to deal with my brother full time. I expect one day when they retire if they become unable to take care of him or he is unable to achieve independence I will become responsible which again I am 100% for. I love my brother and I want to help. 

We had a conversation recently, before I knew this wasn’t how it was meant to be set up (my brother being with us half the month wasn’t suppose to happen) and we had a talk with my step dad. He seemed very angry as if we were deceiving him for extra money. As much as the money does help, I am also helping them and in my mind I was doing the right thing. It was a very accusatory conversation where I felt I was being talked down to. I felt so bad because I was so worried I’d mess something up and now my parents thought we were doing something wrong because I misunderstood what I was supposed to do. I was told by my mom to call and what to say and it went from there at the beginning. Now they are acting like I’m stealing? I wasn’t happy.

Now we are still getting that $2000 a month as it’s direct deposited to me as per the original arrangement made with the program person we did the home share through. The lady on our case knows full well he isn’t actually staying the full month or even half the month anymore but only some weekends (although not lately due to the world wide issue going on). 

She mentioned in the meeting we might just figure out what to do as a group with the $2000/month but we didn’t not discuss actually giving them any. This money is money received like through a job for taking on responsibility and not part of the money my brother gets from the government. This is also paid through the government directly to me. 

My husband thinks since we made this agreement and my parents have not brought it up that we should just use it for bills and savings. I personally feel weird using it as we are not fully doing what we are getting paid to do. It’s also not our fault this isn’t happening though. 

Should we give the money to my parents every month? Or should we just keep using it for bills? AITA in this situation?",02May2020,1
363,"Hey guys just typing from my computer here cause I'm actually really worried about my life and I'm just really scared about what my future holds. I'm currently 19 turning 20 and a sophomore in college(west coast) . I was raised in a relatively traditional Asian household and they always been expecting the best of me academically alongside my brother, who is two years older and is already making 300k+ right out of college. Ever since coming to college, I have had 0 interest in my major whatsoever(electrical engineering) and have fell in love with music. I've had talks here and there with my parents about not liking my major and wanting to pursue music, but they think that this is just a phase and I'll eventually come to realize that it will just be a hobby. 

My second year of college has been horrible so far and I have already withdrew my first semester, which means that an entire semester have been wasted and all of my credits that semester don't count since I was failing pretty much all of my classes. I have been spending all of my time working out, playing WOW, and practicing piano and singing that I don't have time for studying but also to keep me occupied and not feel as bad about slacking off. I honestly can't bring myself to just focus up and study because I just hate it so much and I would never ever want to do this as a living. So far this semester has been EXACTLY the same as the last one with the Coronavirus making it even worse. I literally just workout, play games, and practice music all day without giving a flying fuck about my grades. I personally feel like I have the potential to make a living but it's going to take time and I doubt my parents are going to like what I choose to do. I have been thinking about this for a long time  but I just kept pushing it to the back of my head because I just don't want to think about it and here it is back to bite me in the ass.

Really losing my mind here I honestly hate my life fuck fuck fuck. My parents are going to find out sooner or later  and they are actually going to go crazy and I'm REALLY REALLY scared of what's going to happen(both to me but mainly them on how they are going to react and it's going to have a big impact on their mental health because they made it their life mission to make sure I succeed academically) If you made it here thank you for reading I'm honestly just ranting and hoping to get it out of my system if you have any tips feel free to comment thank you.",02May2020,1
364,"Throwaway. I'll try and keep it short. My ex and I had a pretty tumultuous relationship that broke off right after we graduated school. We were each others' first loves. We dated a bit on and off through the first year of school after, at which point I met someone else and 'moved on.' I am still with this other person, but I still creep on my ex's social accounts a decent amount, sometimes multiple times per week. Oftentimes, when she posts something new I get this huge drop in my stomach, and I can't really explain that. The big problem with this is that I love my current partner and my current relationship a lot. We click very well and I have no doubt that I want to spend the rest of my life with them. But I still have this compulsion to go back and look at recent pictures of my ex, and I frankly hate myself for it.

I don't want to get back with my ex. Like I said, our relationship was rocky and neither of us were good to each other, especially myself, who was kind of an asshole. It's more of an attraction thing, I think. I look at pictures of her because I think she looks hot. Sometimes I (very disgustingly) find myself jealous of guys in her posts, too, which I know is fucking horrible considering I am in a relationship. Overall, this whole situation really sucks and I get terrified of the thought of my current partner finding out that I still check her posts and being hurt by that. In addition, I want to let go, but I find the physical urges to be really difficult to resist. It's been years since we talked, what's wrong with me?

Does anyone have any advice for me? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Thank you.",02May2020,1
367,"Hey. 18M here.

Growing up wasn’t easy. It wasn’t the worst, but it wasn’t the best. I was told that my life doesn’t matter, that I won’t go anywhere in life, that I don’t mean anything to anyone. I was told this by people who you would expect to say the opposite. 

Because of this, and a lot of other bad situations That happened growing up, I developed a mindset. A mindset that if I died no one would care, that if I disappeared, no one would miss me. I get paranoid that everyone hates me, and I hide those paranoid feelings from people. I’ve always been selfless, too selfless. People always told me that I’m smart, and that if I applied myself, I would go places. I’ve also been told by lots, that im very compassionate. Besides that, I don’t know where I’m going in life, or what I offer. 

Maybe this is natural for an, almost, 19 year old, or maybe it isn’t. But I live without aspirations, or goals. I mentor, I volunteer, I play video games, I play guitar, I live, but I feel like I live without purpose. 

How do I break this mindset? 
And how do I find self worth?",02May2020,1
368,"Context :

A close friend of mine has been going through a really hard time and is currently stuck in a very unfortunate position. I've done my best to support them during this time, and gave them space when they asked for it. As a result of the pandemic, I haven't been able to check in physically, and instead have been doing so by text everyday, which they've said they appreciated greatly.  

Where the ""Am I an a\*\*hole"" title comes in is very recently. I've started 'losing patience' in a way. We went from talking daily for hours to barely speaking, and while I understand their situation I've also began internalizing some anger towards them. Although I check in and we talk, we only do so for a few minutes and then I'm practically ignored until the next day. I don't really have anybody else and I feel like I've partially lost them. I feel like I'm starting to disconnect from them, and I really don't to but I don't know how to hold on right now. I'm worried that if I tell them then I'll be dubbed a terrible friend for feeling this way. 

Anyways, I was just hoping for advice on what to do. If I should suck it up, or discuss it with them, maybe just tell them how I feel.",02May2020,1
369,So my mom and my dad have some issues so I usually play my game or would smoke and she doesn’t approve of it. I told her that it helps me sleep at night and it helps me eat.

373,"In part this is cultural. However we are from the same culture and I've run into this problem more times than I can count:  


""Hey what are you doing?""  


The expected response is ""Playing a video game"" or ""nothing"" or whatever.  


Instead she will usually wait 5-10 minutes, and act as though she ignored my question. Wait for me to go and sit down and do something THEN come and tell me about whatever it is. She almost ALWAYS waits until I'm invested in something else. She then doesn't answer with a direct answer. She will stop, bring over her switch, or whatever it is she is working on, and get annoyed if I don't act totally invested while I'm doing something that is either for my job/work/requires concentration.  


Now the problem has an added layer of issues: I have ADHD. I am diagnosed with it and it is incredibly hard for me to switch between things. She knows this and still does it.  


Any time I have brought this up she acts like she doesnt do this and leaves the room to cry and throw a fit. Recently (because of corona) the problem has been much worse. I've gotten sick of waiting 5 minutes for an answer, then I sit down to study for my job, or start going over something I need to do, just to hear ""Oh I \[literally 30 minutes of talking about something\]"" when culturally this isn't what is considered normal.  


I don't honestly know what to do or say. She will talk about how I shouldn't ask if ""you don't care."" Well...I do care, but I don't want to be interrupted in the middle of work or something important to hear about it. In fact I personally find it incredibly rude to break someones concentration.  


She goes on these tangents about how she listens to me, but this isn't true either. If I bring something up she will provide virtually no input, but expects that I will be on the edge of my seat when she talks about her inner personal politics at work. I don't even get invested in the inner personal politics at my work so why on earth would I care about the politics of her place of work?

376,"So I have a sister (we aren’t close, she’s more of a friends over family type of person. The only time we talk is when we argue) and she has a group of friends. Knowing her for almost 18 years of my life, she depends on these group of friends for her happiness and she can’t stand the thought of being lonely so she’s always out with them or on the phone with them. Before the Coronavirus came, her group of friends would come over practically almost everyday and there was a point where I got really annoyed and tired of them continuously coming over because I felt like I didn’t have any privacy or space to do anything I usually do inside my house. So I confronted them about it, and they took it offensively so it started all this drama and they would intentionally come over everyday just to be petty and all but then the Coronavirus came so they stopped coming over. When they did, I felt so comfortable and safe in my own home and I was honestly so happy. But yesterday, when I came back home from working out at a school, I noticed that 3-4 of my sister’s friends were at my house. When I came back home around 5pm, I remember being so tired all I wanted to do was sleep but since our walls are so thin and our rooms are right next to each other, I couldn’t sleep because of them being loud and all. Keep in mind my sister has me blocked on everything and my parents are super chill and laid back, and stupid I’d hate to admit. I texted my parents to tell my sister to have her friends leave but my sister didn’t really listen (yes she’s a spoiled hardheaded brat) so they stayed until 11pm. Today was my first day of work and I had a shift from 3-7. When I came back from work, 8 of her friends were at our house. Because it’s been 2 days in a row of them coming over, I’m pretty sure they’re gonna start coming over everyday again just like before the Coronavirus. I’m tired and annoyed of having the same group of people continuously coming over to my house and every time I text my parents about it, they just don’t understand me and I doubt they ever will. I don’t directly tell them to leave because I’m honestly not trying to seem like a dickhead and I’m not wanting to risk starting drama all over again. I’m honestly filled with anger and frustration and most of the time, my emotions and feelings go through my head to the point I can’t control myself and I end up cussing out my dad because he never understands me and just calls me mentally crazy whenever he doesn’t understand. My mom told my sister to have her friends but obviously she didn’t listen. The reason why I don’t like them coming over is because usually they gossip and talk shit about other people and it’s just I really don’t want that toxic and negative energy roaming around the house. Another reason is because it’s just annoying having to hear their voices from the other room because I’m either trying to do something or sleep. Another reason why I don’t want them coming over is because of the Coronavirus and how easy it is for my parents to die if they were to get infected. So, what do I do? Feel free to ask questions for a more understanding",02May2020,1

I know I shouldn’t of clicked it but I honestly couldn’t resist. After reading everything, I see that he has paid a pornhub/only fans woman for a porn video. He paid her $100 when she only asked for $55. WARNING IT GETS GRAPHIC. Out of curiosity so clicked the video and all of the videos were of her pooping on herself, licking her poop, rubbing it on herself, using a toy to penetrate her anus getting poop all over it, peeing on herself.

I can’t tell her because she’ll get mad and tell everyone that I did something wrong, twisting the story. The only way I know how to get out of the friendship is wait until high school is over.

But then we heard his 14 year old sister knock on the car door (she couldn’t see us because the windows were all fogged up) and he got his pants on, i got mine mostly on but she opened the door and saw me struggling to get my jeans on and said “oh my god”

I am MORTIFIED.

385,"This story starts like a long ass time ago maybe 2 years ago? My cousin introduced me to her best friends little sister. I’m about to be a senior and her a junior btw. But back then I was a sophomore and her a freshman. Me and this girl sorta hit it off. She started things off and it gradually increased in the flirtation and stuff like that. We’d hang out and talk, watch movies, do semi couple-ish stuff you know, I even gave her a stuffed animal, she would also lean her head on my shoulder and always find an excuse to touch me, we even kissed at one point. I stupidly got feelings from it. After a while of this I get a FaceTime from her, and she was upset. Saying that one of her boy best friends didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. That’s all I was told. Later on I would figure out that there was another boy before me. With the semi flirting and stuff. I stupidly simped hard. I tried my damn best to get her. As this guy was one of those typical high school jerks. The ones with expensive clothing, chains, a perm, and a nicotine addiction. This guy was mad that I was in the picture, saying how he feels betrayed and how “he literally can’t love anymore” and how In his own words “threatened by me” so he left her. I tried my best to make her happy but I guess it didn’t mean anything. As when school started that year she started talking with him again. As this happened I’d see them hold hands, kiss and hug. 17 year old me was pretty damn hurt by this. But through the power of homies, pizza, and guys nights, I got over it. She would text me saying how her and this guy are official now. Like I said I got over it, I was hurt being lead on but hey. I don’t fault her for following her heart you know? 

But as this went on she gradually started distancing herself from me. She’d take several hours to respond to me, she would be real dry, whenever I’d talk to her about emotions and feelings she would laugh at me. Then this guy found out we were talking again and made her get rid of me on everything. She had the “heart” to tell me at least.

I can’t lie I was livid. But in text I was that calm vibe you know? I was just upset the fact that because of some other dude I can’t talk to one of my former “best friends” I know think of her as an acquaintance. I told her to have fun with this guy. And said, when he breaks your heart don’t come crying to me because I warned you. Then I blocked her and carried on like usual. She would try talking to me in school and try getting my attention but I ignored it. The school year would pass and she would be out of my mind completely. Until... now obviously lol. Recently in cold ass Canada, I got a text from her 2nd older sister, she has 2 btw lol. She told me she wanted to talk to me, because guess what? The relationship didn’t last. As this guy cheated on her 

That’s where Reddit comes in. What should I do? I kinda want to talk to her again, I’m also feeling really angry cause feelings and memories are stupidly rushing back to me, and I kinda want to like never see her again. But I just don’t know. Is this good for me if I talk with her?",02May2020,1

When my brother texted him asking if he was okay, his friend texted him back saying that he could shoot my brother anytime any place. My brother said that this is not normal behavior for his friend at all. His friend has been texting him really angry/somewhat violent texts over the past two days. We live in a state that doesn't require any permit, background check or firearms registration to buy a handgun. Also, our state has no laws restricting people with history of mental illness from purchasing a gun. My brother isn't sure if his friend is being serious with these texts.

but immediately after i got back from the trip, we had a big argument about one of his other online girl friends who he's close to. i figured out that they call and watch movies together and are writing a book together. it made me feel pretty jealous and i tried expressing that, and we had an argument all night about it. 

little things he's been doing have annoyed me more as well. i think i'm still subconsciously annoyed that he's close friends with different girls. i'm a pretty insecure person and i think my thoughts are getting the best of me.

just tonight, i called him and he was telling me he thinks 2020 is the worst year ever because of the coronavirus and stuff. just a lot of depressing stuff. i felt bad, i want him to be more optimistic and more happy about the future. and then he told me he watched a youtube video about death facts. i sigh and go ""oh matt"" and he flipped. he was like ""why do you always make comments like that? you don't understand the way i view videos"" and he thought i was judging him.. but it was literally just an absent-minded comment. i wasn't judging him for anything. i just didn't want him talking about depressing topics. i dragged it out into a 2 hour argument, trying to explain myself and that i wasn't judging him. i ended up crying a bit and he got tired and went to sleep for work tomorrow. the fact that i dragged out an argument over deadass NOTHING is really frustrating me. i feel like such an annoying idiot.

i'm not sure what to do at this point. i just miss the old us, the us before our trip. before the other online girl friend. i'm not sure if the distance and the coronavirus is affecting our moods or what. but i've just been so much more agitated lately. 

does anyone have any advice? how do i control my emotions and insecurities? thanks so much.",02May2020,1
404,Hi there. I am a teenager who suffers from severe anxiety and depression. I’ve been bullied all through middle school so I’m scared to standing out. I mainly try to blend in but I feel this makes my depression so much worse. I mainly wear jeans and over size sweatshirts because I don’t want anyone to see my body (I’ve been sexually harassed a lot) and I’m so tired of no feeling like myself. I’m going into high school this year and I just want to be myself but I’m scared of leaving the box people have put me into. I’m tired of being bullied and I just can’t imagine what it would be like if I was more of myself. This is dumb I’m sorry. Any advice on how I can be myself. This is stupid again I’m sorry for putting my problems onto you guys.,02May2020,1
405,"Hello,

Just to clarify before I start, not asking for legal advice here. I already know what I’m doing in that respect.

So, last week, I started to get sick. I thought it might have been COVID (a lot of the symptoms, but no cough). I called off work, and have been off work since. I went to get tested on Monday, and they told me to quarantine. I got my results back yesterday, and they said I tested negative, but the test was only 70-80% accurate, so I should finish out quarantine, and that I can go back to work when I have 3 days without symptoms. Hopefully that’s soon.

My boss is rightfully worried about me coming back. He wants to make sure I’m not sick, makes sense.

Earlier this week, my coworker texted me saying that I should apply for unemployment (PA) since I’m sick, and he doesn’t think my boss will give me sick pay. I think my boss told my coworker to tell me to file unemployment. He’s never done sick pay before (he’s adamantly against it), but now our city and the federal government under the FFRCA require it. I think applying for unemployment in this circumstance would be silly, since that’s not what it’s for (it’s a little unclear online if that’s even okay), and he is legally required to give me sick pay under the FFRCA as far as I can tell.

I’m not a snitchy person, so if he doesn’t give me sick pay, I wouldn’t report him or anything. I’d be too nervous about retaliation, since it would have obviously been me who reported it (no one else is sick yet to my knowledge). So, I’m not looking for legal advice here. My actual problem is with respect.

A very important person in our small company quit last week, basically second to the boss. We don’t have a defined hierarchy,  but I’m basically in the list of important people near the top. So if I quit or otherwise left, he’d be in a bad position. The sick pay is reimbursed by the government as a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, so it would effectively be free to give it to me. If he doesn’t give me something that is effectively free for him (and legally required), then I feel like I’m not actually valued as an employee. I don’t think he realizes how annoying it would be if I left. Like, I’m seemingly an important piece of the company (not crucial, but it’s much better to have me), and he won’t even give me the free-to-him sick days that he’s legally required to. That feels really disrespectful. That along with his recent behavior upset me. We’ve switched our production over to making masks, and we’re getting way overloaded. He’s been yelling at our production workers, which is rude, and making the situation worse not better. I really don’t appreciate screaming at people, especially when they aren’t even messing up. They’re doing what he told them to do, and then he changes his mind the next day.

I’ll be fine with or without sick pay. It used to just be me working, but now my SO has a full time job that pays really well (better than mine, at least hourly), so if I decided to quit over this, we would be fine. I’m just concerned about finding a new job during all this, it’ll probably take too long, and I don’t want to burden my SO. My boss already has a strike with me with the being rude to the employees, and if he says no to the sick pay when I ask this week, he’s gonna be at least on strike two. I’m a very passive non-confrontational person. What I’d probably do is keep working there and just put in my two weeks when I find a new job. I haven’t directly asked him about the sick pay yet, but I will as soon as I’m back (and I know he knows I want it because I told my coworker). 

If he says no, I just don’t know what I should do. Earlier this week, I was super pissed off and crying and stuff because I knew my coworker mentioning the unemployment was inspired by my boss. I really wanted to call and ask for the sick pay, and if he said no, I was gonna tell him to go fuck himself and quit, which isn’t very like me at all, but I really like working there and I’ve put a lot of work into it, but he’s making it hard for me, and was already. I don’t feel appreciated. 

Since that other employee left, if I also decided to leave, part of me thinks that will really teach him a lesson. We’re half the sales force, and both of us did a lot more than that too. He’d be pretty screwed, at least for a while, but maybe that would teach him a lesson, and possibly help out the other employees and future employees in the long run.  I’m also not particularly vindictive, so I don’t think I would do that, at least not without notice and such. I did really want to when I was upset earlier this week. 

How should I deal with this as a very passive person. I have a hard time standing up for myself, but I think I need to here in some way. I’d like if I could help out my coworkers in the process, but I’m not willing to go with the legal route here, so I’m not really sure what I can do.

TL;DR My boss is probably going to say no to me taking the sick pay I’m legally entitled to, and I just feel really disrespected, and possibly worried about finding a new job.",02May2020,1
406,"I am a 28-year-old woman living in Seattle. I've been here for over three years and after waffling on it for a while, I'm pretty sure that I just don't like it here. I'm thinking of moving once the virus situation calms down. Looking for **specific** locations that fit the following criteria:

1. In the United States
2. Has decent public transportation. I was a pedestrian in a car accident when I was young and driving gives me serious anxiety.
3. I'm an artist and generally creative person, specifically in nerdy, pop-culture ways. I like table top games and video games and all that good stuff. I would really like it if there was a good social scene for those sort of interests.
4. I love nature and I love seasons. Specifically, I love snow and mountains. I would like to live in a place that has mild summers, snowy winters, and plenty of nature to enjoy. That said, this is probably the category I am most likely to give up on if a location fits other requirements.
5. Is **not** an overly religious or socially conservative area. I am an atheist and while I will entertain and discuss fiscally conservative views, I will **not** put up with someone telling me that the LGBT+ people I love are going to go to Hell. I grew up in the south. I'm done with that life. Don't try to change my mind.

Thanks for any suggestions you can give me :)

**TL;DR:** I'm thinking of moving. If you know of any places that have four seasons, left-leaning political views, public transportation, plenty of nature, and a nerdy, creative social scene, please share. Don't tell me to learn to love socially conservative views -- I'm queer, many of the people I love are queer, and I won't put up with people saying we don't deserve human rights.",02May2020,1
407,"My boss has gotten crazier since this pandemic hit, it's been getting worse and worse week after week. Everyone is miserable. His nonstop snarky comments and constant belittling has worn all of us out.

409,"I have a friend who recently passed. Their funeral is tomorrow. My friend who passed owned a towing business.  The assumption was that the wife would simply continue on with the towing business and use that as income to support herself and their surviving kids.

The oldest son of my (now deceased) friend is not the son of the wife. He is the son of the ex-wife.  My friend had a good relationship with both his ex-wife and his current wife.  

I saw his current wife put up with everything from my friend and stick by him through thick and thin, no matter what. They had 5 kids together. They treated each other wonderfully.  There is nothing that would lead you to believe they weren't husband and wife.   And despite the fact that I've known the entire family for almost 15  years, I recently found out a few key points:

1) The 'wife' is not the wife; despite the fact that they have 5 children together, they were never legally married.  (Although, to me she'll always be the wife.)

2) The house that my (deceased) friend and his wife lived in was purchased during the 2008 crash using the eldest son's credit, when my friend fell on hard times. So even though my friend, the father, was paying the mortgage there was never a bill of sale or anything written up for the house. So the house currently shows the owner, as the son.

3) The tow truck was also purchased during the 2008 crash as well, also using the son's credit.  Even though my friend, the father, was the who paid off the tow truck, there was never a bill of sale written up for the truck and so it too remained under the eldest son's name. 

Now we come to the last few months....  
 My friend was diagnosed with liver cancer. He was set to go for chemo. The wife mentioned something about the experimental drug, but when Covid hit, all the experimental drug stuff got cancelled and the doctors basically just told him to go home and live out his last days. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now the last few weeks.... 

As the dad was getting worse and worse, the eldest son basically started coming around asking questions about money that was owed to his dad, etc, etc.  After a bit of heartache there he eventually came and got the tow truck and took it away and now had given the wife and the children 4 months to move out of the home. 

Of course she's frantic, She's trying to find a place to live. In the meantime, friends of the deceased (myself included) and long time customers of the deceased are trying to help the wife find a ""cheap"" tow truck. However, I wasn't aware that tow trucks cost so much money. One similar to what he had (a 21' flatbed) are like $20K.  

So here's where I need the advice....

I've never started a Go-Fund-Me, but the thought did come across my mind that that might be a possible avenue to take. 

1) I'm not familiar with Go-Fund-Me, so maybe there's a better platform for it. I don't know. 

2) Do you guys even think that this is the type of thing that you should put on a Go-Fund-Me?

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea.  One thing I love about Reddit is the amount of knowledge that is here. You guys are geniuses.  Any advice that you guys can give that would help the wife from losing the current customer/accounts and help her move forward  would be greatly appreciated. 

I want to help.   What do you guys think my next steps should be?

I want to sincerely thank anyone who made it this far. 

Thank you!",02May2020,1

411,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading. 

I am 25F and have been unhappy with my life since I left college at 20. I work in marketing (which I despise) and I only make $25,000 a year (which is not enough to live on where I live, even with roommates). I live with my fiancé, my best friend and our dog. Having more time to reflect and focus on myself during the quarantine, I’ve realized that I’ve created a life that I hate, that I am not proud of, and that is not one I want to live. 
I acknowledge that my life is the result of my choices and so I want to make different choices in the future. 
What I would just want guidance on is how to completely leave behind my current life and step into a new one. I definitely want to move out of state but I’m worried I don’t have the right resources. I currently have about $3000 in savings and I do have a car. Once I leave my fiancé, I won’t have a support system though. I have no family and only one friend, who I don’t think is capable of being supportive of this. Everything is scary- trying to move completely alone, breaking up with my fiancé after 5 years when he hasn’t done anything wrong, trying to start a new career. 

I’ve only ever done exactly what was expected of me and have only prioritized others and now I just don’t know where to start or what I should even consider before making these changes. 

Does anyone have any advice on my next steps?

414,"A predicament that I face is that meeting new people and making new friends after graduating from college isn't as simple as it used to be, and it was never simple to begin with.  As a high school student, I only ever made 1-2 really close friends, and as a commuter student to college, my lack of an on-campus presence made it hard to participate in college activities and shenanigans.

As a result, as a working professional, now 4 years after finishing my undergraduate studies, work consumes me to the point that I don't know how to meet new people after work is over.  I drive about 50 miles each way for work, and by the time I get home, I don't have energy to connect with strangers.  I feel colleagues are different from friends, who are different from family.

I find myself now in a position where all 5 or so of my close confidants through high school and college have drifted away.  I talk mostly with my family.  I definitely start to worry that I will not have the ability to make new friends to enjoy life with, or a social group of at least 1-2 people.  I also worry that my prospects in meeting a significant other will not be realized.  What if I truly do live a lonely and single life?

I'm currently 26 years old, and male, based in USA.  My contributing stresses could be described as low self-confidence, social anxiety, and depression which plagues me.  I haven't found a way to leverage my recreational hobbies or musical talents to meet others yet.  I really do worry that I'm going to continue to be lonely forever, and the circumstances that affect us all do contribute to that.

For what they're worth (nothing), i've tried some dating apps such as OKC and CMB.  They have never yielded matches.  Well, the latter yielded one match that ghosted me.  Confirmation bias of failed friendships or dates have caused an all-time low in self-confidence.  IT really does hurt.",02May2020,1

i’m 15f and play trumpet for my schools concert band. i’ve only started recently but my love of music has grown so much. i’ve recently bought my own trumpet and my teacher says i have a lot of potential with my playing if i can improve my coordination with playing. 

i’ve recently got given an assignment for my music class. the assignment is we have to analyse a piece of music from a film. of course me being the childish person i am chose married life from up (honestly a really bad decision because i cry almost every time i watch that scene) i’ve done a lot of research into this assignment. 
i want to get the best grade i possibly can because every year there’s an award for every year group. although the chances of me getting it because i started late are slim i still want to prove everyone else i have the same chances as them.
all of my friends say that i won’t get it because i’m not that smart (dumb blonde over here) but i think i’m smarter then most in my year. 

i especially want to prove it to my ex boyfriend who used to say i was terrible at music and that he would always have to do all of the work if we got into a group project for music.

416,"Hello, 
Repost with more details since I didn’t really get any advice last time. I would like some more input from people who would know more than me. I apologize for format since I’m on mobile. 


**Background:**

• current 4th year student graduating this fall with a BASc in Health Services Management, BS in Sociology with emphasis in Health Care and Careers, a minor in Public Health, and a minor in Family Social Sciences. 
• also want to graduate with summa cum laude honors. My gpa is 3.9. 
• have 2 years of internship experience at a physician company in their care coordination department and work at a skilled nursing facility as an admissions coordinator. I also have an upcoming summer internship as a business analyst with a fortune 6 company (UHG) 


**Option #1:** go for a Master’s in Health Administration. That would involve graduating undergrad Fall 2020, starting Fall 2021, then graduating Spring 2023. My university’s program is #2 in the nation and I know this is a good path given my majors/background. 


**Option #2:** my work at the nursing facility has made me also strongly consider nursing. My university is also known for its nursing programs and has a 16 month MSN degree. The thing is, it requires 5 out of 9 pre-req’s done by the time I apply. If I were to do this, my path would be graduating from undergrad Spring 2021, apply Fall 2021, then (hopefully) begin Fall 2022 and (hopefully) finish Fall 2023. I’d use the extra semester during my undergrad to do pre-req’s. I believe I can do well in them (I’m a pretty good student and before college, I was always in honors/STEM program... I didn’t LOVE hard sciences, but I can do well to get the foundation for nursing). I’m used to working extremely hard academic wise and the program encourages people not to work for the 16 months to focus on classes. 

Besides enjoying patient interaction and feeling fulfilled, I think having an RN license would set me apart as a health care management leader. Not only would I have clinical experience but also administration. I’ve heard many companies are hiring more clinical professionals (MD’s, PA’s, and RN’s) into their leadership. I also want to think I can handle clinical rotations and being hands on, but I still want to know more. 


**Does anybody have any thoughts they think I should consider? Or which they think?**

Edit: I’ve been told in the past perhaps a MSN is too... easy for me on r/StudentNurse. And that I should consider becoming a PA instead. But PA school is incredibly competitive and I’d need to take a few years to get patient experience before even applying. So there’s that as well.",02May2020,1
417,"A few months back I woke up in the middle of the night - my bed is on the back wall of my room, across from my door. I was facing the wall but could see my entire room somehow. Then I saw the front door to my house open, outside was nothing, then a set of long, thin hands grabbed the frame, and ducked under the door.

This thing was tall, at least 8-9 ft. tall, he had completely smooth, peach-toned skin. His head was large and round, and his hair was in strands. His face was twisted into a whirlpool, swirling into the middle of his face. He wore a somewhat small, non-fitting blue and red-striped sweatshirt with a white button collar.

After breaking directly into my home, he proceeded to eerily walk his way down my hallway, towards my bedroom. My floorboards creek directly in front of my bathroom, and as soon as I was “aware” he was there, I heard them creak in my unmoving, dream-like state; then, he finally reached my door, reaching for the knob before gently knocking - which, again, I heard in real life - before turning right around and leaving for good.

This was the most vivid, strange dream I had in my entire life, I have only seen this man once, and, despite attempting to “summon” him, I have yet to see him again. Anybody know what this could mean? If this has some semblance of significance with my life perhaps?",02May2020,1

So my (19) step (44) just overheard me talking to my BF and I definitely was not saying something nice it was along about how she had implied to my sister (S1) that it was my fault they don't normally get along, and was talking behind my back. I was being honest I just don't know why she seems to blame me when I'm not around but blames S1 when she's not around. She defends S2 endlessly no matter the situation (she is the youngest). 

I just don't get it. This happens often S1 will tell me every time step calls me a bitch or blames me for a situation. Step once told S1 (and the rest of our family) that I made BF cry because he came out of the bathroom sniffing....he has awful allergies. 

Step calls me a bitch behind my back, talks about me all the time. And I do it once and she comes into the kitchen (where I'm sitting) and says ""I don't like being talked about behind my back"" and then goes and slams her bedroom door.

419,"My best friend is drop dead gorgeous. However she hasn’t had the best taste in men and has been in mostly crappy relationships that leave her feeling like there’s something wrong with her. Recently I met a guy who I thought she would really like and I became excited to tell her all about him. She seemed excited at first too. 

I just got a long message from her about how she doesn’t think she wants to meet him (after quarantine of course) because she’s not a “hot skinny girl” and he’s “probably got girls all over him”. She has gained a bit of weight in recent years, but she could literally be a plus-sized model and I personally think she’s very attractive. 

No matter what I say to her to try and tell her that 1. Any man would be stupid not to like her (he saw her pic and said she was beautiful) and 2. He doesn’t seem like the type to have girls all over him. I really wanted to set her up with someone who ticks all the boxes of what she’s looking for but she won’t budge. She hates the way she looks, covers herself up in baggy clothes, and says she’s too depressed to change anything. She just wants to give up and it breaks my heart.

423,"I’m new and I hope I’m doing this right. I genuinely don’t feel like I’m in the wrong. 
Long story short, I (22f) call out my step brother (13m) when he uses the n word (we aren’t black). His oldest sister (18f) is my step sister and she got upset with me and shit hit the fan I guess because I shouldn’t be embarrassing him.

For context, my family is complicated (whose isn’t?) my mom has three kids: myself and my biological brothers (17 and 13). My step dad has three kids as well ( 18, 17, and 13). 
My step siblings take advantage of my step dad and I understand that it’s hard on him as they don’t love him very deeply and have zero loyalty. We (as in my biological family) have to tip toe around them because if we say anything that could upset them, they just won’t talk to us (or him) for weeks until they forget about it. I usually don’t say anything because I myself have a toxic relationship with my dad, and I really don’t want to mess with their relationship because my step dad is a great person.

My step brother has been around the most, and I genuinely see him as my brother. Just like my biological brothers, I will check them if they say the wrong thing. In the past, my step brother has said the n word, my youngest brother is also 13 and I caught him saying it once. I checked him on it, gave him the speech about how we cannot say that because we’re not black, how there is a history with that word, and for good measure, I threatened to tell our older cousins he’s saying that word (as he looks up to them and they are black). Just to add: I’d never tell them that, I just wanted him to realize that he was ashamed of saying it and that it could hurt people. I’ve also told my step brother that he shouldn’t say that word. 
Admittedly, when my mom and I need to say something to my step siblings, we have to tell my bio brothers not to do something so they don’t feel pressured, my bio brothers know this. But for some reason, this particular word is still in my step brothers vernacular in our house and around me. I really don’t want my brothers using it because when it goes unchecked, they think it’s okay. 

Here’s what happened tonight, step brother says the word in kitchen and I’m in the hallway so I only hear the word but I also don’t really care about context. My step sister (18) and her husband are sitting at the table with my step dad and my mom and brother (13) are also in the room. I come into the kitchen and there’s really no way I can go about this without being direct (which remember, is a no-no for them). I say “[step brothers name], I’ve already told you not to use that word around us. It’s rude and honestly disgusting. It’s embarrassing when you say that. Do. Not. Use that around me again.” 

I can’t really threaten or yell at them because I do feel like that crosses a line, but I made my point clear. My step sister goes off saying something along the lines of how I shouldn’t boss him around or threaten him. It does no use to embarrass him, and I “will never be allowed to speak to him like that again” my step dad says “Mija, just calm down, everyone needs to take a breath” and she turns on him because he’s letting me “talk to her brother like that.” He tries to play Switzerland because my mom is in the room (he caves to them when she’s not around) but it backfired and my step sister and her husband go to the car. My mom doesn’t say anything because my step sister has done some pretty horrible things to us and she’s probably exhausted. But my step dad goes outside to reason with her but gives me a dirty look (which is fine) but now everything is tense. 

Did I take it too far to call him out in front of everyone when I know their relationships are fragile? I’ve already warned him a few times, but more lightheartedly. 
My main concern is him rubbing off on my brother and him saying it, I know there isn’t much I can do in terms of parenting my step brother but my biological brothers are my responsibility I think. I don’t know how to even ask for advice since sitting down with them and having a heart to heart is near impossible because my step siblings cannot take responsibility for their actions, criticism, or even handle the smallest amount of confrontation.",02May2020,1
424,"I want a fresh start. I want to go somewhere new and figure shit out for my own. Thought I had everything figured out, kinda got ripped from me. I wanna get all of my possessions, throw them in the car, go somewhere, and start the fuck over. I have 1,300 dollars. I'm in Raleigh, NC, once I get my shit. I just want to leave everything behind.

I have no friends to stay with while I get back on my feet. I have to get somewhere to rent regardless asap.

I have a car, weed, (soon, assuming recovering them from my ex goes well) my clothes, art equipment. I make art, movies, films and shit. It's my passion in life. I wanna work my ass off, do art in my spare time, meet new people, reinvent myself. I'm 21. I feel so lost I just want to start completely over.

So much fucked shit has happened. I have nothing tying me down here, I'm not running from the law, I just have nowhere to go other than literally anywhere.

I want to completely restart. New game. Ditch my past life. Really figure things out and get to know myself for the first time.

This has all been thrust upon me, as it were. So far I'm thinking random low cost of living town in a different state. I want out as quickly as possible, I don't really have a place to sit much less stay to formulate a plan, so I've gotta figure this shit out in a couple days.

I'm planning on going somewhere, then staying at a motel while I find a job and a small ass studio apartment. 

But Where? How? I have no clue what I'm doing. I've been set free of, well, anything tying me down. So I just wanna hit the reset button.

I'm thinking of a decently well developed city, lots of people to meet. I'm an edgy, emo artist so I wanna find my people.

Low cost of living. Probably going to be putting in insane hours at. Well. Anywhere while I attempt to find a graphic design job or pursue freelance.

I'll listen to anyone at this point. Tell me where to go and how to do it. I'm lost.",02May2020,1
425,"To start off, I have several mental problems (which sounds like millenial bullshit, I know) that keep me from being productive in school. I've almost killed myself once or twice because of it. I'm so exhausted of thinking about killing myself every single day. I'm so. Fucking. Tired. At this point, I don't know if I can make it another year. I'm just not designed for it.

I've been applying for jobs. I'm getting my shit together since we don't have in person school, and I'm a junior right now. I'm moving out with my partner this summer as well (who is 18) because my household is a complete circus.

Statistically, 97% of employers accept a GED or equivalent, as well as community colleges and some universities. I don't see myself ever going to university though, as I'll probably never be able to afford it, and I don't really want to. There is a pretty decently large social stigma though, and I'm honestly afraid of some of my favorite teachers being disappointed in me as a person. I also don't want to disappoint my mom even though she promises me that we can figure out whatever works best for me. 

So my questions are: 

- For those of you who got a GED or other equivalent, have you had troubles getting into community colleges or getting jobs (that aren't super specialized, I suppose)

- Should I sacrifice my own time (that could be spent making money and moving forward) and mental health (mental healthcare is out of the question because it's unavailable to me) so I can get a piece of paper that's a little bit shinier?

At this point it feels like it's either my life or my diploma and I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't even think I can finish this year online.",02May2020,1

427,"Tl;dr at the bottom. Thank you :)

Although I could’ve easily guessed, my brother (13M) today broke down infront of me (16M) more than once and told me a lot. Long story short, our dad a few months ago had a sort of psychotic/nervous/mental breakdown. Pretty much ran away although there were no family issues and nothing was wrong. Soon after, we managed to get him back which is a whole other story, but he seemed to have a re-curring problem with medicinal drugs and taking them irresponsibly which I guess lead to his break and psychotic state of mind. During this time my mother, my brother and me felt as anyone would it was all so surreal ofc, but since them a lot has changed as it has been over six months however still under a year so I guess it is a fresh wound. Myself, I find it difficult to cope with what had happened as it was an insanely difficult time and I found out disturbing things that will undoubtedly haunt me forever however, we made sure to suppress all of the gross parts as he is only 13. 

Since all of this, our dad has managed to come off of the original tablet I won’t name but has since almost replaced it with other unnecessary pain killers as he knows exactly what to say to doctors to be prescribed such medicines. However, this post isn’t for advice on my fathers addiction habits, but my brother’s current state. Two days ago on my dads phone, he saw a disturbing search, of my dad trying get ‘high’ on a certain pain killer he currently takes. The pain killer is pretty common and despite his search you cannot actually get ‘high’ on it as fortunately, the dosage of the actual opiate in it is extremely low. Since this, our family have confronted him and he said it was a search to simply make sure he didn’t overdose, or take too much and he’d simply worded it wrong. He has also given us the medicines to hide as he is gonna come off them from now on. 


As anyone would, my brother is deeply hurt by everything thats gone on understandably as this isn’t the only traumatic event surrounding our dad, there are many however over the years i’ve managed to grow independent and learnt to cope using many different ways and sort of disconnected with my family, the same thing many people do as in just being with your family because they have to, but they don’t really know you and you keep it that way on purpose. Unfortunately, I worry I shouldn’t advise my brother to use the same coping methods I use as I recognize many of them are unhealthy and effect me equally negatively as positively. He told me he completely hates our dad, and can’t even pretend to like him, as I first suggested he do what I do and pretend and act as if everything is okay around him to avoid tension or arguments. He broke down many times and I consoled him, but I seriously fear how this is affecting his mental health as he is still only a child and has to go through these things I wouldn’t wish on anyone not even people I hate. I worry that he might fall into similar habits in the future or might go completely off the rails. I can’t tell my mom or dad about this as they’re both not understanding at all and have a slight ignorance towards mental health in general especially in children, because of course! Kids can’t be depressed (sarcasm)! 

I really want to help my brother but I have no idea what to tell him and it hurts me so much to see him cry and to know of the things he’s exposed too at such a young age but I worry about giving him the wrong advice, all I want to do is try and make things a little better for him and I do everything to try, today I put up some of my old fairy lights in his room and he loved it. I truly want to help him with dealing with his trauma and I was wondering could any of you give me some advice. 

Thank you kind peopleeee. 


Tl;dr

My dad has had psychotic tendencies in the past, and has lied to me (16F) and my brother (13M) time and time again throughout our lives. My brother now completely despises him due to some recent events that I guess pushed him over tipping point and he has completely broken down to me many times the past few days. I worry about the impact all of this trauma is having on his mental health and he is only a child. Unfortunately, my mom and dad aren’t understanding of the importance of keeping good mental health especially with kids of such a young impressionable age so I can’t go to her. I need advice on how to help him cope and not avoid the family as they’ll just get more annoyed with him. I want to console him more but I’m not sure of the best ways. 

Thank you kind peopleee.",02May2020,1
428,"We were both 17 at the time and being with her was the first time I felt truly alive. We broke up 6 weeks later but were spending a lot of time flirting before I asked her out about 7 months of just getting to know each other. After the breakup all I did was cry for 2 weeks straight and my friends were extremely helpful they tried everything and so did I. It got so bad that I ended up getting drunk alone on my 18th birthday. Eventually people just told me that time would heal the wound but for some reason it just hasn’t not even in the slightest. I haven’t spoken to her in over a year and yet she still lingers in my head. I often dream about her and I just wake up depressed when I do. I tried writing a song about how the breakup has made me feel but it just ended up hurting me even more. I’m not sure why we broke up never got the closure despite asking multiple times but it was futile so I stopped. We grew apart because she just wasn’t interested in talking to me anymore. Now my life has become a pendulum that swings back and forth between numbness and sadness. Since the breakup I’ve had one girl that I did feel a lot towards but it never would’ve worked. I dated a girl that I met through a friend but I only liked her because she resembled my ex a lot and realised we weren’t compatible after 3 dates. I had only one tinder date and she was nice but she didn’t seem too interested after the first date and I never got to truly know her. I don’t like to use dating apps it just gets depressing after a while. I’m at this point in my life where I just don’t see women as anything more than friends which I don’t get since I still long for an intimate relationship but I just feel as though no one I meet will be a good match. I haven’t liked anyone in around 2 years. I’m in university now but there’s no one I even remotely see as more than a friend.

429,"So I’m 20 years old and I live with my parents. My mom, who I love a lot has been going completely off the rails.

She tells me how she always hallucinates and tells me how she hears things, such as me saying things when I don’t say a damn word. She has a really bad memory and honestly I feel like I’m just seeing her life deteriorate right before my eyes. And I feel like I can’t do anything about it.

I wouldn’t say that my love for her is currently my issue because although it hurts to admit Im genuinely happy shes with someone that she actually cares for and as long as shes happy Im okay with not being with her because thats all I want.

Its been a year and a half and I cant move on from that and get into a relationship because I still dislike myself for what Ive done.

431,I graduated high school a year early making me younger than my class. So I'm newly 20 and finishing up my 6th semester of college and graduate next spring. I'm transferring to an online university this summer because frankly I cannot afford to go in person and everyone I know is graduating so I would be alone and the online university takes 90 credits so. Anyways I realized that effectively my college career is done. All the parties and getting to know people and limited responsibilities. Is all done. I realized I'm only 20 and now I gotta to be in the real world. I need to figure my shit out. I guess I'm just extremely sad that college is over. I just dont know how I'm suppose to meet people. I'm planning on moving across the country in like a year or so and live with my sister in Phoenix so idk. Is it normal to feel this sad being done?

433," 

I'll be honest I didn't know where else to post this question. I searched online but then I remembered while reddit is full of wacky moments there are times reddit helps.

So here's my question, or more like advice seeking. So here's my story. Ever since I was in middle school I've wanted to be a doctor. I think the fascination of medicine stemmed farther back when I was introduced to science. All my life I dedicated my time and effort to be a doctor. I even told my parents I was sure about my decision.

I'm a sophomore in the University of Illinois at Chicago, going into my junior year. I'm taking all these classes, and while they are interesting I feel like I'm in the wrong place. I only realized it when I took the classes and saw what I'm going into.

I love math, I enjoy a hard math question, one that keeps you up for days until you say ""wait, of course, its this"". I remember when I was a kid I also wanted to be a teacher. I like teaching things to people. While I say I'm not the best at explaining things they always say ""no, I did understand, thanks"". It's that feeling of helping a person that makes me feel accomplished. I remember I used to help a classmate in math because they were struggling, that made me feel good and I always gladly help.

Now I'm at a point where I see how my future is being planned out, how much money and time will be sacrificed. Money is a big one, I want to be a doctor but med school is expensive. I don't want to rely on my parents either. I can become a teacher, I can get a degree faster, and not only that but not be in the same amount of debt I could be in medicine. I can help my parents financially faster as well.

How will I tell my parents, I told them I was sure about my career, I don't want them to see me as a failure? 

Here's my main question, how can I decide on my career now that I've gone so far in one?",02May2020,1
434,"So, ever since I was 10 (literally, I found it written in an old diary I had) I’ve wanted to become a doctor. I graduated from undergrad last April, I worked my BUTT off my whole academic career to maintain a perfect 4.0, took the MCAT in September, and now that it comes down to researching schools to apply to, I suddenly don’t want to go.

Part of it is definitely just anxiety from the application process (as I’m sure everyone experiences), but it’s another part of me that is terrified of committing the next ~10 years of my life to more schooling and drowning debt. In general I’m a very high stress person, I wired myself out in undergrad over every little assignment and exam making sure I got nothing less than an A, and honestly I can’t even imagine what I would be like in medical school. Being that stressed over school all the time is exhausting and I’m scared of doing another 8-9 years of that— what kind of quality of life would that be? I’m thinking it is probably not worth it for me.... well, I’m aware that if you’re not absolutely 1000% sure you want to go to medical school, you shouldn’t. So, after a lot of thinking, I’ve made the decision not to apply and thought about going to PA school instead because I’m still very passionate about becoming a provider.

The problem is, I’m still really emotional and struggling to come to terms with my decision. I go back and forth every couple of days about whether I’m making the right decision going to PA school instead of med school. I’m very hard on myself, and I feel like I’m letting everyone down— myself, my mentors, my parents, my friends.... since becoming a doctor has been my dream for so long. And I know I’m capable of doing it, so I feel like I’m just being lazy and not living up to my fullest potential. 

I get upset and anxious when I see/hear about other people being accepted and going to medical school, as if I’m having FOMO. Like wtf.. if they can do it, so can I!!! So why aren’t I???? Although, I would say the PA lifestyle fits the vision I have for my future a lot better than the physician lifestyle does.

How can I stop feeling so guilty about my decision? If I really wanted to go to medical school, I wouldn’t question it, so why do I feel this way??? Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation? Any doctors out there with advice? PA’s?

((Side note: I know PA school isn’t just a walk in the park either, I’m not trying to undermine it, it’s a very vigorous 27-33 months of studying/training— however becoming a doctor is a lot more of a process than becoming a PA, just facts, two different careers)",02May2020,1
435,"I often feel like I haven't lived my experiences to the fullest when they end. I try to be as present as I can but I always end up creating a distraction: that being either thinking about trying to live in the present instead of simply living in it, or actually being distracted by something else instead of doing what I'm supposed to. That leads to feeling like I haven't really been there, and has ruined a handful of unique experiences in my life. I'm writing this because I have just finished watching a really good movie and feel like I haven't watched it right cause I paused a couple times to go to the bathroom and played 5 minutes of minecraft during a boring bit. Could this be related to OCD? I have OCD but in a different way, I don't really consider myself a perfectionist. Anyway, do any of you relate to this? how do you overcome it?

443,"Hi, I’m a teenager and I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. Due to COVID-19 I’ve been home for almost 2 months now (I am not complaining of course. I know it’s very important to slow down this pandemic and avoid putting others at risk) and I haven’t been able to do anything productive at all.

I have school work to do but it’s impossible for me to do it, I just can’t seem to concentrate at all. I easily spend 7 hours or more on stupid social media and I know it’s not good for me but I guess it’s an escape from all this situation. 

My dad doesn’t help either. He’s the type of guy that doesn’t let anyone be right except himself and if I bring up a point to respectfully disagree with him on anything he tells me I’m over dramatic and asks me if I’m on my period and that I have mental problems. Also he’s very manipulative and likes to always be the victim, so he gets away with a lot of things. 
We can’t have a conversation without getting in each other’s nerves and it breaks my heart because I remember how good our relationship was when I was little. 

I don’t know what to do I’ve tried hiding my phone from sight so I don’t pick it up as often but my brain won’t focus on anything else and sometimes I cry because I feel lonely because I have no one to talk to. I try to casually talk to my dad but he doesn’t care about what I tell him but he expects me to listen to him speak about the same things over and over. His concept of conversation is him just talking and everyone else just nodding and smiling, it’s just not fair. I have to listen to his same things over and over and the moment I make a comment I get 0 feedback, not even eye contact, and then he proceeds to talk about himself or something that happened to him again.

445,"Soooo I’m the youngest of 6 kids. We are all grown now.y parents were married for 54 years when my dad passed away 11 years ago. He was the greatest guy, the last of the gentlemen. My mother is now 85. She made me the trustee and poa (power of attorney) and HCP (health care proxy). It makes sense because I’m a nurse and I live nearby her. I’ve been married 20 years and have 3 teenagers. My siblings are pissed. Oh well. One of my sibling is inciting the others telling lies about me. Well one thing he accuses me of is true.... he says I’m a liar and a cheat because for a whole I double scanned my coupons at BJs wholesale. 🙄 Anyway as a kid I was physically abused my older brothers, mostly by the two who are 7 and 9 years older. Besides that I grew up in complete chaos. Both my parents worked which was fine but that meant it left me home with a bunch of lunatics. 4/5 of my siblings are alcoholics and drug addicts. (Neither of my parents drank to excess or did drugs) Being 7,9,15,16 and 17 years older than me, it was chaotic and crazy. So you see why my mother picked me. That being said most of them are clean and sober now and think they’re better than everyone else including me. I’ve never done anything to them that I can think of and no one will tell me anyway. They on the other hand, have criminal records for mayhem, theft, tax evasion, DUI, numerous assault and batteries and other things I can’t think of right now. You get the picture. 
I awake tried to be there for all of them. I was there for my nephew when one of my brothers was in jail. He stayed at my parents every weekend so his mother could work. I lived at home and took him everywhere with me. I supported my other nephew when my sister was in the psych ward and then was accused of trying to make the kid like me more. As if any kid would like anyone more than their own mother. I could go on and on. But you get the point. The brother that is behind turning everyone on me collected unemployment while he was on vacation in Greece for 6 weeks. He left work at his union job at 11 am every day for months and got paid until 3 and got caught. Now he’s the business agent of that union! Wtf. There’s so much more about him and this story. But now he’s taking to me to court to take poa and trustee. He hasn’t done anything for my mother in 5 years and because she been diagnosed with dementia 2 months ago, he started being super son guess how long ago... 2 months. 
2 months ago that same brother (J)called my other brother (E) getting him all worked up about lies. He’s a master manipulator. And when E hung up the phone he started to scream in my face spitting while he talked. He is a 3rd degree black belt in tai Kwon do and weighs 260lbs. I am 100 lbs soaking wet and never had a fight in my life other than with them and obviously I always lost. E backed me up to the stairs got in fight stance and kicked me in the chest sending me backwards down the stairs into a steel door at the bottom. I sustained a major concussion, sprained arm, bruised ribs and bumps and bruises. I feel lucky he didn’t break my neck or kill me. 
There’s so much more to the history and background of it all. I don’t want to bore anyone  I should probably write a book at this point. 
My brother was arrested and charged with assault and battery and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. 
I want to know if there’s a place where I can post anonymously about my other brother. He should be exposed for the person that he is. 
I know there’s sites like shesahomewrecker.com but anyone know of a site to call out asshole men, abusive men, manipulators  whatever it is. Just need suggestions.

446,"The things my stepmom (SM) have done to my step sister (SS) make me really question life sometimes. My own mom always goes out of her way to support anything me and my siblings want to do, so it baffles both of us with the way my SM treats her own daughter. They're from a pretty well off family, SM has never had to work a day in her life as well as being an only child. Her and Dad both live within walking distance of SM's parents in a gated community. SS is one of the most outgoing, friendly, bubbly, social person I know. She's not the best academically, but definitely makes up for it with her awesome to be around personality. One time she wanted to get into equestrian (horseback riding), her grandparents helped her buy equipment, her father was willing to send her to practice, they were literally one step away from signing up when her mom said 'no', that was about 2 years ago. With quarantine underway, I can tell SM is getting antsy from all time time in home (not like she normally ever leaves the house anyway, tends to spend her time cross-stitching and crocheting). SS's grades are also not doing the best because she's not the type to excel in an isolated environment. Lately SM has been constantly taking away SS's phone, calling her a disappointment, threatening to take her out of her Highschool because she's too much of a failure to be friends with her friends, saying that she needs to get tested for dyslexia because dyslexia is the reason she has anxiety (P.S. SS loves reading and is 16, if she had dyslexia, it would have shown up long ago). SS constantly tells me and my brother that she doesn't feel love from her mom, she uses her phone to connect with her friends that she feels actually care about her. But SM is also the type of person to never be wrong, if you try to disprove her, she won't acknowledge she's wrong and instead give a harsher punishment. For instance, if SS has a D in math because the teacher hadn't imputed the grade yet (so that last math test is at a 0), SM still takes away SS's phone, forces her to study more, grounds her (which means she can't go to her grandparent's house), etc. SM and Dad have a silent agreement going on where she doesn't interfere with Dad's parenting methods and vise versa. I don't know how to support my SS, and as much as I reassure her that her mom can't take her out of her highschool to forcefully separate her from her friends, knowing SM, she might really do it. I want to help, but I feel like it's not my place to interfere. Plus, I can see that there's only so much more SS can take before she breaks down.

If I have an internship in two weeks, after which I probably won't be able to drink at all for the rest of the summer, is there any strong argument against me having 3-4 drinks per night until then? I love hanging out with my family, watching movies and drinking, but I'm concerned about any long term effects on my liver/organs (and two weeks is a decent amount of time, especially considering that's been my lifestyle for the past almost-week-or-so).",02May2020,1
448,"Before the pandemic I've been getting my hair cut shorter and I love it. Unfortunately it's all grown back and then some, and the extra long/thick hair has been bugging me a lot recently. It tickles my ears and is just becoming a bit much.

I'm debating on just cutting my own hair tomorrow to stop it from bugging my head so much. I know I usually give the number 3 to the hairdresser when I get it cut, and my beard buzzer has the clip attachments just like they use, and they are numbered. Im thinking I'm going to attach the correct attachment and go to town on my head with it. Are there any tips or suggestions before I do it?

449,"This is going to sound so dumb to ask for advice for but please cos I’m bad at these things so I don’t know?
My therapist has been off 6 weeks said she’d ring me as soon as she gets back never did even tho reception also asked her to. On the 3rd day of her return I emailed her to ring me and she did. (I was sick of waiting 6 weeks then knowing she’d returned and hadn’t rang on third day I was sick of waiting so I emailed her)
She told me our therapy was over cos the company was cutting sessions due to coronavirus. I said I wasn’t happy about this she said it’s out of her hands and her supervisor decides. I asked if I could speak to supervisor to fight for my right to have therapy. She gave me her managers name. I rang her manager they told me “no she got it wrong because she’s been off for so long she must have got the info that they emailed her all mixed up because she didn’t attend any meetings” they said my type of therapy goes longer and I have 4 more sessions. She said she’d email her and her supervisor to let her know to put me back on her caseload. She asked if that put my mind at ease I said yes but I was worried she wouldn’t be back in contact. (Because of before) The manager said my therapist would defo be in contact with me and that my therapist would be super pleased about this news of having me again as she said the therapist was upset over having to ring and tell me it ended. 
THE THING I NEED ADVICE ABOUT IS THIS:
How long should I wait before I either 1. Email my therapist myself 2. Ring reception or 3. Speak to manager again to say I haven’t heard anything (IF I DONT HEAR ANYTHING) 
The call with the manager was on Wednesday. (I was hoping my therapist would call thur or fri but she hasn’t.)
How long should I wait next week until I do this????

450,"I don't know if this is an ok question to ask here but I don't know where else to turn. I worked at a restaurant about 4 years ago now. It was my first job out of high school that my best friend got me and I was 18 at the time. I had a male co-worker there I was into even though he was 10 years older than me. Eventually, long story short, we were sort of fooling around (like making  out in the storage room and things like that). I soon after learned that he was married with a child on the way so I stopped messing around with him. I found someone on my college campus (my now Ex) who I started dating instead. I was still working at the restaurant and that coworker I fooled around with previously continued to grope me and try to kiss me no matter how many times I said no and to stop. Now up until recently I've never thought anything of it because honestly, I figured it was my fault he would do these things to me because I led him on and I inherently deserved it. Yet even now I question is this actually sexual assault or just harassment even though he would continuously touch me without consent? I don't want to make something out of nothing but as memories from back then flood me now out of nowhere I feel like this is a question I need answers to. I guess I just need advice on how to perceive this and opinions on if I'm just being too dramatic and just need to move on",02May2020,1

They have apologized to me before but never for hurting my feelings. It’s like sorry I miss understood or sorry I told you the wrong information but if they hurt my feelings it’s like there’s zero empathy there. Any thoughts on how to get them to empathize and apologize for their behavior? This is my best friend and I consider them family. Their mom is a narcissist.

453,"Hi everyone! Its a very long post so beware and apologies. 
I'm a woman who has a female cousin 11 years younger. Now this cousin and i have a weird relation. She started to piss me when she said at a party that I'm only looking good because of makeup when a bunch of kids repeatedly told me that i look beautiful ( this was 4 yrs ago). She is busty, has a nice big ass. I'm naturally thin and partially due to poor health. She would body shame me for having smalls breasts, small ass etc. She has now become less aggresive n more sweet in body shaming. Just last evening her mom gave us balloons and an air balloon pump. She casually said fill your boobs with this pump. The other day i lost my earphones n she said YOU couldn't feel your earphones while sitting on them?! Then she indirectly praises herself by saying her friends' moms, her friends, the saleswoman etc say that her figure is very sexy. 

I used to have diastema( gaped front teeth). I was very conscious about it so since last year i started earning , this year I got it fixed by getting teeth crowns. Now you should know that i was the first person to tell her years ago that her smile is very very beautiful (she has a nice set of teeth). Since then she started flaunting her smile. When she saw my fixed teeth her face fell but she complimented me saying nice. Then i discovered that my Fs and Vs are sounding weird because of the new teeth. She laughed out loud saying yesss there's no going back now( my fs n Vs are okay now). Now she would constantly say that how she has a ""naturally"" pretty denture.  Also she is brown ( so am I , we're Indians) and I'm like 2 - 3 tones lighter and with the wave of appreciation curvy, darker coloured girls on the internet she plays it to her advantage. She even shamed me for being light skinned by saying she does not like pale complexion!

So there are a hell lot of things she body/look shames me about. Earlier it was quite aggressive. Now she seems to have learnt that this is not acceptable on social media so she has become sweeter in looks shaming me and waves the flag of anti body shaming, feminism on social media. She makes nice comments on my photos on instagram.

Now the copying thing. To her I'm not attractive enough but sis copies me A LOT. Same shoes. Check. Same outfits. Check. Same aesthetic. Check. Same tastes/preferences. Check Its like i wear/do something and the next week she has the almost same thing. She even stole my writings and posted them as her own but I caught her to which she said ""well you should have posted your work from your diary to the internet early. You were lazy so you lose it."" She even stole a famous poetess' work n got it published in her school mag. Yea she was caught but she said she didn't copy but was inspired.
I have always worn baggy clothes n mostly no makeup , glasses(I'm myopic), high bun except for special occasions. I rode my brother's motorcycle. So she had to say how her friends are impressed that she rides a bike( we never saw her ride one bt that doesn't mean she can't). Now this is just what i like and i don't think I'm oh so unique for having this style. I genuinely believe all ppl are special and awesome. Now when she noticed that this aesthetic is popular on internet, she promptly moved from pink loving, carrying kohl n lip gloss to school to baggy tees, non prescription glasses, high bun, batman loving tomboy. She would now say how she hates pink, made face on seeing my peach coloured makeup pouch.  She even judged my then 2 yr old niece for loving pink and Barbie dolls. She would say how her friends call her a tomboy, conveying how she is not like other girls all the while speaking for women empowerment on the internet. Then she noticed I'm mostly the so called tomboy but dress up for parties. So she added that to her portfolio. She even gets her mom in on this and brainwashes/influences her to say things she wants her to say like oh my daughter is a tomboy, oh she is a foodie, oh she writes. My boyfriend is tall so yeah she has a taste for tall guys ""only"". I smell her trying to compare her boyfriend's height to mine cuz she constantly asks me about my bf's exact height. She already brags abt her oh so tall bf n compares it to other guys height (that's a different story now). Theres an endless list. 
Her current obsession is copying my hair. I have naturally curly hair so guess what who is a curly head now! Her hair is neither straight nor curly (btw her natural hair is lovely). She got layer haircut and most Indian ppl's hair tend to curl a bit at the ends. She has resorted to twisting her hair in buns, braids, not brushing it, not washing it( greasy dirty hair gets curly, right?) n just proving that she has curly hair. All of this is going on since years n i have called her out just twice (not enough calling out though). Once for stealing my writings, once i retorted saying I might have small boobs bt at least I don't copy my cousin all the damn time. 
Now plagiarists/copy cats are already a pet peeve of mine and THIS person doing this pisses me to no end. 2 days ago she said to my 5 y/o niece that she is copying her pigtails. I was shocked that she would say something like that to a child. I said she is a child and she wears two braids everyday and that we have seen her grown self wearing pigtails for the first time while she sees my niece wearing those often. She said not my problem, she is copying me. So i got pissed and said look who's talking to which she said uggh it's 2020, she really thinks that she doesn't copy me anymore n she did that just once in 2017 or something (LOL). She said later to look at her curls. I was already pissed i said why are you so obsessed with curls. Your hair isn't curly tbh.  Yesterday she came to me with dirty greasy unkempt hair saying look at my curls. I just smiled. Honestly I'm mad at myself for letting her affect me so much. There are 2 things that affect me. She doing this while shaming me and just those rare occasions when I call her out. I hate conflict or hurting others. I cant avoid her cuz she is a close relative n i end up feeling bad if i try to ignore her cuz her parents had issues n she lost her dad in January this year. 
Now i have lost my peace of mind because i said look who's talking n said she is does not really have curly hair. Yuck!  I hate myself for saying this and have lost my peace, my sleep. Why can't i just let it all go? Do i need help? I'm disappointed in myself. Today is my niece's bday and all i can think abt is me saying unnecessary immature things to her.",02May2020,1

I’ve always known her parents and my parents are close with her parents, but i just thought they were a bit strict, nothing bad.
Today she said on a group chat of just close friends that she basically deleted all social media off her phone, goodbye. Obviously we were concerned so when we did some digging and contacted Jennifer’s other friends, they told us that her parents essentially told her to cut off her friends because she couldn’t study well, etc. then jennifer said quote on quote “I’m not allowed to even have fun anymore, i can’t do shit”

later one of my friends on that groupchat and I texted her on imessage to see how she was doing, and she said she was ok and everything was fine even though it was very obviously a lie.
We asked her to explain and she repeated the same thing her friend told us, that her parents didn’t want her to have friends anymore, except now it seemed that she was partially defending her parents actions, saying that it was her choice to delete socials off her phone, and that she didn’t want us to do anything and constantly repeating that she’s fine.

I’m very close to calling CPS but she kept on telling us not to do anything and it’s so frustrating because i don’t know what to do. If i get my parents and authorities involved is it meddling or helping Jennifer?

so i never loved my birth dad. and i never will cause i am pretty sure he emotionally abused me. so back in 2017 i finished high school. now i have a few mental illness, autism, Asperger syndrome, and some other ""social disorders"". so my mom and dad was told when i was in middle school that i would never graduate school or get a job, ect. pretty much the schools said i would most likely end up in jail at the age of 18 (i am 26 now and dont have a criminal record or even a speeding ticket to my name).i lived with my dad for i think 10 years when my mom couldnt handle my outbursts, but living with my dad who is a police officer kinda helped me fix my outburst. so when i finished school he got me a scooter. like a street legal scooter and we went to get my motorcycle license, and i never asked for the scooter or to get my class M. but it grew on me. after i got some riding time with the scooter he got me a 1996 Harley Davidson sportster, but he kept it in his name. tags, title, and insurance and i paid him for the insurance. i am STILL attached to that bike as if it was my baby! but there was some things that went wrong that was OUT OF MY CONTROL such as things breaking, falling off, ect. well one night i was at a buds house and my bike was stolen and he blamed ME, and took his anger out on me, he didnt hit me or anything. he just kept pointing his finger at me as if i left my key in the ignition and wrote ""free"" on the bike.

so when i moved out, i took the bike with me and he knew cause i told him where i was going with it. when the oil needed to be changed, i changed it. when tires needed to be changed, i got the tire and changed them. hell i even been screwed over getting a used tired when i paid for a new one and i fought to get the NEW tired i paid for. i had my pipes fall off, well i was able to get some used pipes, but they were still in good shape. my ignition switch broke and i ordered a new one and replaced it. hell i even hit a curb and my bike fell and there was some damage to it that i got the new parts and replaced them and made sure they were replaced right! and if i couldnt fix it myself, then i found someone that can help and has more experience in fixing the issue. so i took good care of that bike. cleaned, polished and all.

&amp;#x200B;

so in 2018 i lost a dear motorcycle friend to suicide and after his viewing i had a falling out with my girlfriend at the time and it sent me into like a depression filled madness to the point where i was numb to almost EVERYTHING. so my mom forced me into the mental hospital. while i was in there i had a shop scheduled to pick up the bike and fix something (i think it was the clutch or gears). well when i got out of the hospital and got home, i called the shop and they said they couldnt find it where i told them where it was before i went in the nut house. then i called my dad to tell him the bike was missing or stolen cause it WAS his bike, but he never rode it. then he admited it that he took it, and is planing on repainting it and maybe selling it. so he painted the bike all black when he said he would NEVER do that to the factory custom paint but did anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

so last month he said he was gonna try to get the harley back together and 'try to get me back on the road'. so i thought 'cool. i'm gonna get my baby back' but a week later i called to ask him if he was for sure gonna give me the harley back so i can buy some new gear, helmet, gloves, sunglasses, maybe a vest, you know...the whole biker look. then he starts talking about finding a nice yamaha or some kind of metric bike. now i am not saying i hate them or they are bad bikes or such, but i wanted the HARLEY back cause it was my baby.

&amp;#x200B;

i think he he playing with my hopes and trying to abuse my emotions again, i told him i was letting my class M drop when my licence expires and keep my class C and he keeps telling me not to drop my class M cause ""we will get you back on the road"" but if i dont let it drop he wont give me the bike that made my life worth it. now without the bike i stay indoors hell of a lot more (before the covid-19 crap), and even though i have a car that is falling apart for a 2006, i just dont go out much... and i cant afford a new bike because i dont work cause every job i have fires me for a bull crap reason. so i am on disability for my mental health and thats keeping the roof over my head and such.

&amp;#x200B;

so what should i do? should i keep my class M and risk getting played with again, or should i drop it and not let him win? i am also open to what you think i should do.",02May2020,1

Whether that's finishing a book/game/homework or even a video that I went out of my way to watch. I fidget quite often, and if I can, find a way to get out of my seat. I spoke with a close friend from school, who's observed these behaviors, and he mentioned it's similar to that of his brother's, who's diagnosed with ADD. I might just have a shitty attention span, or be an even shittier student but I was wondering where I'd go to get tested, or if I even should.

We'll be talking and then she just doesn't respond until the next day, which isn't crazy because she could be that she's just asleep. But there've been days where I double texted her the next day, and she responds, but only after I hit her up a day after her not responding. She didn't reply for a day or so, so I texted her and asked her if she was okay, and she said yeah. I asked her if she wanted to still talk to me  and she that she did and thanked me more than once for checking up on her. After that, I gave her my # so we didn't have to talk on snapchat anymore, and she hasn't texted me, so I just decided that she didn't wanna talk anymore. She did say she was busy with school and whatnot, but it's been hours. I'm not that pressed about her not liking me, but why is she sending such mixed signals. She's nice than most ppl ever are and she was never distant at all, she would just take a long time to reply sometimes. What's the point of leading someone on, and being so sweet just to ignore me.

484,"my (19m) boyfriend (22m) haven’t seen each other in coming up in two months because of recent events. we only recently started dating, but it’s been made clear by both of us that we want our relationship to last. however, we’ve been struggling a little bit due to different circumstances living at home. my family is following quarantine very strictly, because all of us are home all day and there are 6 people in the house, 2 of them being children and at risk. i have not been in public since early march, as my parents go out for necessities, and i have not been allowed to see friends in person until recently. my boyfriend is in a different house, where his family isn’t as ‘worried’ about getting sick and haven’t completely isolated themselves, and he is having trouble dealing with the fact that we can’t see each other and touch each other at all. i’m open to seeing him and social distancing, but he’s said that might make him more sad or agitated by our situation. adding to the complexity, my parents are divorced, and i have the option to live at my mothers house, but her partner is a mortician and i feel as if i would be unnecessarily exposing myself and splitting my family up by leaving. i’ve been given the choice to leave my dads house whenever i want, but i cannot come back to his house once i leave, and my brother has to follow to my mothers house if i go (and for other reasons that would not be in his best interest). i feel pressure to stay for the sake of the balance in my family, and guilt because everyone else is staying home and the overall decision of where to stay and who’s protocols to follow is overwhelming me. i want to see my boyfriend, and i personally feel as if it’s safe to see him, but my family’s opinions and rules are different, and leaving to see him could making coming home complicated and he doesn’t fully understand how i feel about this situation. it’s been almost two months since i’ve seen him, a month since i’ve seen my mother, and living at my dad’s house make me feel like shit all the time, but i feel like i have no other option. my boyfriend is starting to get fed up, and me talking about this constantly with him is making us both feel shitty. i don’t want him to break up with me but i also understand why he’s frustrated with me.

487,"I bought what is supposed to be an authentic Tiffany &amp; Co heart toggle necklace. I paid a pretty penny for it. The item was advertised as authentic, not a replica. Imgur album here: https://imgur.com/gallery/gfwlzdY

My heart is unfortunately telling me the seller scammed me, but I can't be sure. I was wondering if anyone could help me determine this because I only have one day left to do a return at Poshmark if it is, indeed, counterfeit.

The imgur album linked above includes close-up shots of the engraving, the toggle, &amp; the links.

Here's what I can tell you other than that:

1. I personally weighed it. It weighs 76.8 grams.

2. It passed the magnet test. As in, I used a strong magnet, and it was not magnetic.

3. I am mostly bothered by the links. It is my understanding that they are supposed to be pretty much seamless. The links did appear pretty much like that when it arrived. However, I cleaned up the necklace a bit &amp; the lines on a few of the links became visible. It was pretty tarnished on arrival. I'm not sure if those lines might become more visible with time or if they would stay hidden. Also, please note that the majority of the links still seem to have pretty invisible seams.

A bit important to note: There IS a Tiffany &amp; Co heart toggle necklace that is blank on one side of the heart. It is vintage &amp; discontinued, and the exact item I was seeking. Being that the item is supposed to be a vintage, I'm wondering if it's reasonable that some links show seams from wear? What do you think?

If there is any other thing I can do to test it to verify either way, please let me know &amp; I'll post the results ASAP.

489,"So long story short,

There was this man who interviewed my girlfriend (not my girlfriend at the time) for a job and about a week after the interview, the man made a fake account and DM'd my girlfriend on instagram asking if she wanted to be friends with benefit. After saying no, and saying that she had a boyfriend, he had the audacity to ask if there was no other way or if he could pay her $300 for sex. After constantly saying no and blocking the first account, this man decided to make multiple fake accounts to constantly message my girlfriend. He then went on to say that he had seen my girlfriend before on the street, and knew where she lived. He then went on to message her again saying that he would pay more money. At this point my girlfriend and her roommate wanted to find out who this dirtbag is, and googled him and found his real account. They found out that he was married and with this information she said that she would expose him to his wife with all the chat screenshots. He began to message on his actual real account saying how sorry he was and how he would repent and never do this again and if there was anything that he could do for my girlfriend to not tell the wife. 

When I found out about this, I was fucking enraged and said that if he messaged the way that he had to my girlfriend (someone who he had met only once during an interview), then he must have done this multiple times and would have kept doing it. I am just asking for advice on what you guys think i should do in this situation. She doesn't know if she should tell the wife, or what she should do. I told her i think that she should, and even go as far as to contact the workplace and tell them of what had happened.",02May2020,1

Recently shes become unbearable, declaring that we're disrespectful, how she does everything around the house, and more. Today in particular we went shopping, got food for dinners, payed for all of it ourselves, brought it in amd put it away by ourselves (minor but irritating), and then got upset with us over us not preparing her food 'I didnt raise you to be like that'.

491,"In order to keep this post as short as possible, I’ll leave out a lot of details. Simply put - a guy from work that I don’t see often because we work different jobs and in different departments has presumably had a little crush on me for at least a year. I’ve noticed it through the few interactions we have had. We recently found out that we had quite a bit in common, which led him to add me on social media a week later. We had a good conversation - nothing personal, just meaningful discussions about random things. Nothing was weird - he was normal, I was normal. Then he stopped responding when it got late. I figured he had fallen asleep. 

Well, he never responded the following day, even though we were mid-discussion. No worries; I sometimes just don’t feel like carrying on a conversation anymore. That’s his prerogative. The day after that, I just sent him a simple but thoughtful message wishing him a good week at work. He read it but didn’t reply. 

That week, I ran into him about 2-3 times. Every time I did, I guess he was caught off guard because his face would turn super red, and he avoided me. It was very bizarre. He’s a little shy-natured, but he never avoided me prior to us messaging one another. The first time or 2, he wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. The final time I saw him, however, I made sure to look him in the eyes and he returned my gaze and blushed again. Wouldn’t say a word to me though. Also, he is almost always one of the first people to view my “stories.” To me, that shows some level of interest, right? I only look at maybe 5 peoples’ stories, and it’s only people I care about or find interesting. Otherwise, I don’t really ever watch anyone’s because I simply don’t care, bored or not. 

Also, just some miscellaneous info: I’m 100% certain he’s single. I’m 24, and he’s 29. He’s usually actually a very sweet, polite, and good-mannered guy. 

So my question is - I am really interested in this guy. I wanted to ask him out for coffee or lunch (picnic somewhere), but then he started ignoring me. So if I want to find out whether or not he’s interested, I obviously have to address the part where he’s ignoring me, right? If you were in my shoes, would you just send him a message and ask? I just cannot think of ANY REASON as to why he started ignoring my messages and avoiding me. It’s strange. But I really want to know, and I also want him to know I’m interested.

493,"Ok to start off I am an emotional personal and my father is not. I generally feel like he has no tact in social situations whereas he thinks I am just too sensitive. 

For example I went to a Mexican grocer to get some masa for tamales a few months ago. My father decided to tag along because he could do some other stuff too. I should mention that this grocer is really busy and they sell out quickly. So I was prepared to wait for a while. 

I ended up feeling happy in line as I love Mexican grocers. I was also trying to play it cool too and not be a bother to the workers.

However, my father showed up and things only went downhill from there. He started off by asking why they were taking such a long time and then he wanted to go bug a bunch of workers about when the mass would be finished. My father is the type of person who will ask you a bazillion rapid fire questions and complain the entire time.

He wasn't happy after they told him that it would be an hour or so. It was at this point that he told me that we should head home and just grab Costco tamales. A lot of the people in the line gave us weird glances after this comment too. Also, this comment really pissed me off as I love making tamales and I feel like he just likes to be an ass.

494,"(I am in my final grade of high school)

Back in November when I ended up applying to university, I ended up picking many BSc psychology programs at some local universities; I was accepted to my first choice.  And ever since about January I have become so indecisive about studying psych; and most people know, a bachelors in psych doesn't lead to many well paying careers. Lately, I have come to realize that I don't think I am ready to be in school for about 10+ more years, I don't even think I am a PhD bound student.  My mom really thinks psych is what I should study, and she constantly shuts down any new ideas I have; which could have lead to my indecisiveness?
I feel like ever since I brought the whole psych idea up she has stuck with it.  Even when I come up with new ideas, she convinces me that i should stick with psych.  
So this past few weeks or so, I have started to get an interest in coding again.  I was thinking of trying to bring up studying computer science as my major and psych as my minor.  I took a computer scince class in grade 11 and enjoyed it.  I also have all of the pre reqs, but I'm going to attempt to teach myself calculus and review some programming now and over the summer just so I have at least some fresh experience with the field.

497," Starting off: I have ADHD, a terrible memory, and a bad case of perfectionism so I've always struggled in non-traditional learning assignments. Online assignments are incredibly hard for me to remember and focus on. I have a habit of letting things go that I don't ""need"" to finish, and then doing a rush job on what I ""have"" to do.

For one of my classes, we needed to craft a website. It is 100 points and was originally worth about 1/4 of the class grade. The class is very important and I cannot graduate without it. It's about 20% done and I have all the basics in place.

All of my other assignments for this class are due next week, so I mistakenly assumed it was also due next week. About 10 days ago my professor emailed us saying we needed to sign up for a time to review the website. I assumed (again) that this wasn't the final submission date, and that I still had time. I don't still have that time, and it was the final submission.

I've now missed 100 points in the class. What's worse, the professor edited the syllabus and increased the value of the website to 1/3 of the class grade. I cannot safely say I will get a perfect score on the other 2/3rds, and I doubt I will pass. I now will most likely not graduate on time. I'm incredibly embarrassed by my mistake, obviously.

499,"Tl;Dr on bottom. Buckle up folks.

Fair warning for what’s ahead. Ahead is a very long post about very trivial things that upset me. I need advice because of how strong my emotions get over these things, but if you are someone who has little patience for people who get upset about trivial things, please, I implore you to go into this with an open mind. I don’t ever want to imply that my issues are more important and pressing than someone else’s actual physical issues that involve grim subject matter. I already contemplated whether I should post this because of how guilty I feel putting something like this up when people on this very subreddit deal with very serious issues such as sexual assault or relationship issues. That out of the way, let’s begin.

Hi, I’m 17(M) and I tend to get far too emotional or upset over the most trivial things like what happened today. For some context, I’m an active gamer and user of Discord, so I’ve been interacting with some communities and one community in particular I’ve grown to like had opened some slots up for new moderators. Not really having much to do because of quarantine, I decided to apply and unfortunately, I wasn’t picked. I never said anything or did anything in the server that would have suggested I was upset about not being picked since all I really said about it when the new mods were selected was just a simple “Congrats!” That was a few days ago. Today, out of nowhere, they made someone else mod (wasn’t me) and said that they may get some more mods than originally planned, so I was kinda hoping that perhaps I could get mod, so I was being way more active in chat then I normally, though I never directly talked about my desire to be mod. Some of the admins of the server were active too and we were on the topic of pets. It’s worth noting right now that the server is perfectly fine with slightly dark jokes as long as it isn’t malicious. I was about to make a off-hand joke about one of my server friend’s cat looking like roadkill because the server friend jokingly said their cat was ugly (I’m good friends with this person and they and I have a good joking relationship thankfully) when one of the admins said their cat got killed by a car earlier. Welp, they posted that little message literally right before I messaged the joke about roadkill into the chat. I didn’t think much of it, but then like two minutes later, the admin pinged me and told me to be more considerate of others and just had this super smug attitude (Aka, they have a :) after every sentence which pisses me off to no end when people do that). Thankfully, another admin and the friend mentioned that I didn’t post the joke to specifically target them and I myself apologized for making a joke about roadkill given their current situation, but the admin in question refused to address me again and the chat began to move along as if nothing happened. I apologized a few more times subtlety in chat and made some jokes about me accidentally offending an admin and things seemed to be fine. Well, I then got a warning from the server bot in Dm with the reason saying that I needed to stop talking about the incident, that it was just a misunderstanding, and I was being stupid by not letting it go. I didn’t mention anything in the server chat about it and I made an excuse to go offline because I just felt horrible over the whole thing. I know it isn’t a big deal, getting one warning on a server and possibly not getting moderator, but it just felt like it was a big deal. It’s hard to explain, but I sometimes just get upset over something minor like this and start to obsess over it for weeks. I then feel worse once the logical side of myself reminds me that what I’m getting upset about doesn’t matter and isn’t a problem. It just gets worse and worse until I eventually shut down and just go on autopilot until I forget about it which can take a long time. This isn’t the first time this cycle has begun, but this time around, I don’t want to feel horrible over something trivial. I don’t want to be in an awful mood for weeks on end all because I didn’t get mod on some random Discord server. It just sucks when I get into these horrible moods because people around me generally label me as the “mature” one and the “reasonable” one because of the fact that I don’t tell people my real feelings. Even online, people seem to buy into that persona, but that persona isn’t the real me. The only reason I’m posting about this on Reddit is because I’m not very active on Reddit and none of my friends use Reddit. Back to the post, I wish I was calm, collected, and mature, but in reality, I get far too emotional, think far too much, and cry far too much over stupid crap such as if I don’t get moderator or if I forget to work on my personal hobby projects. That’s another thing, it isn’t just in the realm of video games or online stuff that I get upset as I get upset with myself and will literally cry alone if my writing (which is a hobby I do love to do) isn’t turning out the way I want it too. I just don’t think this is normal to be literally crying about something like not getting mod and I don’t think it’s normal that despite the fact that I’m this emotional, people say I’m the mature and quiet one. 

I want to know how I can change this part of myself. I’m afraid to talk about it with anyone, my friends and family, because I feel like they have high expectations for me to be the mature one. I can’t count how many times my sister, one of the people I feel more comfortable talking with, has complimented me on being mature and rational because she herself is also very emotional, though unlike me she talks to people about her emotions and it seems like her friends have just accepted that as a part of who she is. Her friends and my friends are very different though as many of my friends have very, for lack of a better term, “internet” personalities. Basically, lack of patience for stupidity, nerdy, not super serious, and cynical. That’s why I don’t want to talk to them about this sort of thing because they just don’t seem like the emotional types to me. I also don’t want to talk to my family because when I was much younger, I didn’t hide my emotions and it caused my mom so much stress because of how difficult it made school. I did eventually start to hide just how emotional I was and started to do much better in school as I was able to actually to get somewhere in social situations without breaking into tears. Unfortunately, this is only possible because of the self-loathe, anxiety, and crying that I subject myself to when I am alone.

In essence, I am asking for advice on how to handle my horrible tendency to get unnecessarily upset over trivial things such as video games, mean Twitter comments, and writing difficulties. It has been draining on me over the past few years as I feel like an emotional wreck, a fraud. I feel like one of those crazy people on Twitter who have a mental breakdown with the only difference being when I am about to cry and beat myself over something stupid, I just simply type “gtg” and give a bs reason for so that usually garners overly positive responses and well-wishes. 

I know this is a big post and that the main issues such as the mod thing and the writer’s block aren’t what people would define as “big deals,” but my tendency to get emotional and unreasonably upset is starting to get to me. I feel like I can’t escape these feelings as it seems to happen everywhere. Hobbies, friends, family, social events, whatever. If it’s even slightly not something I want or like, I get super upset inside. I’ve been quiet about this for so long because of how silly I think this is, how trivial it ultimately is. Even when writing this, I was close to tears thinking about how I’m getting so upset over this when there are people who deal with legitimate problems such as poverty or abuse. I guilt myself into thinking that I’m selfish for getting upset over a moderator position when there are people who struggle with enormous challenges and still face them with integrity and courage. I mainly came because of the fact that this cycle I’m getting myself into always ends with me going radio silent online and going on autopilot irl for months and I don’t want that to happen again. I don’t want to completely trash my happiness for months nor trash my relationship with this server in question as I do like a lot of the people on it. I don’t want to develop an unreasonable grudge against an admin who was just having a bad day as I want to be friends with people and get to know them. I have done this before with grudges and it’s always so hard to break out of it. I start to develop horrible assumptions about people I know are unreasonable, but I believe in anyway. Already in this situation, horrible assumptions and fears are starting to crop up as I started to seriously think for a moment that the staff team didn’t like me and wanted me to go away because I was male while a lot of the staff team are female (I know this is stupid and it made me feel stupid when I started to think this way. It’s especially stupid given that two of the three new mods are male). 

I know I’m gonna get a lot of responses saying to talk about these feelings with someone, but I’m so scared to. I’m scared people will lose patience with me and leave. I’m scared I’ll get labeled sensitive and crazy like those Twitter crazies who rant about childless women in Disneyland. Even if it was to a therapist, that would involve telling my mom about it as I don’t know how to get in contact with therapists, especially rn given world conditions. I probably should have mentioned this earlier, but this whole post is unformatted af. I have been diagnosed as having Asperger Syndrome and I do have certain physical disabilities (probably won’t be that hard to figure out which ones if my Reddit history is anything). Post is almost over, hope I got everything I wanted to say. Conclusion time, buckle up.

I feel like I’m drowning in my own self-pity even as I write this post, but I don’t want to hide anymore. I want some actual advice on what to do for this. How can I more properly handle things that upset me? Can I prevent things that are trivial in nature from upsetting me in the first place? And if you guys wanna be generous I guess, how should I move forward in regards to the Discord mod situation? I do really wanna be mod because I love the server in question and I love helping people on it (something I already do sometimes though mostly through the form of telling people to “read the pinned message”). I really wanna get a handle on this now because I applied for some online Discord game of sorts that I am really excited for and that only has a limited amount of slots a week ago and the participants will be chosen on Sunday. I don’t want to get completely wrecked if I don’t get in because of how silly it is to get upset over not getting into a Discord game.

Reddit, what is your advice to me?

Tl;Dr: I possibly screwed up my chances of being moderator on a Discord server and am unreasonably upset about it though I don’t make it obvious. How can I address these feelings?",02May2020,1
501,"I’m a college student but have totally fallen in love with a 2006 Gibson ES 165 Herb Ellis model guitar. It costs $2300. I have enough to buy it. I’m going to college for Accounting, but jazz guitar is my true passion. I figure I can play it this summer (during quarantine) and probably get lots of hours of enjoyment and improvement in my playing from it. It’s a true professional guitar.

502,"As the title says, he wants me to be horny and do sexual things, but I don’t know if I want that.

We’ve been together for a year and at the start I was quite active and adventurous but then I just burnt out, for some strange reason. 

Since then, whenever he asks if we wanna do anything sexual I tend to say no. Sometimes I don’t even feel like making out (and I have no idea why). 

I know he fees very disappointed or upset whenever I tell him I don’t feel like it, and that makes me feel terrible as well. 

We’ve talked about it and he says it’s fine, but I feel guilty because it’s like I’m holding him back.

At the same time, I’m mad at myself about not being horny... though being horny did cause my reputation to change two years ago and I wholeheartedly regret that. 

In summary, I feel guilty for not being horny, but at the same time, I don’t know if I want to be horny again, because sometimes I can’t control myself/it’s just a bad time overall because it just feels wrong to involve myself in it at this age (even though I’m of legal age in my country). 

I don’t know... would breaking up with my bf make the situation better? Should I try to force myself to be horny, or identify why I don’t feel like it in the first place so that I can change it to how it was before?",02May2020,1
504,"I'm having a hard time at the moment with my mother. I'm 25, college student, getting ready to apply and transfer for my junior year. My mom has been a lifelong alcoholic, she has never been physically abusive to me, in fact whenever I was physically in danger or needed help with my difficult rare medical issues, she was there. 

However, she has been emotionally abusive to every husband shes ever had, divorced 4 times, is currently living with her newest boyfriend, and was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal and stomach cancer.

Firstly, I do love her, but even before the cancer diagnosis I began avoiding interacting with her years ago since becoming an adult. I pretended everything was ok up until recently. She had a panic episode just before she was to start chemotherapy and made a rash decision to call my grandparents, who are housing me while I'm attending the local community college, and told them she wanted to come here to give up and die. They know I have some grief with her and asked how I felt about her coming here

I told them I was fine with it, if she could wait 3 weeks (at the time) for me to finish my finals. I am at a very crucial junction in my life right now, first time I've had a semester with straight As, and I really need this GPA boost for my college applications. And I cant handle being around her while shes drinking herself to death, lashing out at everyone around her, including me, her parents, her doctors, just spiraling out of control. I cant emotionally handle watching my mom do this at such a crucial time in my life.

Unfortunately when my grandparents told her these concerns for my education. She hung up on them, called me hours later and left a voicemail basically calling me a piece of shit and that whatever problem I had with her I needed to get over it, and hung up. Granted she has since decided to resume treatment and stay where she is.

I tried calling and no answer, so I finally just wrote up a massive multipage text expressing my reasons and grievances for everything over the last 25 years, made it clear that I love her and don't hate her but just cant have her physically her right now.

And now I'm here feeling a mixture of anger, sadness, and guilt over it all. Was it the right thing, will things ever actually be ok between us again",02May2020,1

507,"Hi y'all. It's been almost two months since the Quarantine started and I've been reflecting on some stuff in my life. I'm not really good at apologizing for my actions but I'm going to try, but it'll take a while.

Keep in mind the setting here is in the Philippines and people aren't exactly LGBT+ friendly.

It has been almost a decade since I've graduated from a Christian high school and have friended a lot of people there including the teachers and pastors that come by every week in school (it's a small school. Probably between 100-150 people including teachers, staff and the principal).

To start, about a year ago, August 2019, there was a controversy regarding a trans woman being harassed for using the women's bathroom (Link to the article below). 

Unfortunately before that time, one pastor and his family was really against the SOGIE bill (Summary of the bill: People can't discriminate LGBT+ folks because of their sexuality) being passed. I was disappointed in them so I unfriended the whole family.

I didn't do anything else except remove a few anti-LGBT+ posts from relatives and other people until I saw a post from another pastor who is also a teacher in the school.

I was honestly heartbroken as I read the post where he basically said that something is wrong with the woman mentally and she needs to return to ""normal."" Fearing that my friends who were still there will parrot him and will do the same to me when I come out, I unfriended them on the spot.

It has almost been a year since the controversy and I have been sorting myself out during this quarantine. I have been considering re-friending them and I'm afraid of the messages that'll come after. Should I do it?

TL;DR: Pastors posted hate during a controversy, so I unfriended them and my highschool classmates, but I  have been re-considering to undo the decision.

511,"I’ve been living in this building for a while now and all was quiet and calm. Then these people moved in downstairs and down the hall, so their apartment is diagonally downstairs. 

These people are so loud that I can hear their music clearly in my apartment (this place has thick walls). They play the music almost all day but especially loud from 12am till as early as 8am. It vibrates the building. 

They smoke inside (hallways and their apartment) and stinks up the whole building, including my apartment. 

They also like to invite 6+ friends over and hangout in the parking lot, crowding the entrance, in the middle of a pandemic. They also like to run around yelling and screaming at 3am while outside.

513, My roommate and very close friend staged a suicide attempt to postpone an interview. None of us are from the United States but we study here.  She told everyone that she took 30 pills of thyroid medicine when she actually took only three or four because i go with her every month to refill her medication and she has been complaining that she doesnt have medication for the coming month.  We go on walks everyday and that is the only time we get out of the house due to covid. So we know each others' every move and also to double check i called the univ pharmacy and they confirmed that its not refilled.  Its not a  cry for help either because she didn't have any solid reason to substantiate an attempt. This came of even in her diagnosis and they are now running tests to know if she has any thyroid related disease causing depression that she doesn't know of.  She has a history of making up very serious lies to get out of tough situations but i never thought she would pull off something like this and betray me and use me. Now the problem is that i don't want to stay with her under the same roof because I don't know what she will do next. She is planning to leave the university on May 9th but i cant even tolerate her until then or be fake with her. Her rental contract ends only in July.  How do i go about this?  What should I do?

514,"I found out my dad was cheating by accident. His email was logged in when I was using his computer. I was nosey and I looked. He had an affair with 3 different women. (That I could see before my tears blinded me)

As you might have guessed I had a bit of a meltdown. I was in my early 20s then. I tried to print them but when it didn’t work I just wanted to leave. He was in the room beside me. 

I walked outside furious but shocked and silent. I walked past my mom in the garden. (We live in nowhere Canada it’s not that special) And said nothing.

I called my best friend. She was working and she asked if it was important. I told her yes. And the tone in my voice was enough. She told her dad (who she worked for) that she had to leave.

I called my brother (not my dads son, 11 years older) and told him I needed him. And to meet me at my best friends house. He said he would as soon as he could.

She was there in 15 minutes and I was shaking. She said get in the car straight faced. I told her what happened.

While we had never talked about it, it was very clear to our very small town that her dad had cheated on her mom a lot.

She told me I couldn’t know what their relationship agreement was. And asked if I was sure I wanted to tell my brother. 

My brother is exceptionally large, strong and intimidating. Not to me but I see how he is to others. 

I know that telling my brother ends with my dad in the hospital. So when he arrived panicked. ( I have never done anything like this) I told him I made a mistake. And he laughed and went back to work.

I didn’t speak to my dad for 2 years. Except to scream at him when he answered the phone. “If mom isn’t there you do not pick up the phone when I call. Fuck you, you bastard I never want to hear your disgusting voice again” I never directly said why I was mad. We both knew why.

I am from another province, 24 hour drive if that helps.

My mom never asked why, if she even noticed I wouldn’t speak to him. I’m sure she liked I was mad.

My parents have a really bad relationship. My mom is VERY verbally abusive. If you knew what my brothers dad did to her you would understand. She is cruel to him but seems to enjoy it. But the things my brothers dad did... you can’t imagine. 

I’ll tell you one of the many horrific stories I read in her diary from then. 

Mom was a nurse. She had to stay 2 hours overtime. When she got home he shot her favourite horses legs, one at a time, in front of her before shooting it in the head. When he spoke he told her “ you won’t be late again” 

He did other bad things involving puppies that I won’t put you through. 

Anyway before I found the emails My siblings (4 of us, 2boys 2girls) and I saved money to buy them a 25th anniversary present. An all expense trip to Honolulu. That is where my dad cheated. On the vacation paid for by his 2 college daughters his high school aged son and his step son. We were really broke so my older brother (not his son) paid for most.

 My mom used to make us promise that we would tell her if dad cheated. (My brothers dad really damaged her) My earliest memory of this is when I was 7, while she stared my dad straight in the eye.

I speak to him now but barely. I kind of hate them both. As bad as that sounds. But I kept the stupid secret.

I never would have thought they would be capable of doing that to me, but some things are strongly hinting towards them being my abuser. I don’t know if I can go forward in my life or even in therapy with this being a possibility. It is truly life ruining.

517,"I’ll call my girlfriend D and her best friend H.

So I’ve known D for about two years now, and I was briefly friends with H before I met D.

D and I started dating a few months ago. A few months after that, H broke up with her boyfriend. She said he was kind of abusive and overall wasn’t nice.

D has told me about some stuff H has been saying. After her breakup, she started saying things like “why do you get to have the good relationship and not me?”. There also was an incident where I was considering breaking up my girlfriend, and someone told her and then it turned into a whole overdramatic thing. And after that H started telling D that she should break up with me because I was just going to break up with her.

Despite all of that, H still acts super nice to me. Whenever we see each other, she gives me a hug, which weirds me out a bit, but I guess different people do things differently. One time she even told me that she’d missed me. All the time she’ll give me random stuff and she just acts super friendly (she’s just a nice person in general) and is never really mean to me.

I can’t figure out if H is jealous or if she just dislikes me.

Should I confront H or should I just let things be?

I was shocked and searched the internet for a while. most people said that although HP series is a lot of fun, there are many continuity errors in the book, probably more than other famous fiction series. I was disappointed.

531,"Don’t be afraid to be brutally honest with me and tell me where I’m wrong, I just want a solution that doesn’t involve sacrificing my self-worth. 

My friend and I had two big fights recently, but let’s go into backstory first. 


(Most of this is probably irrelevant, but I want to paint a bigger picture). 
Her and I have been friends for almost a year, gradually growing closer. During the quarantine, we would contanstly call each other for hours at a time. For the past week (not counting the last three days) she’s been busy and apparently hasn’t had time to text/call. Naturally I was extremely upset, but I understood and dismissed my feelings. 

First fight: (one of my faults is when I get mad i initially go into basically a rage. I won’t insult the person (unless they do it first) but in general I’ll just be a dick)

Thursday she finally had time to call and text and whatnot. I asked if we could call and she said “yeah maybe after this video” (when she says ‘maybe’ it’s a yes as far as I could remember) so I wait about twenty minutes and ask again, no response. (Keep in mind it was about 2:30am when I initially asked) An hour later I finally get a response which was just a keyboard smash “jdbsish” not an actual answer to my question which I got salty about. Then I didn’t get a text for the rest of the night.

The part that set me off is the fact that she was texting/snapping someone else while “watching” her video. I know this because on Snapchat (which is where we usually text) you have a “best friends list” (basically a ranking of the people you text the most on there) and if you and someone else are each other’s number 1, you both get a yellow heart next to their name. We had that yellow heart prior to this night, and I remember seeing it soon after she left to watch her video, but later that night i realized it was gone. Putting the pieces together, she must’ve been texting/snapping someone else while “watching” her video. 

The next morning (yesterday, Friday) We got into a big initial argument where I went into my “rage.” Fast forwards a few hours of not texting and I calm down and she said she would talk to me once I was “done being an ass.” Which I said I was calm and I was ready to put aside my reasons for being upset for the friendship. She said she would call later tonight. 

Fast forwards to 2:30am, she calls and says she’s going to a “friends” house. I’m was severely disappointed in her for a few reasons (and I told her) 
1. She’s sneaking out of the house at 2:30am to go to a town 20 min away (she’s not the type to sneak out)
2. Her family is on quarantine, and they even have an elderly person at their house (grandma) that’s susceptible to covid. 
3. She’s going to a “friends” house (“friend” is a guy). She has only met with him 2-3 times in real life, all at public places/her house

She said she WOULD call after she leaves so we can talk about the Thursday night. I just say okay and hang up. 

Throughout the night I’m texting her, asking if she’s okay. The later this goes the more mad I’m becoming. Fast forward to 6:30 am, im furious, Im exhausted at this point and I would have slept but I can’t sleep when I’m mad/upset (which I told her). She finally texts back at 7 saying she’s been home for 30 minutes (which means she left about an hour ago because of the drive). 

I got into my “rage” again and went off. At this point I’m just gonna copy and paste every message
B=Beth; M=me. Also I’m changing her name to Beth and my name to Eric. When I say “sidenote” I’ll be adding information that helps you understand the text. 

M: are you done finally?

B: yeah, I got home at 6:30

M: what the fuck happened to calling? I’ve been waiting this entire time

B: ERIC

M: what?

B: what

M: I don’t fucking know. You said “ERIC.” And honestly, reply fast or don’t reply at all, Im fucking done waiting

B: okay

M: I waited four and a half fucking hours. But that doesn’t mean shit to you. I don’t mean shit to you. FOUR AND A HALF FUCKING HOURS. “I’ll call you after this” NO YOU FUCKING DIDNT. And you got home thirty fucking minutes ago. That means you left his hour nearly an hour ago. Fucking really beth? Treating me like a piece of shit 

B: Eric chill

M: fucking why?

B: ?

M: Why the fuck should I chill. What’s your excuse this time?

B: i was with *sister* and I didn’t think you wanted to talk to her. 

Sidenote: me and her sister used to be close friends, but had a huge fight and fell off. 

M: You were in the car with *sister* coming home? You didn’t think “oh hey, Eric might still be waiting for me after waiting and staying up four and a half hours

Sidenote: her sister didn’t go with her. 

B: okay Eric. 

M: Just a fucking okay? This past week, you’ve treated me like complete shit. I was willing to look passed it the past two times, but not this fucking time. 

B: okay Eric. 

M: how am I in the wrong? tell me

B: your not but that doesn’t mean you gotta be an ass about it

M: Beth. My day today was fucking horrible already. And you literally made it phenomenally worse by treating me like shit, like an afterthought

Sidenote: she knew my day was terrible

B: okay sorry

Fast forwards to this afternoon/evening 

M: anything to say regarding last night.

532,"I don’t know why it’s all coming down on me now. I’ve been living with it for half of my life and I should be used to it. When I was like 8-9 my parents got divorced, at 10-11 my mom started dating my step dad. I guess it started coming down on me when my mom asked me about my first kiss. I told her it was my ex boyfriend, but that was a lie. When I was 11 my first kiss was stolen by the man my mom was seeing, my stepdad. I hate calling him that. He stole my first kiss and silently molested me for years. One summer my real dad suggested we sleep over at his house for the break. I was exited because I would finally be away that man. While I was away my mom found my diary where I wrote all the things he did to me, she confronted me about when I returned from break and I said it was true. Me her and her boyfriend talked about how she was going to call and tell his family all about it. Then the next day nothing happened, he stayed living with us and nothing happened to him. I was angry, and began taking the anger out on myself. I started self harming and over time developed an eating disorder. We moved to a different apartment and he stopped touching me for a while. I got my first boyfriend and actually felt loved, I stopped self harming and my eating disorder just ended. I lost my virginity to him after a year, my mom and him found out i lost my virginity and he began touching me again. I was too scared to say anything. It was as if I didn’t have a voice. My ex boyfriend who I lost my virginity to knew, and ended up telling my mom and once again she confronted him and he admitted, yet nothing happened. He stopped touching me, but I could feel his perverted stare always on me. I began to wear baggy clothes and just stopped dressing up altogether as a way to get his attention off me. We moved around some more and now we currently live in a house. He’s still here living with us, I’m 20 now and this pandemic has made it worst. He doesn’t touch me, but being in the house all day every day with his stare on me is just very disturbing. I don’t feel safe in my own home and always feel like I’m being watched. I hate being in the same room as him and can’t stand when he talks to me. My brothers don’t know, so when I talk back to him or give a rude response I’m just seen as a bitch. There’s not much I can do about it but just take it. I want to move out as soon as I get the chance and get out of this hell im in. I love my mom and greatly appreciate everything she’s done for me. But this is something that I will always subconsciously hate her for. There’s really no one I can talk to about this so if anyone actually took the time to read this, thank you, I just needed someone to listen.",02May2020,1

I didn’t attend all the session duh nobody does I’ll happily admit to this and own up but I have very good reasons. i was affected by certain things I won’t go into detail but false accused of something which police proved me innocent ( this made me abit depressed and wanting to isolate as a man it’s hard to express yourself with sensitive subjects like that ) and also in November I was very poorly with covid 19 symptoms looking back now but the ones I did attend I wasn’t on register, turns out I wasn’t on the system for anything, it’s a medical course so all my health checks and injections not in system, all the first aids training I did (which I have certificates for) not in system, even placement allocation NOT IN SYSTEM and the uni is trying to blame me for all of this saying its my responsibility I should of got into contact, well how tf would I know if I’m on there system or not.

Fast forward I’ve reached out to people to try and solve this but they haven’t responded since February it’s insane and ironic as I was accused of not responding to emails I never got lol. For the record my uni loads of student have experienced same issues, and in the news this place was exposed for giving out offers to pull in money and students having sex on site .

536,"**TW: Mentions of suicidal thoughts, self-harm, and depression**

For some background:

When I was little I was spanked and above the age of 11, my mom instead throws something at me, or yells at me, or hit me. Whenever they are angry I'm afraid they will hit me now and every once in awhile they will. since when I was little I felt scared of my dad because he spanked me and i'm now even more afraid. For a brief period of time at age 10 felt like I could trust my mom with anything, but now I'm afraid, scared, and at the hint of aggression from my parents I think back to when I was little when I was getting spanked or hit. My sister is disabled she is in a wheelchair, has a heart condition, Aspergers, depression, paranoia and I think is being tested for something with her stomach soon. She has to take a bunch of pills a day. (I'm also Non-binary, have epilepsy, and im 14 years old)

Yesterday my mom hit me 2x, threw her phone at me, took away my phone a Nintendo switch that I bought with my own money, and yelled because I didn't do one minor assignment for school and I haven't been taking my medication. When I decided to hide in the closet cause I couldn't take the yelling anymore, She then got my dad who broke down my closet door when I was on the other side hiding from her. After this all happened I seriously considered jumping out of a window (My window for my room is pretty high above the ground) or running into the street to get hit by a car. I even wrote a note and made a plan but I haven't gone through with it yet. I have a history of depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. And I haven't seen a therapist in 5 months because my old therapist moved. One month later my grandmother died and I have been having many dark thoughts. I currently don't have a therapist and I'm scared to ask for one now. My parents might say that I'm overreacting. Or that it doesn't matter because my sister is dealing with things worse. My dad refuses to recognize that I'm non-binary and doesn't make an effort to use my pronouns. However, my mom and sister try their best.

I know this isn't as important as other people's posts but does anyone have any advice for me? Am I overreacting? Sorry for the long post.",02May2020,1

She's from US Texas, Both of our families are religious and can't stand the thought of a foreign relationship
While I'm safe since not under their command,Her parents lately found out and she got abused really severely,It has been ongoing for a few days and now today when her mother realized there's no way to stop her
She took away all access to internets from her after abusing her to an extent which she, texting me at 1am silently from her desktop while trembling, described as She gave me hell(She has suffered quite alot of physical abuse so for her to classify it as this,It has to be actually bad) 
I forced her to go to sleep since it she's found doing that, There's a high chance they'll either disown her or leave permanent damage on her

The reason for her parent's severe hatred towards this relationship is because of stereotypes against my country,And i recognize them all, I've never been a patriotic fellow so its not like they gave me a chance to confront them myself and explain

She has 5 months left before she's off to university and isn't under her parents anymore
How do i help her? How do i maintain a bond through these 5 months? How do i not let her feel alone Everytime she's abused? She has no one to talk or cry to and Is already on the verge of breaking due to the intensity of abuse 

I'm from across the world so I need advice over anything that a US citizen has to offer about child protection (Please note she's 18 and unfortunately doesn't know much about being independent)
Or just generally if there's something i can do
I was really heartbroken and tore apart knowing she's being tortured trying to preserve this,Me indirectly being the subject and reason of her pain and my role here is to just watch her as a spectator because i have no control

I admit that I was feeling good, but there’s just a thought in my head that I might just prefer to feel how I would naturally feel after work. Like days where I just want to cry, scream, direct my anger towards something.

I told a group of friends (all of them smoke) I know about my experiences, and they said I’m just thinking wrong and don’t have the right perspective, and that it’s toxic to be angry or sad about things.

541,"Should I reach out to my professors for help about potentially failing the classes? I'm mostly want to do this because I need help, but I've been resisting because it's my fault. I have severe procrastination (possibly anxiety/depression related?) that causes self-destructive behavior. Through most of college, I've just been making myself miserably stressed by not doing the work. I'm supposed to graduate this semester but the lockdown kind of screwed me up and made me shut off. I haven't been able to do any work and I'm like 3 weeks behind in all my classes. 

I have a huge deadline coming up for a dual paper-presentation that I'm supposed to have been working on all semester due in a week. It just feels stupid to ask for help, you know? I'm basically asking them to help me somehow (and I don't even know if they can) because I didn't do what I was supposed to. It's just embarrassing and presumptuous. ""Professor, can you help me, I haven't done any work just because I can't?????"" 

But I really think nothing is going to change, I feel like I need something, anything to trigger a panic that will force me into action. That's usually all that helps. I just don't know what to do, I feel so out of control. I don't even want to fail, it's going to ruin everything (graduation, have to retake classes, screw  over my mom paying for my tuition, it's going to be just as hard for me the second time and still remote).

Nothing she’s said has ever been a lie or maliciously untrue. Just mean. I got a text from a fake number (I’m assuming it was textnow or sideline) and I’m almost certain it was her. The text said there was a porno of me “getting trained by 2 dudes” and called me “sleeping beauty with purple hair” and when I was raped I was unconscious for about 2 hours through the whole thing and did have long purple hair when it happened. I texted back asking for proof and never got a response. I wouldn’t have fed into this being possible but went to a tattoo party with my friend tonight, and there were some pretty odd people there. And some guy who I have never seen before asked me if I ever had long purple hair. I felt really sick because I only had long purple hair for a week, as I had dyed it the night before I went to California to see my ex friend, and I literally cut all my hair off into a pixie and went bright red the moment I got home. And I said yes and he kinda laughed and said he was pretty sure he’d seen a kink porn video of me before. I did ask him to smoke a cig with me and talk privately for a sec because I needed to know. That kind of solid evidence could help me more than it’s currently eating me alive. I asked him why he thought it was me and he said he knew the tattoo on my collar bone, which is a very unique font as I did it myself, and it’s a large quote. I asked him where and when he saw it and he said some fetish Snapchat before it got reported. He also said he’d look into it more when he got home and try to find it for me if there was an actual site it was on, and added me on Facebook so he could let me know.

3 weeks ago, our bathtub cracked on the bottom, about 12 inches long. We were told not to use the shower until it could be fixed, which ended up being 5 days later. Normally I wouldn’t mind much &amp; would find an alternative, however, with this pandemic going on we can’t just shower at other people’s homes. AND, My s/o works 50 hours a week with seafood &amp; smells gnarly after work. I am working 4 days a week myself. 

We bit the bullet and went 5 days without showering. They replaced a portion of the bathtub floor and told us to wait 24 hours. 

Well, two days ago my bathtub floor cracked again. It feels like there is not enough support underneath, when you put your foot down you can feel a sort of hole underneath. They said they don’t know when it can be fixed, and I stressed our necessity to shower at least every other day. They gave us a key to an empty unit to shower in for the mean time. 

I don’t want to walk to a different building to take a fucking shower after work. We both work too much to be dealing with this, and if I’m not offered a permanent solution (or the bathtub cracks after being fixed AGAIN) I want to revisit my lease. 

Do I have any grounds to revisit my lease with these problems? I just want a fucking shower. 


TLDR; bathtub floor has cracked twice in 1.5 month tenancy. we have no estimate on repairs &amp; are showering in an empty unit across the complex. we work 50 &amp; 30 hours a week and need the shower daily. do i have any grounds to revisit or terminate my lease if they can’t adequately fix our shower? or at least in a timely matter?",02May2020,1

Since then I’ve been spending a lot of time at Cora’s place.  We’re both just some 19 year olds out here, so I’ve gotten to know her mom pretty well from all my overnight visits.  She loves me... her mom constantly talks about how amazing of an influence I am on Cora, and she calls me her future son-in-law.  She’s a good woman.  She works hard and provides for her daughter.

That kinda leads me into why I’ve come to hate Cora.. she is the laziest person I’ve ever met.  She’s worn nothing but pajama bottoms for two months, she’s a complete stoner (smokes multiple times a day), she leaves a huge mess in every room she walks into to, and she forces her mom to clean it all up.  On top of all this: she’s as dumb as a bag of hammers.  Oh my LORD we are watching Avatar the Last Airbender and this girl cannot understand the plot for the life of her (just a funny example.. I’m just kind of counting on you guys to know a “dumb, lazy, stoner” type to compare Cora to).

Now the problem I’m dealing with 3 months into this mess is that the sex we have is spectacular.  We really do have a connection, but that connection is limited to the bedroom.  I really don’t want to sound like a douche, but I’ve been with a lot of girls and none of them compare to Cora in bed.

Oh, and she thinks that I’m her boyfriend and I definitely let her believe that because her mom wants me to help her get a job AND the sex.. duh.

One instance was when i didn't finish a canned food, because my stomach was hurting and my grandmother threw a plate at a ground in front of me, shattering it, i experienced a lot of anxiety. I often cried when i get scolded and hurtful things we're thrown at me a lot. I have insomnia (not diagnosed) and when my grandmother saw me not sleeping in the middle of the night, said that she wished that i had covid 19 and would get out of her house, not wanting to see me again.

I’ve tried everything I know to do to make myself good enough for a relationship, I’ve lost over 80 pounds, bought all new clothes, I have a car, I go to college, I maintain a job, people and my therapist tell me that I am a “kind soul” and a “great person”, yet I still am not good enough for anyone to be considered good enough.

I just don’t know what’s wrong with me, i feel like it has to be because I’m disgustingly ugly. My therapist and my friends tell me that I am not ugly but it’s the only thing I can think of. I don’t know why else nobody has ever loved me, I don’t know why else I can’t get anyone to want me. I am good socially, I always try to keep people laughing and I have lots of friends who want to be around me, yet no woman wants anything to do with me beyond that. There’s pictures of me on my profile and I can link some more recent ones in the comments if you want me to as I’ve lost a little more weight since I’ve posted those pics of myself. 

All I want in the world is for a girl to love me, I just don’t understand what is wrong with me. It makes me hate myself so much, nobody in my life has ever found me worthy so what grounds do I have to claim I have any sort of worth as a person? I can scream it in to the wind as much as I can but at the end of the day what does it matter if nobody believes it?

I got a pretty good handle on my self consciousness regarding my lack of chest, but it still hits me sometimes. I avoid what I can on social media but even just walking around can feel terrible. Several ladies that look their age and hella good. My boyfriend has a gorgeous friend, and although I like her and I'm not exactly threatened by her, it can be difficult to hang out with his friends cause I'm so caught up in my dumb brain.


I struggle with comparisons regarding deeper things as well (like success and happiness and whatever), but lately I just can't stand looking in mirrors. It's ruining sex for me since I can't get out of my head. My face has always been chubby but now my metabolism is catching up to me and my stomach and thighs are not what they used to be. I work out pretty regularly and I'm not ""fat"" by any means but I am ""shapes.""


I play ukulele and I'm learning guitar and I do a bit of photography so there are hobbies and skill building things that should help but they don't with this. I hate it.

I try to not make a huge deal out of it cause I feel like most men do this, but this has to be my biggest fucking pet peeve considering I do not look like any of those models and women with onlyfans accounts in their Instagram bios. They’re all thicker women with big butts and boobs and I’m small and skinny. My body is definitely my biggest insecurity and I don’t feel hot enough for him even though he always told me I was. It just makes me feel inadequate and part of my problem is that I just can’t stop looking at the pictures he’s liked. At least I’ve seen that he hasn’t put any gross comments (yet). 

I guess since we’re not really together anymore, it shouldn’t matter or bother me. The thing is, the breakup was due to circumstances other than us fighting or something like that. We both are just figuring ourselves out, but still have feelings for each other and that’s why it still bothers me.

For example, this is his first time traveling for work while we've been together and we're both hurting, so that'll be the inspiration for the first page.

I also cut up the cardstock into quarters to make little cards about special moments, like our morning hikes and sweet memories I want to always have, dated and illustrated as well.

So, men of reddit, is this something you'd appreciate? Any feedback (welcome from anyone!)?? I dont have a lot of male connections that arent exes (which I obviously dont talk to anymore) or guys that are trying to get with me now - so their opinions arent what I want. I think the best part about this is he gets a view into my head and how much I value our relationship, and with every trip he has for work or adventure we have together, there will always be new additions to it.

He has no issue making new friends, and well the only problem is he still trusts this close friend of his and I'm a little worried for him as he trusts people easily and that caused him to leave people and recuperate for his mental health a year ago when he was set up by a group of people accusing him for many things when they themselves did the same. How can I advice him not to trust people, without trying to sound so overbearing? He's a nice guy, talented but just always trusts the wrong people which led to painful experience.",02May2020,1
562,I kind of recently discovered these free Harvard online courses. I was thinking of starting one of the   introductory courses for computer science. I was thinking of starting it because I want to try and learn the basics for when I start computer science GCSEs next year but I realised I don't really know you really do online course is and if this a good idea. I read somewhere that you have to take an exam at the end or something and that there is homework.

563,"so recently i’ve been deep diving into the past and i can’t help but miss all my friends i had last year that i don’t really talk to anymore. we had a major falling out last summer due to my best friend (we’ll call her emma) not liking the fact i had start dating our friend (who’s now my ex, we’ll call him tyler) and my ex brainwashed me into thinking she was a bad person so i cut her off and lost my whole friend group.

i broke up with my ex back in december because he was manipulative and lied to me several times. anyways, it’s been almost a year since me and emma have talked, recently it was her birthday so i decided to be nice and wish her happy bday over instagram. it ended up being us apologizing for all the shit that went down last summer and taking a trip down memory lane. i really missed her.

i want to be friends again and i want to hang out with her when school starts up again but there’s a few obstacles in the way. my lifelong friend (we’ll call her katie) has not had a change of heart towards emma and still hates her. i haven’t told her that we’ve made up yet because i’m afraid she’ll judge me. another big issue is that emma and tyler have also rekindled their friendship and are close. i’m not ready to become friends with tyler again because i’m in a new relationship and tyler is not over me. me and emma still have quite a few mutuals, but we’re in separate friend groups and there’s no way i could join her friend group due to tyler and she can’t join mine due to katie.

i’m aware our friendship might never be the same, but it really makes me happy talking about old memories with her. can we make the friendship work?

564,"Alright reddit, but of a long one here, I (23F) have two children (2F)(1M) and they currently live with my mother/“Jane” (53F) and father/“Joe” (52M). 

For context, I was living in the house with them from August 2019 until December 2019. Me, the kids, and their father/“Peter” (39M) moved in because our lease was up at our rental and we were struggling to save for a house deposit. My parents offered for us all to move in so we could save. Big mistake. 

Instantly there were issues between Jane and Peter. Jane has never liked him and continuously berated him for mostly no reason, occasionally her reasons were valid, generic household crap like not picking up after himself and whatnot. Peter while living there made many improvements to the home by fixing lighting issues, damage to walls, cleaning up outside, etc. But Jane eventually kicked him out for some bull***t reason so it was just me and the kids from end of September onwards. 

I have a sister “Sis” (25F) who struggles with mental health, we both have all our lives because Jane was a very neglectful parent and left us open to abuse from other people. So Jane talked to me shortly afterwards about not being able to contact my sister and that their relationship was deteriorating. This was her way of asking me to help by talking to Sis and seeing what the problem was. Which I agreed to as I was concerned about Sis. 

That goes on until about late December. Tension between me and Jane is high as she is constantly berating me and critiquing my parenting and basically trying to claim that she was the best mother in the world and that I needed to do better. Which was fair enough as I was dropping the ball due to mine and Peters relationship breakdown as well as prior mental health problems, but my children were always looked after and knew they were loved. For further clarification I had started going out for a few hours some nights to either see friends or cry in my car. 

For further reference Jane has never liked me, and I suspected for almost 17 years didn’t love me. This was all confirmed on Sis’s birthday on New Year’s Eve.  I was expecting a phone call from one of my friends that was going through a miscarriage at the hospital so I explained to Jane and everyone else at Sis’s birthday lunch that I may have to step out for a couple of minutes. Everyone was fine with that, until the phone call came through. Jane made a snide remark about me being rude or disrespectful, I can’t exactly recall, so I told her to stop being such a hypocrite and not to cause drama on Sis’s birthday. I went outside and took my phone call, during which Sis came out to talk to me. We chatted about Christmas and her birthday, she told me she wanted to give back the $500 Jane and Joe gave them for Christmas. I was confused because we had all agreed on only buying for my children with Christmas. So obviously I hadn’t gotten anything but both my siblings had. Which didn’t bother me, other than the fact she lied to my face, so I told Sis to keep the money because that’s what our parents wanted to do. During this conversation we also worked out that Jane had guilt tripped me into going to lunch because that was the only way Sis would come. 

We came back in and Jane was being overly passive aggressive and making everyone uncomfortable, so I decided to leave with my kids so that Sis and our parents could enjoy lunch. 

When I got home Jane exploded after I told her about the Christmas money thing and her using me to get Sis to come out. I flipped out at her and all of my feelings about how she’d acted towards me for my entire life came out. I ended with saying that she’s my mother and she’s supposed to love and care about me to which she replied “So what?”

I admit, I completely lost it after that, I broke a pile of her CD’s and screamed at her asking how she could not love me and treat me the way she does. She screamed at me to never come back to the house again and that she never wanted to see me again. 

I left the house and didn’t come back for a week. I left my children with my parents as I had nowhere to go and couldn’t have them living in the car with me. During this week I texted her multiple times between going to different crisis accomodation organisations, which can’t help me, asking how my kids were and for photos of them. All of which were ignored. I called her once during the week which ended with her calling me every name under the sun. 

When I got home Joe called me a horrible mother for not even bothering to check on my children and for ruining Sis’s and Jane’s relationship. I was completely confused and asked what he was talking about, he said that Jane had said that I haven’t bothered to contact her about the kids, that I was the entire reason my sister hates her, and that I left because I was “jealous” that I wasn’t given money for Christmas. I corrected him on all of this and showed him all of my unanswered text messages that I sent to Jane. He apologised, but doesn’t seem to care about her behaviour. 

Fast forward to now and I’m living in a share house trying to get a house, which is impossible because no one wants to do opens due to Covid19, so I’m stuck for now. 

I came over to see my children while Jane goes to work. I decided to go clean my daughters bedroom because there was a smell in there (assuming she had hidden a bottle an it had gone mouldy) but I was wrong. The slate floors were covered, I mean completely covered in spilled milk. I also found mould growing along the windowsill and window, cobwebs, dead bugs, etc. 

I’ve just spent 3 hours deep cleaning the room and I’m honestly scared for my children’s health. I just need some advice on what to do. 

TLDR; My mother kicked me out while me and my children were living with her. Kids stayed with her but the house is filthy and my mother is narcissistic and mentally unstable. I’m scared for my children’s well-being.",02May2020,1
565,"My whole life I have had issues with socializing with others, including non immediate family members. I grew up in a abusive household and my father regularly emotionally abused me as well as kept me isolated from people my age when I was very young. By the time I was older I was allowed to do whatever I wanted but I ended up developing a lot of social anxiety and have trouble figuring out how to react in certain situations, while for others everything seems to come naturally. Fast forward from my freshman year of high school to 22 year old me now. I am proud to say I’ve made great strides these past couple years. I am on my own now and my social anxiety is nearly gone. But I’m still having trouble with social context and finding the courage to build my social life, i grew up in a small town and was bullied a lot for being awkward. I feel like a high schooler who is putting together my first Instagram profile. I feel like a blank sheet and don’t know where to start. I was wondering if anyone out there could relate to this, and if they could share some strategies of basically building a social life during adulthood.",02May2020,1
566,"I did post this is another sub, it’s basically word for word w/ more clarification 

I feel like none of my friends care about me. I’ve known them since high school and throughout college. We were the outcasts. I was more social then them but I stayed with them because I felt like they knew me and understood me the best. Everything was fine between us until recently. I really want to be an orthopedic trauma surgeon by the time I’m 28 so I finished my BA in two years. Even tho I’m busy I’m always supportive of them. I encourage them even when I don’t think they’re doing what’s best for themselves. I help them schedule doctor appointments and even help them network in their individual fields if I can (if I can’t I try to find other sources) I help them research their reports and thesis and help them with their studies anyway I can. I look out for them a ton. I listen to their problems and try to help no matter what. And I know I do because they’ll acknowledge it when I’m upset with them. Lately I’ve been struggling. The love of my life left me, I had a miscarriage, I left the church, some of my family disowned me (came out as BI) and my cousin killed himself. Everything that could go wrong did. I really needed emotional support and my friends but they weren’t answering (the day my ex left) so I went and got hammered to suppress my feelings bit. I called my best friend and he answered laughing. We chatted for a few moments when I heard the rest of the friend group talking about me. Saying what a drag I’ve become (miscarriage happened about two weeks prior) I immediately hung up. I played it off as if I didn’t hear it. 7 months past by and things are just different. I can’t tell them anything or I get told I’m too emotional (I’m not) or attention seeking (I’m not). I still want to be apart of their lives but it’s difficult for me because of school and my internship so I send articles to the group chat for them to enjoy and give support. About a month ago I started sleeping around and I’ve been getting more support by these people I’ve known for less then a day then my friends I’ve known for YEARS. I recently found out that two of these friends were engaged. It’s making me realize that I’m not important to anyone that’s important to me. And it’s really hard on me. It’s making me want to drop out of their lives suddenly. I cut my hair short from stress and they didn’t notice. I really want to change my name, delete socials, and even consider plastic surgery (probably won’t go that far) I recently got accepted in a med school across my country but I also got accepted to one near my friends. I really want to go to the one far away because I’m learning to hate my friends but I don’t want to let them go. They remind me of a happier version of myself but also make me sad. I know I’m supposed to outgrow friends and all that but it’s just complicated. I have told them how I felt but that has ended in silence on their end. I also have tried to make more time for them but it just doesn’t work out. The worse part is I don’t know what I did. They say I didn’t do anything but clearly I did. I don’t know what to do. Do I stay in this funk or do I basically leave everything behind? (It’s hard for me to makes friends, I’m cold and distant for awhile but especially with everything going on I’m more cut off) 

Basically I feel under appreciated and I want to pack everything up and leave. Delete social media, change my name and just start over.",02May2020,1

What I do know is that my mother has both depression and anxiety. In recent years I’ve lost interest in most things I used to love. I have no motivation to usually do much ( I used to love reading but have no motivation to read anymore. ). I’m easily irritable, with the slightest thing being able to completely ruin my mood. I get sad for no particular reason, very often too. I could be sitting at my computer enjoying myself and suddenly I’d just be incredibly sad for no apparent reason. I get anxious around others, I overthink constantly, my mouth trembles when serious topics or when I have to be verbally emotional.

572,"Hey reddit, as of right now I am 17, going into my senior year next year. I met this girl back in 7th grade, and literally always had a feeling about her. Confessed a little crush in 8th cause we were basically kids, she declined but that’s just how it goes. She moved schools after that, but was still very close. I didn’t lose feelings for her, but sorta just put them aside. I started looking for her in other girls(I know, awful). Got a girlfriend, didn’t go very far. We were together for about 6 months at the end of freshman year. Summer came around and me and the girl were hanging out with our group of friends a lot more, and near the end of summer she got hammered, first time drinking. I sorta made sure she got through the night okay, she appreciated that a fuck ton. That’s when we started talking again after nearly a year apart, and it was great, as if we never stopped. Then, she got a boyfriend a week later, shit broke me. I did my best to move on, and for a bit I thought I did. Then, her and her boyfriend broke up around 4 months ago, and one of my friends(also her best friend) told me that and said we should go to prom together. I wanted that night more than anything(fuck you corona). Obviously, it didn’t work out like that. But we started talking again regardless, once again like nothing happened. We’ve been talking ever since, she rarely is on her phone to the point she doesn’t even respond to the best friend i mentioned earlier for hours, same with me. She said she just needed time sometimes to be by herself, trying to sorta find herself again after being together with a guy for over a year. But, when we would have convos they went very well, she’d say she always liked talking to me, and I could easily make her laugh all the time. But she is clearly in need of more time to come down from the relationship she just got out of, and I’m sure she wants to be single for a bit. So, reddit, I ask you, how do I make sure this whole time wasn’t for nothing, and how should I go about becoming an interest in that fashion(sorry for asking for an entire fucking plan, my head is just all over the place cause this might actually work out in my favor).

574,"I’m 13 and in the military so I’m always moving. So far my whole life I’ve been rejected, and it sucks. I recently moved to a new area and started going to a new school. I had a crush on this one girl (let’s call her J) and tried to tell her I liked her and I blew it. After telling her, I did one of those cringey things and said “it was just a prank!” but I actually liked her. She was mad at me and said I broke her trust, and then said “it’s ok tho, i never had feelings for you anyways.”. This broke my heart cause I figured that I would’ve never got her anyways. So I cried for a good 2-3 hours and in that time period, i vented to one of my friends from 5th grade, from where I used to live. My friend then put me in a GC with all her friends and we actually got along pretty well. I got over “J” and wasn’t crushing on anyone. All of a sudden, my friend adds one of her other friends “A” and I fell in love. She was my type, had the same interests, has a funny sense of humor, and is just in general really pretty. Over the span of a few months of talking in the GC, I started to dm her privately. I knew the group a little bit before but the GC made us all closer. “A” and I went on a FaceTime call for about 8 hours and I acted really awkward, but we spent most of it on game pigeon. After a few weeks after that, I told her how I felt about her. Keep in mind that she lives about 6 states away and is about 10 months younger than me. She said “Why me??” which should be an automatic sign of “I don’t really like you like that”. I didn’t take the hint. We still talk in the GC and I just really wanna know what she thinks about me, but at the same time I don’t. I told “J” on how I got over her and that I thought “A” was a cute girl. All of a sudden, “J” says she likes me. This is putting me in a weird state cause I don’t like “J” anymore, and I’m crushing on “A”. “J” keeps flirting with me, and “A” is always on my mind. I cried over “A” at least 5+ times and literally can’t go through a day without thinking of her. My friend said “Don’t cry over a girl that isn’t yours” and I’m trying to live by it but I can’t.

Even if it's a bad friendship I don't know if I could let it go, but I also want to know what others think, and if I'm just being a unreasonable. Also I think it may be important to say we are in our late teens. Sorry if this pain to read, i'm not great with writing. 

Anyway, this person has done some things that I don't approve of. At one point they wanted to runaway from home. Not because he has a bad home life, but because he was ""bored"". They didn't want to tell anyone because their family would stop them. Thankfully they didn't, but it got me thinking about how this person views others. Maybe it's because we're young.

They have also told me that they had buried some baby birds alive. I didn't know how to react. I never thought they would do something like that, unfortunately I think that they did. That alone makes me question if I want to continue this relationship.

they are also a bit of a nicegirl/niceguy. They have said and done thing very close to things you would find on r/niceguys or r/nicegirls. In the past they have made me very uncomfortable, though I can't think of anything in particular rn, so you don't have to believe that bit.

584,"I joined a small company 2 years ago where I work load is a lot and the management is workaholic and expects others to keep up with you. 

I have been keeping up with them for 2 years and as miserable as it made me to work for 10 to 12 hours, to work in the weekend, I kept up.  

I handled the workload as well as I can without complaining too much. 

Since it’s a small company, some basic etiquettes are not followed so you end up screamed at a lot. I kept up with that abuse. They generally hire freshers and experience people don’t seem to last probably because of lack of basic etiquettes and the work hours. 

For this of you wondering why I kept up with the shit because I needed the money. I had left a previous job because of issues with the management. I didn’t want to repeat that here. 

We are not given national holidays. People just take 7 to 10 days (which includes weekends) once or twice a year to visit their hometowns.

Earlier this year, the management came up with a holiday list but they are not implementing it unless we remind them to. For instance, on 1st May we had holiday but none of us remembered until a friend messaged me and I saw the calendar. We found out that some people (a senior manager) took the holiday while others were working because they had a deadline. So even if we are getting the holiday, the workload was not adjusted accordingly hence you end up working. 

The management is not going to help make our lives better. All they can do is hire more people which can share the workload but people don’t last in our company or we fire them because they don’t meet our expectations. 

I skills that you acquire in this company are phenomenal. And of course you grow a lot and at a great speed. But now I want my life back. I want work-life balance. I can’t remember when I wasn’t working in the weekend. I want time to focus on my mental and physical health. 

I have two option - leave or set boundaries. 

When it comes to setting boundaries, once you have allowed yourself to be made use of for son long setting boundaries can be difficult. Management can become antagonistic. Which will lead to more stress. It can affect my salary. 

Second option is to leave and find better job - I am one of the only people handling one area of the company. I’ll need to find a good replacement. I’ll need to train him or her but people don’t last so I’m sure what to do about this. Should I just leave without a replacement? That’ll sour things between us. Do I tell them to step up and find someone and work to retain them so that I can train them and leave in a few months? That’s never gonna sit with them well. 

I am at a lost about how to move forward. Any suggestion?",02May2020,1
585,"Im a guy and she texts me that Im her BFF and her Friend with benefits. This is why we broke up - I played alot of pc games with friends, I wasnt very jelous, I treated her more like a friend. I hate myself for doing that. I didnt play the game for 2 weeks and I am planning not to play it ever again.  4 days after we broke up she fell in love with a boy that didnt feel the same way. She texted me that she was heartbroken from me and from him. She said that that I will always have a chance, yet she says that I have a very small chance. Furthermore she wants to have sex with me. We watched a film and after had sex. She was pretty ok with all. I didnt ask her anything after. We just talked for abit like it wasnt a big deal. I have a few questions? How often should I text/ call her? (I heard that if I text her alot my chances get lower.

 Is she giving me hope by wanting to have sex with me?

 How much time should I give her before I ask her out (IK anytime when it will be appropriate, but when do you think is the point of no hope, weeks, months? - how much?)

If you have any questions, I will reply.

I wanted to go to oberlin, but I’ve realized if I did that I’d probably never get out of debt, and I’m considering Furman. I’ve been thinking about a job in teaching highschool English and theatre, because I love literature and I absolutely love theatre, but I hate being onstage, and the idea of having to act in a college theatre class makes me feel sick.

588,"Going through some heavy, existential thought at 2am.

I apologize in advance for this long ramble. Please don’t feel obligated to listen to what I’m about to write. I don’t even know where to start. I’m not even sure if this is even the right place to post this, but I don’t even know what to think anymore. I was laying in bed not able to sleep for the 4th night in a row when I started to question everything about my life and my existence. This will need some explaining.

I’ve always considered myself atheist. I don’t believe any sort of higher power, any concept of post-death reward or punishment, dualism, fate, etc. I believe in what I do because it is my truth. I respect others for having their own truth, and if that’s finding some comfort in a god, then good on them. I’ve always thought myself to be both logical and skeptic about the world around me and what others tell me and to find my own truth. Lately, I’ve been struggling. For a long time, I’ve struggled with my purpose in life, or anyone’s purpose in life.

I do believe in science. Yes, I payed attention in school. My personal believe is that we are all a collection of atoms and a process of breaking down energy in such a unique way in order for us to experience “consciousness”. To live, laugh, love, hate, and cry. I also personally believe that when we die, our functions simply stop working like a computer, or a Gold Ruberg machine reaching the limits of its kinetic and potential energy. Who is to say that we, living and breathing people, are any different than a lightbulb, a computer, or chain of dominos? At the end of it all, everything in the universe can essentially be broken down to a collection of atoms and a process of breaking down energy from a higher form to a lower one.

All these ethical arguments about humans being “more conscious” than animals are bullshit. Yes, humans are obviously more intelligent and can speak languages and understand complex theories, mechanics, and concepts than any other species on Earth, but it doesn’t fucking matter. Each and every individual organism is living and experiencing a subjective point of view in which we, as individuals, can never and will never understand. Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed. Entropy will be the end of everything. Everything eventually breaks down and the universe will evenly disperse all energy across all space until everything goes dark. This is my own personal truth, my subjective belief, and I have made peace with this idea of impermanence. This doesn’t mean I’m at all nihilistic or suicidal, but that isn’t the issue here.

What has me awake and wondering at 2am is this: If we are only a collection of atoms and energy, how in the absolute hell am I experiencing this life? How am I experiencing consciousness through my own eyes, feeling emotions, being subject to human nature? If I am only atoms and energy subject to physics and the laws of nature, time, and space, then how am I experiencing free will? How am I choosing to to do anything? Solipsism holds that knowledge outside one's own mind is unsure. It can or cannot exist. As of this moment, I am experiencing consciousness through my own eyes and other senses, and as far as I am concerned, only I know for sure that I am doing this. If this is the case, why me? What is my purpose in life? Why am I here to experience everything?

I’m sorry, this is so hard to explain without sounding extremely entitled like, “I’m the only special one and everyone doesn’t exist,” but this isn’t what I’m trying to express in the slightest. I’m here for help. I need help. I feel like I’m losing my mind and going insane. I’m unsure of everything in my life, if I can even believe this is “life.” I have a great life, and I’m not shy to say that. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, and people who I love and who love me. These existential thoughts have been consuming me.

I’m just happy to get these thoughts out of my system. If you listened, thank you. If anyone could help me understand our place in this world, than it would mean everything to me.

TL;DR: Sad boi questions purpose of life at 2am and seeks help.",02May2020,1
589,"So i’m 23f, I have had a problem with alcohol for a few years, to the point of physically being dependent and having to be medically detoxed. I came out as gay a few years ago and was in a really great relationship.. but it all broke down last year. The breakup really messed me up. I was drinking every other day again, day drinking, hiding bottles at work, my eating disorder came back and I was barely keeping any meals down, I was self harming again, it got bad.

Anyway, I went out one night with friends. I was supposed to be staying at one friends house but she left without me, and in my rebellious state I decided to text a guy that I knew wanted to sleep with me. He had been trying to hook up with me for so long and I always declined it, but this night I kinda thought “whatever, I have no where to go and nothing to loose, live a little” and went home with him. I was soooo drunk, he was completely sober as I had called and woke him up. We ended up sleeping together and I hated it, I wanted to stop it.. but it was like when you touch a hot stove? You know you’re not supposed to, it hurts and you know it will scar later and you’ll regret it but you do it anyway because it’s what you deserve? That’s the way it felt. I felt sick doing it, the room was spinning but I just kept going. He didn’t force me. I was forcing myself. I know that if I told him to stop he probably would have.
After it happened, I woke up still super drunk and he walked me to the bus station (I was still too drunk to drive). I remember throwing up in the trash can when we arrived there and just wanting him to leave me alone.

Ever since this night it has haunted me. Like completely traumatised me almost. As hard as I try to just see it as a one night stand.. I can’t. I wake up with nightmares, I find myself daydreaming, land on the memory and give myself a panic attack. It’s caused so much distress. Why do I feel this way? How can I heal from this? I can’t tell anyone about this because I don’t feel like my feelings about this are valid. 
It wasn’t rape, it wasn’t abuse, but it is completely messing with me emotionally to the point of feeling like I can’t continue life like this. I just want this feeling gone.",02May2020,1
590,"i grew up in a house that was so manipulative and mentally abusive for years until i finally had enough and left to live with my boyfriend. my siblings had done the same thing, none of us could deal with my mom's bullshit. 

now im living with him and have no connection to my family and things are so much better. except his grandmother is exactly like my mother.

she's been trying to convince everyone im only using them and im ""out to get them"" and so many other lies. my only intent is to live in a peaceful house where i am loved, i already feel bad taking up space and money without her saying im a bad person. 

she outright told me i was rude and she didn't want me around. she's been planning a vacation over christmas with the family. except for me. she wants to take everyone on a disney cruise and simply abandon me over christmas. of course i would stay with his other grandparents who are absolutely wonderful people. 

i can't say anything and everyone else refuses to out of fear of how the stress will affect his great grandmother. im really sick of people like her pushing everyone around and thinking they can get away with it, thinking they're so high and mighty just because they tear others down. what should i do in this situation? i refuse to live with this kind of torment any longer, it's the whole reason i left home at 16.

591,"There was this girl that I met when I was 16. She’s a year older than me. She fell in love with me, but I was a complete dick to her. Played with her feelings, made her cry. I did it unintentionally, though. I was young and stupid. I had no interest in her but I couldn’t straight up tell her so I just pretended that I cared. Few weeks later she realized I didn’t care for her and it made eveything even worse. But because of that we finally broke up and I was happy we did. We met a couple more times throughout the next 2 years and they all ended the same way.. we would spend the evening/night together and then I would just disappear from her life. 

I’m almost 24 now and sometimes I still can’t sleep because of this. I feel like I want to apologize to her for what I did. I wanted to do this in person last year when we agreed to meet again, but we never met. I still have her on facebook/instagram though and now I think about just doing it virtually since we live in different countries. I don’t want this woman.

593,"We’ve been together since we were 14 and 15, and I moved in with him when I turned 18 during my senior year in high school due to my family. We’ve been through hell and back with the kind of stuff I’ve had to go through, but it’s honestly been a joy ride with him. He comes from a military family and I’ve known he was joining since we met. 

His dad told us (unprompted) that we have his blessing to get married really whenever. My boyfriend is a dual citizen though and his mom (who lives in his home country) gave us her blessing (also unprompted) to get married in a year or two after he enlists. However, we don’t really want to wait. We understand that we’re young and usually people our age are divorced by 23 with a kid in this scenario and are really taking it into consideration. 

But for us, it just makes more sense to get my paperwork sorted as his dependent before he goes so I have my available resources ready (like financial planning and other stuff) instead of trying to coordinate it separately later when he’s busy with military stuff. We 100 percent don’t want any kids and we both prefer just getting married without the ceremony. We both don’t like the diamond industry so don’t plan on a ring yet. Basically I’m saying, we’re not missing out on anything or changing any plans to rush it. It’s just what we want. We are so excited to take on the challenge that is military life together.

I was so enraged because she knew that I didn’t want my mom to know; I wanted to tell my mom on my own eventually. I know she ratted me because she wants to smoke weed too and she thought that if she told her mom that I did it then she’d be able to do it. Also I only did it like 3 times and it was with my oldest brother who is legal and my parents know smoke weed, so I was safe not with a bunch of people my age. I blocked her so she couldn’t reach out to me because I was THAT mad. I ended up lying to my mom for two days until I confessed (everything ended up being okay.) My mom and I are so close and I was heartbroken about the fact that I kept lying to her face. I couldn’t believe my friend would rat me when she knows how close my mom and I are. I’ve unblocked her now but she hasn’t reached out to me and I feel guilty. I feel like I overreacted but I know that if my mom and I’s relationship ended up crumbling because of this I’d still be mad at my best friend.

600,Me and this girl have been best friends since we were in 4th grade and we both transferred to the same college when we were in our junior year. I was really excited to spend more time with her but after the first two months of college (in which we spent a solid about of time together) I started to notice her push away from me. I figured she wanted some space to be her own person at our new school so I let it go on for a while until I noticed that she wouldn’t spend any time with me and when we were together with mutual friends she would avoid eye contact with me and not speak to me directly. I texted her asking to meet up and talk about our problems but she didn’t want to give me face to face time so we argued over text messages during which I think we both said some pretty nasty things. After that day she hasn’t spoken to me again and after a little bit of me trying to keep communicating she told me to leave her alone. This all happened a little over two years ago and I still think about it at least once a week if not more and its still extremely upsetting and I can’t get over it. I’ve been considering trying to speak to her but I don’t know if I should seeing as when I do see her (because we have several mutual friends) she avoids me at all costs.

603,"Hi, I don’t often write on this so forgive me if it’s sorta messy. Basically I had my first year of college and at the beginning I had quite a good time, and made some friends. However as things went on I felt increasingly excluded from events, like they would plan things and purposely not invite me, but then made sure that I knew that they were hanging out without me. (Through social media, sending pics, etc) 
So I didn’t really care at first because I strongly believe that you don’t always need to hang out with everyone all the time, and everyone has their own life. It just got to the point where is happened all the time, and they even had a group without me and were discussing to each other on whether to add me or not. 
I don’t really mind, but if you’re debating on whether to add me and listing pros and cons about me, that really hurts. I found out about this group because someone literally showed me the chat. 
Anyway, they also always just kind of said insulting comments through out the year. Comments which seemed normal but were insulting in a subtle way, if that makes sense. 

It’s getting super long so I don’t need to get in too much detail, but recently I expressed how I felt about them, and really only one of the people actually messaged me to say sorry, whereas the others were like “I think there are other factors making you feel like shit, and we aren’t the reason for it.” 
I might be overthinking it all, but all I know is that I constantly feel worse about myself when I’m around them and insecure, and especially with this quarantine my mind is spiraling because I am at home alone and I have had some personal issues going on, so my mind has just been at quite a negative mindset. 
Anyway, I’ve decided to take some distance from them, and am not interested in continuing being friends with them the upcoming academic year. 
I don’t feel like I’ve ever really done anything wrong, and I’ve asked them before if I’ve done anything to hurt them, etc,  apologized but never really got an answer from them. 
I don’t know how I’m supposed to fix what’s wrong with me if they don’t tell me why they don’t like me, so I’ve just decided to take distance. 
Anyway since I’ve slowly been taking distance, they’ve noticed, and are not happy about it. They’ve been posting stuff on Instagram like “it’s such a toxic thing to just cut people off, so childish” and “just because I don’t talk to you doesn’t mean that I’m not your friend” 
I’ve just deleted Instagram since then because it’s just making me more upset, and they’ve been sending me messages just kind of guilt tripping me into staying friends with them. 
Is it actually toxic behavior for me to want to leave them and just find other friends? I know friendships take time to work on and form a good relationship, but every time I’ve stayed quiet about my emotions they have gotten mad that I didn’t speak up about it, and now that I have spoken up about it, they just disregard it and say it can’t be them.

Some facts about me that may contribute:
- I’m a daily marijuana smoker but I Do NOT smoke tobacco.
- 26 white F
- struggled with eating as a child and was told to drink ensure. 
- I suffer with depression and anxiety.
- No eating disorders in my family that I can think of. My mom struggled with eating as a young adult as well.
- I only take Zoloft as a prescription med.
- not taking birth control
- abstinent so not pregnant

—— 

This started last April-June ‘19 around. I’ve always been a picky eater but I got really sick with the flu last summer and my eating hasn’t been the same since. 

It hasn’t been about my appearance or weight. It’s purely about the food I eat. I look at it and feel absolutely disgusted by it. I love ethnic foods and still have kept my interest in that. But a MAJORITY of foods I used to eat before I can’t eat because of the way it looks/sounds in my mouth. 

I’m nervous hair will get in my food and I’ll eat my hair and it grosses me out even more. (This has happened to me so I always eat with my hair up). 

I’ve lost some weight, my friends can tell but I don’t have a scale yet so I haven’t checked.

I went to the doctor about a year ago when I noticed it and they said unless I’m vomiting or fainting, to just try to keep eating. 

I’ve never vomited or fainted before related to eating but lately I am dizzy if I just stand up (this could just be because of the pandemic). 

It wasn’t until the last couple months I get waves of extreme nausea rush through me. I hear my stomach rumbling but I can’t get myself to eat anything. I feel awful for about 10 minutes a couple times a day. 

Currently drinking around 1-2 ensures a day to try and keep my calories and protein up but clearly it’s not enough.

He offered me two weeks to pay up, but i don't know where i can get the money from.

What should i do?

How do I not make her the stereotypical black girl in a story? (Is there anything to avoid or include?) 
What is the most comfortable way to wear long very curly hair? (Should she have short hair?)
Is there anything I should be aware of before writing, so I don’t make a fool out of myself?

624,"I've been with my fiance for a number of years now, we have kids and the while shebang. Long story short, pregnancy gave her POTS which is hard to find when you try to look it up but it basically feels like your having heart failure when in reality the worst that's supposed to happen is you can end up passing out(she has not passed out from it yet in the 4 years shes been diagnosed with it). It was to the point she almost always felt like she couldn't breathe from every little activity. The 2nd pregnancy seemed to make her POTS disappear, but now after a year of pure breastfeeding the POTS is coming back due to hormone changes with slowing down breastfeeding. So needless to say it is not easy for her to exercise all the time.



The heart doctor said herself that losing weight should help big time with the POTS. She lost a lot of weight compared to what she was before her 2nd pregnancy but she is still overweight and realistically needs to lose around at LEAST 20lb's to start making a healthy difference.


I decided to get healthy in 2018 and dropped 20lb's so I can really help her and we can do this as a team. But she just seems to have no desire to really give it what it actually takes. She will think 20 jumping Jack's then 20 mountain climbers in the morning followed by junk food the rest of the day is being healthy, no it's not.



Now with this Virus going around I'm worried because now only do I have a small pre school aged child and a 1 year old, but my fiance has POTS amd I don't know how that would interact with the Virus. She gets headaches all the time. And now her body is aching and she has a 100.5 degree temperature. I just want us to actually be a healthy family and she has no interest in really doing this with me. I dont know what to do. I legitimately care about her.

and tbh, in my case, its not even anything fucked up, but the things i think about while jerking off, trying to reach the orgasm are so disgusting for me, like, those thoughts literally go against my on principles.

long story short, i can only nut thinking about degrading shit done to me. (dominated) again, i have developed this shit, it was a gradual process. i wasn't like that in the past. and honestly, its just a fantasy, if i had an actual pussy in front of me, thing would be different. but, the fucking guilt after the whole process is the most fucked up thing.

it makes me feel so insecure, it makes me feel insecure about my masculinity. i get angry, overly rude and tough. i know what the simple fix to this issue is. to call it a day, to stop doing it for couple of days.

Some info beforehand: I am 18, my bf is 19. His aunt and mother are in their 40's if i remember correctly. I am german, while he and his family is austrian. 

Now. I am in a state of shock. My boyfriends aunt has been sending conspiracy theory sience videos to everyone is his family, including him. The video was about how donating blood is bad, plus how being forced to vaccinate is breaking human freedom (""your body, your choice""). She started a huge fight with my boyfriend and basically said she's shocked at how much he is a mindless sheep.
Shortly after she posted an image into her whatsapp status saying something along the lines of ""people who don't understand a specific mindset are insulted and called conspiracy theorists"". Shortly his mum jumped on the bandwagon aswell and posted the same image with the caption ""so true"". He is currently in a fight with her and i tried helping his side.

My arguments were she is endagering babies, old people and people with an weak immune system. She replied ""it's worth putting them at risk"".
I honestly don't know what to say anymore. I am shocked. My boyfriend is just as shocked as I am. He's getting frustrated his family is believing all of this.

631,"So this would be my first Reddit post. I really can't ask advice from my family nor friends since they might judge me or my family so I'll just ask here. I have an adopted older sister with a 16 y/o gap between us and she gave birth when I was 2 y/o. My sister being a single mom asked my parents for help raising my niece in our care since she'll be working abroad for a mean time so me and my niece grew up treating each other as siblings but when I was 10 y/o  my sister took her and they lived in Russia for a few years. Fast forward in the present, my niece is now a beautiful woman and wanted to enroll in a university near my place (I already moved out and have my own apartment) and asked me if it's fine if she can live with me in my apartment, as her uncle/brother I told her it was fine. At first living with her after being apart for a long time was very awkward considering we have a little age gap and she's extremely pretty but we became comfortable again after a month of living together but that was the start of her agressiveness. She starts crawling in my bed to sleep besides me starting giving peck kisses in cheeks and sometimes in the lips. I told her that I was uncomfortable with her doing that and she just replied that we do these things when we were kids so I just let her do what she wants but then she started walking around the apartment with just lingeries on and being overly seductive towards me. I told her not to do these since we are basically family but she insisted saying that we're not blood related. I've been avoiding her lately since I don't know what to do with her. I genuinely love her like a family but I don't think having her like this would be very healthy for the both of us.

When I found out my boyfriend was initially so supportive because we both agreed to an abortion. However, throughout the process I changed my mind but didn't have the space to think my decisions through because he was pressuring me. 

We met yesterday evening to discuss and it didn't go well. 

He is leaving to London for a job once Coronavirus lifts. He says he cannot raise a child being away from it. He told me he does not want a child right now and if I do not take the tablet tomorrow that the relationship we have is done. However if I do take it we can continue.. because obviously I would want to after that (not). I am completing my masters in corporate law and he continually told me I will be unemployed and how could I bring a child into this. He has no idea how the future will go. 

Yesterday evening he kept ringing me and pressuring me to make a decision about taking the tablet. Feeling this immense pressure i told him then and there I won't take it. I am torn about wanting the baby and not. Since then he has continually said such nasty and horrible things to me - telling me I'm coming after him for his money, that I've ruined his life and that he wouldn't want to be with a girl who is unemployed (Part time job is shut due to corona and I study full time - I've been applying for so many jobs). All he is worried about is how this affects only him and has told me he's going to look bad going away and when the child is older and wonders why he wasn't a part of his life he will look bad. 

He has told me to never contact him again, that he wants nothing to do with me, the baby or anything. He has blocked and deleted me off everything.

639,"Hello everyone, so I actually do not have a single thing to ask advice about. Instead I'm going to list down things about myself that I feel like I should address; whether it  be self-help or through professional help, I honestly don't know. 

So first a little something about myself: I'm gay and an adopted child. My whole extended family is perfect and I don't think I have anything to complain about. I grew up in a loving, accepting, and supportive family. I work in STEM now and also currently in grad school. 

Now that's done, here are some things that convince me that I need help: 

1. It is so hard for me to bond with someone unless I know that they are a nasty, garbage, piece of shit person like myself. I just do not know how to act around people who are generally good people, you know? Like the only times I have struck up a conversation with a stranger that eventually blossomed into (somewhat) a friendship is when we're being nasty bitches. 
2. I make up stories in my mind that I eventually believe, and these stories change over time. Recently, the story I've been telling myself is that I have a very handsome guy (let's name him Greg) who's head over heels about me but I don't like him because I'm in love with a significantly less attractive but average looking at best (let's name him Kevin). Greg (in my mind at least) is harassing Kevin and I, even going as far as attempting to murder Kevin. Other stories I've made up are that I was born in an abusive family, that I'm a child genius who learned calculus at 8, etc. 
3. So the last number was about how I believe these stories that I've spun in my head. Probably harmless in the grand scheme of things. The problem is that I also tell other people these and I've been caught lying so many times but I cannot help myself. For example, until now my friends still believe that I'm the son of a businessman and a ballet dancer. My parents are college professors. Being aware that my friends will possible meet my parents in the future doesn't stop me from lying about these. There are a lot more lies that I tell to people. Basically every person I meet, meets a different version of me. 
4. I feel like I don't love my family (even though they are perfect). My grandma died 4 months ago, and my dad called me in the middle of the night sobbing. I told him to call me back later because I was studying. When I went to saw her in the casket, I had to fake tears. Also, I am significantly more politically outspoken than my family as most of them lean on the conservative side (they're not homophobic though), and everytime I get into a fight with a family member because of a debate gone wrong, I actually feel relieved that I don't have to acknowledge their existence anymore. 
5. I also don't care about my friends. One of my closest friends (if you even call them that) almost got raped while I was with her. I knew I had to comfort her, probably even hug her and console her, but I just couldn't do it. The most I did was pat her back. I know it's wrong but I don't feel bad about it. This is just one of the stories but you get the gist. 
6. I know I mentioned that I am politically outspoken but sometimes I catch myself actually not caring about marginalized people. I'm not going to go into detail but I sometimes catch myself thinking that oppressed social groups deserve their oppression. I know it's wrong though. I just can't shake it off my min. 
7. I'm an overachiever but the act of achieving isn't the thing that drives me to do the things I do. In fact, the only motivation I have in work and at school is the fact that I get to prove to other people that I am better than them. I feel zero happiness from getting a promotion, 100% of my happiness comes from the fact that my boss will probably announce it to the team and people who have been working here before I came in will realize that I got promoted before them. I don't care about getting perfect exam scores, I only care about the fact that the class average is 67%. You get the gist. 
8. As you can probably conclude from the previous numbers I'm significantly more well off than my peers (although my family is lower-middle class). I have a full-time job and I have a steady freelance gig. On top of that I do lectures and public speaking. I do have a lot of income streams. The only reason I work hard for the moolah? So other people get to see how much richer I am than them. Tbh, the only reason why I have Apple products is because they look good when I'm chilling at Starbucks. Also, the only reason I gave my parents new iPhones and my brother the highest Macbook Pro is so they get to tell people I bought them those.
9. There probably are more things I could write about but my fingers are getting tired. These stuff were the first to come to my head so I guess maybe they're the most urgent concerns... so yea. 

The thing that bugs me is that I know all these things about myself and I want to change them... sociopaths generally don't admit about being a POS person right? So if I'm not a sociopath what am I?

How do I stop complimenting as much? How do I stop constantly chasing girls and maybe make them chase me instead? I'm actually tired of being like a simp or a nice guy.

He's an older man in his sixties and he lives alone in the unit attatched to mine (so our living rooms are only seperated by a wall, which means this is very hard to ignore). He clearly has a drinking problem, but when I see him outside his house he's quite a pleasant guy. Problem is most nights he starts shouting, either noises like he is in pain, or just ""No! No! No!"" I assume he's drunk because after his farm was damaged in the Australian January fires he spent a week straight inside his house only coming out to stumble across the road to buy more booze, all the while shouting day and night. I was so worried then that I called the police to do a welfare check, but they never told me how it went.  But the bizarre shouting started well before all that. 

So now he seems perfectly fine during the day and then about the nights he is shouting for hours on end for seemingly no reason. So I know he's not injured or anything at least.

After a bit she dm about a “pedo”. Turns out she was shaming the poor guy for having rape fantasies. I tried to explain it’s almost like being gay but she really didn’t care. The poor guy was raped by his uncle and she started calling him a freak and a pedo. I reached out to the guy to make sure he is ok and he is fine. 


She then kept messaging me about pedos. One guy was a doctor who did nothing wrong at all and was just trying to help. She is running around the internet accusing people not being perverts and pedos. I spoke to all of them and they all said SHE started the conversation and no one else. 


She brought everything up and I finally told her to just stop sending me things. Bout a week after all that I may or may was worried about how she was doing and she made a post saying she was suicidal. I got scared and decided to make sure she was ok.

I have tried Xanax, clonopin, Valium, gabapentin, Vicodin, oxycodone, and I drink alcohol occasionally. The only things that worked exactly the way I wanted was opiates or alcohol (but only if I’m drunk.) I would feel euphoric instead of tense, make decisions quicker and easier, and the procrastination disappears. Suddenly I’m ready to clean the whole house, do all my online college work I would otherwise forget about, go to the gym, and be very social. 

Back when I was in kindergarten, every student got a coloring/drawing book that was made of plain manila paper where we could draw anything we wanted with crayon. While everyone else was drawing terrible family pictures and awkward looking rainbows, I would color the whole paper one color. From edge to edge, completely filled in with a single color. The color would change daily. I always thought it was weird but at the time I was loving it. 

I need to take classes in person so I could be forced into caring about the subject for that period. I almost never do homework, and I avoid online classes since I’ve failed 90% of the ones I’ve taken. If I’m in a lecture it’s very hard to focus and I won’t absorb much of anything unless I hear it’s gonna be on an exam so I write it down, except I can’t study so it’s useless. I take all my quizzes and exams just using memory from class, and if the class had more participation involved, my grades were always higher than compared to just listening and taking notes. Now with the Coronavirus pandemic happening, all my classes (4 altogether) were converted to online and my grades went from all A’s to all failing. 

I took half of a 30mg tablet of Adderall IR for the first time today on an empty stomach, waited an hour, and didn’t feel any difference so I took the other half over an hour after the first half. Although I was able to focus, I would still get lost in my thoughts because I would still jump around ideas but now I spent more time on each one. The amount of thinking was even more intense, and instead of having 100 different thoughts, now I had 2 thoughts with 50 ideas for each. Either way, my thoughts came at me like a freight train and I started to sweat (like usual) except it was a lot more, lasted the entire Adderall dose, and I was very jittery. I’m normally sweaty and jittery but Adderall did not help, only made them both worse. I still forget what I was saying in the middle of speaking and I was quieter now since the thoughts were coming in so fast. 

I was hesitant to try Adderall because of it being a stimulant and I hate feeling jittery and sweaty normally so I definitely don’t want those increased. It’s now been 8 hours since I took the Adderall and now that I’m home and alone, I feel more calm but I doubt I could fall asleep. 

If the Adderall could feel like it does now, but without the jittery sweating (which has almost disappeared completely by now since I’m home alone and now it’s wearing off, just feel kinda wired at the moment) it would feel exactly how 20mg of oxycodone would feel, except I would also be pain free since i was paralyzed suddenly 4 years ago and I suffer from Transverse Myelitis which has mostly healed except now my spine is constantly sore right at the C7 vertebrae, and it makes it hard to do most things without forcing myself. I now suffer from slight erectile dysfunction since then so I take cialis 5mg daily for that. Mornings are brutal and my lower spine is in so much pain that I can’t stop pacing around the house and I’m ready to scream. When I say I’m mostly healed, I mean that I’m not paralyzed at all anymore and when it first happened I was almost completely paralyzed from the neck down. My organs were still functioning on their own but i think they were reduced in function since I remember them being worried about my heart stopping. 

They would stick pins in my arms and legs and I couldn’t feel them. As you got closer to the C7 vertebrae, the pain inside my body would increase. TM is weird I guess, since my body was in a tremendous amount of pain, like almost mind breaking and asking for death, and at the same time paralyzed to the point where you could stab or burn me and I wouldn’t feel it at all. You could cut me, burn me, tickle me, no matter what it was, I wouldn’t feel it and my limbs didn’t work. 

Apparently I’m gonna feel this way for the rest of my life, add in the mental issues I mentioned earlier, I’m kind of finding it hard to believe I’ve been dealing with this for so long. It sounds like something I would’ve given up on if I had the option to and now that I’ve written all this, it’s making it more clear to me how big of an uphill battle I have ahead of me. 

I’ve almost completely given up on having a wife and family but it’s something I really want. I just don’t think I could support anyone in this condition, in fact, I receive too much support as it is just to appear to function normally. Without financial support, I’d be living in the streets since I can’t hold a job. Just speaking physically, it takes around 4 hours for my back to calm down in the morning before it becomes manageable but I still won’t be able to bend over, at least without feeling like my spine is tearing apart. There’s no way I could keep up with any schedule like that, so I make money from home growing marijuana and the rest is provided in financial support from my parents. I don’t live at home with my parents because I need to be alone to deal with my mind and openly feel pain without worrying about them seeing me and feeling sorry for me. If my mom actually knew how much pain I was in, and how hopeless it has made me feel, she would try to do everything in her power to help. She will become manic and honestly I don’t even think she’ll stop before becoming a neurologist herself just to get her hands on my recovery and make sure everything’s going according to plan. My dad was stuck overseas when it happened so he feels guilty that he wasn’t there. He came back as soon as he could but by then the worst of it was over and I was just barely starting to walk on my own again. I just feel guilty taking their money because they both run a business together and work hard for their money. 

They have plenty of money and a bunch of property, but that’s only because they work Monday-Saturday 8am-8pm, 72 hours a week and only take sundays off to relax and have a bbq. They work ridiculously hard for their money with no signs of stopping anytime soon, but I can’t help but feel like I’m a mooch who is getting spoiled. I’ve never written this much about myself so a lot of this is just dawning on me. 

I know what “the cure” is. I’ve had it and it is perfect for every problem I’m having. It’s opiates, specifically 20mg of oxycodone or more, or 30mg of Vicodin or more. I haven’t tried other opiates so idk what they would be. We’ve all heard and are aware of how dangerous opiates are, with addiction being guaranteed and side effects eventually taking a toll on you. Abusing them puts death right around the corner with withdrawal and overdosing being pretty common. The thought of relying on a drug for the rest of my life, with the risk of death if I’m ever not able to refill a prescription and suffering through withdrawal because I’ve taken it daily let’s say for the past 5 years hypothetically terrifies me. Peoples opinions of me will change, and idk how I’m supposed to even drive if I’m on a dose of oxycodone since it’s illegal and considered a DUI or OWI. Its very frustrating to have the solution right there in front of me and not being able to use it because I’m scared or I’m refusing to swallow my pride and admit to my doctor and my family that I’m in a lot more pain than I’m letting them believe. All I have now is about 3-4 days a week where I take a single dose of 20mg Percocet that gives me relief for about 6 hours so I can do everything I need, like go to school, see my family and friends, and buy some food to enjoy without having to adjust my back 5 times a minute. The rest of the week I’m in pain and suffering mentally, that’s 18 hours of relief, like 35 hours of sleep, and 115 hours of mental and physical pain a week. Sometimes I don’t leave the house all week just so I won’t have to use it and act normal. I can’t think of anything else at the moment but if I hadn’t mentioned it, than it’s probably not that big of a deal. Sorry this is so long, the Adderall made me rant. 

Tl;dr- pain from TM is taking a toll on my life and I have anxiety that makes me sweat a lot. Opiates are my only hope but I’m terrified (read last paragraph).",02May2020,1
654,"I dont know what to do. I need advice about this. I know some might say its not my business and all.

Context:
My Bf and I are gonna be in Grade 11 when school opens for this school year.

I first initially wanted to be a nurse but then changed my decision to be a Game Developer. My Bf choice is gonna be a doctor. But thats not his decision its his family's decision. He wanted to be a game developer due to him playing games and he wants to make games and thats what he loves. His family thinks he wont get anywhere in life if he becomes a game developer. That he would end up as an Internet Cafe owner.

So at first he was ok with his family's decision letting him be a doctor. But when I changed my decision to be a programmer. He feeling miserable because I would not be in the same work area as he is. The reason why he was ok with his family's decision was because I was in the same work field as he is. He is very unhappy in being a doctor and having me in the same work area as he is made him feel less miserable. 

Now you might be saying  ""He can just confront his family about not wanting to have the career."" Wrong. My Bf is non confrontational and doesnt want to fight with his family. His family wants whats best for him even if he isn't happy with it. Because being a doctor would have alot of money and all. So his family wants him to have a job that would support him.

 Now I am extremely miserable knowing my Bf is not happy with his career. My bf doesnt want my happiness to be taken away as a Game developer and told me not to let him falter on my choices in life. That i should pursue on what I want. He told me to be Happy so that he would be happy.

  I don't want my bf to be miserable because his family wants him to be a doctor. I dont know what to say or do. I need advice in what to do.",02May2020,1

656," 

I've never get along with my sister because she's treated me like shit. She took advantage she's 8 years older than me to do this. On the other side, my mother doesn't have any character so she just stood there.We inmigrated many years ago to Europe and come from an underveloped country when hitting children is social accepted. However my mother has NEVER hit my sister. So she doesn't any ""reason"" to follow this ""educational method""

Well, my sister is married with his husband and ten months ago they had a beautiful baby girl. Let's call her Alexa. I will admit the baby is a difficult one, I mean she's restless, and she bites and scratch a lot. On the otehr hand she's very very clever. The thing is listened my sister is always complaning about her. But when I am with Alexa, it's true she's restless but the scratching and bitting is something she rarely does and stops if you tell her: NO. I don't understand why she would do it to her parents more than her aunt.

Well, more or less since the quarantine began they started hitting the baby. At first it was because Alexa's obession with mobiles phone. Literally she can't see one. But they were the ones who started to give it to her at first so she would stop crying. So, its not the baby's fault. Then they started to hit her because Alexa scratches and bites them and from my sister's version now that she has grown teeths is even worse. Besides, because Alexa also hits them. I know Alexa does that *sometimes* But I don't think an adult should level down to 9 month old.

My sister shouts at the baby too. For example I just listened how she was just shouting at the baby in a repulsive way and telling my mother is because Alexa was putting her hands on her mouth and if they were to a restaurant she would embarass her.

I completely sure as the baby gets older the abuse will only get worse. No one in their right mind hits their baby, listens the baby cry bleakly and still does not feel like shit.

But a the same time she's just a baby and I don't know if it we will be perjudicial for her. Even if I harbour some resentment to my sister, I will never report her for that reason. I don't know if I will crossing a line and this too much.",02May2020,1

661,"Hi I am currently 18 years old and due to the ongoing lock-down in my country my medical entrance exams have been postponed. This has caused my parents to force me to study more than ever before which is causing me serious stress. 

The fact is I was a dumb kid and wanted to have a high paying job and after googling it I found surgeon to be at the top spot so I thought hey let's try that. 

I took it seriously up until my final semester of my high school and then it hit me.........

So the point is that in order to start earning anything as a doctor in my country you have to study for at least 12-15 years after 18 years of age. I couldn't imagine being in my parents care up until I am 30 freaking years old ! Only my father works in my family and I also have a bro in his final year of middle school. I would receive a certain amount of stipend while I am doing my internship or residency but in my country its not worth anything. 

Here comes the difficult part.....

I WOULD have been the 1st doctor in my family line. When I had told my decision about being a doc my mother was almost at the verge of tears and they believed me that I could do it. I clearly am destroying everyone's expectations by changing my career. Whenever I try to approach my parents about this my stomach just crunches up , mouth begins to dry up and I cannot put it into words seeing how everyone is expecting so much from me. Also my dad has a short temper and always shouts at his phone every now and then.

666,"He keeps on having these manic episodes and being forced to go to the psychiatric care. He thinks that his medicine (lithium) makes him depressed and unable to think clearly which leads to him not taking it. Every time he stops taking his pills he will after just a month be back in a manic episode, where he wants to change the world, break all norms, start a political party, write novels, record an album, make movies, write screenplays, start a podcast etc. But its all just talk with nothing happening. And he talks non stop for hours and hours (he is normally a shy often quiet person) and is completely unaware of him being mentally ill. If you even try to talk about medicine he becomes upset and that he is not mentally ill and its the first time in his life he feels good. 

After a few days he starts hitting himself, destroying his things, crying, screaming, laughing maniacly.

667,"Hi reddit,

Me and my mother moved into a new house in February in order for me to start University. We had a time limit and thought the neighbours were ok. On one side of the house, we have lovely neighbours. On the other side we have completely abusive trashbags. The trashbags have a nice 10 year old daughter who is currently who knows where and have 2 people staying over. The trashbags like playing loud music all day, when I'm trying to study at home. We have called noise control and the police and nothing ever happened. 

Today we called noise control, and I heard how they treated him. It went somewhat like this:

Noise control!
""What?""
Noise control, your music is too loud!
""What?""
Noise control there have been complaints turn down the music!
At this point two women came out and started shouting at the noise control guy, telling him to f off.
Male turns down music, comes out and all three shout at him, telling him they don't need to turn down the music, that he hasn't read the rules, general abuse. Most importantly they ask him to tell them who called noise control.

We are very shocked by their reaction and go inside to eat dinner. But it's not over yet. Trash bag woman and trash bags female friend come over to our house (on our property after telling us to get off their property for trying to ask them to switch off their loud music that was playing outdoors while they are indoors) and knock aggressively on our windows and try to open our slide door for 15 minutes.

We call the police and the police fo over and talk to them. At that stage they have turned the music right down and say that it is ""not loud at all, is it?"" and that ""They are so sorry because it's such a waste of police time""

TLDR
Trashbag neighbours play loud music practically all day. We called noise control and they first went ballistic on the noise control guy. Threateningly came on our property and knocked for 15 minutes trying to get in. When we called the police, they made us look insane.

669,"its my first year

and im fucked

lowkey feel this way all the time

not sure what im doing

like, okay. first semester was ight, well, i did fail one class, but at the same time, i kinda dont care cuz it was an easy one, tho it kinda pisses me off too. dunno. Academically im doing just enough. 

but, its not even the main problem. i feel lonely asf. the thing is that in terms of that everything started off perfect. i literally talked to everyone, became the most popular. but now, i just cut all of them off.

its weird. the reason is weird. i just started to think that they didn't care enough, i still didn't feel like anyone's first choice. it made me angry, everyday, seeing them, it made me mad. so i just gradually stopped talking to them. honestly, i dont care to be the part of the group, if i dont feel important. and yes maybe thats the problem, but i really cant get rid of that desire.

like, even if i dont feel like the main guy in the crowd, if im not the funny one, and if i see others taking the spotlight. it just makes me hostile, i dont even know. 

i started to do this gradually, stopped talking to them. it was not a dramatic fall out or anything like that. but...

it did make me feel lonely. i feel like everyone's against me, i feel like its me vs the whole world. and obviously, the stress doubles, when you feel that way. i also gotta take care of my grades, the exams, etc.

it was a mix of anger and feeling of not being appreciated that made me this way. i did the same with my school friends. and that's why, rn, im completely alone.

i feel lost asf.

again, the only thing that helps is anger.

i got that fighting spirit, i stop giving fucks about everything. and yea. it does help. 

but, also its lonely af. i dont want to waste my fucking time like that. i dont do shit anymore. the last time i was out with others, was the beginning of this year. and thats it. i got literally no one. i've been like this for almost 2 years. its just me.

It will also help you pay for most prescription medicines and provide you with ambulance cover during any emergencies. Before you move to Australia for your further studies you have to purchase OSHC. This must be covered in order to meet the study in Australia for international students requirements.",02May2020,1
680,Hi I don’t post quite often but given all the time I have had in quarantine to think I have started to realize how much I miss a lot of old friendships I had with people that I don’t talk to anymore. I want to start talking to them again but I’m a pretty shy person and even through text I’m very afraid to do it. I’m afraid that telling them I miss them will lead to one conversation of awkward small talk and then we never talk again. What I really want is to renew friendships with those people but it’s scary for me because when you haven’t talked to someone in so long you assume they aren’t thinking about you or they don’t miss you at all the way you miss them. I want to talk to these people so bad but I have no idea if they even want to be friends with me still. I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to do this because I know it can be tricky sometimes as well as scary. Any tips or advice would be really appreciated :),02May2020,1

683,"Hi,
I'm 22 years old, Since i moved to my own house i used to keep it extremly clean cuz i spend a long time at home as a result of my job which is on the internet.

Recently noticed that i'm obsessed with cleaning everything around, i feel joy when i clean dishes, wash my hands, wipe the window glass and those things.
Is it normal to a guy in this age to be interested in cleaning and cooking ?

And.. My friends bully me always when i tell them to clean something.

688,"My girlfriend is about to turn 18 this year (which is sorta like ""the coming of age"" stage for women here) and Her Family has been planning a pretty big party for her. She absolutely detests that idea calling it a waste of money, and that her father should just spend it on beer. (He's not an alcoholic or anything, just likes to drink with friends lol) 

Context about her past (not going into too much detail, for obvious reasons, lol) 
-She was adopted by her biological parents to some relatives (so she's still blood related to one of her parents)
-She was practically fought for by her adoptive and biologival parents at quite a young age on her very birthday.
-Rumors were spread around her area regarding her situation by her very own biological mother. 
-Her adoptive parents are loving but are pretty strict (you know, usual asian parents but nicer than the stereotype) . They have also only given her a partial truth.

She has quite erratic mood swings but nothing unusual for a  teenage girl. She's usually happy, and has really strong determination towards being succesful financially(Her Family lives in the lower-mid class, which is pretty harsh conditions here in our country.) But she often gets into states of depression when anything about happy families, and when her adoptive family goes through hard times since they really are doing their best for her future. 

All of these thoughts start crashing down on her on her birthday. The first birthday I celebrated with her was me trying to stop some very self destructive behaviour (she also just had an absolutely terrible year before hand, all this happening before I met her.) We did seek professional help but proper psych help here is pretty expensive, we're just students, all we could approach was our guidance counselor (who was a TON of help for the both of us).  Me and my gf and our counselor are confident that a similar situation wont happen again. But ofcourse who knows. Things are looking really bright for her now, but Im not sure how long itll last.

So I need advice that As a boyfriend, I just really dont know what to do. I had a surprise party for her a month after but was met with ""i loved it. it was amazing. but I beg you please dont do it again."" I'm supposed to celebrate her life and how I'm thankful for her. But for her, it's just a mark of a day when a story that should never have started began.  

TL;DR- Girlfriend had horrible past, blames it all on her birthday, and I, a guy who likes birthdays, dont know what to do. Help.",02May2020,1
689,"right let’s get into it shall we because this is going to be long and I’m sure I’ll lose a lot of people reading because of it

My Dad was horribly abusive towards my mum before I say born, beat her in the street, she had to go to woman’s refugees, got out, beat her some more etc you get the jist he’s a piece of shit right (btw he’s been t-total ALL of his life and never touched drugs, it’s literally just his personality) anyway she left him when she was pregnant with me after already having my brother, so she had 2 kids under the age of two when she was 21 years old. Yikes 

my childhood was one big yikes factory. my dad only wanted to see us so he could still control my mums life in some way, my brother was an absolute horribly psycho child -  think ‘we need to talk about Kevin’ type of shit. Tried to kill every single animal we had, including my hamster (me and my mum went out and came home to find he has squashed it in half with a broken draw) , he chased rabbits around the garden with spades, chopped slow worms in half for fun, tried to drown the cat... the list goes on, apparently my dad was known to do similar things! Nice! Anyway so my brother was really aggressive towards me and my mum and if he didn’t get his own way then someone was sure enough going to get hit, so my mum gave him everything he wanted. 

Eventually he got a diagnosis of autism ( me too!!!!) which explained why he was so insane and obsessed with things, for example when he was 7 years old he had an obsession with hanging himself, yah... I have no words, don’t know how my mum did it..  

You can guess how he’s turned out right? Absolutely bad shit crazy. He has the biggest ego of anyone I’ve ever met. Eh it’s so hard to explain the whole situation without having to go into more detail so I do apologise. So basically my brother was put into a psychiatric hospital when he was like 13 because he tried to stab my mum and was having hallucinations, he got out, then I went in! yeah I went into hospital a year later because I developed anorexia, anyway during that time my mum couldn’t cope with him by herself so he went into foster care but didn’t like it so he knocked on ours dads door after not seeing him for years and asked if he could live there. He said ok (my dad had a new girlfriend and kid at this point btw) and so that’s what happened. 

I guess dad told him everything my mum said was a lie even though everyone in our family vouches for what she said and the fact he has a whole reputation in our area for being a complete waste of space. Anyway so my brother is naive and believes him, it gets weird, a bunch of other shit happens, he goes to university, gets disowned by my dad after not contacting him for months, comes back to live with me and my mum, then he went completely mad and moved into my room without asking me and then threw all my stuff down the stairs and starts threatening me because I won’t let him use my phone, my mum is on his side always, because that’s the type of person she is 😆

Flash forward to today!!! My brother is living in a hostel somewhere up north after just leaving one day and has started sending me messages that are really fucking weird. He basically keeps saying that I’m the only person who is the same as him, who is as smart as him, and that I need to gain more personal insight, he keeps telling me to take psychedelics so I can get lose my ego and my defences?? He basically is saying that we are superior to other people because other people don’t think how we think. I said no, talk for yourself but please don’t talk for me, but he keeps going on and on about it. He really feels we are superior and God like compared to ‘neurotypical’ people.  It’s because we both think A LOT  about things and don’t just come to a conclusion after reading one article, for me at least I go over things in my head through the lense of a thousand different perspectives before I come to my own conclusion. And when I come against someone who has a different view to me I don’t dismiss them because of that, I don’t want to be right about things, I want to develop my own perspective naturally without being defensive. I don’t think that means I’m better than people though, trouble is he does. He genuinely thinks we have a higher calling. Yeah I couldn’t make this up..

Anyway so he’s a really scary person and I’m genuinely scared that one day he’ll come home through one of our windows and stab all of us in our sleep. So, if that happens at least I’ve written this post right. I don’t really know what to do as I constantly feel like I’m in a perpetual state of fear because of him, he has said before that he is better than people and he is a God. I’ve tried getting him help before but my mum doesn’t really care and since he’s an adult he can only have help if he wants it.",02May2020,1

I’ve stopped looking at their social media’s and I feel all alone. It’s going to be this way the entire summer. Right now I don’t have much to do because of quarantine, but after finals I plan on driving to Colorado where I can hike and bike and be outside all day and I’m very very excited to go.. when I told my bf this he immediately told me how far the drive would be, and how if I stayed with my grandparents it would be a much shorter drive and we could see each other every other week for a couple days.. but if I stay there, it would be like it is now. And I would be bored and have nothing to do. (He told me I should do what makes me happy, but ik he wants me closer) 

I feel like a burden to my boyfriend too, he tries to not tell me he is hanging out with friends and thinks I rely on him for someone close. It makes me want to distance myself from him because I just like being close to him, but I don’t need him to be happy.

695,"I really hope this doesn't get buried here, I really need some advice. It is long, so thanks to anyone who reads it all and can offer advice. 

I (34F) have two sisters (33F and 32F), who I will call Sara and Daisy, respectively. My mom (50F) has had a series of abusive relationships, but is too naive to see it. Her ex-boyfriend (46M) is Ron, and this new ""stepfather"" of ours is Tim, (50M). 

My mom and Ron got together in 2000, while she was still married to my bio dad. My mom told my father she wanted a divorce on my birthday, bio dad moved out March 2001, and Ron moved in the next day. Ron had, and continues to have, a severe alcohol problem. Not the best thing to bring into your teenager daughters lives. But we were stuck, and suffered a lot of mental damage from being directly involved. Our bio dad wants nothing to do with us, thanks to the brainwashing we sustained from my mom the moment the word divorce was uttered, and continues to this day.

Ron has several DWIs as well as assualts under his belt, and stopped drinking in 2002 after getting his 4th or 5th one. He relapsed in 2016, and has yet another DWI from recently. He is very violent and belligerent while drunk, and once beat my mom, who is disabled, within inches of her life. He claims he has no recollection, but that's a lie. She allowed him to live in her home, which is where I reside with my young children. She is living at Sara's due to a medical illness, so she doesn't see what I see, and I refused to tell her at times because they put me in the middle way too much. I have since come clean to her, even though she still defends him. Ron is a narcissist, and remains abusive verbally and emotionally, mainly telling me how much he can't stand my mom and sisters, and does the reverse when talking to Sara. Daisy and Ron do not speak at all, as they are basically one in the same with the lies and narcissism and butt heads horribly, and their last interaction became violent.

Fast forward to less than two weeks ago. My mom gets a random friend request from Tim, a single father across the country. Two days in, he is declaring he is in love with her. He is going to build them a house, first in his home state, but now he is moving to my state, possibly this summer. He has plans to pick my mom and Sara up at the airport and fly them back to his state for a visit in about 3 weeks. I fear that if this happens, this will be the last time I see either of them. They message each other constantly, and talk at least 5 times a day on the phone according to my mom. He began messaging me two days ago, ""wanting to get to know me, as he is now my stepdad and we are one big happy family."" His questions are really bizarre, and he repeatedly says my name in every message, which is really creepy. I try to be polite, and tell my mind he is a nice guy who cares about my mom, but the red flags are glaringly obvious and I can't ignore them, nor get past them, that it is not my paranoia coming into play. He asked for a picture of my kids, and I told him no, I wasn't comfortable with that, but unfortunately my family doesn't respect my requests to keep them off of social media, so I am almost positive he knows what they look like. I dread hearing the notification going off when he messages me, and want so badly to be rude and blunt with this guy, but that's not who I am, as I've been beaten into submission over the years to avoid any backlash from my mom. I want my mom to be happy, but her naivety is just infuriating to me right now. Essentially, she is forcing this guy down my and Sara's throat, repeating history, and not giving any of us a chance to heal after enduring years of abuse along side her. She believes Tim is for real. I looked him up on social media, and his main name is something else, with the name he gave her in parenthesis next to the other name. I have no idea what this means.

He also claims to be a high ranking official in the government, and wants to transfer his ENTIRE life savings, which are in an offshore account, to my mom. She has been in the process of opening a new account. I advised her to speak to a lawyer, pointed out what she is going to lose if she chooses to accept this money, and told her I find it very strange that he is essentially sending a stranger everything he has earned. She said he trusts her and wants her to hold onto it. Who knows where this money came from, if it is even real! Sex trafficking, cartel, blood diamonds? The possibilities are endless.

My mom briefed Tim on her abusive situation with Ron, and she messaged me yesterday saying ""we are all being protected from Ron, Tim is taking care of it the moment he gets here."" I asked what that meant, as alarms immediately went off in my head, and seems like some sort of plot against Ron is being conspired. As bad as Ron is, I feel any sort of harm to another individual, no matter how bad they are, is so absolutely wrong, but if I say something to tip Ron off, my mom will immediately know. I've been caught before by manipulation from both. I don't know what to do in any of this.

Some things to note. I depend on my mom for shelter, and though I provide food and the necessities for my children, I cannot afford to be on my own, thanks to Ron and my mom's doing. They have ensured I remain dependent on them, and I am trying to break free but have many obstacles in my way. I am highly paranoid and don't trust anyone after everything I've been through. I have no extended family to turn to, as Ron and my mom made sure to burn all bridges, and the only people I have are my sisters and mom.

My mom and Ron are both chronic liars, but god forbid you ever call them that. They don't lie, ever. They manipulate the three of us against each other, though we are aware and talk before believing what was said. But both sisters have rolled on me before, so I am very careful on what I say. Sara has mentioned to me though that something is wrong with this situation.

Ron is not staying here with me and my kids because he would repeatedly go on drinking binges and interact with several people, against quarantine orders, and increasing my and my children's risk of exposure, and two of us here have an underlying health condition that could prove fatal if we contract the virus. I had to kick Ron out, my mom refused to, and was trying to get me to let him move back in, but I stood firm. I fear for our safety being alone here with Ron's violence and unpredictability. 

My mom recently, within the last few days, reached out to a victim advocacy regarding the abuse she has sustained from Ron, but hasn't mentioned her new relationship with Tim. She has said several times that if Ron finds out about Tim, Ron will finish the job this time and make sure she isn't around to see another day. I've told her, as have Sara and Daisy, that she needs intensive counseling. I was told yesterday that I am not to say anything negative about Tim, that she just wants to be happy, and she is approaching this situation with caution. I told her she wasn't, she was blind to it all and walking into a potential trap, and I was immediately shut down and told not to say anything else that is negative. She said Tim wants to keep things private and between them, and she is respecting his wishes, which may mean she goes mum to Sara and I about what is going on. On one hand, that is a huge relief to me, on the other, I don't trust my mom's judgement to see a dangerous situation approaching, especially since she thinks Tim the greatest thing next to sliced bread. This is all so messed up.

I fear for all of our safety, and my mom basically just doubled the risk of harm that can happen to any of us. We already know to watch out for Ron, but who knows what this new guy is capable of. It's really scary, and I would rather be cautious than ignore it, so I'm not blindsided. But things can go wrong in an instant. Tim has basic information on us, and who knows what he is capable of.

What I need advice on: What do I do? Do I contact anyone, even though the risk of being found out is extremely high? Do I continue to be nice to Tim so I am aware of any more red flags since my mom will likely back off telling me things since she has a hunch I am against this ""relationship""? Why would someone who supposedly work for the government need an offshore bank account? Why would someone with an offshore bank account be so persistent about transferring the funds to a stranger? Is there something else I am not seeing because I'm too close?

I have no one to talk to, and no idea what to do. My head is spinning, and the stress has become so bad that I am actually experiencing sharp pains throughout my body. I know I need counseling, but can't afford it right now. Can anybody please help me? I apologize if this is all over, I am just so confused and am trying to be vague as I don't know what this man is capable of. If there are any specific questions, ask and I will do my best to answer them.

TL;DR: my mom leaves one abusive relationship, only to enter what seems to be another, complete with him trying to give her his money from another country and move to our location asap. He calls himself my stepdad already. The red flags are horribly obvious, what do I do, if anything?",02May2020,1

For anyone who's wandering what my post was, here it is : 

 

Hello everyone,

I don’t know if this belong to this sub but we (students of France) need help.

I’m a student that belongs to the generation called the sacrificed generation because we are the first to test a new reform made by the government and contested by everyone, teachers and students, because it only changes the system to worse. Because of it, our school year was already movemented, with new programs, new grade system, and teachers that didn’t’ know what to do with it. On top of that came the corona virus, when we were supposed to study for our final exam in French (one year before graduation), the ones that are a year older than us (the one graduating this year) had their exams cancelled, and we had the written exam cancelled, but not the oral exam. This is the problem. It’ll have to be based on the studying we did at home during the quarantine, which is a lot influenced by the conditions of living at home (some of us live in very little apartment with loud family members, or does not have any internet/laptop so it can be quite difficult at time like that to study) and the french teachers we have, for example mine didn’t even bother to send the program so we don’t know what to study for the exam. This makes the government decision quite not understandable and even more when we take in the fact that these will take place in June, and that the virus probably won’t be eradicated a that point so it’ll put all the teachers and the 500 000 students that have to pass the exams at risk. We decided to address the government’s decision and ask them to rethink about it. If you agree with the irrationality of this, it’ll will help a lot if you could sign this petition : [http://chng.it/z92Y4rdwGH](http://chng.it/z92Y4rdwGH)

It’s in french but I think you can translate it automatically and if it’s not the case you just to put a name and an email address to sign.

So I'm going to drop it... I'm gay and so are my sister and brother. Yes I know this is hard on my mum... point blank to have all your children to be gay must be hard. 

I came out at 19 after my mum just not settling for me being in a relationship and i weren't ready for her him to meet... plus it ment me talking her it was a guy. 

Anyways told her, didn't speak to me for months... refused me in her home etc... put after 9 months past she started to accept that she had to accept me as gay or loose me. .. Anyways that's history and I now 10 years on she is giving me and my siblings heart breaking hell! 

She keeps saying about her being a nan and saying how much us children have hurt her because we can never give her that. We will never know what it's like to feel her hurt. You will never know what its like to be a parent. She will call us gay bastards! And say dont u think u have hurt me enough! 

Oh and don't get me started on the dreaded birthday. U could buy my mother the crown Jewells and she would still make a fuss that we have not made an afford. Honestly it's living hell. 

So yesterday, after my mum making my sister cry and gave her a choice between her or her gf I had enough and fucking went at her. (They argued over my sister not paying her way and her gf living there for free). Then her nasty words came out. 

I went full on cunt. I basically said that she needs to stop acting like a child on her birthday. She needs to stop saying homophobic words to us. She need to stop making us feel guilty for her not having grandchildren, even though in the future we might give her grand children... there are ways. No more of this shit! My mum's job is to bring us up to be respectful, happy and health. She has done that. Thanks mum job done. Now leave us only to figure out our own lives ffs. I said she needs counselling and that she is homophobic and needs to address this! Anyways she put the phone down. And not heard off her since. 

Been years she has done this and enough is enough she can't keep doing this and has to face what ever is in her head and stop off loading her 1920s view of people having children... back off mum,get a hobbie and leave us to focus on our life! 

Honestly I wish I could change my sexually I really do ... in life it would be easier. This is not a choice I would make honestly. It's truly who I am. What do i do?

701,"So I just turned 19, and I have no interest in doing drugs or alcohol. 

I prioritize my mental health and physical health by meditating, lifting, nutrition etc.

But in college, it seems like everyone smokes weed, drink a shit ton, rail lines, take LSD, and pop addies for fun or to let loose. For some reason, disassociating from sanity and reality doesn’t seem fun to me.

702,"I've known for as long as I've known her. Her mother is horribly emotionally abusive, and there doesn't seem to be an end to the madness. She's very irrational, getting angry at little insignificant things that a grown woman shouldn't be getting angry about like not getting brownies or the dog peeing inside (ok this one I get but her reactions are both uncalled for). And she takes it all out on her daughters. My friend and her sister are 15 and 12 respectively and I know this is not just your typical strict parenting or anything. This is abuse. 

Earlier this morning my friend texts me saying that her mom basically blew shit up last night because my friend and her sister ordered brownies and didn't offer their mom any because she had chocolates of her own and she basically said that they could forget about her as their mother.

My friend is a violinist and last year she suffered from tendinitis and had a hard time adjusting, since it meant that she wouldn't be able to play like before. She was going through a really tough time because she really loves her instrument, and her mother blew up at her for wanting to play. My friend would want to practice and her mom would say things like she was going to make her quit orchestra for being disobedient, or completely flip her shit and yell at her to play and play since ""that's what you wanted"", despite knowing that her daughter was in pain. 

I don't know what to do. We don't live in the states so I frankly don't know how I should handle this. There are good days, of course, but I know this shit happens and I know it's not supposed to be happening. Frankly I don't know how my friend copes with something like this. I don't know if there should be legal action taken or whatever, but I do know that this has to stop. How can I help my friend?

706,"Good morning,

After careful consideration and difficult situations where I currently am, I have decided that more than likely for the winter semester of 2021 that I will be applying to go to a school outside of my state. I will have roughly 41 credit hours by the end of the summer semester, and a GPA of \~3.7. I will be going into a psychology undergrad with hopes of exploring a PA program after, and if that doesn't go through, then a masters in a field of psychology. 

So what all of this is adding up to is... a lot of schooling. A lot of possibly very expensive schooling. I'm trying to find the best way to navigate all of this. I've only accepted the pell grant for two semesters so far, so I know I have 4 more semesters to be able to claim that.

neither of my parents accepted student loans for college, only one of them finished college. I was wondering what the process would be for obtaining student loans, if I worked a job, what could I expect my living expenses to be like during that time of schooling? 

I know this is a bit vague, and I'm happy to answer whatever further questions are needed. I just don't really have the financial support of others and want to make sure I'm making a sound choice of moving out of state. I'm hoping the out of state costs would go away after the first or second semester when I've lived in state for more than 6 months.",02May2020,1

711,"I just hate it when she drinks. She's been an alcoholic for my entire life but refuses to admit that she has a problem, much less get any help for it. 

She gets violent when she's intoxicated. I'm not going into detail but she becomes physically/verbally abusive. Right now, I'm doing my best not to cry so loud because when I cry, it really sets her off and she's goes ballistic. I'm also listening to her cuss out my stepdad (who enables her) and throw things against the wall. To make it even more pathetic, it's only 9am.  (but remember, by her bullshit logic, that's fine.)

She's so selfish too. She drinks or 'self-medicates' (as she calls it) because ""her nerves are bad"" but what does she think it does to mine. Her drinking has been horrible for my mental health. I have  severe anxiety because of it but she doesn't give a shit. Because apparently, her ""nerves"" are way more important than her daughter's mental health.

Yes, I've spoken to her about this, many times but she doesn't care. She's seen the damage (both physical and metal) she's caused, so talking to her about it is literally useless.

For anyone says anything, I'm not getting CPS involved. They won't do shit and  even if they do, I don't want to be foster care. I also don't want to be forced to live with my strict grandmom (I've stayed with her before and it was Hell- i think she caused my mom to become an alcoholic)

I don't want to waste my time or my doctor's time going in for what my mother (who has been a nurse for 30+ years, this is also the reason I was always at school as anyone with a nurse for a mom can tell you, they don't let you go easy lmao) assumed is a bad cold.

713," 

I'll be honest I didn't know where else to post this question. I searched online but then I remembered while reddit is full of wacky moments there are times reddit helps.

So here's my question, or more like advice seeking. So here's my story. Ever since I was in middle school I've wanted to be a doctor. I think the fascination of medicine stemmed farther back when I was introduced to science. All my life I dedicated my time and effort to be a doctor. I even told my parents I was sure about my decision.

I'm a sophomore in the University of Illinois at Chicago, going into my junior year. I'm taking all these classes, and while they are interesting I feel like I'm in the wrong place. I only realized it when I took the classes and saw what I'm going into.

I love math, I enjoy a hard math question, one that keeps you up for days until you say ""wait, of course, its this"". I remember when I was a kid I also wanted to be a teacher. I like teaching things to people. While I say I'm not the best at explaining things they always say ""no, I did understand, thanks"". It's that feeling of helping a person that makes me feel accomplished. I remember I used to help a classmate in math because they were struggling, that made me feel good and I always gladly help.

Now I'm at a point where I see how my future is being planned out, how much money and time will be sacrificed. Money is a big one, I want to be a doctor but med school is expensive. I don't want to rely on my parents either. I can become a teacher, I can get a degree faster, and not only that but not be in the same amount of debt I could be in medicine. I can help my parents financially faster as well.

Here's my main question, how can I decide on my career now that I've gone so far in one?",02May2020,1

I have been distancing myself for months now. I haven’t messaged her, she’s messaged me only around 3-4 times over Snapchat during this time, and not to ask how I am they’re always about her. And she never puts in enough effort to continue a conversation, it’s always me. So I’ve stopped trying (very sure she’s noticed but she hasn’t brought it up or asked what’s wrong). If I wanted to continue being friends with her I would have let her know about things that are bothering me and how they make me feel, but this time I know I need to let go, so I haven’t. 

I have thought about bringing this up with her and talking to her about how we aren’t on the same page anymore, but I thought it would be kind of worse and that it would be better to just slowly drift from each other. But now I’m thinking it might get a bit messy and it won’t be a mutual drift and that it’s going to be people getting upset. I feel bad because I know even just drifting will probably hurt her.

When I was younger I had a friend suddenly stop talking to me after 9 years and she’s purposely exclude me and stuff. That’s not what I’m trying to have happen to my friend because I really don’t want her to experience the same thing I went through. It was one of the worst things I had to go through.

717,"Hello everyone.
I'm asking for advice with a decision I will have to make sooner or later.
To many this decision might be easy but for me it is not.
What I am talking about is something that has to do with my social life I guess you could say. Before all of this corona chaos started I met this nice girl and we instantly got along great with eachother. We started texting everyday and she told me she has feelings for me. Now this came a bit unexpected since we didn't know eachother for long but I was ok with it. I haven't been in a relationship for well over a year and I really wanted to be in a relationship again.
So naturally I said ""yeah I think you're kinda cute too"" and ever since we're almost a couple. 
Now a bit about me: I am very very insecure about what others think of me and my actions and also I am not the lightest person in the world. I am relatively tall and I've got a bit of excess fat around my belly which I am not proud of and I want to remove(exercise/gym/etc).
Since I haven't been in a relationship for quite some time I was not really thinking straight and (like mentioned above) just went with it.
Don't get me wrong she's a really cute girl.
The ""problem"" is she is a little bit chubby. Now from the start I swore myself to not body shame and all that stuff and to only count what's inside and I am still trying hard to do so. 
A few days ago my anxiety hit me right across the face: my friends...my colleagues...my family...just everybody. What are they gonna say? I know some of my friends will make fun of me (and her) and say she's fat and just mean stuff and I wouldn't be able to handle that. It just makes me sick. 
That's also why I don't know if there's a solution to this problem. I mean it can only end badly after all: if I choose her over my friends I will be a laughed at and I'm gonna be laughed at. If I choose my friends over her I would feel terrible and I know this would break her heart. 
I hope this reaches somebody that can help me in any way.",02May2020,1

In January of this year, I had a missed FaceTime call from my brother who was 16 at the time, around midnight. This was unusual and I called him back. He was FREAKING out. He told me he was looking for weed in our dads things, and he found something else: a crack pipe, and drugs, and he didn’t know what to do. I asked him to go show me, and he did. I made him take a photo and send it to me, and I told him I would be the one to confront our mom over the phone tomorrow, since he was scared. I called my mom the next day and she was as shocked as I was. She told me she would call me back after talking to my dad. I waited hours, and got no call, so I called her. She said she found the drugs and pipe, and got rid of both of them. She confronted my dad who claimed he had only been doing it for the last six months (duration of their move) because he needed the extra energy for the move. I called bullshit instantly. My dad is a toxic asshole, we haven’t gotten along in years now; I am a 20F. For the last five or six years, my mom has repeatedly said to me: “I don’t know why your dad is like this now, he didn’t use to be this way.” To me, the drugs explained that. A month or so later, my mom tells me it was meth, not crack, and that it had been an issue for the last TEN years. It explained my dads drastic weightless [120 pounds lost] and his behavior changes. 
My parents and brother just moved back to the area this week, and we are now in May. My dad has yet to seek any counseling of ANY kind about his addiction, and he is is denial that he was “addicted” but my mom told me his withdrawals were the scariest thing she’d seen. I have been pretty cold to both my parents. I don’t agree with how they’re handling the situation. I’ve been living on my own for the last year and they had never asked to see my apartment, and the day I moved out, my dad had to sell tires to some guy and that’s why he couldn’t help me put together all my stuff (he’s a contractor so it wouldn’t have taken him long.) my relationship with my brother is strong, and I’m working on getting him out of my parents house when he turns 18.

722,"I LOVE my family. I dont think many people LOVE their families, or are as attached to them as I am. This, I have come to find out is especially true with my friends. Maybe this is partially because  I am yet not financially stable, so my dad helps me out a lot, but I honestly would give anything for them, even if I had a job. Im a 20 year old male, college dropout, and I dont know what Im gonna do with my life yet. 

The problem is that my friends, in this one friends group I have(the one im closest with, and have spent most time with), all either are financially stable, or just despise their families. When I say despise, I mean literally one of my friends dad beats him with a belt sometimes. So I understand why he hates him. 

During these corona times, I have forced myself to stay inside and not socialize a lot. This is mostly because my mom has asthma, and several other allergies, making it almost a guaranteed risk of mortality. 

Of course as the title says, my friends dont care about this.Thet go out as they please, like there is nothing going on, and shame me for caring. 
Today they planned on drinking and smoking in a friends basement, and invited me. I agreed this time, so we where gonna be 7 people, in a tiny, smoke filled basement. But then suddenly they say my friends brothers friends is going to be there too, so we where going to be atleast 10 people there. I told them I was not coming, and they started going batshit in the groupchat. I then said that I dont care what they say, and that I care too much about my family to take risks like that. This only made them more heaty and some of them made inappropriate ""comedic"" insults(stuff like I like my family so much I have incest with them and shit), and it made me sick.
I then thought to myself these people can go to hell, and said this "" I said my piece, and I will piss sideways on anyone who doesnt respect my decisions"". I translated whats in quotation word for word from swedish, so I know it sounds weird. After that, one paricular friend, who is the one I have most problems with, continued a bit with the comedic jokes, then it stopped. Only he continued. Guess the rest understood I was furious, but he obviously didnt care.

Back story:

- We’ve been dating 1.5 years and are reaching that integration and “next steps” stage.

- He makes 100k more than me. He has to pay child support and alimony but even taking that out of the equation (~40k) still makes significantly more money.

- He wants to split rent/mortgage 50/50. He wants his kids [5M, 10F] to have their own rooms, which automatically makes a place jump from a 1BD/1BT to a 3BD/2BT minimum. He’d have to get that size place regardless of me, whereas I’d fit in a studio apartment.

- His daughter doesn’t even want to hear my name mentioned on phone calls [exwife manipulation]. I told him if my relationship was better with the kids I’d be more inclined to help cover their portion of bills but for now he created them, they’re his financial responsibility.

- He told me it’s not fair for me to expect to be 50% of the partnership if I’m not paying 50% of the bills. He basically said I can’t have as much say if I don’t pay as much as he does. He also said he might as well get a renter instead of me if we’re splitting bills in a percentage.

- I suggested splitting things according to number of bodies or proportionally to income and he didn’t like that idea. 25/75 considering his income and kids. He said he’s incentivized to make less money so he can pay equal to me. He also told me it’s my fault I chose a lesser paying job, and to go back to school so I can get a better one.

- I’d be leaving my whole life behind in California to follow him to Ohio.

This morning, he woke up, literally unable to move, and he STILL rejects surgery, saying that he'll ""walk it off"" and it'll ""go away on its own."" He also says that he doesn't wanna ""go the hospital during this time"" which I think is just another shitty excuse.

734,"Alright so before I say anything I need to obviously explain a few things for clarity.

1. This is a throwaway because people in these groups could see this.

2. I’m not asking for help on how to continue this secret, but instead on how to end it.

Ok so with that out of the way I can start, 5 years ago I made an account so I could watch streamers and talk to them, and I named the account after some random character and I decided it would be fun to pretend to be that character, so I was acting like I was an adult woman when obviously I was just an 11 year old little boy who didn’t understand anything. At first it was really obvious and everyone immediately knew that I was lying about who I was, but with enough practice and by jumping through enough communities, I made a brand new person. People really believed my character was a real person and to an extent she is, because her life is just a reflection of my own, something happens to me, something similar will happen to her, I’m feeling bad about something, she’ll feel bad about something. 

This has been the case for the last 2 years, I realized right after joining these communities that these were really cool people and that I’m just lying to them for no reason, these people love my character like family and they do so much to help her, but she isn’t even real. I decided that it wasn’t a big deal since it was just a little lie and nobody was hurt by my character. I made so many wonderful friends and they really helped me out. So the beginning of this year my dilemma came back, I was wondering if I should tell them the truth or not. 

They don’t deserve to be lied to but I haven’t told them because it would really hurt them if they found out that one of their best friends is fake and it was all a lie. 

I’ve shown them my face, they’ve heard my voice, and I talk to them regularly but they don’t know because I look pretty feminine and I look how old I claim to be. My voice is really deep but I rarely talk because I said my voice makes me insecure since it’s so deep for a woman. When they’ve seen pictures of me, I have long hair and I shave so they don’t get suspicious, and they’ve seen 3 or 4 pictures of me as well as seeing me in videos so they don’t question it. 

Should I be honest with them, or should I just leave the communities after finding an excuse that will make things easier?",02May2020,1

we’ve been together 3 years off and on and I’m the one that keeps breaking it off, because he has lied to me taking other girls side at the beginning of our relationship, texted other girls, gotten a girls number, was on tinder when I was visiting family, and most recently I caught him sexting a girl. Now in the relationship I’ve always had my accusations and insecurities because he really hasn’t given me a reason to trust him other than he didn’t fuck the girl he was sexting when they met up a couple weeks ago. Now I’m trying to end things for good but I feel like he’s saying everything I want to hear and that he wants to treat me better.. but ive heard it before. Also I find that when he gets angry he gets ANGRY and lashes out on me if I try to have him see two sides or I do something wrong and verbally attacks me I.e. “lazy insecure fuck” and I’ve heard worse...

Now I’m leaving and he just wants me to stay for companionship he knows we won’t be together but he just wants me here because he has no one no family no friends and I sympathize, he says that he can’t go on without me and if he doesn’t have me he doesn’t have a purpose and his mental health will take a serious turn being alone in a room with no one... so what do I do?

739,"Hi reddit,
This is for people who trying to escape their negative thoughts no matter what they are abt,
Here are just some ideas of ways to escape them and give urself a break.

Recently, I've been suffering some rlly dark thoughts abt my relationship, and truthfully still am. 
But I hv found some ways to give myself just a few minutes break from them in the day.

1) DONT IGNORE THEM
 instead of running from them, give urself some time to actually watch ur thoughts. I've found that the more u try and stop thinking abt something, the more u want to think abt them because as humans I think we are drawn towards doing the wrong thing. Whether for the thrill or because we want ourselves to suffer. 
But anyway, just allow urself to hv a few moments to think on them, and sometimes they resolve themselves. Accept them, and it hurts less when randomly ur mind is reminded of them.

2) SURROUND YOURSELF IN NATURE
I know its sounds stupid, but what more of a way to put ur mind at peace than to escape the noise of urban living and spend a few hours in the day in a forest. Surrounded by the quiet, fresh air, sounds of birds singing and other animals. For me this is when I'm at one of my calmest. It's like u run away from ur thoughts and can relax in nature.

3)  GET AWAY FROM TECHNOLOGY
By this I mainly mean social media on ur phone. U can see a lot of harmful things and if it's a friend problem or something like that it can remind u. 
Instead maybe watch it favourite series on tv, listen to music. Music is another major way for me to relax as u get sucked in and ur attention focuses on the song.

4) TRY A NEW HOBBIE

Hobbies are another way they can distract ur mind to focus on something else. This could be doing photography, learning an instrument or anything u like.
Formr me its exercise, as it makes u feel better and proven to make ur think more healthy.",02May2020,1

741,"I met my bf 1,5 years ago in a different country. Our relationship was great; it was everything he and I wanted. Due to the visa issues we were spending together every other month and lived with his parents (alternating it with long-distance periods). Long-distance was always challenging, but handled it. In February I had to go back to my home country to finish my studies and get my residence permit to move to my bf’s country. I didn’t have an opportunity to visit him till my school changed to distance learning. In the end of March my residence permit was ready, I could go to my bf’s country. 

His mother is immunocompromised and she decided that she doesn’t want me in the house under any circumstances. My bf had enough money to rent an apartment, move out of his parents’ place and support us both (that was our initial agreement; we just didn’t expect to do it so soon). He said that it’s a lot of money and a huge decision to make so fast, so we postponed thinking about it and, a few days later, planes were not flying anymore. 

After this point our relationship went downhill. I feel that I am gradually losing feelings for my bf. It’s difficult for me to process what is going on, I feel that this quarantine is going to last forever and I’m going to destroy everything what’s left of my relationship before I can meet my bf and sort it out IRL. 

He is really supportive throughout this time and he is always there for me. However, I get emotional a lot, cry over the phone, scream and blame him for not taking me to his country when he had a chance (we already talked it through, he agreed that it was his fault). I struggle with studying because of what’s going on in my head. I think that I blame my problems on him. 

All this negativity results in me being really controlling (checking what he is doing on xbox, checking the time when he was on Instagram, checking his e-mail), guilt-tripping him and pushing his buttons (like start crying, so he will stay on the phone for a longer period of time). Once I threatened him with leaving. 

My boyfriend says that he can take it and he will just keep enduring that until we are together. This is unacceptable scenario for me, because I don’t like myself when I act like this and I don’t like him, because he doesn’t stand up for himself.

I still have feelings for him. We truly believe that when we meet each other our problems will disappear. Neither of us wants to break up. How do I fix what’s going on? How should I approach this issue? Should I only focus on my life for now? What should I do with the relationship?",02May2020,1

743,"Weird title,sorry but for 6 years now I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend. He’s 23,I’m 22 we met during high school just to put that out there. 

Flash forward to today,we’re living in a house with his parents and older brother. While running a senior care home on the bottom floor. It’s not ideal at all,and wasn’t bad to start with! But as time goes on,things change. 

Yesterday an incident happened between myself,my boyfriend and his brother and their mother. I misheard what my “brother in law” said to me about who was supposed to be on duty downstairs,left it and didn’t reply to him. Their mother and I were on a zoom call to their family in another country. She apparently heard right and kept correcting what I was asking her of what had been said by the older brother. I stayed with their mother for a little longer on the call,stood up and watched out the window. But when the arguments happened later,she would tell them I stormed out and was all attitude. 

Later that evening,after telling my boyfriend what I thought had heard,so he knew what was going on,his brother confronted him. Now I wasn’t around when they started talking,but all I heard was “Do you want to fight” from my boyfriend and it broke out. Their mother comes running out and gets in the middle,she gets a bit of a scratch on her lip,and my boyfriends neck is all scratched and dug up with marks. All my boyfriend did during the fight was held his brother to stop him from punching and going on. But they aren’t worried about my boyfriend,only the older brother because he was pale in the evening. Their mother tried putting her hands on my mouth to stop me from talking,she later put her hands on me when I tried to leave the room as well. I don’t feel comfortable being around them today. 

The thing that’s keeping me here at this house is my horse,that my boyfriend bought in October. She’s for my “recreation” program,as that’s my job here. I’m willing to let them keep my SUV that my boyfriend and I share,but am unsure what to do with the horse/what to do from here....She’s registered to my boyfriend and I on the papers.

745,"Here's mine:

Studies have shown that when it comes to short-term attraction, women prefer to date arrogant, hypermasculine men with the dark triad personality traits.

Never heard the expression *""treat them like dirt and they stick like mud?*"" That's because certain guys can get away with treating women like crap and they come back for more. For some reason, being a selfish, emotionally unavailable jerk is attractive to women. It creates a desire in women to prove themselves by transforming this badboy into boyfriend material. I've seen it happen time and time again. It almost always ends in tears, with women getting pumped and dumped, abused or trapped in toxic relationships, but like moths to flame they can't help it.

Dating studies have also shown that when it comes to rating male attractiveness, women consider 80% of men ""below average"". Most men will be able to attest to this. If you don't have male model goodlooks, women won't even notice your existence. That's why ""looksmaxxing"" techniques don't really make much of a difference if you aren't genetically blessed in the first place.

Of course, it's not ALL about looks. As I said, if you have superficial charm and a badboy persona you can attract women without being the bestlooking guy on the planet. Also, women (especially later in life) will look for a provider to settle down with, usually a beta-male to fund her preferred lifestyle. Generally, women are not physically or romantically attracted to guys like this, it's simply a marriage of convenience.",02May2020,1

748,"I love my family. I love my brother too, but it seems like as time goes on he’s been treating me worse and worse even though I’m trying to help him. 

He’s in 9th Grade and man does he break me apart. Me and my mother have been really worried about the rate in which he’s growing, and I recently started to worry about his future. He’s turning 15 in June, though still has the physical appearance of an 11 year old. 

He spends all day on the PlayStation and he’s in the second lowest class there is in a public High School. The first time I studied with him, 2 months ago, I found out that he has the intelligence of a 3rd grader, not kidding. Couldn’t even multiply two single digit numbers.

I’ve explained to my parents MANY times that we need to think about just exactly where he’s going to end up, because we sure as hell know that he couldn’t survive a job involving physical labor. He’s never exercised in his life, and his bones continue to cause him discomfort.

It’s just PlayStation all day long with him, my God, it’s self-sabotaging. The funny thing is, he’s truly happy with no responsibility. He’s living in a false reality and he sees absolutely nothing tragic in his future if he continues down this path.

Even though I’m studying Advanced Maths, Physics, Biology and Chemistry, I can’t help but feel as though my help (which is hard to manage given my limited time) is unappreciated when I try my absolute best to study with him. 

Even though he thinks that I love to suck any joy out of him, that’s not true and I’ve explained it too many times that I’m just trying to help him.

As my parents (who are truly great people) haven’t enforced discipline into any of their children in their lives (me and my brother), I’ve had to adapt to this since a young age. My brother is far off, taking advantage of the no work for great reward mentality.

I don’t mean to sound mean, but he truly acts like a spoiled brat. He doesn’t try to better himself, he plays video games all day, eating away at his life but enjoying himself. 

Whenever I explain to my parents, they agree but brush it off. I don’t understand because there’s such a simple solution. Ban the PlayStation, give him punishments if he acts angrily and study with me. He may be a spoiled brat, but he treats his parents with respect and listens to whatever they say.

We’ve actually tried this once, but my brother grows depressed quickly without video games. After one day, my parents caved in, felt bad for him and gave it back to him to continue his 16 hour play dates. 

This comforting your child no matter what mentality is terrible because he’s back to his ways. I finally took initiative and acted as an authority figure over the past 2 months. Everyday I turn off the PlayStation and force him to study with me. 

Today was heated because he screamed comments like “I fucking hate you” or “leave me alone you fucking piece of shit”. 
My parents come and asked what was happening and I explained why he’s destroying himself but they don’t listen. They’re frustrated that I’ve been doing everyday and shout at me to leave him alone. 

I don’t give up and say “I don’t care I’m staying here until he goes to my room to study with me” in a firm voice.
He continues shouting “fuck you” and my parents continue shouting “leave him alone” all at one.

That broke me. There’s no winner here in this situation. I can’t do anything because I’m not a parent even though I’m trying to act like one.

I just walked silently back to my room and started crying. He doesn’t want to be helped. What can I do to help him?",02May2020,1

I’m a female 21!!! I’m using my friends account 
So lately I feel like my face is getting bigger and chin is getting wider ?
I have a ovalish face 
I am getting braces soon and my wisdoms out as I have an impacted wisdom tooth! 
I am 21 

I feel like my face is changing from and that I look a bit different than I did two years ago ? 
But everyone thinks I’m delusional !!!! 
What if it’s changes in noticing which was gradual but everyone is used to my face so they don’t know what I’m talking about !!! 

I feel like my jaw aches when I wake up in the morning I would open my mouth and it would feel tight !!! But at the same time idk if it’s my anxiety and bdd!!! 
My parents, boyfriend , friends everyone say so look exactly the same !!

What if it’s my impacted wisdom teeth ??? 
Or maybe because I should have gotten braces before !!! 
I don’t have straightess teeth but according to people they aren’t bad and according to my bf and friends it looks “cute” 
I’m so scared 
I genuinely feel like my face is getting longer !!!!??????

I already kinda have a oval face I guess but I don’t want it getting any longer !!!
I remember one dentist said my few years lower lip looked weird and that it looked  like I have underbite and I would need surgery 
But then the other dentists I went to denied that and said I have a small issue and that I don’t have a underbite and just need to sort out my teeth which braces would fix and it’s not noticeable! 

I have big lips and My lower lip is bit bigger than my top lip and more fuller but I’ve been complimented for it ?
Although I hate it !!! 

Today I got so agitated at my face that I automatically started tightly clenching my teeth together now I’m scared I messed up my face even more! 
I also am pretty sure I have tmj and Bruxism !! Which I learned a sleeping technique to control me rubbing or grinding my teeth together but I feel like I’ve damaged my face !!


Idk again if it’s my anxiety or it’s my face that’s changed over the past 2 years !!!
I feel like make up also looks bad on me now and that I look weird asffff


But my boyfriend thinks I’m being delusional and said I look EXACTLY at the same !! Same for everyone else !! But then why do I see it !!!!

753,"I know a lot about video games. Video games has very negative outcomes in the future. There are many problems with video games and good and reasonable reasons why video games shouldn't exist. The first problem is that video games are r4c1st. In a lot of video games the main character is white and the main villian is black. The games are trying to show that white people are god's people and black people are Satan's people. Also in a lot of the games most of the npcs are white because they are trying to show that the perfect world is white only. A study from the university of Copenhagen show that video games make you much more obese and increases the risk of getting autisme and Ocular Melanoma. Ocular Melanoma is eye cancer caused from playing video games. Science has found out that it is more common to engage in aggresive behavior when playing video games. People who play video games have often lower IQ than people who doesn't play them. And the last problem is that ADHD is caused by you guess it video games. Most children that get ADHD are gamers. All the facts above are true. Please share this with your friends to warn them of the risk of video games.

So I (18M) came home today from work and saw my mother (42F) with some of her friends doing some makeup on each other. I didnt think much of it since I don't particularly care about that stuff, until I saw the logo of the brand which was Mary Kay. I've seen some antiMLM videos on YouTube and heard about MK from there, aswell as heard lots of bad stories about other MLMs. 

Now I dont know how bad MK is as a company but the thought of mu mother joining a MLM isn't a jolly one. And since I'm pretty bad at talking to and convincing people I though of asking you guys about help.

Am I just overreacting about the whole thing or not? Because as told I really don't want her getting sucked into the whole MLM business and waisting her money on products that probably are more expensive than other brand counterpart.

TW / assault

Context: My junior year of high school, I was sexually assaulted at a party. Since then, the person who assaulted me has come out as trans (good for them) and made a new Facebook account with their new name. A friend who knew the situation showed me the new account so I could watch out for adds (I tend to accept whoever requests me). 

Issue: I’ve noticed that we have more and more mutual friends everyday.  I’m considering sending a blanket message to the mutual friends (right now there’s only 25, but at least two of them know what happened) that says something along the lines of “hello you’re getting this message because you’re a mutual friend I have with someone who sexually assaulted me. I’m writing this to let you know that if you wish to be friends with them, I understand and I’ll block you as well; I won’t be friends with someone who supports an abuser and if you do choose them, no hard feelings, and if not, cool, thanks. Let me know if you have any questions” 

Question: I’m asking advice to see if I should send the message? Or if I should just block them without context or warning? 


Tl;dr my abuser came out as trans, made a new Facebook account and now I have several mutual friends with them again. Should I message our mutual and tell them to either delete them or I’ll block them? Should I just block them? Should I ignore the issue?

Thanks in advance!",02May2020,1
757,"I feel really embarrassed posting this since there are people who would love to be in my position right now, but here it goes..

Around 6 months ago, I moved to across the world to live with my girlfriend while I'm on a work visa. Pretty much the only things I brought with me were clothes. I left behind all of my possessions including my gaming desktop.

I love it where I live now and I really enjoy living with my girlfriend, however I can't escape feeling depressed about not having a computer anymore. It was a comfort item for me for and as an introvert, it's where I was able to charge my battery by video editing, making mods for FO/Skyrim, playing games, etc. It was a really important aspect of my life that is no longer there which feels really bad.

Unfortunately, I can't just buy a new computer since my girlfriend and I are currently saving for a partner visa which costs a heavy chunk of money. There's no point in having my old computer shipped either since it's going to cost more than the computer is worth to ship. Once we've applied for the visa, I can then save towards a computer but that's months away. 

I've done whatever I can to fill my time. I'm exercising everyday, learning a new language, cooking and doing chores. I have my phone which I can play SWGOH, watch videos and surf Reddit on and my girlfriend lets me use her laptop for games when she doesn't need it, but I still just get really depressed about not having a computer of my own. I'm not really sure how to feel better about the situation.

I appreciate where I am, what I have, and my girlfriend (who is extremely supportive of me). It's just a sadness that won't go away. I don't think it's just about the computer since I had left so many things behind that I miss, but it would be the thing that would bring me the most comfort if I had it back. I do have a history of anxiety and depression, but have made great strides in coping with these things. It feels really bad to be dealing with it again despite being in an overall positive situation.

What can I do to feel better?",02May2020,1

762,"To start this post off, I have severe anxiety and have prescriptions just for it because anxiety inhibits my everyday life with and without medication. 

My best friend (F 27) and I just moved into an apartment together. She wanted to invite her boyfriend over for a night which is pretty reasonable so of course I did what I could to control my anxiety (I've only met him once in passing, so he may as well be a new person to me). She really wants me and him to be friends. She knows about my anxiety and agreed to get kind of drunk before he arrived and she also agreed to no pda because it grosses me out. 

Well last night he came over and somehow I was the only one drunk when he got there, which made me kind of upset. We sat down and watched a movie and she laid down on him on the couch and they started like... Caressing each other? While I'm right there on the loveseat beside them. At that point they just became unapproachable conversation wise and I announced that I'd had too much to drink (I hadn't) and was going to bed early. 

Today I'm feeling really uncomfortable, anxious, and kind of mad now because my best friend didn't follow the rules/boundaries that we set. Or maybe we have a different idea of what pda is. But regardless I felt like a drunk third wheel and am feeling all kinds of ways about that. 

She knows me extremely well, I can't hide it if I'm not feeling normal. She will question me. What do I say to her? Am I wrong to think their cuddling and rubbing each other was gross? Am I just some prude? It made me feel really uncomfortable and I don't know how to develop a relationship with her boyfriend or even start conversation if they're just all up on each other. Please give me some advice.",02May2020,1
763,"Backstory: Me and my best friend (let’s call her Jess) have been friends for over 12 years now. We talk every day and have been for years. We hardly ever talk on the phone or FaceTime or anything. Ever since I started working my new job (2 years ago), our schedules are opposite so we (before COVID) would try and hang out a couple times a month on the weekend or something. 

Now: Example that just happened from last night. I got a text from Jess that basically said, “this is Matt (her bf), she wanted me to let you know that she’s not feeling well and she’ll talk to you later.” So I responded and said, “thanks for letting me know Matt!” So this morning, I noticed she was active on social media but hadn’t texted me yet so I decided to send her a message in which I spent 20min proof reading that said, “Hey, if you’re ever not feeling good or just don’t feel like texting back, don’t worry about me. I appreciate you having Matt tell me what’s going on, but don’t feel like you have to give a reason at that moment or even day. We all have our days where sometimes we just don’t want to text people anymore and/or just not in a good mood and/or not feeling good and that’s okay. You have to take care of you first. 

I hope you are feeling better than you were last night and you got some much needed rest. If there’s anything I can help with or do (even in this circumstance of life right now), let me know. Text me whenever you’re ready. I love you!”

She responded to this message saying, “Uhm... I had an episode of vertigo again last night..? Matt had to basically carry me to bed. So I managed to tell him to text you that I wasn’t feeling well. 

And at this time I am unsure if I want to talk to you right now, since as you thought I was using that as an excuse to not talk to you when in reality I would have just not responded until I got up for the day today.”

This happens ALL OF THE TIME. She completely misreads what I am saying or she gets upset because I’m trying to be caring and show concern and it makes me feel that no matter what I say or do, she’s going to get mad at me.  

I’ve talked to her about this before and she denies it. I told her she always makes me feel guilty about the way I text her because at any given moment she can get upset at the way I worded my text. 

Am I being dramatic? Are my feelings warranted? How can I fix this problem? I don’t want to lose our friendship, but talk after talk we have, it seems like this happens shortly after all over again.",02May2020,1
764,"I am currently laid off due to COVID-19. I had been employed 1.5 years with a Tire &amp; Automotive company. I was a Management Trainee for over a year. When the Assistant Manager position became available 6 months ago, I was overlooked for the position. Matter of fact, I was not even considered, despite being in the training program so long. They hired from outside the company and that hire was brutal. Tardiness, rude, unprofessional, and the list goes on. I was transferred to a more profitable location under the tutelage of the the Managers Trainer. Awesome guy, learned a lot, everything headed in the right direction. Company cut staff 50% in March due to Covid-19 quarantine. 
I believe 99.9% that I will be rehired when things get back to normal. The unemployment benefits right now are silly ($600 weekly on top of regular unemployment pay). I've been enjoying the time off and use it wisely. 
A competitor called me the other day expressing interest. Met with the district manager and he was highly unimpressed and shocked that I had been in a Management Trainee program for over a year! He wants to talk to hos boss to bring me on board to take over one of their locations. I will hear an offer this week, whuch will be a substantial pay raise. 
My dilemna: At age 48, do I want start over with a new company when I have established myself with prior employee that will hire me back? If I take the new position, it starts in 3 weeks. I enjoy working for company A, but company B may actually appreciate my value. I am college-educated , professional, years of management experience, and a very reliable employee.

I'm really tall and skinny with a full beard, plus I cook, clean, sing and play instruments, but I've really only learned how to be confident in myself within the last year. I have only ever asked 2 girls out. The first one said yes, then stood me up (politely), and that fucked me up for a while, and the second one ended up being an engaged lesbian. I tried dating sites for a bit, but don't have any pictures of myself because I don't really have friends or use social media. Plus my interests are unconventional, and I have never met anyone I can talk to about them.

766,"Hi all, I’ll try to make this as brief as possible.
About 2 years ago I started a small business, thankfully it is fairly busy and has become my primary income. 
I owe a ton of the success to my dad who goes almost everyday to pick up inventory, brings it back to our warehouse, cleans/preps inventory to go out. 
I, on the other end do my part of delivering inventory, stocking inventory, running all the social media, customer service, marketing, etc. So we definitely put in an equal amount of work. 

The thing with my dad is that he truly does things out of the kindness of his heart and doesn’t expect anything in return. He doesn’t let me pay him for his work and I’d say he puts in a solid 10 hours a week of work. Anytime I try to treat lunch or something, he insists that he pay for it. 

Now my dad has his own business that he’s had for about 20 years and it has remained small and just enough to get by, so he’s able to kind of kill two birds with one stone; when he picks up stuff for his business he can help with mine. 

I’m now at the point where I really want to do something nice for him. 
Every weekend I cook dinner for him, I surprise him with desserts and little surprises like that and I always tell him how grateful I am for him. 
I just feel he deserves something awesome, I would love to send him on a vacation with my mom but 1. The crisis is going on and 2. I still am not financially in a place to be able to do that. 
I’ve mentioned to him if he would like a watch and I showed him some that I was into and he got really excited over a particular one that is affordable. I would have no problem getting him that watch I just feel he deserves something so much more special. Ideally something special and something that won’t break the bank. I would appreciate any suggestions, my dad really deserves it and I’ve been helpless trying to figure this out.",02May2020,1
767,"It's a long story really, thanks to anyone for reading this quick overview of everything so far. 

There is she: too dependent on men. Never single. Goes from one guy to next one. Always claiming to be in love, when they break up , her whole life stops, depression starts for a short time. Then she gives a guy another chance , then he dumps all over her again, then she is miserable again, claims guys are all the same. Then a month later she find another one. It's been happening almost a decade. She chooses idiots ( claims she can't meet better guys, but she settles too easily for the first  good looking guy that texts her.) I never gave it a thought because I accepted it, but she keeps going in details every time , about every guy, every situation. She always acts how strong she is , feminist, blah, blah, but she let's guys take a dump on her always. Recently I heard that back in college , they called her easy . I didn't know that then. For the last year - she was in love 3 times. True love. 

Next, she makes new friends too easily. She lets anyone  in her life , and to everyone she tells everything. Too many girlfriends. And recently, she broke up, again  with a guy she gave a second chance, and I didn't care much. I even made snarky comments. This guy mentally abused her for months, she even thought about suicide, and she forgives him. And How does she expect me to react when she says they broke up again after a week? 

She became too self centered. She always talks about herself, her current relationship. She stops and might listen to me, but its not the same person anymore. She stopped really caring much about me or my life. I can feel that, and even our other close friend. I talked to her recently, and she came to the same conclusion.  She keeps talking how she is too smart for people around her, how she can't find her match, how she is so pretty. But then you look at her friends, and ex's...and you might not even think that's the same girl. 

She always claims to be honest. She is not. She will say what's bothering her, but sometimes later, when she can no longer keep it to herself. Both of us, the other close friend and I, had some horrible accusations coming from her over the years, had bad situation she put us through, and not once did we do anything about it, because we were convinced that she has every right to tell us all that. And we would support her through everything. But she doesn't do that for us. Not anymore. 

I need some space sometimes. I try not to do that lately, but I would isolate form other people at times, because I need a time to myself. I have anxiety disorder and depression, and I need my space.

If I could pinpoint my mistakes. It's that one. I would disappear for a week or two, and even then I think I did text. But no one really gave that too much thought, people would let me have my time, but not her. She would complain how I forgot about her, how I never call her, and she even would tell stories to that close friend of ours behind my back. And I would always say she is right. I don't think so anymore. She never tried to understand me. She only used me. So she would feel better about herself. She accused our other friend to be negative. Her brother was diagnosed with cancer, her mom committed multiple frauds over the years, left her to pay debts, destroyed a family. My dad has cancer, my mom bad heart, relatively recently divorced, we have our own debts. But still, we were always trying to be there for her, to go out with her to parties we didn't want to, meet the people we didn't want, never with  a single complaint. Her own folks are divorced, but they are not in a mess and were never in  a mess , she was never in a mess that two of us were, her closest friends (until recently, I think she found substitutes for us. ) Both of us have to struggle to find a job in this god forsaken country (were not in USA), we take whatever we can, we have yet to graduate college. She has a degree, makes money online, but complains how she is not satisfied. Makes more money in a week that us in a whole month. 

Anyway, I know it may seem like high school stuff,and that's why I cant stand it anymore. We have other problems. Not guys, not misunderstanding between girlfriends, gossiping. I feel like I can't deal with those anymore. Too much drama and lack of empathy from her place.

777,"Hey, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So here’s some background of our brotherhood/friendship. I’m an 18 year old guy and met a guy who I referred to as my family until now when I was about 6. Let’s call them John just to make it easier. Where I lived, all the kids would just be outside on the street all day and night playing and doing whatever. This is how I met my best friend John. We were super close and best friends for a long time, up until now. We were basically family. He’s a couple years older than me, and we always called eachother family and were basically brothers. I think he’s spent more time with me and my family than my sister has. He has even worked for my dad and my whole family liked him. 

Anyways, I never saw this coming. He was always a typical guy, going outside playing and doing crazy shit. Eventually he got into drugs and trapping, and was big ups in the city we live in. Even though he was changing and doing crazy shit, he was always himself around me. (Not putting on the gangster act) and we remained super close friends, but of course we both referred to eachother as family. So with all this COVID-19 stuff going on, he was in quarantine with his girlfriend. Everything was as usual, we were both doing our own things. Then tonight, he told me that he’s cutting me off from everything forever. He told me that had talked with his girlfriend and has figured out that he is actually bi. At first I thought he was joking, so I was joking around, but he assured me that he was serious. He convinced me (I won’t say how, but I know he is serious). He said that all this time he did think what he felt for me was brotherly love, but he has learned now that it was actually feelings. He loves his girlfriend, so he is cutting me off. Anyways, as hard as is this for me, I don’t really know what I’m writing this for. Maybe just to vent. 

Has this happened to anyone? It feels as if I’ve lost a family member that I am close to or something. It just hurts because I thought I really had a life long best friend, but it turns out it really wasn’t a mutual friendship. I never suspected it at all, we were boys and would do everything together. Nothing sexual at all, I’m the straightest person ever. Should I go and tell my parents? Why am I even writing this I don’t know what advice I’m even asking for?

778,"Hello, I hope this won't be too long. After getting my high school diploma I started looking for a job and never really had any luck getting into any job, that could have some possibilities of getting better pay and benefits in time. I didn't have a job for a few months and was making little to no money on the side as a personal trainer, because I have a certificate, but I never really knew how to attract clients, so it didn't really work out.

My parents did let me live with them, however I didn't want to burden them anymore, so I got into your typical dead-end jobs. My first one was a worker for a glass company, I was still looking for a better job at the time, since I wanted to get out of there and the working conditions were really bad. I had no luck finding a job that I could have some progress in, but I found a job with better working conditions for the same pay and right now I'm working as a warehouse worker.

When I started working there I was still looking for another job, sending CVs, contacting people, but I usually didn't even get any reply. After another few months of trying I was really tired and decided to take a break, so I did. However it put me into a really bad state of mind, my schedule got extremely repetitive, GYM - JOB - HOME (eat, TV) - SLEEP every day and weekends were just me usually sleeping for most of the day without really any motivation to get out.

It has gotten really bad to the point I started to have some pretty dark thoughts, I felt hopeless and completely stuck. But one weekend I woke up and somehow forced myself to get out, cleaned my flat and felt a lot better and decided to do something with my life again little by little. 

I didn't spend all day lying in bed anymore, I started to eat better and take training more seriously again. I picked up a new hobby, which is learning new language, which I'm learning through English, so I'm improving my English at the same time. I also started thinking about personal training again, but I'm still stuck at not really knowing how to actually even get clients, so I was just catching up with new research on training etc.

Those are the things I have done so far, however the main problem is still there, I'm stuck in that job. I'm very scared of even actually trying to look for something and scared of falling back into that state of mind.  I'm always open to learning new stuff, I don't halfass my work, but I didn't really get a chance from employers and I feel like I'm just not skilled enough or that I'm just not worth it to even be employed.

What should I actually do? Are there any skills that I could learn? I'm honestly open to anything, I don't mind if it's a skill that will take some time to develop, I can handle to stay in my current job for longer if I actually have some hope, that I will be able to change it in the future.",02May2020,1

My boyfriend and I signed a lease about 3 months ago. Because he was living in the house he had to be on the lease. Before we lived together he has never violent , but he was hot headed. But since we have lived together he has become violent. Here’s a list of this he has done :

• broken a window by throwing a candle through it
• punch a hole through bedroom door
• pushed me in response to me telling him if he puts his hands on me I will call the police then says “what are you going to do you have no proof” 
• thrown glass and other objects toward me.

• thrown all of my stuff out on the porch and broke multiple things of mine
• pulled me out of a chair on to the ground 
• got in my face 
• spit on me

My parents found out and obviously were furious and told my instructors about it, making me more embarrassed that they got involved. Nothing happened,but i did get punished to not go for a while, getting my phone taken away and a lack of privacy (which i gladly now have) My parents seem to trust me more, but still.

788,"So guys, I honestly was mentally friend but I needed to talk to my girlfriend, I was hoping I would be in better shape to talk to her but after not being able to sleep well. Everything is going to be summarized but this conversation went from 6pm: to 4AM.

I told her that I wanted to talk to her, that I was making her a scrapbook of our events together, and I found the pictures of her and her ex and videos. She starts saying oh my god I am so sorry I meant to delete them. I told her basically they are burned into my brain now :(

I talk to her about it, I told her flat out that it hurt. And that there were two parts one, the fact that she enjoyed it more with him, and two that she did things in bed with him that she never did with me. She starts telling me that its different that they were just fwb that she just went for hotness not for other traits, that I am way smarter than him. I ask her if that's the case then why was she begging him to be exclusive with her.

She said that it was just her brain being dumb, that so many girls was hooking up with this guy that she felt it was a competition. I asked her too about the other stuff in bed, she told me that sex is 'different with him.' and that its different too with a friends with benefits and a boyfriend. I asked her that if they did become exclusive and start dating, would she stop doing those things, and she says its impossible to say....

We talked more, and more and it seemed that her way of assuring me seemed to be in telling me everything that I provide to her, oh that I am smart and that our kids would be smart too, oh that I have a good job. That my family is super sweet.. Nothing about Oh, I just want you for you or any sexual aspect that you are so sexy..

After the talk I told her that I Was going to stay over my brother’s apartment. She begged me to stay we talked more and more and I told her too that I was planning on proposing because she started pressing why I was looking through her drive. And I showed her what I made so far.

At my brother’s place I talked to him and he told me.

1). That I will love again, that I can have the same feelings if not more

2). That not all women are like this, not all of them make sex tapes with fwb.

3). He told me that the biggest reflag was the fact that she gives more to sex with casual partners than she does with the guy than she is to her future husband. And don’t bother asking, because you want her to want to do it, not beg for it.

4). Only stay if I feel things with her are truly special, that there are some circumstances in her and this relationship I won’t be able to find in another woman.

5). No matter what happens this would be on the back of my mind and haunt me if I choose to stay.

I thought about our relationship, and it was tough. Had I been younger breaking up would have been easier, but now it was much tougher to let go. I thought about my own mental state, and realized that I would much rather start fresh with someone. I talked to my girlfriend, and I told her we were done. This lead to a lot of tears, crying and more tears back and forth. She started spam calling me but I needed to do it. I got a phone call from her mom telling me that we have so much history to please reconsider it. I had mutual friends reach out to me. Its been crazy :/

I don’t know if in 10 years I will look back and say this was a huge mistake. And I don’t know if my next girlfriend might even have even worse things on her google cloud account. I don’t know but I know that this relationship was hurting my mental state too much

&amp;#x200B;

789,"Dog is a large breed 13 year old (avg lifespan for his breed is 11). He has metastatic cancer all over his body. Low to none mobility (back legs aren’t really functioning anymore). Difficulty pooping. Losing interest in food, we’re having to switch it up to a lot of different varieties. All the classic symptoms of it being time to go. My mother and I are at peace with the decision and all 3 vets my dad has consulted are in agreement. He refuses to see. He doesn’t spend as much time with the dog as either me or my mother. He just sees the moments when the dog looks up from his bed or gently wags his tail when getting pet as a sign that “oh look he’s fine. He’s still curious and happy.” I doubt how happy this dog is laying there 23 hours and 50 minutes a day (10 minutes for his efforts at not pooping). But my dad says since he can’t see signs that the dog is in pain, he must be fine and there’s still life left. I know he loves the dog, we all do. But his love is prolonging the dog’s suffering.

Hello you wonderful people,

I (27m) am in a bit of situation and could use some advice. I started a job in a new field 3 months ago and it's been stressful to say the least. I took a 20% pay downgrade for this job with a way longer commute, but I see it as a stepping stone to a new career and exposure theory for all of my fears. For example, I'm afraid of planning, but will have to be on the road 60% of the time and plan those trips.

Anyway, halfway through the training phase (which ends now), I got thrown on a big, complex project that will be my responsibility in 1-2 weeks. I had a personal inofficial call, with the person leaving the project (he had 20+ years of experience and stayed for 3 months, because he couldn't take it anymore). He said that it was just too much and that the company likes to burn out new employees.

So, I am already overwhelmed with my responsibilities and new, anxiety-inducing tasks right now, how will be able to handle when I take over this overwhelming crushing project? Any advice on how to cope? I'm already on box-breathing and trying to exercise at home.",02May2020,1

I found out that she was flirting with a guy on Instagram (ewww) all the time she was supposed to be ""studying"".
I confronted her. She went all sad, saying how sorry she was, that she would never do it again. 
I think it broke my trust and created me a kind of insecurity. I can't stop thinking that she is flirting with guys when she is not responding. 
She still ignores me, even when we video chat she is on her phone. We used to like that for hours ...

So I ordered one of those pop out cards and wrote something nice and said it was from both of us. 

I sent to my friend and I said I hope it's okay I put from both of us (because it's a pic of us 2) and I think she would love it.

She wrote back ""I'm sure she will"" and that's it. Not that's cute or anything 

Now yesterday she also invited me to help work on the apartment we are moving into slowly together. 
I told her prob Sunday but I'll try Saturday.

Well today she is working on it, and I keep updating her and asking when would be a good time. And she keeps giving me the run around. And it feels like she suddenly doesn't want me there?? Did I over step with the card?

Long story short, I (26F) was caught stealing money from work. I was forced to confess and resign, which I understand. I’m not sure if they’re going to press charges, however, I hired a lawyer to offer all my savings to pay them back as much as I could. I feel extremely guilty, and have been feeling so during those acts... ironically enough the last time I did so, I was going to stop completely.

I know it’s not going to be an easy ride and I told them I fully accept consequences, but would rather not have it on my record because I still have yet to establish a career (which I potentially ruined).

What is suggested for me to kind of, in a way, redeem myself? Would wanting to volunteer more just be a way to better guilty conscious (which would probably make it worse... as if it’s an act of selfishness?)?

823,"This will be long. I apologize.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 20F finishing up my 3rd year of university. As the title states, I do not have my driver's license. When I was 15, I took Driver's Ed. and got my permit. But I hated driving. It terrified me. My instructor always joked about how wide-eyed I was going through down town, and spent most of our time together teaching me to not be as much of a defensive driver as I was.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I wasn't SUPER defensive, but I was to a somewhat bad extent. I'm the type who sees *everything* that's happening around me, which is good, but back then, if I couldn't 100% read someone's intent, which was pretty often, then I would usually slow down to get a better read, which... yeah. I don't know. My time with my instructor helped, but after I got my permit I just didn't feel comfortable to be on the road. I felt like a liability. I drove maybe 16 hours across the 2 years I had that permit before it expired. I got a state ID for identification purposes instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe 6 months ago I retook the permit exam and got it back. I still don't love driving, but it's proven to be a bit of a necessity to ""adult"" around here because the city is big enough that biking/walking isn't viable but our public transportation is awful (as in nearly non-existent, not going where you need it to go... going to the grocery store 12 minutes away to pick up a few things and return home would be a 4 hour ordeal with the bus schedule, it's pretty ridiculous). I also just feel more mature and level-headed than I did when I was 15 and so, as much as I don't look forward to it, I accepted the fact that I was going to drive and get my license.

&amp;#x200B;

My big motivating factor for doing this is wanting to work. I haven't worked. Yes, at 20. And it's getting to me. It's experience I want to have. I live on campus during the school year and have tried for the last 3 semesters to get a job on campus (I walk everywhere on there), but priority is given to students in tougher financial situations than myself. So between really wanting to work/the fact I'll have to work off-campus and knowing I should be entering into internships soon, I'm pretty set on the idea of getting that license.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue, then... While on a permit, I need someone who's had their license for a couple of years in the passenger's seat. In my state, you're supposed to drive 70 hours prior to applying for the test. Once I turn 21 (which is in a couple weeks), I would no longer need the hours, I could apply whenever. But I still want way more experience than I currently have with someone there beside me. However, the only person who can do that is my father.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a very anxious person, tends to think of worst-case scenarios. She's never been in a car with me. Most of that is not because she's scared to be in a car with me, but rather that she doesn't want my younger sister in the car as well (understandable), and doesn't want to leave my sister home alone in case we get into an accident.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with my father is that 1. he deploys, so he's home \~3 months, gone \~3 months, etc, and 2. when he is home, he usually at his camp \~1+ hour away because my parents don't have the happiest marriage. This makes it very difficult, as he's overseas for many months and when he is home, he isn't usually *home* home.

&amp;#x200B;

With Corona going on, the Uni sent everyone home from the dorms, so I live with my family currently. I was really disappointed because I don't enjoy living at home for a variety of reasons and was worried it'd impact my studies, but saw it as an opportunity to drive more.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, classes have been chaotic (to put it nicely) since they switched to online. I'm an Electrical Engineering undergrad, and some of my classes were lab classes that can't viably be taught online. Between that and a whole bunch of other stuff that's been happening (TA mixing up my grades, giant ongoing project worth 30% of my grade, etc), I haven't driven at all. Because the few days my father has been home have ended up being days I've been even busier than a normal day, and on days that I might have an hour or two to slip away, I can't exactly call him back from his camp which is an hour away.

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends and a BF who would be eligible to be my supervisor while I drive, but my parents won't let me drive their car with a friend - which I understand, so not much I can say there. But it really sucks with the situation I'm in. I also personally would not be comfortable driving a friend's vehicle in case the worst happened, and aside from that, I know my parents just wouldn't approve of that idea regardless. But we don't have any other family members living close by. My dad deploys again on May 13th, this time for extra long, returning in early September... when school starts again. I need *someone* to drive with me. I don't want to apply for the road test with the amount of hours I have, even if I legally could once 21. I don't know how to convince my mother to drive with me , and even if I could, there are things (i.e. parallel parking) I would *not* want to practice with her. Like I said; she's a very anxious person, and her anxiety ramps up mine, so doing something stressful like parallel parking with her wouldn't be a good experience. General driving would be fine, but not specifics like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to work and become independent. I am very fortunate in that my dad covers my dorm fees when I'm living there, but that means my mother refuses to acknowledge it as truly living on my own. As in, it wasn't until recently that she'd ""allow"" me to stay up past 10/10:30pm while home, or let me sleep in on days that my classes aren't until later. Because apparently the fact I've been managing my own time and schedule and life in general for the past 3 years is invalidated because I don't pay for my housing and I don't have a job. Don't get me wrong, I'm eternally grateful and know I don't have it as hard as some people, but I don't think that the financial logistics of that situation completely discredit the fact that I've learned time management and how to juggle some of the more ""adult"" responsibilities I've faced while in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. I don't know where to go from here. I feel stuck. Internships got canceled due to Corona, I'm far enough into my degree that all I have left to do are engineering classes that aren't offered during the summer, and so I just want to get my license and work so that my summer isn't me sitting at home and I will have more pocket money as well (I currently earn my spending money via ""tutoring"" my sister; she is home schooled but my mother isn't good with any of the math, so I'm actually more of a 6th-7th-now 8th grade math teacher for her than a tutor).",02May2020,1
824,"When I first started middle school, I switched friend groups to the “cooler kids”. At first, I was happy with them, and they enjoyed my company a lot. But by the second year, I could tell they really started to dislike me. They even said it to my face. At this time I was also extremely depressed, and had been going to a therapist. When I look back now, they were one of the main factors for my mental problems. They were never friendly to me. They always made jokes about my culture, my appearance, anything about me. They also continuously insulted me. But if I said something back and made a home about their culture, they would say I “took it too far”. I decided to switch lunch tables, and sit with other kids, that were friendly with them. I never said anything to their face, and I still maintained a friendly relationship with that table.  Our table was 4 boys and 4 girls. The girls fought and they slip up and all of them left the table. Two of the boys at my table went to my other “friends” table. Their table was full, and it was just me and one other kid. We soon became close, and it was great. I still kept in touch with the kids at the other table, and would invite them over to my house because I had no other friends. They would always annoy me, but I had no one else. Since quarantine, I have Ben playing lots of Xbox. In the beginning, I played with them. This was fun for about 2 days. Then they started to harass me. Any chance they got, they would annoy me. They would tk me, make fun of me, and any time I said something they would say I “took it too far”. I tried to stop playing with them, but there was no one else I could play with. I decided I needed to be “cool” and impress them, so I downloaded a software were I could boot players from the game. They liked it, but I didn’t. I got a message from someone who I booted, and I felt bad so I deleted the software. One of them wanted to play with me, so I played with them. I had a bad game, and he started yelling at me, and insulting me. I 1v1 him, but in the first game he cheated (I was afk) and so we restarted. I beat him in the second game, and said GG, he went off on me, and told all of the other kids who were harassing me. They added me to groups and added my camp friends (who were girls) and started embarrassing me. I left, but they wouldn’t quit. One of their moms is in the school district, and he reported me for booting kids offline (even though they wanted me too). Overall, they keep harassing me and I don’t know what to do. I only have 1 friend, and they are trying to turn him against me. I am now depressed again, after I just beat depression, and don’t know what to do. I should have left the friend group sooner.

825,"I’ve been learning taekwondo since the start of february in 2019. I actually like the sport, which is especially surprising because I’m the shortest, shyest asian girl in my grade 10 class, who sucks at PE. 
But even though I like practicing taekwondo, I feel like I can’t keep going with it. Reasons being:
1. I’ve missed all the classes during the summer break, as well as ones that were supposed to happen but didn’t because of coronavirus. After coming back to classes after the holidays the first time, it felt like my body had forgotten how to do things, and all the practice I put into being where I was before has gone down the drain now. 
2. I initially started with my sister, but she quit at the end of last year. As I mentioned above, I am an extremely shy person with limited social skills, so I’ve been finding it difficult to make friends with other girls who are one or two years younger than me (who are way above me in skill level, not that they’re mean about it or anything). Awkwardly standing with them before every class and during breaks kind of makes me feel down. It’s also kind of hard not to feel embarrassed when I have no idea how to spar as well as the others, or at the fact I can’t kick as hard or keep my balance. 
3. I also mentioned earlier I’m in grade ten. Which happens to be the year that precedes grade 11. I’ve got a crap ton of homework and assessments (which are really bloody hard since I’m in a program for “smart kids”). I have to keep up to get good grades so I can do good courses in year 11, year twelve etc. etc. I’m also doing a uni level course (which is nothing amazing or anything, it’s just teaching background knowledge for people in uni in case they didn’t have it, and the course lasts for a semester and doesn’t have a big impact on anything really except my knowledge of human bio). Basically, I have stuff going on at school. 
And with taekwondo, I miss a lot of time to do assessments and such. I can’t skip when I need to because my parents have to pay monthly for the classes and it’s a waste if I don’t go. This wouldn’t be too bad if it were just the two hours a week, but I live a half hour train ride away from school, which also cuts into my time. And after coming back from practice, by the time I’ve taken a shower, changed, eaten dinner, etc, it’s already time to sleep. 

Sorry if this post got really long, I realise it kind of turned into a rant. Didn’t mean to make my first post like this lol. I also apologise if some parts didn’t make sense. It’s currently 1am and it’s messing with me since I usually sleep at 9pm. 
I know that since it looks like I’m making so many excuses to not go, I should just quit, but I genuinely want to keep improving. Mostly because I want to actually have a chance at winning a fight if some asshole decides to attack me in the future, and despite all my spoken opinions towards the contrary, exercise actually feels nice (? like wow)

TL;DR: I want to continue taekwondo, but I’m too stressed with school and not having friends (at taekwondo, not school).

Edit: also I just realised that maybe there’s a way to exercise and learn how to fight without having to deal with the whole process of doing taekwondo practice. I know the alternatives won’t be as good, but if anyone has suggestions, please let me know (also keep in mind I’m a teen with no money)",02May2020,1
827,"I'm (25/f) a behavioral support technician who works with dual diagnosis clients. There is one client in particular who self harms a lot. Before I go any further, let me give you some context on myself: I've recently been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses and one in particular I share with this client. Because of this illness, I used to self harm too, just in a different way. For a year now I have been in specialized therapy that specifically targets this disorder and the symptoms of it.

I have a friend, lets call him Bob. Bob and I sorta grew up together. I'm bi, and I'm 60% sure he might be too, but nothing has ever been said about it and most of the time he talks about women he finds attractive. But when bob and I used to hang out in his room, we'd watch it lying beside each other (on a double bed) and occasionally make jokes about our dicks, sex etc (always thought this was just banter between 2 hormonal teenagers). Neverthless, and I hope this doesnt sound too lewd, but I'd be lying there with a major hard on lol. Sometimes I'd put my legs round his, but there were always times where I thought he was a bit hesitant or weirded out by this. We've always had a good rapport, but we have had our play arguments etc. 

So, fast forward a bit. I've deleted all my social media, and haven't really talked to anyone in a good while because of this lockdown. Today, out of the blue, bob turns up to my door with a vase of flowers, just asking how I am, saying its good to hear from me etc. I was thinking this was probably just his way of checking up on me, but after a while I got thinking that it might be seen as beyond ordinary to give a vase of flowers, and that theres something else at play. 

Am I overthinking or is bob attracted to me? What do you think the next steps are? Should I confront it to him? Thanks.",02May2020,2

836,"I have an Asus laptop (if necessary I'll add the model name). I've had since June 2017, and since then I have playing a lot of video games on it. 

Last summer, the problems started. My laptop kept either shutting down or restarting out of nowhere, sometimes even when I was in browser and not running any programs. Turned out that the HDD was failing so I replaced it with a new HDD, bought a cooling pad and hoped everything was fine.

The shutting down problem reappeared. Although I cleaned the fans multiple times, I knew it was from overheating. For a while I didn't even touch it, I abandoned all my favourite games in hopes that one day I'd simply get a new one laptop.

In mid March, the quarantine begun in my country, so of course I craved playing video games. I started playing some older games, such as Tomb Raider, so that I wouldn't torture my laptop with newer graphics. My laptop was fine. Later I got into games such as Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs - relatively old games, but I still feared they'd be too much too handle. Nope. My laptop didn't have any problem. It was ABSOLUTELY FINE even after 15hrs of Watch Dogs, or 12hrs of Dead by Daylight. I was surprised, the problem kinda seemed to solve itself, right?

From time to time, however, the problem reoccurs. Some days, my laptop shuts down in the middle of a game after minutes of playing it, but other days it easily handles any video game for hours straight.

Now that I’m in college and dealing with my issues a bit better I have started to attempt to reconnect by texting her a bit. At first she seemed cool with it but she stopped responding to my texts after our last convo February. Our last conversation was about her complaining about her parents being strict and annoying. I told her the next time she was getting annoyed by her parents, that if it was okay with them, I would take her to the local library or a cafe for some time away, and maybe help her get some homework done or find a good book. I talked to some friends and my sister about it and they all had different theories. My big sister thinks that she is going through her own teenage angst right now and I should just ignore it, friend #1 thinks that she is mad at my attempts to reconnect after the long period of being apart and doesn’t want to speak to me, and friend #2 thinks I came off as creepy as an adult wanting to maintain a friendship with a teenager and take her places.

Hi everyone, how are you? Not a landlord, but a renter here. I wanted to share my story not to cause arguments or drama, but to look for actual advice directly from landlords, as to what my next step should be . 

My wife and I have been trying to move to a decent place for almost 2 years now. We are a family of 6- a 5 month old, 2 year old, 4 year old, and an 8 year old. I am a full time worker working in the trades , and my wife is a stay at home mother who gets child tax every month. Our income is very good and dependable. Now, here comes our dilemma ..

We both have bad credit . 
We have a large family 

Both of these things have caused such an issue with somebody renting to us that last year, we were almost homeless. I am from Toronto Ontario, and if anyone knows how it is there lately , the average price of a 1 bedroom is 2000 dollars. So obviously, Toronto is not much of an option for us. But now we are finding it hard to rent anywhere- not for price, but because our family is too large. 

I have spoken to almost 100 landlords over the past almost two years, and every single one has told me that I have too many people. They want a professional couple or 1 person for a 3 or 4 bedroom place. I have tried , and tried, and tried , but cannot get a single person to even give me the time of day once I tell them how many people I have in my family . 

What are my options? Do I lie? Seems to be something that could work, but once The truth comes out, it immediately creates a terrible relationship between tenant and landlord, and that is something I do not want. So with that out of the way, what are my other options? Genuinely would love some

For example, we were discussing a task that was given to me and then he asked if I follow any other tasks that was assigned to others? He then goes on to mention that I should at least be updated so when we have discussions I can contribute to the discussion. I don't mind staying updated to other tasks but at this point in my career I am barely able to keep up with the amount of work I have. Another example, we had four deals to be allocated between three staff (two colleagues of mine that have been in the department for more than a year and me 8 months in the department). My boss ended up assigning two deals to me and one to each of the others.
And the sad part is that he would always praise my colleagues' work and never praises my work. I admit that their output comes out better as they are more experienced but I do not understand the way he allocates tasks between us. I wish he would assign tasks better based on each person's abilities and experience. But I don't want to complain about that as it may sound as if I don't want to work.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a while now but am starting to notice so many red flags. He is very insecure constantly asking me if im talking to anyone else, checking who has recently followed me on instagram and even getting upset/angry when I go out with my friends. Most recently he got upset with me for absolutely no reason, blocked me on all social media and refused to talk to me for an entire day. When he finally decided to talk to me he apologized for his ridiculous behavior (not the first time) and when I said I no longer wanted to be with him he started calling my best-friend. Not only did he call my friend to tell her what had happened but he was spamming my phone and nonstop calling me as well. This is the first time its ever gotten so bad but we have had arguments in the past where he yells and just becomes a totally different person. I just feel like I'm not getting anything out of this relationship that is benefitting me and it just feels impossible to leave him I feel so stuck.

872,"(The background on this question is super long, sorry. If u don't wanna read it just read the title and respond to that as best you can pls)


I've (18M) always had rly bad self esteem issues. Whenever I caught feelings for anyone prior to this year I would always tell myself that I was unlovable and that they could never be attracted to a disgusting piece of crap like me so there was no point of me liking them. I would basically self deprecate the shit outta myself until I no longer liked them, and it worked for getting over crushes, but it was quite unhealthy for obvious reasons.

This year I made some big strides in improving my self image; I stopped telling myself Im horrible and repulsive. And I caught feelings for a girl who really seemed to like me back. She went on a date with me and even said she wants to go on another, but then before our next date she texted me saying she's not ready for a relationship and just wants to stay as friends. We continued texting for the next couple monthes as friends, but I realized that there was no way I was gonna get over my feelings for her texting her every other day, so I told her I needed some space to get over my feelings and that we could come back and be friends after that.

It's been about a month of us not texting and I still adore her. I don't want to do things the old way and hate on myself until I don't have it in me to like her anymore, but I have no idea how to get over crushes without doing that. How do normal people get over unreciprocated feelings? What do you tell yourself when you catch yourself thinking about her? Sometimes I can't help but daydream about the way she smiles and laughs, and about us cuddling and being together. How do I make myself stop in a healthy way? I want to go back to being her friend but I feel like I shouldn't until I get over my romantic feelings for her.

I feel like a big part of why I'm so obsessed with her is because she's the only girl that has ever made me feel liked. There were a couple weeks where it really felt like I was special to someone that I thought was special too, and I've never felt that way before, and I guess I'm scared I'll never find that feeling again. How do I get over this?",02May2020,1
873,"So a little while ago I finally told my parents about my mental health issues, and even showed them the diagnosis I got from my primary care physician stating I had depression and anxiety. I had known I had both of those for a long time (since I was about 12) but finally decided to get a medical diagnosis. My parents knew a tiny bit about it but not a ton. 

After a lot of thinking, I decide that I think an ESA would be great for me because even at my worst of times, an animal always perks me up. It could be as simple as seeing a wild rabbit on the road, but that little interaction would make me a bit happier when nothing else can.

So I show my parents the diagnosis from my PCP and they say it doesn't count because the diagnosis needs to be from a mental health professional (which I guess I understand a little bit because PCPs sometimes just slap their patients with a diagnosis and don't go into too much depth). Well then I also start talking about an ESA and they don't seem very into it. I explain how I think an ESA would be super beneficial for me and after a little bit of talking, my dad says they want me to go through their process which consists of: seeing a therapist, exercising more, and going to bed/waking up earlier. Then we can have a conversation about it. 

I am currently seeing a therapist, exercising a bit more, and going to bed/waking up earlier. Nothing is working. I still feel the same. About an hour ago I brought up the ESA thing again (indirectly somehow) and my stepmom said it would be okay ""way later"" meaning after college. I can't fucking do that. At college is when my depression and anxiety got so much worse. I can't live some half-life at college where 4/5 days of the week I can't even get out of bed. They don't seem like they're open to an ESA at all anymore, and that was only a month ago. I'm so stressed and heartbroken and my anxiety is through the roof right now. Pills would be a last resort for me. I feel like an ESA could really help me and they just see it as me wanting a pet and trying to cheat the system.

I could be so close to really getting some help and they just refuse because ""it's our house, our rules"". But what about my mental health? You've already reiterated if I got one, I would be 100% financially responsible for it. I'm working my butt off (as a CNA) so I can do that, and I can afford one. God, they just can't see it as the ESA helping me. 

TL;DR. Parents don't believe my mental health issues are real until I get an actual diagnosis from a mental health professional; also don't believe that an ESA would be beneficial for me even after I've been trying to get better and nothing has worked.",02May2020,2

879,"Hello! I'm a 14 y/o girl from Europe. This is my story: I will try to be as concise as possible, but i assume that it will be a bit long.

From the begining: in 2016, me my mom and my two sisters (they're 10 and 9 now) moved out of my childhood home to the apartment we have been renting since then. My father was abusive so my mom took us and left. My dad was mentally ill, but he never got diagnosed. As a kid, i cant say that i was not cared for. My mom bought me and my sisters everything we needed, she fed us and we always had someone to talk to. My dad was the real problem: he was very violent, always screaming. He hit my mom several times. I was abused too but not very bad, he just made my nose bleed (i dont know if it was broken i guess it would've hurt more) and my sisters were too. Anyway since 2016 we've visited him but he was not very present in our lives, we were mostly staying with his parents. One day i had a huge fight with him and i left to my mom's apartment (the road was about 20 kilos but it went thru a forest) on foot. I got picked up by a nice man that took me to the apartment and i haven't talked to my dad since. He cut ties with my sisters too.

My mom handled the divorce ok. We were bffs but about 2 yrs and and a half ago she started dating this guy. He is pretty smart, and some-what successful. Everything went ok for some time. One year and a half ago my mom got pregnant again (they wanted the baby) and things started going downhill. My mom began getting angry and annoyed with anything we did, but we assumed it was because of the pregnancy. When the baby was born, i had a fight with her bf that lasted about 2 months, when i finally texted him (under my mom's pressure) to ""apologize"". My mom said that we are a family and we should talk our problems together. He is very controlling and wants everything his way, and my mom changes so much when we are around him, transforming into the sweet adoring mum she was before the pregnancy (but in a very phony way). Very recent, her boyfriend did something terrible, he hit her (he knew about my mom's trauma with my dad), and i could not forgive him. That resulted in him ""kicking me out"" of the family without even mentioning an apology or ""talking"", just saying that i have been very mean for ignoring him and that he will not tolerate.

I know he has been whispering bad things about me into my mom's ear, wanting to put me and my ideals down, but i ignored it. She's been yelling at us for the past 2 months since the coronavirus pandemic hit and we cannot escape eachother. Because we live in a small apartment i do not have a room of my own, so me and my mom are splitting one. Her boyfriend convinced her to put cameras around the house so she could control us, so my ""personal space"" is nonexistent. I cannot even lock the bathroom door when i shower. It has been a nightmare.

Today we got into a fight about me putting in the sink a glass if milk that was half drinked (it wasn't even mine). She  started calling me names and yelling and told me i was an egoistic asshole that does not think once about her. I know i tend to be egoistic but i try to help her as much as i can. This year is very important for my education: in 1 month i have an exam that determines the base of my whole education, a thing that i value A LOT. So i cannot help her as much as she would like but i try. I spend hours with the baby everyday, but she just ignores that and other things i do telling me that i do nothing. She used to say that i am not learning enough for my situation and when i do start learning she says that i stay at my desk all the time and do nothing. My sisters started taking advantage of her hatred for me. Whenever they want st that i will not grant them they go to mom, and she agrees with them just to spite me. (Example: i have a playstation 4 pro right beside the desk where i was doing my homework and my sister wanted to play fortnite. I said no because of the annoying sound of the fan. My mom yelled at me for not letting her play and let her play, despite always being annoyed by the same sound.)

So, am I the problem? I always considered that i was mature for my age and i never thought i was the problem. My friends' moms love me and everybody says i am a sweet kid. I really try my best, but its hard when i have my mum's nagging voice in the back of my head telling me i'm doing everything wrong. I have no one to go to. To talk to.

Also, what does a normal parent-child relationship look like? I tried searching the internet but i never got a clear image

881," 

Hello there, thanks in advance for helping me.

Ever  since I was a teenager, I've always suffered a lot because of my  stretch marks: I'm a guy, I've always weighed between 75-85 kilos, I'm  healthy, I didn't do anything to anyone...and yet I got tons of stretch  marks on all my joins during puberty because I grew up too fast.

They're  not bad or anything, they're your normal, common stretch marks (except  two which are kinda big: 0.5 cm large each, and a few cms long) but god  do I feel bad about them:

I'm 30  now, but they changed my life: I don't go to the beach anymore, I'm  scared of intense lights since they make them look awful, I don't go to  swimming pools even though I love swimming, I'm scared of showing my  body to people. I'd like to take photos of myself since I'm fit and  girls say I'm a handsome guy with a handsome face...but I can't, I'm  stuck with these feelings.

The  only thing I can do is to wait for science to help, but it's gonna take  years before the proper treatment comes out (tissue regeneration). Right  now, NOTHING works against stretch marks, nothing at all.

I've  been worried about girls rejecting me because of them for a very long  time, I'm scared shitless thinking that I could get rejected because of  my stretch marks, it would crush me.

I'm  on medication right now to calm this obsession I have with them,  because it's really making me suffer on a psychological level.

Until  we finally have a cure for what is, I know, a super common skin  condition, I have to learn to live with them, and I really need help  guys.

So please, I'll take any advice, thanks again.",02May2020,2
882,"I’ll make a long-story short by saying that a few nights ago, my friend, J, and I got into a fairly heated disagreement over FT. The fight didn’t seem like THAT big of a deal to me, and I thought we would go to bed and be okay the next day. When I texted him the next morning, asking if he wanted to talk about what had happened the night prior, he didn’t respond. I assumed he needed space, so I respected his wishes. I would’ve preferred some sort of heads up that he was not going to be communicating with me for awhile, but he owes me nothing- so I understood, albeit I was a bit hurt. A few days go by, and my other friend (22M) sees how much this situation is affecting me, and reaches out to J on my behalf, simply asking if he’s alright. J replies almost immediately, saying yes and that he just needs space from me. I was a bit confused because our fight was not that volatile, and nothing awful was done/said. It was just a strong disagreement over something super minor. Later that night, J reached out and apologized for ghosting me, rather than communicating that he needed some space. He said that during his time away, he was heavily debating on whether or not he wanted to continue our friendship and just didn’t know how to tell me that without hurting my feelings; although, he ultimately decided that he did want to continue our friendship. He said that in a perfect world his wants would equate to his needs. However, with our friendship, he wants us to remain close, but believes that he needs to put space between us, as we have super clashy personalities. He said that despite his rationality and head telling him to put distance between the two of us, his heart can’t help but miss me, leading him to proposing that we remain friends because “life is too short to faze someone out permanently, over a disagreement so temporary.” 

Since that though, something just feels off. Despite us being “friends” again, things just don’t feel the same. He has been a bit distant, and I cannot help but feel that we are both walking on eggshells around one another. I don’t know how to ask him what he is truly feeling because he is not a super emotional person, and already struggles with expressing his emotions; I don’t want to make him any more uncomfortable than he already has been. Him reaching out and conveying what he had been feeling this past week was super big of him, as is. I shouldn’t demand more than that. But it’s truly killing me. I miss our friendship so much. I wish we could just resume to how things were prior to that argument. Had I known that his thoughts/feelings towards me would change this drastically over something that minor, I would have never allowed the argument to progress. 

What do I? I know I should likely just let things progress and occur naturally, but my anxiety and heart are making it hard for me to just sit back and let this friendship crumble. Maybe I’m being dramatic and he is just taking his time getting back in the groove of our friendship. Any insight would help.


TL/DR- My male friend and I heatedly argued over something over a week ago. He stopped talking to me for a few days; during that time, he was considering cutting me off as a friend. But ultimately decided against doing so. He says he wants to remain friends, but something just feels super off between us now. Is our friendship doomed? What do I do?",02May2020,1

I open my eyes in my dream (similar to how you wake when you experience sleep paralysis where the room is accurate and you see everything how you would if you were truly awake) and I looked at my door to see a silhouette of a person peeking in. They had a gun and upon realizing that I had seen them- they charged at me screaming in another language with the gun in hand and ran to the couch. It was intensely vivid and seemed very real. I was petrified. The reason I don’t believe it’s SP is because I’m not paralyzed. I react and move and, in this case, coward in fear and cry as they approached the couch and stood over me with the gun. I watched them throw something behind me and I repeated that “I’m dreaming! I’m dreaming!” and I shot up, awake. I checked the time and it was 2am. So no more than an hour after I had initially decided to go to bed. Which leaves me to believe it wasn’t SP or a regular nightmare because I wouldn’t have been in a REM sleep yet. 

As I said, this has been happening to me ever since I was a little girl. It happens so often that I have become pretty good at recognizing them and can repeat that I’m dreaming until I wake up. But it doesn’t make it any less terrifying or feel any less real in the moment. I have pretty bad anxiety and these will send me into panic attacks and I won’t be able to return to sleep for hours afterwards. It’s becoming very scary and I have no idea what it even is or if I should be worried or get it checked out.",02May2020,2
887,"This is on a throwaway for obvious reasons. I don’t need anyone to tell me to get help or anything, I’ve already decided this is what’s best for me. 

Here’s a little backstory:
My parents have never actually loved me. They always say they do then turn around and beat me or tell me that I’m worth nothing to them and that they don’t care if they ever see me again or whatnot. I tried to graduate early. I was promised with freedom and the ability to leave the house as soon as I graduated. And now that it’s a week from graduation, they’ve taken that away from me. When I tried to bring it up they would tell me I’m lying and tell me that I’ll be locked in my room until I turn 18. I had a boyfriend that was a lot older than me. I loved him but because of his past girlfriends he always had trust issues and as a result, could never trust me. That’s why we broke up. My parents have drilled it into my head that I’m lazy, so much to the point where I’ve actually become how they see me. 

I’ve had pretty bad depression and anxiety since middle school. I tried to kill myself in 8th grade and every day since then I’ve regretted stopping halfway through it. 

My parents have explicitly told me today that they don’t care about me and they don’t care about seeing me. They told me that when I leave the house at 18 they will be happy that they won’t have to deal with me. 

I have no motivation to do anything in life, I don’t feel like I would be a productive member of society. I’m just a waste of oxygen. 

I guess I’m wondering, what would be the easiest and least painful way to end my life? I’m considering slitting my wrists but I know it would be pretty painful.

888,"A couple months back I met this woman while gaming who I hit it off with, and we eventually grew super close, but then she began acting distant and red flags began popping up...


One day, I did a reverse image search and found out that most of her pics belonged to an IG account with close to 100K followers...now, she always kept her life a secret (just told me that she worked out and was a hip hop dancer), so I actually ended up believing it, since the IG account is that of what appears to be a part time fitness/sportswear model (she sells clothes in her bio).

 When I confronted her tho, she got super defensive, deleted me off her friends list, and said ""See, my brothers were right about you. They knew you weren't trustworthy, and would flip out once you found my IG""...and yeah, I believed it and we moved past it, and eventually got close again.  95% of my calls either get ignored, or she has an excuse as to why she can't talk. She's half Korean and half Japanese btw, apparently, and is from Japan, but moved to NY, and lived in Miami for a short while before moving back to NY with her family (they have money like that). I asked her to video chat like 3x, and she ignored all my texts. However, she got her brother to speak to me (took him a couple weeks since he was busy), and that put my mind at ease. He basically explained what Asian parents are looking for, and to keep up what I'm doing (called me from her number).


When I first met her she told me to get Snapchat, but I'm not a big social media guy so I didn't. However, can pics be faked on there, as well? She used to send me pics when I asked (via text), but it seems like ever since I discovered the IG, she hasn't sent me anything, even though she apparently posts on SC all the time. She's been sending me pics without a problem by text for allll this time, but now there's an issue? It's been like 2 months since she sent me any pics. When I confronted her about it, she said ""I don't feel like sending pics out like that. It ain't my fault that you don't have SC"".

She also apparently 19, and works as a beta game tester, making $22/hour. She says she graduated school early and finished her last high school year in America, but her IG shows that she's been in Korea for like the past 3 years (so how could she have been in Miami and Korea at the same time? Why does she have a Florida phone number?).

I confronted her about it, asking her to hear me out and that her not sending pics or video calling me had me skeptical about everything, and her response was basically ""You already know what I look like, so I don't see the point of that. But I'll tell you what, if you don't believe I'm me, then stop talking to me. Simple.""


Now, her dad texted me a week ago from her phone, asking what's going on...and I asked him ""how could she have been in Miami and Korea at the same time?"", and he said that she doesn't give out her real location due to possible stalkers, and that the woman on IG is indeed her and that they've been in Korea. He said that her family uses the link in the IG's bio to sell clothes, and that I've been a horrible friend to her, and that I'm not cut out to date someone like her because I was asking for pics/video chat when we're not even a couple, as well as my frustrations in the past about her not giving enough to this friendship/relationship (she rarely asks how I'm doing or asks about my life), and to believe what she says or get tf on. And he also said ""You don't want to make an enemy out of my family.""

That aside, she has a lot of holes in her story. And even if what he said is true, then that would officially make her a liar, since she wasn't in Miami when we first met (she told me stories about being in Miami). And if she's really in Korea, then why when I asked her a couple nights back if she could talk she said that she couldn't because it was either ""meditation night"" or ""movie night"", which means she isn't in Korea because it would've been around noon time over there. Plus, we had convos in the past and my phone didn't get any outstanding charges (for neither incoming/outgoing calls, and I don't use Wi-Fi calling). Plus, the woman on IG's birthday is definitely in early August sometime, and hers is in early January, but she said that was just due to Koreans celebrating their b-day twice.

I didn't believe it and told him that if she doesn't video call me, I'm going to assume that she's a catfish, and haven't heard back anything since...Now, was I wrong for not believing her, especially after talking to her brother? Would things have been different if I downloaded Snapchat? And anytime I talked to her and we argued, I could hear the emotion and passion in her voice, so it seemed real. Plus, there were like 3 pics that didn't pop up when I reverse image searched them, so it seems like it could've been the truth.

Soooo...did I get catfished? Or did I throw away something good due to my gut feeling and not being patient? Was she an anomaly?",02May2020,1
889,"Hi all,

We've (M29 and F26) moved to a new house half a year ago and we do not know most of our neighbours yet. The one that lives next to us (M35+ approx) is building a sort of plastic roof held with wooden sticks in his backyard garden and although it blocks us sunlight during the last hours of the day, we do not really mind it. However, it seems that he likes to leave his leftover woods to us. I surprised him once in our front door next to the trash doing something with a hammer and a stick, I open the window and asked: ""are you ok?"". He grumbled a ""yeah"" and left leaving the stick there. I put it in his front door in the exact same place he did in ours. Today we've found a long piece of wood threw in our garden, we put it in his. It seems to us like he's just leaving us his work leftovers. I don't know how to approach him peacefully and successfully as I struggle managing my anger and this is really hitting my nerves (especially now with quarantine). 

I already went ballistic with our former upstairs neighbours told me to ""deal with it, newcomer"" after I repeatedly asked them to stop letting their kids run and jump from 6 a.m. to midnight. My burst of rage did work, but our relationship with them was horrible and I do not want the same now.

The amount of guilt I'm feeling is making me feel physically sick to my stomach. That's the worst feeling on earth to me, stomachaches.

903,"Not sure if this place is the best place to ask but I feel I'm done not letting out my thoughts and feelings at this point.

About me: 24 y.o, asian male, living in the Netherlands, raised in a broken family (parents divorced when I was a 4 y.o, age difference of 13 and 14 with my two brothers and me), broke all contact with my father and brothers since my 11th birthday in 2006, living with my mother since then. Diagnosed with grade IV brain tumor on the 3rd of Oct 2007, only being lucky enough for the braintumor to be encapsulated and having it removed one day (4th of Oct) before surgery date due to me already being in coma. Officially clean since Feb 2014. Only finished high school as I'm still looking at what I want to do with my life / what direction I want to take in terms of career path before picking a university of applied sciences. Got a part-time job for now but still looking for more work as I want to fill up my days with *something* if it's not following higher education.

From a young age I've experienced both physical and mental abuse by my father. I was always used as a tool to extract information from my mother so he could use it against her. It was a one-sided battle from my father's side. I was always 'interrogated' by my brothers if my father was cooking instead. Threatened to sleep outside during winter in the middle of the night if I didn't give my father certain information. My father and brothers always put emphasis on ""Family is number one. Family is the most important thing in life. Your family is priority."" but I never felt like I was being treated like a family member. My mother never forced me as it could make me target her as an abusive parent as well due to what I've had to experience with my father and brothers but here is what's bothering me personally.


The issue:

Due to my father and brothers (I think, is not officially recorded anywhere), my feeling of 'family' or a 'family-bond' has become so...broken(?) to the point that, whenever I'm feeling / receiving some kind of 'oppression' by my mother in whatever kind or form, my reactions tend to be *less normal*, if not *violent* (not necessarily physical abuse towards her but like slamming doors, stomping the stairs, etc). It's probably my way of dealing with my anger back when I was a teenager / young adolescent. Nowadays, whenever we clash against each other, I just mute myself and ignore her for a few days, weeks, or even months (happened thrice as of writing this).

While I did and do have normal days of life with my mother (since these clashes are merely moments, not every day life things), there is a part within me that wants to have a proper / healthy relationship with my mother (without me lashing out every time I'm feeling 'oppressed') and being a proper family member in house with her (doing house chores as currently it's taking me a lot of effort not to get angry whenever my mother tells me to do stuff). And then there is the part of me that wants to break all contact with every family member and living on my own, without contact with any family member out there.

One thing to note is that philosophy helped me get out of my depression back when I was a teenager. Never was I able to kill myself or even hurt myself with whatever object nor was I able to run away from home because at one night during winter when I tried running away after clashing with my mother, again:

""I don't care if people forget about me. But the memories, bonds, experiences I have and the people I've met, friends, doctors, teachers. I didn't want to lose or forget them. And my mother. The one person who helped me when I was young kid being abused by his father and brothers. The one who stayed beside me whenever I felt sad. The one who took care of me every time I needed to be taken care of.""

This is all me *inside* the house or whenever I'm with my mother. Outside of the house or whenever I'm with other (non-direct family related) people, I consider myself a person who wants to enjoy life to the fullest. Willing to help others if possible, granting a listening ear for those who need one, being all cheerful, laughing, trying to bring joy to people's life. Someone with a broad interest. Someone who is up for a challenge. Someone who doesn't mind learning new things.

I've already searched for help with psychotherapists but the help they gave me or knowledge they gave me were either:

- Things I already knew.
- Things I've already tried.
- Things that won't help me out.

We've also tried systemic therapy. Sadly enough it didn't help or improve the situation as most of the things we've done or did were things that were already happening (during normal/good days).

I've tried to get help from psychologists as I wondered maybe I'm suffering from PTSD when it comes to family members, or that I'm having a dual personality / being two minds in one body (I often refer to myself as having two minds: The grown up who is being just and rational, doing all the right things his mother taught him to be and using his father and brothers as an example of what *not* to become in the outside world but fighting back against any oppression / unjust done against him. And the vulnerable kid who seeks warmth, love, things any kid wants and needs being protected by the grown up me.) Sadly enough, I was never considered having a psychiatric / psychological problem because the me people see outside, is the grown up person who wants to enjoy life to the fullest (also probably doesn't help the situation at home between my mother and I always was normal whenever visiting the psychologist/psychotherapists).

I'm currently in a clash with my mother again (subject being something about family) so everything might be normal again tomorrow, a few days or maybe a few weeks. But I'm done keeping these thoughts to myself, experiencing this feeling by myself again. I don't know what I can do to improve the situation for her, me or both of us. Especially during corona time it's hard for me to look / get accepted for other jobs (especially since I'm 24 and no higher education means I'm considered to be too expensive) to gain more financial stability / independence in the case I want to move out (which I'm still thinking about since living alone / having place to myself feels lonely but I have yet to experience it). I also don't know what other types of help that could be useful for me.

In short: I'm at a loss. 

- It's not easy for me to find / get accepted for other jobs due to not having finished any type of higher education and being at the age of 24.
- I don't know what career path / higher education I wish to have / follow / strive for (I tried those tests to see what befits you best in terms of jobs but the tests were never specific enough to narrow down my interests and strenghts)
- I don't even know what other type of help I could possible look / ask for.

The two biggest interests I have right now is music production (if I had a stronger financial position, I'd be looking for a mentor / coach / class / course for music production as I've noticed that I'm not the type of person motivated enough to learn on my own. I require a (personal) teacher or a sparring partner to compare with / exxchange information/ideas with) or becoming a teacher (though the position of teachers here isn't really healthy in terms of salary vs workload and harder to do during corona right now).

Again, if this isn't the right place to ask / write this, please excuse me and help me find the proper place to do so.",02May2020,1

905,"On mobile so sorry if this is formatted weird!

I (17m) was accepted into a bunch of universities, but in the end it came down to choosing between the two most prestigious ones that I got into—both me and my parents agreed these were the two best options for me. Financially, they are identical in terms of the cost. My parents are separated but would both be putting money towards my education, so I would likely end up with some debt but nothing insurmountable. I was leaning strongly towards one of these schools because it’s in a city I have always wanted to live in and because it is significantly better for my major (think ranked #30 in the nation while the other one is ranked #150). It also offers a co-op program where I would be able to make some money before graduating.

My dad is an engulfing narcissist and decided that he hated the idea of me in the co-op program at this school because he wants to have financial control over me and me making money would threaten that authority he has over me. I explained that I wouldn’t have to do the co-op program if I went there but he wasn’t having it even though he had no arguments left to force me to go to the other school.

As many of you probably know, May 1st is “the day” for college decisions. Both of these schools had the deadline on May 1st but the school I really want to go to extended the deadline until May 14th for me due to issues with them giving me my financial aid information on time. So last night my dad kept trying to force me to go to the other school that I really don’t want to go to but I didn’t commit to it. He is furious.

Now, he is saying that he refuses for me to go to college at this amazing dream school. It costs 70k per year including room and board (ouch, I know) but so did the other school. 

He is now saying I have to choose between two other schools that we hadn’t even considered until this point because they have later deadlines: one is 50k per year and the other is 70k per year but they are LEAGUES behind the dream school that I want to go to.

If I go to the dream school, only my mom will be able to support me. They aren’t legally divorced so I can’t be an independent from my dad on the FAFSA so their combined income means I will never qualify for financial aid.

I know that lots of people have to pay for college themselves and don’t get any help from their parents, but I still feel shattered. My dad told me it was my choice and that they would support me financially by paying for school, wherever I chose, but when I made the choice he didn’t like he is saying me and my mom are on our own in paying for this. Also, my dad is really a textbook narcissist, and doesn’t listen to other people about anything. He is an abusive asshole. I would have been prepared for this if he had had this blowup months ago, but the day for college decisions has now passed and I am left with only three options: Paying for dream school with just my mom to help me, or going to the safety schools that cost 50k and 70k with the help of my abusive dad. If this had happened earlier I would have been able to choose a state school that gave me a really good deal (15k ish per year) but my parents didn’t want me to go there and now the opportunity is gone.

He is really a textbook narcissist and I am not exaggerating about that, although I didn’t really delve into it in this post. I am adding this in in case anyone here has experience dealing with engulfing narcissists.

So, reddit—I am desperate and the rug has been pulled out from under me. I am sorry if I sound spoiled or entitled but my vision of what the next four years will be like has been completely shattered. What should I do?

906,"So, years ago when my brother was 18 (hes 23) lived with my mother. He would sit on the roof with his friends in lawn chairs, and smoke weed. About a year ago, the roof started leaking little bit. Recently my brother admitted that it was probably his fault for sitting on it all those years, so my mom bought some shingles, so my brother could fix the roof. It kind if seemed like he knew what he was doing, but didnt. I just helped him. He just cut the bad piece of plywood out, and put another one in, nailed it down, and put a tarp over it, because it was gonna rain. When he was putting the new piece of plywood on, I noticed there was what I think was some mold on top of one of the trusses. I didnt tell him, because he has anger issues, and I didnt want to make him mad by worrying. So, I asked if he could bring it up the drill thr next day. He didnt ask why, he just dropped it off. The roof was leaking even worse the night before I think, and that was from my bothers doing. Anyways, i would feel bad for leaving what I thought was mold there, so i took it upon myself to take the tarp off, unscrew the board. Whipe the mold away, and screwed it back down.i couldnt get it perfectly flush with the roof for some reason. Maybe my brother had it like that too, because he screwed the 2×4 on underneath. I then put the tarp on. It took me a lot of effort to fit the board in the roof room I had to take a hammer and hammer it in until I fit, and I kind of scraped up the shingles in the process. I dont think that really ruined too much though. Anyway, my brother has had several chances to come up and finish, but he hasn't. Its leaking pretty bad. I had to out several pots up there to catch. Drops, and it was seeping through the drywall cieling. I'm not sure if me taking the board out, and back in made much of a difference, but I felt bad, so I called a roofing company 3 days ago. They said they would maybe call me the next day, so we could schedule an appointment for an estimate, but they havnt gotten back to me. Its raining pretty bad outside today, so there's no way they are coming today, and maybe they dont work on Saturday, but I'm gonna call them first thing on monday.

908,"Hey!
I don’t know what to do anymore... I’m in bad situation currently.. 
So a few months ago i become a huge fan of wrestling and boxing, i started to watch videos, play WWE 2K games, and just got interest about such things.. 
But then i realized that I want to become a wrester, i’ve never had any interest about sports, until now... I got jealous of other successful people such as - boxers, wrestlers... 
I really want to become a wrestler, but it seems impossible, i’m 18 years old, so it’s probably too late, and i’ve never tried any sports (only gym, running) In the past i had terrible videogame addiction, so i’ve never cared about sports, and such things.. But now i want to change my life and become a wrestler... Professional and Famous one... 
I can’t even sleep anymore because of this, i just want to cry - there’s no hope... I know i have to work hard, but first i want to know if there’s any chance for me to become a professional wrestler. I’m planning to start my practice on September, looking for good wrestling gym currently.. It’s not my fault that i had gaming addiction, i truly deserve to be in that wrestling ring... no matters what...
And my current weight is 120 lbs, and my height is 5’11” 

Can someone please give me some good advice, seriously i’m tired of this...",02May2020,1

Hey beautiful people. 

I (30m) live in Cape Town, South Africa. As some  might know our government has decided to ban the sale of cigarettes when lock down started (26 March we started with FULL lockdown). Our president told us during the month of April that on the 1st of May they are going to lighten some of the restrictions, with the sale of cigarettes being one of them. BUT, guess what. On the 29th of April they announced that they will not be allowing the sale of cigarettes from May 1st. 

The whole country (even the non-smokers) is furious at our government. Never, ever in the history of our country have they kept us people in mind when making these decisions. It is always to line their own pockets and the pockets of their cronies. Now this ban has NO scientific grounds and was purely done out of either spitefulness or some way to make money. AND we are the only country in the world that has this ban. 

So here is my issue. I have been smoking since 15, and I am now 30. I went from an average of 20 cigarettes per day, down to 5 per day, and now nothing. As I am typing this I haven’t had a cigarette in 34 hours. 

Experiencing the following atm: 

Craving nicotine 
Wanting to eat the whole time
Terrible mood swings
Restless hands
Irritation

I should also add I suffer from Bipolar and acute anxiety.  

Who of you has quit, that can give me some tips and pointers. I’m kind of losing my shit here. 

TL;DR Our AMAZING government is forcing me to stop smoking. Some tips would be great. 

Thank you!",02May2020,3

912,"We have a very sweet wonderful 3 and half year old Sharpei-Pitt Bull and our four boys (ages 15, 14, 12, and 11) adore her.  She is the best dog I have ever had, she loves her boys to peices.   18 months ago she was diagnosed with fungal pneumonia and was sick for two months.  We very nearly lost her.  She was so sick she lost a quarter of her body weight and had to be spoon feed liquified dog food.  We almost put her to sleep to save her from the pain and suffering but she was so young that we told the vet that as long as she had a chance we would fight for her.  And she won. 

 She's always had a little wheeze since then but the last couple weeks it was a little more pronounced,  and then a couple days ago she started to cough and so I made her an appointment for the vet.  I was afraid that she had a lung infection as she is a bit delicate and always would be.  Unfortunately when the x-rays and tests came back it showed that she has lung cancer and that it must be growing quickly considering how fast her symptoms came on.  The vet says there is nothing we can do but let her enjoy the time she has left, which may not be long before she starts to suffer.  How do I tell my boys?  We are so attached to this dog especially after watching her overcome such a terrible illness once.  How do you get children ready for this?",02May2020,1

914,"Throwaway account...

I'm from the US and have been living in Europe for almost three years. In that time, I haven't exactly made a lot of friends and my relationship with my family has faded. This is exacerbated by the pandemic and everyone having to stay home all the time. When everyone went into quarantine, I made an effort to try to contact my parents more often, but I still can't help but feel us drifting apart. And I don't really have any friends nearby who I can reach out to either. My family is small. I'm lucky to still have both my parents around and I have an older sister. They all live in the same state but rarely talk to each other. Meanwhile, my mental health is deteriorating and I'm falling into a deep depression. At this point, it feels like my family are the only ones who I can reach out to but even that feeling is starting to fade. 

I love living here in Europe. My job (elementary school teacher) is what gets me up every day. And perhaps most importantly, I have health insurance. If I move home I lose both, but I know I would be happier. 

So, I have to ask myself:

Do I risk getting myself and my family members sick? Should I wait until things improve? Is it worth dropping everything here and starting over back home? 

Any advice is much appreciated!",02May2020,1
915,"(both mid 20’s) So I met this guy on tinder we’ve been hanging out once a week for like a month now things are going good so far (he even brings up things like so “when we meet each other’s parents” so it’s sounding liek he wants to definitely stick around) and we just message each other on snapchat mostly sending bitmojis back and forth to each other in between when we don’t hangout lol because we really have nothing to talk about and idk why but when he doesn’t send anything back in like an hour or more I get this horrible gut feeling that something is going wrong and makes me so anxious even though I shouldn’t be over a stupid bitmoji message. And last night he sent a Bitmoji and I guess I didn’t notice it so I didn’t reply back till this morning. And it’s been 3 hours now and usually one of us will send a good morning message/bitmoji and then the other usually replies back but he hasn’t replied back still. But he does have his snapchat maps on and it says he hasn’t been on in two hours but when we was on after I sent that last Bitmoji this morning he didn’t reply back. 

Idk why but I’m so freaking nervous over something stupid like this but it just worries me and this is (not officially yet) my first time I’ve ever been this into someone let alone possibly in a relationship before and I just really don’t want to mess anything up. Ugh someone give me some advice about this what should I do? Should I message him or send another Bitmoji again to see if he replies or just wait and if he doesn’t reply should I say something later like is everything ok or whatever along those lines if he still didn’t say anything or what should I do I don’t wanna seem clingy either?",02May2020,1
916,"Me(24M) and my girlfriend(24F) are in a relationship for year and half now. We always have been serious and want to get married.

So there's a decision we need to make which will impact a lot of things in the future including our wedding, it's regarding her higher education. We either have to decide to go with a 5 year Law course vs a 2 year MBA course. Today, I wanted to have a discussion with her regarding this but I think I feel it came out wrong which put her off. I can wait for 5 years, I don't have a problem with it. The reason I say this is because she is very interested in law and I want her to take it, but she is confused, she says getting married late and having kids late is not a good idea, which I agree to. We will be 30 by the time she completes her law and that's late. So, we had the same discussion a couple of days ago where we were discussing it, I was supporting her decision to with law but she put all these points of wedding, having children, because if we decide to marry while is she is studying and if we have kids, then we won't be able to take care of kids. Sounded right to me. So we decided it will be a 2-year course, but she likes law and she's not able to get it off her mind. 

She is confused, but when I'm trying to take to her it's coming off as if I don't want her to take up law, but I want her to. I want to have this discussion with her and make her understand but that's leading to some misunderstanding. I'm ready to support her with whatever she likes. 

Guys please help!",02May2020,1
917," So I broke up with my ex a little over 2 months ago now. A couple weeks after I broke up with her I was on tinder. I matched with cute girl. We talked, and she said she just got dumped and I was trying to help her get over it. She asked if about my old relationship and I told her the reasons why I did what I did. She then asked to text my ex who I started talking to again because my friend liked her and told me she had some drama going on. So I asked her and she said yes, so I gave her my ex's snap. My ex then said the girl I matched with on tinder was calling her names. So I blocked her for about a week. In this time me and my ex were talking more and more, feelings were coming back, so I ended it cause I knew nothing could happen since we are now 300 miles apart. Some other stuff happened after I did that and she messaged me saying she wished I talked to her more and I said that I am not required to tell her anything. Now, while all of this is going on her and my friend are talking more and he's developing feelings for her. I asked her what she thought of him and she said she loves him like a good friend. She then says that shes coming up and asks if we can have s\*x one last time. I said I would think about it. When she came up we weren't talking to each other because I said I'm not required to tell her shit. She stays with my friends and she tells him she wants to cuddle and she lets him feel her boobs and other things. She then goes back cause her mom is pissed and she ghosts him. I then text her mom a week later cause my friend was worried. She finally responded. I then find out last night that not only is she fucking with my friends feelings but shes also the girl I matched with on tinder who had been fucking with both my friend and I for the past couple weeks by saying a bunch of stuff. And she blames it all on me playing with her feelings thinking I was faking it. 

How should I deal with her?

I don't know if I should be understanding and forgive her and just move on with my life, or stay mad and move on with my life.",02May2020,2
918,"I just graduated University after 4 years of insanity and I'm disappointed in myself and I'm not really sure what to do.

Background:

I'm a 26yo Canadian female. 

I started university on a high: I had amazing grades, I was on the rowing team, I had a healthy relationship, and I was happy. In September of my second year I fell off my bicycle and received a nasty concussion and broke some ribs. Because of this I obviously couldn't row anymore and struggle to sit in lecture hall seats with my messed up back. My grades dropped dramatically, I was depressed and my relationship fell apart. I barely got through that year with my sanity intact and grades above 50. I slowly recovered my grades though the summer and third year when I developed trigeminal neuralgia - and they got worse again. I had also put my trust in someone who ended up stalking and harassing me for an entire semester. It was chaos. In my final semester of school I actually did really well and all my grades were above 80 until the university closed and my everything got all weird. None of my courses had ever been offered online so no one knew what they were doing (students and professors). In 2 courses where I had previously been doing really well my final grade was 68. I was counting on 80s to help recover my  average so I could get into grad school or nursing school. My other grades were 88, 85 and 81.

Now with my mediocre average I'm never going to be able to move forward with my academic career, which wouldn't be nearly as crushing if I weren't 26. I told myself and my family that if I didn't get into grad school or nursing school I would join the airforce (family tradition). I think I would do really well in the military - I'm good at just plowing through everything without letting my emotions get to me. I love hard work, I'm athletic, well disciplined, and good at just doing things until they are done. But I'm a bit scared of how it would totally uptern my life - I watched how much the military broke someone I care about. Although with everything going on I'm in a place where I can't work, can't apply to grad programs or nursing school until December (which I likely won't get into), military applications take ages, and have no other prospects. I'm taking some summer courses to boost my average but I'm worried it won't be enough.

At least I graduated...

I have had such a strong focus on school and getting through it all with my mental health intact, I don't even know what I want at the end of it. I need advice; academic, career, spiritual, anything.

I don't even know what is out there.",02May2020,1
919,"I'm a little concerned about my mental health lately.

I can't explain it too well, and I don't know if this is a normal feeling for people sometimes, but I have just been feeling a lot more dumb than usual (sort of like a brain fog), and I've been doing ridiculously stupid things lately. Very minor, but noticeable stupid things throughout my day. And I'm very self-aware of it too.

For one, I've been listening and getting more into a lot of metal, rock, and punk the past 6 months or so (SOAD, Slipknot, Nirvana, Korn, The Ramones) to cope with a lot of stress, but also because I like it. I've been headbanging heavily to this stuff.

Secondly, I've been getting terrible rest because I can't sleep well. I'm usually in bed for 2 hours before I sleep, and I go through my days with migraines (I don't drink coffee or take anything addictive). It's affected my school and my ability to learn as well. I've noticed it's taken me a lot more to learn something new than I ever have. And I get bad neck pains too.

And last, it's affected my social interactions. I've stuttered and don't even know how to respond to what people say sometimes, and I just come off as an awkward clown. Even with my girlfriend. The charismatic and flirty guy she knew has slowly turned into a milquetoast dude, because that's my damage control for being the way I am lately. I even forget some things I knew about her, and it pisses me and her off.


((Tl;dr)): I think I got brain damage or something from a multitude of things, especially heavy headbanging, lack of social interactions, incredible stress. It sounds crazy but I don't feel like myself.

925,"I met this guy on Tinder during the Qurantine. We have virtual dates, we have meme wars, we have bonded over mental health issues, we are both left-wings, and we share similar hobbies/interests. He is sweet, supportive, easygoing, caring, empathetic(maybe a little too empathic but that makes me feel more protective of him), and very well-read. i have told him about the emotional abuse that I suffered and he expressed a desire to hold me and console me. I sent him an audioclip of me singing Selena‘s “Dreaming of You” and he said he was touched and that he would save it. I melt whenever I hear him call me “babe“ or his “beautiful princess“. I look forward to hearing from each day. Whenever I see him smile, I smile. Whenever he’s hurting, I wish to console him and take his pain away.

Today, I told him that I can’t picture myself ever having kids for multiple reasons and that I would have a hard time conceiving anyway since I have Turner Syndrome. I then proceeded to asked him how he pictures his future family and told me that he does eventually kids and that it was a dream of his to be a dad one day. I then asked him where we stood and he said that he still really likes me and still wants to continue the relationship. He even made a light joke saying, “And hey! Less chances of any accidents when we have fun!“ to which I giggled at.

But still....that got me thinking....I really really really like him (maybe even love him).....but still. Would I be wasting my time trying to pursue this guy long-term? I mean, if we’re on different pages in terms of family dynamics.....would that be fair to either one of us to stay together long-term when we could be looking for other people who are on the same page with this.

I had met this boy who was 15, I was 12. He introduced me to pretty nasty stuff and thought it was normal. He asked me to send him stuff, (I know him personally, we don’t go to the same school anymore and he sent stuff too, much more than I did) and I did. My face wasn’t in it. When I was 13, I blocked him. I felt weird talking to him, but other boys were involved. One of them asked me for pics in yoga pants and a bra, (he forced me), and other would as me for nudes, so I sent them pics in fully clothed yoga pants. I thought it was okay since they weren’t “nudes” but that’s clearly not true. I did it, my face wasn’t in those either. I got used to this and thought it was normal, so I continued to do it whether it was forced or not. 

(This was on Snapchat)

I am just now realizing that what I did it very illegal since I have matured, and I was wondering, can these photos be denied according to law? Can I just say that they’re not mine? Would charges be dismissed? There’s rlly no way of knowing I’m a minor either, and my account has been deactivated. Am I safe? What if bathroom tiles are visible in the pic, and another pic with my face in it has the same tiles? Is there even a chance I would be prosecuted?

This caused a huge fight which would have been traumatic enough in itself, but more and more secrets starting coming out. 

I found messages of him flirting with other girls on discord and I found questionable bank transactions. The biggest kicker was that I found out he has been academically suspended from his university. He has pretended to go to classes for the past 5 months in efforts to keep this a secret from me. I helped this man dress up for class presentations and looked over some of his more important assignments. It was all a lie. He wasn’t truthful about anything. He tried to lie his way through until the end even after begging him to just be honest with me.

I asked her to be honest and tell me if she really does like them, she answers no and that she buys BTS’s merch for a ‘joke’. She also writes bizarre fanfiction of them where Jimin is getting tormented by the other members, she uses degrading words and makes the other members bully him. I found it funny at first but then she started writing more and more incredibly well detailed abuse about Jimin and I’m starting to get a little concerned now. 

I don’t know what to think anymore? I don’t understand why she would be so passionate about something she hates. This is getting a bit too invasive for it to be just a joke, keeping in mind she owns a lot of bts merch and has spent more than me on them.

937,"TL;DR - Not committed to major. Do I stick with what’s safe and boring or change things from here?

The plan up to this point has been to major in IT. I’ve been attending a community college these past two years, taking general classes at a cheaper price, and plan on transferring to a four year to finish my degree. I recently got into school A (a tech school), near my home, and school B (not a tech school) across the state. I was planning on going to school A and rooming with a friend about 25 minutes from campus. This plan hasn’t panned out, however, and attending school A will require me to live at home, about 40 minutes from campus. None of this is a huge deal, but school A is a commuter school with no social presence. Again, not a dealbreaker, as living with my friend sounded fun enough. Having to now live at home though, on top of attending a dull school, I think I’ll lose my mind after having attended a quiet community college these past two years. I feel like wanting to experience traditional college is kind of selfish, though. I know I should suck it up, get this lame degree, and find a job. However, the option to go to school B does exist. It would mean changing my major, which isn’t earth shattering as I’m not really committed to it yet (have only taken general classes). This seems like such a big change though, as IT has always just been the default, I guess. Going to school B would let me live in a big and exciting city, away from my childhood home and parents (whom I love, but especially with this quarantine I’m going a bit crazy around). I missed out on a lot of high school, and it would be horrible honestly to not have any fun during college. I guess I’m just asking if making such a big change for these reasons is even rational, or if I just need to quit bitching.",02May2020,1

939,"I met a boy 3 years ago on holiday. We got on really well and he was actually the only boy i've ever felt deeply for but we were really young (13 and 14 at the time) and lost contact afterwards. I think we have and have always had very similar personalities and ambitions. About a year and a half ago we started talking again as friends and eventually it got to the point where I went to see him- he lives 4 hours away. 
I don't really remember what my intentions were in going but I know that I wasn't emotionally attached to him at this point and only considered him a friend/potential. He'd been complimenting me for ages on instagram and i'd started talking to a different boy at the time, and my friend pointed out to me that I should give the boy from the holiday a chance so I think I instigated that I see him as he'd mentioned it in passing a few times. When I saw him in person the feelings all immediately came rushing back to me and I don't know why but I felt really really comfortable with him. He's one of the few people that i've ever instantly got on with. After I went back home I held it in for a few days but then I told him that I liked him whilst really drunk and he seemed to.. accept it lol. I have constantly fluctuating self esteem so at this point I had no fear of rejection from him. 
I think the main reason that I liked him is because I hate where I live because of years of bullying in secondary school. He was kind of like a safe place for me and he was the first guy to treat me like an attractive human being rather than an object or joke. For a while he made me feel really special, and there would be short periods of time where he'd make me feel like shit- but he's a male, that's what they do. I went to his house a few months later and I basically lost my virginity to him. Maybe i'll regret it in the future but I don't really regret losing it to him because it was a good experience for me and I have nothing to compare it to lol. He was really really really sweet with me afterwards for that whole day and I was overwhelmed with emotion because i'd never felt like anyone could truly appreciate me like that. He kept referring to me as his 'girlfriend', whatever that meant to him lol, but at this point I knew for the first time in my life that someone actually cherished me. 
It was going fine afterwards and he was going to come to me in April but then coronavirus happened. It's really weird because he brought this up whilst at a wedding and he was being really nice and talking about relationships and stuff and mentioned that his parents know who I am or something (we're not serious at all so this surprised me because I don't really talk to my parents about him). Ever since the lockdown he's been really really distant with me. More than ever before. I don't think he's called me in a month, it's been me every time. There's been the occasional message from him but we don't really communicate through text fully. He's started making me feel like a burden and it's started mirroring the way that some boys treat me in school. 
I don't like him like this. This isn't my safe space anymore. The last time we spoke was Monday and I made myself look like a massive beg because I was drunk and I don't remember what we spoke about during the hour long conversation. Ever since then i've been spiralling a bit on social media because this lockdown is making me go insane and i've become hyper self aware of how people view me. I deleted all my socials off of my phone yesterday because I was making a tit of myself on twitter and wanted to stop obsessing by looking at my instagram and wondering what he thinks of me and waiting for a message. For all I know he's messaged me on insta but i'd rather not know because if he hasn't i'll be broken. 
At this point, if he's going to continue acting like this he's not the person I had feelings for and not worth the emotional torment. But at the same time it's scary because i'm scared i'll never meet anyone so similar to me or anyone who can be my safe space ever again. I do see a future with him but i'm only 17 so maybe i'm just being blinded by 'love' or whatever. I'm not attracted to anyone else, there is nobody else that I want or would even consider as a romantic prospect. It's all him and I don't know why he can't treat me with respect anymore. My friends constantly tell me that I 'could do better' but he's the only boy i've ever really had feelings for in my entire life. And i've fallen for him twice. I know that I should ask him where I stand, what he wants, if he's feeling it anymore etc but i'm terrified of losing him for good even though I know that if he doesn't respect me anymore then he'll do me more harm than good. It's really difficult for me because this has taken a massive toll on my self esteem. Before I thought of myself as an intelligent, attractive and mature woman but without his reassurance i've suddenly reverted to feeling like the girl who everybody hated in secondary school. I think this is because he's from a big city and i'm from a small town. We're both high achievers who want to go into politics so there's also that element of being 'above' my town... as awful and pretentious as that sounds. If he never contacts me ever again (i'm basically disappearing on him and leaving the ball in his court right now) or changes his behaviour I don't know how i'll cope because I don't go to Uni until next September and he's going this September. And if you're British and know about uni culture, you can imagine how horrible that would be for me unless I somehow magically found another perfect Southern boy or somehow committed to him. Anyway, if you took the time to read this i'm amazed.",02May2020,1
940,"Here's some back story.

I moved into this place in January. I saw an ad for a room for rent at a great price in a house with internet already paid for and I could use the kitchen and all that. It was a great deal! It still is! The landlord and I get along great! He lives here in the upstairs, and he rents the downstairs out to some people, and also the two rooms upstairs to me and we will call her Samantha. (Not her real name of course.)

I don't know Samantha very well. I know she's a bit of a hermit crab like myself, but overall any time I'd seen her she was nice and said hello back to me. Cut forward to a few weeks ago. Samantha asked me if I could help her upload some videos from her new video camera to the internet since she didn't have a PC and her phone didn't have enough space. Sure! Not a problem! We hang out for just over an hour, listen to some good music, she does have a good taste in music, and upload the files.

I felt like I got to know her a bit better through this exchange. Of course only talking to someone for an hour isn't enough to fully figure them out but I learned she has kids and a husband(But did not learn until later from my landlord that she has 4 kids, and she lost them all due to substance abuse.) Anyways... She's a nice person, and I am not judging her in any way.

The other day I went to the washroom. My bedroom door, hers, and my landlords are all right next to each other at the end of the hallway. As soon as I opened my door I smelled something I'd never smelled before and it smelled TERRIBLE. Like... Really fucking bad. The smell lingered the entire night. I had to hold my breath as I traversed from my room to the washroom and back! I said to my friend on Discord ""Dude I don't know what the fuck it is, but whatever Samantha is doing in there smells disgusting!""

First thing my friend said was ""Probably the hard shit."" which I didn't think anything of in that moment but at the same time it was like ""I wonder."" I smoke a lot of weed every day, but the hardest drug I've done is shrooms/acid. I've never fucked with meth, heroin, coke, or any of that hard hard shit.

Day 2 of the smell now... I wake up and go to the washroom. Again, just this disgusting smell. I truly hate that smell. I text my landlord ""I don't know what Samantha is doing in there but it smells nasty af!! lol"" .... He replies ... ""I think I know. Chat with me when I get home."" So I do. He gets home later that day and we share a joint over a solid conversation. Through the conversation I learned that my landlord himself used to be a junkie until he got his life figured out and that the smell I was smelling was indeed meth. I had a tiny feeling it was something hard when my Discord friend mentioned it. This is when I learned that she doesn't just ""have kids and a husband"" but that she has 4 kids, who were taken away from her by the husband because of her substance abuse.

She keeps a bag from Shopper's Drug Mart in the fridge with her methadone. Basically like going to a methadone clinic, but they let you take it home if you piss clean. I don't know if she's doing this just to abuse it, or to actually get the help she needs, so I have not said a word. It's really not my place right? But at the same time, she lives in the house I live in, and we've formed a small... Not friendship, but acquaintanceship between each other and I'm a pretty caring person. I don't want to see people take the wrong paths in life. I will never steer for them, but I have been known to help nudge them in the right direction once or twice in my lifetime.

Also, my landlord found a needle out back on the ground. He put it on the BBQ. When she went out to the sunroom(which is next to the outside BBQ) and came back inside, he said the needle was gone. So she could potentially be into some harder things too. My landlord has gone out and purchased an OD kit just in case.

Should I talk to her about this? We're connected through Facebook. If I WAS to contact her about it I think I would only say something along these lines... ""Hey. I know the smell that's coming from your room and I want you to know that I will never judge or tell you not to do something, but if you ever needed someone to chat with about things because I know you don't know ANYONE in this new town, you can always chat with me.""

Something simple, short, to the point, but that is also not judge-y or implying that I think they should change in any way. I don't know if I should do/say something like that. If I should do/say something else. Or if I should just do/say nothing... The problem with not doing or saying ANYTHING, is what if the problem gets worse because she doesn't know she DOES have someone she can chat with, or any other reason, and it gets worse, she ODs(which I definitely won't hear with my headphones on) and my Landlord and I now have to deal with this potential corpse in our house... Not something you want to come home from work to see...

What should I do???",02May2020,1
941,"This is probably a minor thing, but it does really upset me.

My view of the game is, you're supposed to begin your village/city/island from your first save file, and then build it up from scratch. Make mistakes along the way, or do something not entirely optimal, but it's fine, it's all part of the Animal Crossing experience. You have to really think about what you're doing.

So, in short, when I was getting a new account set up for my Switch and whatnot, I formatted my Switch, and ultimately my Animal Crossing save file was erased on there. At the time, I was only three days into it, and I did know at the time that I'd have to redo some of it, but that it should be okay.

Turns out, no. It didn't feel the same.

Trying to rebuild my island feels like I'm cheating the game in a way, because now I know what to expect. So I ended up looking for a better tent spot, and I got new villagers and fruit to work with, and I had to work my way through the tutorial. But, once I got back to the same spot, I felt like this wasn't the island I wanted, and that I should've just kept the first island. So, I got rid of this save file.

Since then, I've tried a few more save files, erasing them like within an hour for the same reason, like I'm trying to rekindle that same magic that I had with my first island. I know I should've kept the save, but at the time I had to format my Switch, and there was no way to cloud save it or anything. I ended up purchasing it digitally too, when I know that getting it physically probably would've allowed me to keep the island because it wouldn't be tied to an account.

So, now I'm at a point where I just want to forget the whole game and wait until the next one, and actually do it right that time. Yes, I know I could be waiting seven years, but I figure it would be worth it, as the next game could possibly be even better. But then again, I don't know.

I see people on Reddit all the time show off their islands that they made, and all the progress they've did, and it really makes me wish I could've kept my first island, because I would've been like a month into it by now. But, as of right now, I have no save on it, and the game is just on standby, waiting for it to get activated yet again.

I wanted to be a part of New Horizons, but my heart won't let me enjoy it anymore. My mind is constantly reminding me of how much I'm negating the experience, and I feel like I'm always rushing through the first days now and not letting things play out like they did on day one. I'm constantly watching the game's tutorial too, and I've been trying to skip it, so that's not a good thing to have on a game that involves getting attached to it...

So, did I ruin it for myself? Honestly, I just want someone to tell me ""yes"", and that I was dumb to erase it, so I can move on from it easier. At this point, I don't know if I'll ever get into the game, my heart won't let me. I just want to wait until the next game...

958,"Hi Reddit, I hope you’re all doing well and staying safe during these turbulent times. 

I have come here for some help, whether that be some tangible advice or at least feel like I have got some thing off my chest. 

As title suggests, I am 28 years old and have 3 younger brothers. They’re the “source” of my guilt. I am from a poor background, my mother has bipolar and out upbringing was not great for obvious reasons. I would often step up to help my mother when in need. I had big ambitions but a poor education, I flunked my GCSEs and only just got 5 at C grade. 

I struggled at college whilst working two jobs to help but to also ensure I had money to spend on my self. I still managed to get BBC in my chosen subjects.

I then attended university, getting a 2:1 in my undergraduate, then achieving a distinction for my masters in finance and economics. I am proud of my achievement. I had worked so hard to get that grade and have got a decent job which I enjoy.

But my word, I feel deeply guilty for it and almost ashamed. You see, my brothers are 25 and 22 (Twins) all 3 have worse grades than me at GCSE and no A levels. One of the twins is desperate for an apprenticeship, but the other twin just does not know what to do with their life. The 25 year old, well, me and him have major personality clashes because we seem so opposite to one another and yet, I feel like that is my fault. 

I persistently feel guilty for where I am, and I feel responsible for their situation. I don’t know how to shake this feeling, I just feel deeply troubled by it but I understand it is not my fault and I also feel ridiculous for feeling this way. So, how do I come to terms with it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you and stay safe.",02May2020,1
959,"This is a subject I pushed to the back of my mind for a while, but now I cannot stop thinking about it. Before I start delving into the specifics, there are things I need to say about my family. My actual Grandfather and my Grandmother were divorced, so she met my Step-Grandfather and got remarried. My actual Grandfather died in a motorcycle accident around when I was 5 or 6 (I think 2005-2006 range). My Step-Grandfather has two kids who are my step-aunt and step-uncle. On this side of the family I have one older cousin (daughter of the step-aunt), who is integral to all of this, and 3 younger cousins (daughter and son of the step-uncle and son of the step-aunt). I am VERY close to this side of my family (which is my mother’s side), and trust them with my life even though we are not blood-related. My step-grandfather is currently working at a chip mill and has been working for this chip mill for as long as I can remember. Their business is running extremely well. He also owns a farm that our family goes to quite often.

Now, it is time to begin with this whole setup. My older step-cousin is in college and she is extremely studious. She looked toward my step-grandfather for work to do over the summer. He let her work for the chip mill company alongside him for this time period. Now, Christmas rolls around and we are at his farm. My older step-cousin pulls me and my other younger guy step-cousin to the side. She apparently has been waiting to tell us this information for a long time.

My step-grandfather was in the Vietnam War. I knew this, as did everyone else in my family. However, this cousin then began to talk about her time at the chip mill. Everyone there apparently began to ask her random questions in secret about whether or not she knew anything about my step-grandfather and “Agent Orange”. If you don’t know, “Agent Orange” was an extremely strong chemical compound used by the United States military during the Vietnam War. Of course, my cousin knew nothing about it. She didn’t even know where they were pulling these questions from. This then led her back to do her research online.
She told us that, along with “Agent Orange”, there existed this plan of scientists who worked on the project to have their identities changed for the sake of them and their family’s safety. She came to the conclusion that our Grandfather (my step-grandfather) was a scientist that helped work on “Agent Orange” and had his whole identity changed as well as my step-aunt’s and step-uncle’s identity.

This may seem like absolute insanity, but - the more we pieced it together - the more it made sense. When my older step-cousin went back and asked my step-aunt and step-uncle about what the people at the chip mill were talking about, they either blew it off or completely shut it down. This wasn’t a “I don’t know” kind of thing. This was a “That is none of your concern” type of deal.

When my older step-cousin revealed all of this to us, it made us quite confused. I did not believe it, but we began to think. There are still gaps that haven’t been filled. For one: my step-grandfather’s ex-wife. No one in the family knows anything about her except my step-grandfather, step-aunt, and step-uncle. Quite literally no one else held any knowledge of her, and - when asking about her - they simply said nothing. They ignored it. This could be chopped up to a bad marriage, but their marriage seemed to align perfectly with when he was in the military. I was wondering if his military work cause the separation. 

There also exists the fact that none of us have ever heard him talk extensively about the military, nor does he have any military memorabilia. The only story that was ever told about his military life was told to me. He simply was talking about being stationed in Hawaii and how stunning it was there. That was all. He never talked about anything else regarding the war. This is also understandable because my grandfather on my dad’s side never talked about his time in the Korean War because of how much it scarred him. Out of respect, we don’t press for information about my step-grandfather’s war experience.

There also exists one more thing: my step-grandfather, step-aunt, and step-uncle have only ever talked about their EARLY early childhood and their time from having my cousins to now. Their is a huge gap of their life that is missing that they won’t talk about. My other step-aunts and step-uncles talk about their lives growing up freely, but these three do not.

This is all the information I can give at this time. I simply don’t have anymore information. I also do not wish to press my grandparents with questions to get information out of them. I feel that would be disrespectful. However, I do wish to find this all out because I want to know who my family truly is. It may be none of my business, but a lot of my cousins are now intrigued and concerned. This is why I have this on my mind. Now I’m down to the questions I need advice on.

1. How should I go about getting information without intruding on my family’s private life?
2. Should I ask the workers at the chip mill how they knew this?
3. Should I get my step-cousin to help with asking questions to the workers?
4. Is this something worth pursuing?
5. Is there another subreddit I should post this to?

However, I don't really know what's safest, or if it's just a flat out terrible idea. Here are my thoughts:

1. Make him something and send it by post. The outer box can be sterilised once it arrives and the inside shouldn't have been exposed to pathogens on transit. However, I'm a bad cook, and with delays in postage and stuff idk if it'll work lol.

2. Order him some desserts from a local bakery on justeat or something. They would arrive fresh and I could order things which are reheatable so he can burn the rona. However, less secure packaging and no knowledge on whether the chefs are taking self isolation/hygeine seriously.

3. Order him something which he won't like as much as food, but is safer. For example, a steam game (he already has the games he wants and has a huge backlog PLUS it's exam season so I feel like it'd be a better gift for after exams as he wouldn't even be able to play them?) or clothes (can put them immediately in the wash and disinfect and stuff, but tbh I don't think he'd exactly get excited by a t shirt).

4. Do a kinda IOU or belated surprise for when this is all over. Suck it up buttercup (at least for now)

I will say that his mum is really worried about germs and viruses and things and as he lives with her, I want to be respectful of her. He's pretty laid back about getting a delivery etc but she isn't.

Before I went up there today, I called a deputy to report my neighbor. He said since I dont have proof hes hitting his dog, then they wont do anything.

I went up to my neighbors to weedwack, and do some investigating. He brought his puppy out to show me. The first thing it did was jump up on me. I casually said ""this is what I did with my dog"" I turned around, and ignored the puppy. He said ""yeah, or just knew him or step on his hind paw.

I don't know if hes applying pain when stepping on his paw, or just holding it down. After that, I was talking about how good his puppies recall is. He said yeah, but sometimes you have to give em a slap across the head.

I straight up told him that I dont agree with that. He just said ""well, that's what a trainer told me"" (yeah, maybe 30 years ago). After that, I'm not 100% sure this is what her said. It might just be my mind making things up, but I think he said something like ""sometimes you have to give em a pain, or hurt slap"" maybe he said a ""shock slap"" o called the deputy with my new information.

She said ""well, some people can get defensive, and become violent, and I wouldnt want to tou to get hurt.

Am I doing the right thing by telling her? I dont want to be left out on group chats because she makes new ones without me to talk. I do like a good gossip but sometimes she takes it too far picking on people. What's your opinion of her?

 I do enjoy her presence but this popularity shes gaining shes becoming more mean and arrogant about how beautiful and 'unique' she is. Fair enough self-love but dont hate on everyone else. I dont know what to do because if we stop being friends then it will split our friend group. Without these arrogant comments and sly digs at my insecurities we get along fine. Shes so loved up with herself and has such a big following on social media that she thinks shes so amazing and just brings people down. 

Please give me any advice!",02May2020,1
964,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. I began dating a guy about 5 years ago, we will call him Jon. We hit it off but I think we were both in a point in our lives where we were lonely and needed a companion more than anything. At the time we met I was renting a house and he lived in a small little trailer down a dirt road with no heat or air. we both worked as detention officers at the time, making over $3000 a month due to overtime. 

Anyways, we dated for about 2 years and continually fought about shit (cleaning and dumb relationship shit). We figured out we weren’t compatible relationship wise so we nixed that and ended up staying friends. Fast forward 3 years later and we are still really good friends. Jon is a Marine veteran. He was in Iraq for multiple tours and was on the front lines. He killed people and almost was killed. He saw things I can’t even fathom (his mother told me about some of these things because he’d never tell me or talk about) 

He is on 70% disability from the military. After sitting down with a therapist for one session she set him up with 70% although I believe he needs more. He is on medications for depression and anxiety as well as PTSD. He still talks to a lot of his USMC buddies and stuff. He’s been great lately especially with the meds helping the stress of not having to work full time is gone. 

He seems to have taken a huge step back though. He had a manic episode (that’s what I’m calling it anyways) where he was exuberant and happy for a few days. Then a package didn’t get delivered that he’d been waiting on and he went BERSERK. punched the wall because the neighbors music was too loud. It’s been intense. We don’t live together but we live in 2 separate apartments in the same building. 

Anyways... I went up to check on him today. I straight asked him if he’s thought about killing himself. He said not seriously but it’s been on his mind so he asked if I’d take his guns, which I did. He’s already been on the VA website looking for therapy sessions. 

I guess my question is, how can I help? It’s exhausting and I have cried a few times already just thinking what he’s going through. I will always be there for him but I’m sitting here with a shotgun and a .22 on my couch, with my fucked up in the head Marine war veteran upstairs. Is there anything I should do? Should I give him space? Keep checking on him? Bring him food or groceries? Just looking for a little support. Thank you!",02May2020,1
965,"I asked my manager if I could work from home on Saturdays, and he said yes, so did the other manager. This was about a month and a half ago. Today the building owner decides he wants to come through and check doors. Ours was apparently unlocked. He called the big boss and tells him our front door is unlocked and the lights are off. I'm sitting at home when I get two calls, one from each manager telling me the door is unlocked and that I need to tell the boss that I was on lunch (this happened around 11:30 - 12, so it's plausible). I told them both I'd have no problem telling the boss I was at home. They insist on me lying to him and telling him I was at lunch. 

I drove my personal vehicle to work, as I have been doing on the weekends. This means they can't track my location. However, there are a multitude of cameras around the lot, there's no way he can't check to see if I was there.

I'd much rather not lie to the man. Also, I'd rather not get blamed for this when I cleared it through them. They were both ok with me working from home. What do you guys think?",02May2020,1
966," I need advice regarding my life plans. I am nearly 26\[M\] and I am an atheist in a country where it is not socially acceptable to be one. 

I knew long ago that if I am to have a somewhat normal social and romantic life then I would need to immigrate. I did not work hard enough to be good at my studies and my career in order to get a job abroad.

I have ADHD like symptoms and maladaptive daydreaming which makes any time I dedicate to studying worth nothing, I have not been able to fix this over the years. I had confronted this when I stayed home because of the virus and I managed to stop all forms of entertainment ,yet my productivity was minimal because every minute I spent studying was negated by 5 minutes of daydreams.

That lead me to think differently about my life, maybe what I need is a totally different career, one that does not conflict with my innate traits and abilities (or lack thereof), I thought I should try learning a trade, something that is in demand in countries open to immigration. The problem is that learning such a trade abroad would require much money that I am afraid to spend on something that I am not sure of, but without this idea I have no idea what to hope for in life.

I have been depressed for my entire adult hood and I don’t wish to keep going like this. I am also afraid of losing what little I have already, monetary safety from the money I have in the bank (my inheritance) and a full time job.",02May2020,1

968,"Bio: 19 M, formerly super soft guy, was at peace with everything in my life til recently.

Hi lads and lasses, does anyone know why I can be the nicest person ever at work, be decently mannered and helpful to the people around me to then turn into a soulless asshole to my girlfriend (which I really love) after?
Honestly I do often get frustrated at work and I feel like this is an influence on my behaviour towards her and anyone really, that I get in contact with after. Why is it that I know I'm being a huge douche but for some reason I get enjoyment out of it?? Normally I'd say it's a big nono for me to be disrespectful or hateful towards your loved ones to just do it myself when the wind's not in my back?

My gf and I have already spoken about this but every time it's like talking about it just pushes me further to just be more of dick until the point that she must cry and leave the room. It breaks me, honestly, yet I still do it.

Help, please, is all I can say. I don't suffer from any conditions apart from slight lazyness, unregulated sleep schedule (impossible with my job tbh) and sporadic drug use (mainly herbs, sometimes chemical).

If anyone could teach me how to overcome this fight I have with myself, please do tell. My relationship is possibly on the line and I think all of what I just told you would get amplified until the point of no return, if that were to happen.

I wish all of you much love and hopefully you're all safe and well.

Earlier this year the first serious relationship I was in ended quite abruptly (I was blind-sided and never really found out why things ended... and I really did love this person we were together just over a year)... and this job rejection has bought up the feelings I've been processing over this relationship break-up... and all that healing I did just has been reversed... it feels fresh now.

970,"Background: I am in a tight situation and need to find a rental asap. I've spent the last two weeks touring 20+ units, with proper safety precautions of course. Miami is weird because realtors will seek out renters and help you find a place because they receive half of your first months rent as commission. 

I have just been searching on my own for the most part and request tours on the units I find. Through this process, I've had multiple realtors show me a few units once they receive my initial request. Yesterday I had a guy show me three units. I want to apply to one. Today I had a different guy show me about 5 units. I want to apply to one.

I am seriously stressed because depending on where I get approved faster and any potential move-in specials the owners will consider I will be leaving one of the realtors hanging with not even a dime of commission. Should I let them both know I have applied to a separate unit and will be making a decision once I hear back from both? Should I just not say anything and deal with it once I find out the outcome of my applications?

F azi la 15:50 topic choice or writing style cause my academic writing is dry as shit

M azi la 15:50 both

F azi la 15:51 yeah, sorry, I had to choose something from the Regan Era, and well, liberal college, so... know my audience, essentially

M azi la 15:51 egh, I never thought you'd cuck out

F azi la 15:51 are you fucking serious?

This is where I made the mistake of assuming he was right leaning, since I remember he consistently praised Reagan in the past, I assumed he took and easy way out to get an A. As in, purposefully write against his own opinion in order to get a better grade. As in, being a cuck to your beliefs. That's how he explained it originally too, so I'm just confused, ""yeah, sorry, I had to choose something from the Regan Era, and well, liberal college, so...know my audience, essentially"" How does this statement not mean, ""I chose something from the Reagan Era, saw that my class was biased, and wrote towards the bias to get a better grade."" So I assumed that's what he did...am I in the wrong?

M azi la 15:52 tbh, I would have taken the F if it meant I spoke how I felt honestly. but that's up to you

F azi la 15:52 did you really? right, forgot, you're a fucking idiot why should I expect you to think and to understand that not everyone is a racist peice of shit like you don't even bother reading it if its going to make you think

M azi la 15:53 I may be an idiot, but I don't say I support or disregard something I don't like.

F azi la 15:54 thats the thing. I actually agree with what I wrote there we fucked them hard but no, I'm just a cuck fuck you man sorry, forgot you're just a boy pretending

M azi la 15:54 ok, that's fine, the way you described it sounded like you chose a topic that would be an easy A. my bad

F azi la 15:55 why do I even bother with you

M azi la 15:57 I'm not sure what you mean by that, I explained what I thought you meant and realized that you believe whole heartedly what you wrote. Earlier, the way you described it was that you didn't believe it entirely and felt that it was just an easy A. that's it.

F azi la 15:57 why do I even bother wasting my time on someone who'll just disregaurd me and my work the moment it doesn't agree with his narrow world view

M azi la 15:59 I didn't say I disregard it. I said I didn't think you would write against your feelings, thinking that you didn't believe what you wrote, because of the way you explained why you chose your topic. This has nothing to do with my racism. I legitimately thought you didn't believe in what you wrote. Because people do that, a lot of people. They'll choose a topic they don't believe in so they can get a better grade.

F azi la 15:59 so your gut reaction is to call the only person who has put up with you this long a cuck

M azi la 16:00 it's a way of saying that you went against your beliefs. I didn't mean you actually cuck. but now that I see you didn't go against your beliefs, I'll retract my statement

F azi la 16:01 what was the name of the shitbag you like again? the idiot who doesn't learn? A or something? the really unlikeable stupid one.

M azi la 16:01 B?

F azi la 16:01 that one why don't you tell him all your deep secrets and shit, because I'm done I'm done with your shit.

M azi la 16:04 well then...I'm not sure what to say, don't think I can say anything.

974,"well this is gonna sound weird but let me give some backstory. i pretty much grew up on the internet, and as a result i’ve cultivated a lot of relatively niche interests. the kind of stuff i’m into (arthouse film, experimental music, “alt” comedy, pretentious stuff like that) is not considered that weird in the internet circles i’m apart of - but i’m from a small rural canadian town and i’ve had a really hard time finding people who share my interests. 

i have a partner (24m) who is AMAZING and will listen to me ramble on for hours about my interests and lets me show him weird stuff, but doesn’t go out of his way to enjoy it. he shows interest because it’s important to me, but experimental music and movies aren’t necessarily his favorite thing. to be clear - i don’t need a romantic partner who shares every single one of my interests. my bf is the best man i’ve ever met and we already have a lot in common, so i’m fine with the dynamic we have, haha.

my issue is that i have no friends to hang out and bond over “weird” stuff with. i see my online friends find “irl” friends that share their interests and i’m always so confused as to how they do it. 

my tentative plan as of right now is to revamp my bumble profile to make it explicit that i’m on to meet friends (that isn’t uncommon right? that is an option on the app and i’m pretty sure i saw other people do that) and kinda lay out some of the stuff i’m into. OBVIOUSLY this won’t necessarily pan out for meeting people irl during the whole covid situation. (but who knows maybe i’ll meet people i wanna video chat with 🤷‍♀️) 

side note: in high school i pretty much lost the ability to make friends because of intense anxiety and depression. so if this sounds like an alien trying to figure out how to connect to humans, that’s because it pretty much is, lol.

TLDR: i want to make some real life friends who share my obscure interests but i’m kind of lost. tentative plan is to make a bumble profile for this purpose, to hopefully cast a wider net. do people do this?? would it work?? are there other ways??? tell me!!",02May2020,1

I apologise if this ends up being a bit too long, but I feel like getting this off my chest and seeing what people have to say will help me feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 20 years old, my girlfriend is also 20. We're british. We have been together for over a year now. We are madly in love and want to spend the rest of our lives together. Yesterday she told me she has been noticing weird things happening to her body which could also be very very early signs of pregnancy. I do not want a child at this point in my life, and she has always told me that she would not want a child at this part of our life too.

&amp;#x200B;

She is on a contraceptive implant called Nexplanon which is supposedly 99.9% effective, and she has been on this implant for 5 years. (It lasts 3 years. She had one already, and is now going into her 2nd year on the 2nd implant.) Around 5-6 weeks ago she started taking Citalopram for her anxiety (20mg/daily). She was getting similar side effects of the medicine such as feeling nauseous, loss of appetite, etc. 4-5 weeks ago she had her first period in around 1-2 years. We did not have sex at the time however her period was long (she said it was 10-14 days). 5-7 days after her period we had sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about 3-4 weeks since that time and since when we had sex. Yesterday she messaged me saying she has been feeling sick, her vagina bled very slightly, and that she's had cramps and felt sick in the morning. She has been feeling sick sometimes since taking Citalopram. She doesn't usually get periods because the implant almost completely stops them and has had them maybe 3-4 times total since being on the implant. The implant she has also causes periods to stop, or slow down, or be irregular. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has always told me in the case that she would actually be pregnant, that she would abort as she does not want a child under any circumstance right now, especially with everything going on and in the position she is in with her work, life etc. I therefore did not use a condom and she has always reassured me that she does not like condoms, and that she would not have a child ""no matter what""

&amp;#x200B;

When I spoke to her yesterday she said she is unsure and worried if she could be pregnant or not. She did a couple of those bullshit online pregnancy quizzes and read into it and thinks there's a chance she can be pregnant. I froze at the news and asked her, ""assuming you are actually pregnant, we can't have this child right?"" to which she said that now she's unsure and she's about 75% against having the kid (again, assuming she is pregnant.)  


She has not taken a pregnancy test yet. I'm going to see her tomorrow (May 3rd) and I'll get one for her so that we can find out the result.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit more about me; I struggled a lot in school with anxiety but always put it off and never confronted any of my worries. This is my first real relationship and my longest one. 4 months ago I was diagnosed with depression and put on 40mg of Fluoxetine daily . I have been feeling better since taking the medicine and have tried to have a more positive outlook on life. After she told me what could be happening, I have felt extremely stressed to the point where I actually thought about taking my own life if she is actually pregnant and decides not to abort. I'm extremely worried and I don't know what to think. I am happy to be with her but the stress of having a child would kill me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I know, the risk of having sex is the fact that my partner could be pregnant. But as I said she always calmed my worries about her being pregnant and does not like me using condoms, and I trust her and love her more than anything so I did not object. Yes I know, that ultimately the decision to keep or abort is hers (assuming she is pregnant) but I feel like I have a say in this as well. I'm extremely afraid that if this child turns out to be real, and she's actually pregnant, her and my life could be ruined and I feel like I could not love and bring up a child right now when we both have enough on our plates.

&amp;#x200B;

I probably missed some details out but please ask if anything. I just wanted to write this up to see what people have to say and for me to ""vent"". Again, I don't know anything for definite without doing the test yet but I am still really worried about the whole scenario. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR girlfriend and I are both 20, she is on a contraceptive implant with effectiveness of 99.9%.  We had sex and she could possibly be pregnant, she and I are not mentally or physically ready to have a child. She has never wanted a child at this age but assuming she has one, she isn't sure about aborting it. She hasn't done a pregnancy test yet.",02May2020,1

So the first guy we will call “Steve”, the second guy we will call “Anthony”. So I’ve been talking to Steve since February (we weren’t official yet). We really like each other. Well I said something in person that he didn’t like. Instead of talking about his feelings he decided to kind of distanced himself. Since quarantine started, he was ignoring me for hours. He would find an excuse not to talk on the phone. But he acted like nothing was wrong. So I’ve been going crazy because he’s the only thing on my mind. On top of everything I lost a lot of life changing opportunities because of quarantine. So I’m mad depressed and stressed, I haven’t been thinking straight. Anthony and I we’re friends. He came over my house one night to hangout with my brother. My brother kind of ditched him and then he started hanging out with me. After that night he asked if I wanted to hang out with him at his place. I say yes because I wanted to try acid with him in a safe environment with someone I trusted. After the trip me and him connected on a spiritual level. Once the trip died down I didn’t feel good. I had to stay the night with him, I couldnt drive. I slept in his bed because his couch was way too small. He kept checking on me, making sure I was doing good. For once in the past month I didn’t feel alone. Two days after that I went back to his house because I forgot some of my stuff there. We ended up fucking, which I wish I didn’t do because it made my life more complicated. Now I think Anthony thinks I’m “the one” for him. I can tell he’s obsessed with me. Which makes me feel terrible because I have feelings for Steve. Yesterday me and Steve finally talked it out and now we’re dating. I actually hate myself because I feel like I need to tell Steve what happened.

984,"i dont know where else to post this and i also need to vent. 

is it selfish of me to want to move out from my parents with my boyfriend even though i need their financial (and also emotional, mental) support? how do i tell them without making them feel bad or feel like they are being pushed away?

context: i (F21) am a student of medicine and i want to move together with my boyfriend of 4 years (he’s 22, also college student). 
it’s not that i dont want to live with my parents anymore, i love them and i’m so thankful for what they’ve been doing for me. i just feel like it’s time to be more responsible for myself and also i want to have my own space. i think it would be better for my mental health because there has been lot of tension in the household lately (due to some things which i have no control of) and i can’t concentrate properly.
but even though studying college is for free in my country (czech republic, yay!) i am still financially reliant on my parents since my studies take A LOT of time. i tried to have a part-time job last year, but i felt like i was going crazy because i didnt have time to study when i was at work or to work when i was studying, so i was very stressed out.  also i am physically ill (chrohn’s disease) so it’s more difficult and tyring for me to study AND work at the same time. 
i wouldn’t need much money from them, but i dont know how they would take it since it REALLY is easier for me right now to live with them, i dont have to worry about food etc. and i’m not complaining!
i just really love my boyfriend and it was always my dream to live with someone i love, make our own place etc. and now it’s the perfect time to start because everything is so slow and nothing is happening because of the coronavirus. 
i also kinda feel they are emotionally reliant on me (and i am on them). we have really good relationship, we talk almost about everything and i couldn’t wish for better  parents, so it would be hard for mě and for them to leave. 

(to make things clear: we would live in one of the apartments my boyfriend’s mother own, so we wouldn’t pay big ass rent)

so my question is: am i being selfish for wanting to move out even though my parents do everything to make my studies easier?  should i just wait for time when i’ll be able to make money for food and rent on my own? (in like 5 years lmao) 
is it just normal and healthy feeling of the urge to move out since i’m 21 and i should do it? am i ungrateful? 
AND: how do i make myself not feel guilty about wanting this?

thank you for any advice!

It's not an auto injector either, it's a proper pre filled syringe with a retractable needle. 

It doesn't even really hurt doing it, though I have had a phobia of needles since I was young where a student nurse couldnt find my veins and started wiggling this needle around in my arm all kind of angles and directions.

989,"So, i wasn’t really talkative person, I always only texted my friends, very rarely speaking to them; the dynamics between my best friend and I changed tho as she started calling me three-four times per week, beginning 6 months ago. I was going to lectures, she usually stays at home, she us unemployed, but I still found time to speak. We also went out 2 times per week. Then, I suddenly started preferring phone calls with her and it became my favourite thing to do. We began talking for 3-4 hours every day, now I was the one mostly initiating the phone calls. Since two months ago, during the virus lockdown, which is still on in our country, we continued with the talks, as we couldn’t and still can’t see each other.
Recently I noticed we spoke only for 1-2 hours max per day, for the past two weeks. Today she told me we can maybe limit it to 1 hour per day as she is getting headaches (her parents are constantly at home due to the virus as well). We still text all the time. However, what changed is I can see she is always online and gaming, on a game we both play. She however games nonstop. She found a new friend there and they are constantly chatting. 
So my question is, her saying we should talk no more than 1 hour per day now, is it a sign she doesn’t want to be my best friend anymore, and is sick of me? I asked if she is sure if there isn’t anything else, and she refused that there is. I know she stopped calling her other friends (calling them once a week, when she used to do so at least 3-4 times). Which means she still makes a lot of time for me.
It’s just difficult because, as I said, we used to speak for a lot longer and I feel like she is replacing me.

They talk on Discord for hours and she always talks about him. But some of the things she tells me about don't many any sense to me.

Here's everything I know about Fred He's apparently 29 years old (his job is a whole other thing entirely) and when he first met my friend he got her alone in a call and told her that he was the descendent of Romani gypsies and he asked for a picture of her palms. He said that she had a confidant (meaning me) and something else I cant remember. it was pretty general stuff. But she said she was in awe that he knew what he did.

She said that during their private conversations he would send photos and immediately remove them from the chat. He started asking her to do research on some boat that had something to do with his job. At first all he told her is that he worked in government and that he really needed her to do it because people were after him because of his job and thats why he needed her to do it. She asked him more questions and he said he would tell her everything after 6 months. She asked me what to do and I told her to ask more questions about his job and his real life friend who works with him. 

She spoke with his friend and he said that they both worked in government together. After this, he apologized for overstepping a boundary with her and so they continue to talk. She tells me that he did a tarot reading for her bf on discord and that he got a couple of things wrong. That was last night. This morning I found out they were talking all night and she said she found out a bit more about his job.

Fred apparently works in national security as a profiler...  and now she is being vague with me because 'he has a really dangerous situation' and she can't give me too much info. She says he has to go away for 9 months for his job and that she plans to email him. I'm worried my friend is either being played for a fool or getting dragged into something awful. (Also, its fair to note I've never spoken with him before so everything I know is from her)

Hi redditors, thank you for taking the time out to read this. 

So as the title says I feel very unwelcomed when I go to visit my adopted mother by her biological son.

Backstory: I was adopted my by Cousin (37F) when I was in the 2nd grade for purely financial reasons. If she adopted me I could get better healthcare as I was a very sick child and my Grandmother could not afford to pay for all of that out of pocket (and other little academic and financial reasons but you get the point. It is also important to note that I am from a third world country and not America as most redditors assume that everyone is from there, with my experience on this platform).

 My Mother and Father are completely out of the picture, but I lived in a pretty large household for most of my life, I lived with my 2 cousins (adopted mom and her son), 4 aunts and my Grandma, so most if my life I basically lived with my everyone. 

However, about a year ago my Cousin and her son moved to a different house about 10 mins away. She offered for me to come love with her, but I turned down the offer and opted to alternate between the two homes because I didn't want to be a burden, but when I go over there I am treated like one by her son.

Her son and I were pretty close growing up, we did everything together and now I am kinda taken aback from how he's been acting. When I go over there he never misses a chance to let me know that he likes when I'm not there because he doesn't like sharing his bed, I quickly adapted and respected his wishes and just sleep on the couch whenever I go over there to visit. 

But he finds more things to complain about to his mother about me. He tells her that when I'm there all their bills go up and their food finishes faster, when he tells her this it's kinda awkward for her because it is true but I get the feeling that she knows it's true, but she has never said anything on the matter and always makes me feel welcomed, it's just her son.

I visit her house every two weeks because my Grandma is not in the best financial situation and food is kinda scare there and I'm often times hungry when I'm there, my other 4 aunts are still kids so they rely on my Grandma. My living situation at my Grandma's is not ideal, I have no privacy or anything like that.

So, how can I deal with this? I really enjoy going to her place to get away from my reality and when I'm there I'm not really hungry. It just takes a huge toll on me mentally to feel like a burden.

TL;DR: I am told I'm a burden by my adopted brother when I visit my adopted Mom.",02May2020,1

Ive been making music for over 20 years, its the thing ive always been enjoying and i dont know what else i would like to do in life.

However... i have also been forced to do a lot of things i dont like to get a salary but always thought that's just part of life.

Recently, somehow, i feel ive kind of been stuck these past year or so, not progressing towards my goals. At the same time, I finally had an epiphany / a vision a few months ago what id like my plan to be and i felt excited for the first time in a while.

HOWEVER, now thanks to Covid19, i cannot do anything i looked forward to and now im forced to stay where i am but now, in addition to not being able to progress anywhere, i dont even get money doing boring gigs and nothing is certain.

I feel very anxious, totally unmotivated to make any type of music and it scares me so much. Ive always loved making music but now i feel dead inside and very exhausted. I dont know why......

Ive been with a therapist since 2017 just so you know but havent really felt this overwhelmed up until last week

Please, i need some words of encouragement because i feel i need the spark back. Should i force myself to make music despite all of this, should i take a break (im able to do that for a little while) and see how i feel or is this a sign i'm weak and should i quit?

TLDR: I (25F now) am struggling at times to deal with a past relationship because I never truly processed the inappropriate (abusive?) parts of it to the point where it makes me physically sick to think about it.

Now on to the longer story. I was in a (somewhat long-distance) relationship with an older woman around the time I was 16-17. I'm talking 16 years older than me. To give you an idea of it, we met through an online forum on a topic we were both into and talked for a long time before anything more happened. It took a long while to even disclose ages, but young me was very idealistic in the ""age is just a number"" -sense, to the point where I insisted that everything is totally fine because we are in love, so why wouldn't it be? She was struggling with a lot of issues such as incredibly low self-esteem, (undiagnosed) major depression, drinking as a coping mechanism, self-harm, still living with her parents, unfulfilling job, being religious and liking women, you name it. It was my first real relationship and the first time I had realised I was bisexual so in this time of self-discovery I was convinced everything was possible and that my love and complete commitment to her will make everything better and that I would give up anything for this relationship and would not let her down like others had before me.

The relationship ended after about one year and a half, after several episodes of my parents finding out, prohibiting any contact, me going behind their back with a burner phone, them finding out again, and finally them giving me an ultimatum that finally worked. I was in my last year of high school back then and did not want to give away their support for my future. It did damage the relationship with my parents for a long time, because it took me more than a year to realise they had been right and that the relationship had been toxic for me. However, even after realizing it, it was still thinking along the lines of: ""You were right that it was toxic but I wish you had let me realise that by myself without forcing me to end it. Good conclusion, bad process.""

When thinking back about it, I have never seen it as abusive, but more as me being terribly naive and idealistic to get into it. I always think sure, it was a mistake, but back then I thought I was in love so whatever that was (i guess infatuation?) it meant that I was all in. After all, I was choosing it. I was the one promising to never leave when my ex was telling me to leave her because she's worthless. I was the one who insisted I loved her when she was saying that nobody could ever love her. I was the one who cried for weeks after I had to cut all contact and even reached back for closure a year later, after I had moved to another for university, just to offer some closure (since I had gone directly no-contact after my parents' ultimatum).

Now I am not so sure anymore? I don't know how to feel about it and I don't understand why it still bothers me to this extent even though so many years have passed. I live in another country, my relationship with my parents is great, I am in a long-term relationship with the most amazing partner, I'm successful in my studies, everything is working out fantastically. 

The only problem is, from time to time, sometimes once or twice a week, otherwise not for a few months, something accidentally reminds me of my ex, which gives me a really weird feeling physically. It's a feeling of complete repulsion, like I might throw up, combined with a slight pressure in my chest area, lightheadedness and sometimes nausea. It has not gotten to a point where it negatively affects my everyday life, but it is definitely not pleasant. To give you an example, the first time it happened was over a year ago when I was running an experiment in the university lab. One of the participants looked very similar to my ex, which gave rise to the intense feelings of discomfort that I described and made it really difficult to spend the coming two hours running the experiment on her.

I can usually deal with it by just actively ""throwing"" it out of my mind but then I end up being bothered for a longer time simply because... Well, I am technically over it, so why is this bothering me so much to the point that I am getting horribly uncomfortable somatic symptoms?! 

Hence why I am posting here because I would really appreciate some advice from an objective person who has never heard this story before. Has anyone else ever experienced something similar? Do you have any tips on how to manage it? How to process everything so that it does not bother me to this extent?

Some final notes in case there are questions:
1. Not from/in the U.S.
2. I know therapy is the go-to solution but I cannot afford it right now since I'm still studying (and therapy here is only free for like really bad disorders).
3. I am however studying psychology so definitely have some access to knowledge on the subject and some tools through that. I think I somewhat understand it rationally. My bodily reaction is just not rational and it just makes me very confused.",02May2020,1

1011,"First, I want to provide brief context for the situation. I'm a 19 year old male and I've been in a loving relationship for the past two years with a girl I'll refer to as Sylvia. We've been very happy and run into almost no hiccups in our relationship for a long time. She's great, and she's always treated me nicely. It's been wonderful.

But I've also been, what I think is, in love with a girl since my freshman year of highschool five years ago. We'll call her Emily. I would describe it as a love at first sight experience. I fell for her immediately and I have wanted to be with her for so long, but I never got a chance to confess my feelings. She was always either in a relationship with someone else, or now I am of course.

What bothers me is I don't think I'm unhappy in my current relationship. Sylvia is wonderful to me all the time and I think I could be happy with her, but I have been feeling pulls to other things in life. Like being single, other girls, and very much Emily.

I'll host social events for all our friends just hoping Emily shows up. My heart flutters when I see her. I get exactly all stupid and nervous around Emily just how people describe it. I scroll through Emily's instagram looking for new posts or just to see pictures of her smile.

I would have chalked it up to a crush if this hadn't been going on for five years even with me actively trying to suppress it. I am fairly certain I love this girl.

But the problem is I'm not sure of a few things. I'm not sure Emily would ever love me. I'm not sure Emily and I would last. I hope so, because I'd literally give anything to this girl, I'm damn near obsessed with her. But most of all, what I fear is letting go of Sylvia.

If I break up with Sylvia and mess this up, I might lose the girl I really was meant to be with all along. Or what if I get with Emily, and wish I'd stayed with Sylvia?

What I'm afraid of simply put is this: Am I in love with Emily, and I should pursue true love? Or am I just feeling burnt out on my relationship with Sylvia, and I fantasize about Emily because she's new?

Essentially, the grass is always greener on the other side complex.

Please, any serious advice is welcome. I'm so desperate to solve this and so scared to confront Sylvia about how I feel.",02May2020,1

1018,"Sorry for the long post, but I have a lot to get off my chest...
Myself and my flatmate have been isolating since middle of march. She is high risk (many health problems) and she has to isolate for 12 weeks, and I am the only person she is able to interact with. It's been 6 weeks since we isolated, so another 6 to go.
When the lockdown was announced in our country, she let the guy she is seeing come over to our flat the day after, even though I had seen our mutual friends a week earlier and she had a serious problem with it as 'we aren't allowed to see anyone we don't live with and it's irresponsible', even though we werent under lockdown yet. I confronted her about him staying over and how she was being hypocritical. The next day he left and she said he wouldn't be coming back over. 

Cut to now, she has told me that the people he lives with have had coronavirus recently, yet she asked me if I would be okay with him coming over because she misses him. I told her straight up that I'm not comfortable with this, as he has been in close proximity with people who have had coronavirus and due to previous issues, me and this guy aren't exactly friends, therefore I'm not willing to risk my own health for this guy to come to the place I live. We only live in a small flat too so there isnt anywhere for me to distance myself while he's here. 
My flatmate said she understood what I was saying but he's 'been isolating anyway' so it's no risk if he comes over, even though I said I'm not comfortable with it and at first she said she would respect what decision I made. We left it for a while, but just the other day she told me that he will be coming over next week, because she can't go any more time without seeing him. I told her again that I'm not comfortable with it, not just because I'm not too fond of him, but because it's a risk to not only her health, but also mine, and it is also illegal for him to come over, as he doesn't live with us and they certainly won't be staying 6 feet apart while he's here. I suggested for her to just go for a walk with him and staying 6 feet apart but she ignored this and just continued about him coming over. 

The thing that annoys me the most is that she doesn't seem to realise that I also live here, she asked if I would be okay with it and when I truthfully said I'm not, she disregarded it and tried to convince me. 
If she lived alone, I wouldn't be bothered, I'm not trying to dictate what she does with her life, and if she chooses to risk her health or not but its not just her health she is putting at risk, its also mine, especially seeing as he has definitely been exposed to coronavirus. She is also high risk if she contracts the virus, so that's another reason why he should definitely not be coming round, as she has to isolate for at least 12 weeks and it's only been 6 since we went on lockdown. 

Im planning on leaving the flat if he does come over, as I'm not willing to risk my health for him, but I don't find it fair I have to leave the place I live. Also, it would make me extremely anxious while he was here and after he left, as I'm extremely scared about contracting the virus.

Am I the asshole for saying he can't come over? Or am I being reasonable?

I moved back home right at the start of it upon my parents request but being home has made my realize how much I cannot stand my family dynamic. I have an older brother (24) and a younger brother (18). My older brother and I who get along pretty well do most of the chores around the house (ie. yard work, cleaning) we usually do this stuff upon request with no arguing.

My older brother and I started to see this happening more and more and we have gotten pretty tired of seeing this happen. If we say something about it my parents will just tell us to be quiet and my younger brother will tell us that we are lazy and freeloading because we are older than him and currently living at home.

1032,"I'll  be the first one to say this sounds totally shitty. For anonymity's  sake, I (17M) will call my friend (17F) ""Emma"". Seems like a basic  enough name.

Backstory as short as  I can: I met Emma after I transferred to the orchestra she was in in  the second semester of our sophmore year, or January 2019. She had her  own friends and whenever I tried to talk to her she kinda was cold to  me. Still, by the end of the school year (May 2019) we talked a bit  every rehearsal to be considered friends, although never hung out or  texted. However, when I did get her number/social media we texted all  the time in this one weird one week period where we talked all the time,  like 7 hour call all the time. We had a lot of things in common and  enjoyed each other's company. Although we never hung out irl, the time  we spent texting and video calling more than made up for it. Everything  ended after we got into an argument at the end of the two weeks and she  blocked me on social media and removed my number. We didn't talk for  months after that.

When our  orchestra resumed in the autumn, she ignored my attempts to reconcile  when I approached her. I asked her if we could make things up, but she  refused. Nevertheless, we started talking again around Thanksgiving  after I found her number after being added to a group chat with her. I  apologized for our argument and asked if we could move forward. She  agreed and, although we never talked as often as that one week in the  summer, we texted every once and a while and called a couple times when  we were bored. We were never the best of friends, and in the rehearsals  we had after November we talked a little bit, or at least the regular  amount since we both had other friends there with us, but we were on  good terms. Our friendship was mostly carried out on texting and calling  since we have never gone to the same school.

Everything  was going well, especially after we started talking more often after  our rehearsals got cancelled a month and a half ago due to current  events. Since the middle of March, we've texted almost daily (most of  the time short convos and exchanges, but sometimes longer), video call  while doing hw, and every once and a while have long conversations about  random topics. However, things were different than originally. Instead  of our playful and teasing friendship back in the summertime, our  conversations were a bit more strained than usual. Although Emma had  always been open about her mental health issues (she has been diagnosed  with bipolar disorder and anxiety since before I met her), when we  started texting often recently, she's been a lot more candid about them.  She often flippantly says things like ""Oh I've been chilling, just  doing emo journalism and making suicide notes"" and other things related  to her pretty fucked up mental health. This combined with her pretty  messed up family life (her parents are divorced and while living with  her mom along with her two brothers, they have many financial issues)  give our conversations a consistent dark tone.

It  hasn't bothered me that much honestly. Although never to the extent as  her, I've had my time around the dark end with suicidal and depressive  episodes as well as mild anxiety. I've (thankfully) put those times  behind me, and many of the problems she faced/faces I've found my  solutions to through therapy, so I've tried to show her how I've  overcome my own problems. However, whenever I try to give her advice or  even simply try to console her, she explodes and says that she never  asked for any advice. Every time she mentions any of her mental health  problems (which is at least once a convo) and I try to help in any sort  of way, I get the same response. Logically, I've tried to stop, but  every time she brings them up, there's no response that won't get a  completely negative response from her other than changing the topic  completely.

Another thing that  makes talking to Emma difficult is that talking to her in general is  just walking on eggshells. I've already mentioned her mental health  issues, but many topics in general that we don't completely agree on  100% oftentimes end in a complete flare up on her part even if I tread  on the topic with the utmost caution. Even sometimes when I just ask  more about her music tastes, send her a meme (to be clear, memes without  any political or social connotations), talk about family, or just talk  about something I like for a while she gets defensive or annoyed.  Conversation with her are often just difficult in so many ways.

All  of this have made me think about just stopping talking to her more and  more. Of course if this was just how all of our conversations went I  would've never stopped talking to her in the first place. We have a lot  of things in common, most notably our, uh, niche political views and the  instrument we play together and whenever we do joke around and she  doesn't completely flame me for being lighthearted, we have great  moments. Most of the time that we do talk isn't that bad too, it's just  when she gets tense and defensive and miserable that my hands are tied  and I think about just stopping things before she seriously hurts me.

Part  of me says to just stop talking to her. I can talk to people that I  know much much less a lot more easily, I'm not obligated to go through  her intense mood swings and defensive attitudes, and the time I'm  investing in the relationship would manifest much better in any other  person. Another part of me says that it's cruel to stop now. She doesn't  have any friends at school and the others that she does have are not  that close to her and her only best friend moved to North Carolina so  I'm one of the few people that care about her or even want to talk to  her.

I really don't know but it's  kinda killing me Reddit. I simplified this a lot for brevity's sake but I  hope you have some nuggets of wisdom. Thanks in advance.",02May2020,1

Shes very energetic and strong, also a straight A student, shes always been the overachiever, while I'm just a loser and a loner.

1044,"This is kind of a long story, but I wanna make sure I get all the facts in. Also, I'm on mobile, and English is not my first language. 

A little more than 3 years ago, my neighbor got a divorce from her husband. Up until that point, I have not been aware of any abuse going on as I haven't heard anything like that from their apartment, and she hasn't mentioned anything. The day he moved out, things got physical to the point that I called the police and decided to try and intervene to hopefully just make him aware that there was a witness and he might stop(maybe a dumb decision, idk).
He stopped attacking her, after I yelled at him to stop, and then he turned around and punched me in the face and stomach and shouted ""stay out of this you dumb B****, or I'll f***ing kill you!"" and after that he ran away. I ended up with a black eye and 2 broken ribs, and neighbor ended up with a long list of injuries including broken arm, broken nose and severe concussion.


He was arrested and sent to prison for 3 years for the attack on me + minor drug charges. She refused to press charges or to testify against him. 


He got released from prison about a month ago, and 3 days ago he showed up at her door again. She didn't wanna let him in, so he broke down her door and attacked her with a crowbar. Police showed up pretty quickly after he broke down the door, because some neighbor had called them, and luckily(?) he only managed to hit her on her abdominal area twice before he ran. He didn't get arrested until nearly 12 hours after the attack, and the police was camped out in front of her apartment until he got caught, to make sure she was safe. When this happened I wasn't at home, so this was told by other neighbors and the police who contacted me, as they knew of my previous ""run in"" with the guy. 


Once again, she didn't want to press charges! And so, he's out of jail again. 


So now, I'm not sure what to do, if he decides to show up again. I know I'll call the police if he does, but should I just stay in my apartment if it happens again, or should I ""grow some balls"" and go yell at him? 
On one hand, I don't wanna put my life at risk, especially for someone who I don't think really cares (otherwise she would have pressed charges imo). On the other hand, I don't know if I could live with myself if something so bad happens to her, that she won't make it out of the situation alive....

1045,"ThrowRA account for obv reasons 

My boyfriend and I graduated undergrad in June (we’ve been together 3.5 years). I got into med school so I’m currently still a student. He got a job in July and he absolutely hates it. 

He doesn’t hate the job itself, he himself calls it his “dream job.” The problem is he hates the 8-5 work style. He constantly talks about how horrible it is that he has to work during the best part of the day and when he comes home there’s no time in the day. I tell him there’s plenty of time when he comes home to do stuff, but he just wants to smoke weed and tune out. The weekends are just as miserable because he’s anxious and just in a shitty mood. I’ve dealt with anxiety and understand how he feels but he refuses to go get help. 

Quarantine has been nice bc he can work from home and go do stuff during the day. His mental health has been much better. But he got the call Thursday that he’s going back to work Monday. Ever since then he’s been in a mood. Today he woke up in a mood, we went grocery shopping and he seemed fine, but after that he went into bed and won’t get up. When I ask him what’s wrong he just says “I’m not happy.” 

I am so passionate about the career I’m in and I cannot wait to graduate so I can get a job. We’ve talked about how in the future he’ll stay home with the kids and I’ll work. But now he just keeps saying “I can’t wait until you graduate and get a job so I don’t have to work anymore.” But there’s no guarantee that he’ll never have to work again in his life. Working is just apart of life, I understand why he hates it but I don’t think anyone loves it? 

Is this normal for someone to be so upset over work? I’ve talked to him about therapy before and he acts interested but then never acts. I’ve been so patient about this for so many months I’m just angered now. I feel like I care more about his mental health than he does.

1047,"Long story short: good friends, slept together twice after I broke up with my bf. We confessed our feelings for each other, but a relationshio was impossible. He said we’d stay friends but he moved abroad and he became more distant, while still being flirty and almost sexting. We agreed to Skype after my bday, but right before he drops the bomb that he has a serious gf since November and asks if it’s awkward (I think they live together). I say no, I’m not exactly single either because I’m trying to make things work again with my bf, so I wasn’t planning to take my clothes off. He then ghosted me. 

Questions:

1. Is a voice message the right option? I’m thinking it’s harder for his gf to snoop. I sent him a voice message in the past, so it’s not unusual.

2. Ghosting is so much not like him at all, he was always very open and direct to everyone, no matter how harsh the truth was. Does anyone have any clue why this change happened so suddenly? I mean it’s true he became more distant after he got a gf, while like I said still kinda sexting, but why would he ask me to Skype and then cut me off right before?

1049,"Last year, my I got a pair of really expensive headphones as a birthday gift, one that I had asked for a couple years back and was ecstatic I got. I love them; they are literally my most prized possession. In the last week of school right before lockdown, they stopped producing sound from one side. I was frustrated and scared to my core, dreading the cost of fixing such premium headphones. Also, the repair shop that fixes them is very far away from my home, so it would be a considerable journey to get them fixed. I looked the issue up, and it turns out it’s not an uncommon one with these headphones, so it’s probably fixable.

Then there’s my father. He is extremely easily ticked off and loses his cool at the slightest of things. The thing he hates the most is when something he buys breaks. He takes it as personal insult to him, as he says it’s like “throwing [his] hard-earned money away”, and he has a history of starting week-long fights with family members, including myself, all because a phone screen cracked, or because Windows became deactivated on someone’s laptop (seriously). 

This takes us to the present day. My father just got a job offer at new place, and his anxiety level is through the roof, as he wants to make a good impression in his newly found senior position. Meanwhile, he’s also stressed by *my* college-entrance exams, due early June, and he’s been in this heightened state of anxiety for basically since the beginning of the year.

So there's a girl that I met a while back (about two months ago) and we've talked off and on. She hasn't talked to me for the past few weeks except for when I told her that I thought she was ghosting me and she said that she was really busy and caught up in her own life. I know that even if I was extremely busy and caught up in things going on in my life, I would still make some time to talk to her.

1052,"I’ve been friends with this one guy for over 10 years. We’ve been really great friends and at some point we’ve tried dating once or twice. We broke up about 5 months ago but have kept a FWB type of relationship. I’m absolutely in love with him but I never let that get in the way of what we have going on or our friendship as well. Now whenever I think of Friends With Benefits, I don’t imagine them to be extremely affectionate. But he is, he kisses me on the forehead, cheek, or just out of the blue. He’s really affectionate with me in front of my family. Will hug me all the time, tries to be constantly near me. I’ve NEVER initiate sweet physical contact, HES always the first one to do it. He got sick at my house the other day and I took care of him. Whenever I was about get up and leave so he can rest, he grabs my arm and pulls me down to lay next to him so he can cuddle me. He holds my hand and hugs me from behind. He says sweet things and all this stuff that I don’t think FWB should do, or even normal friends. I can’t tell if this is just him doing what he thinks I want so he can continue sleeping with me, or if he still likes me but for some reason isn’t telling me. I’ve told him I don’t want him being sweet like that because it confuses me and my feelings. I know I shouldn’t reven be doing this whenever I love him, but I can control my feelings and I know Whenever the time comes for us to stop ill be fine. And I’ll be happy for him no matter what he ever chooses because above everything that him and I are going through we will always be friends first. So hang advice 😂",02May2020,1
1053,"Hi all - someone recommended I posted here about my unemployment situation as it's a bit unique. 

Basically in March I got a job at this brand new restaurant after already having been unemployed since I finished grad school in December. Then COVID came and I got really worried because I have asthma and an immuno-compromised family member who I need to be able to visit.

So I asked the manager what precautions we were taking (this was days before everything shut down in my state) and she said ""we're a new restaurant, we're not going to worry about it"" which I find sooo irresponsible but whatever. At this point in time other restaurants had begun taking social distancing measures.

I weighed my options and decided to quit because I'd rather be broke than dead from COVID or my loved one be very sick too. Then the restaurant shut down two days later.

So because I ""quit"" on my own terms, I was denied unemployment and have been denied every appeal. Everyone else who stayed those extra two days got unemployment because they were ""let go.""

The worst part is I had already worked a day and half before that and the restaurant owes me $150 they STILL have not paid. I've filed a wage claim with the state with no luck, but apparently those can take months to process. I have texted the manager numerous times saying I need to be paid for the hours I worked, but she blocked me (!) on social media and has ignore all my texts. I honestly can't believe how immature that is. 

Anyway, I am running out of options and have no money, no unemployment, and no way of getting the $150 they owe me which would really save my ass right about now. 

If anyone has any advice regarding what to do, please let me know. I'm getting desperate and am honestly still so so angry about this situation.",02May2020,1

1055,"I currently live in my house with my brother only, my parents moved countries a couple months back and were supportive and are not charging us any rent for the time being (I think because we expected to stay with them until graduating, but they have left before then). 

I graduate next year, my brother graduates two years later, I believe. I do not have a relationship with my brother nor do I wish to. It is very strained and I do not like him at all and do not want contact with him. This has been going on for the past 4 years, no end in sight. I don't want to reconcile. It was fine for the past few months but with this quarantine it has really become harder and has only escalated. We got into a big argument resulting in me leaving and staying at my boyfriend's.

I want to move out to get away from him as it has become very stressful being there (especially right now). I do have money saved up to be able to be good for a while and afford rent for maybe a year or so. I am continuing to work/receiving employer's insurance.

I know it is an issue between him and I, but right now I just don't think it's possible to bury the hatchet.

1058,"There is obviously a lot that I can't fit into a reddit post. A lot happens in 6 years. I will try to have all the important details here
  
- Met in 2014 in highschool band  
  
- Continued seeing eachother every day for the next 3 years. She's great and perfect blah blah blah everything I want  
  
- Because she was dating someone through highschool, I never developed true feeling because of that figurative wall  
  
- After highschool and they separated, we both went our separate ways, but still contacting eachother everyday through snapchat.  
  
- Over the next year, I reflected on her everyday. The bonding that we went through as friends had cemented eachother deeply in eachothers lives. I'm comfortable saying that I fell in love with her, and didn't know it until she went single.  
- November 2018 She got in a tinder relationship with someone, kind of hurt by this.  
- November 2019 I got in a tinder relationship with someone new. Really want it to work, very sweet person I'm willing to commit to.  
  
We've spoken very lightly about relationship prospects. I told her that ""I couldn't see why we wouldn't work together."" Her side is there are people that complicate that idea. She's right I guess, but in the end that's not our problem.  
The whole thing boiled down to ""I don't see you like that"", and I realized that the entire time knowing her, she will have her foot up at a certain distance saying ""this is as close as we ever get"".   
  
So, I plan on nuking this friendship. I have this girl, whom I fell in and out of love with. All that remains of this friendship are infrequent snapchats, and maybe see her a couple times a year to hang out and drink a bit. A *sliver* of what it use to be. Also remaining is a small ember for this girl that I still think would make a great relationship.  
  
I'm depressed by constantly being reminded of how distant we've become, the fact that I still carry this romantic deadweight, and cried myself to sleep wishing to have the old friendship back. I want to make a genuine attempt to move on (from this feeling, and to another person).  
  
I want to have some closure though. So many old friendships ended with a text, a call, or a handshake that you *didn't know would be your last*. I believe me and this girl are on the same path. I don't want that to happen, so I want to just end it as is, say ""We have no future with eachother"". Wish her the best, and remove her on snapchat and facebook and all that.  
  
Now, my question is...  
  
is this overreacting? I've done everything to show her my value as a relationship partner. If she doesn't want it, than my future won't include her. And we drift apart anyway. I just want some closure",02May2020,1
1059,"Studies have shown that when it comes to short-term attraction, women prefer to date arrogant, hypermasculine men with the dark triad personality traits.

Never heard the expression *""treat them like dirt and they stick like mud?""* That's because certain guys can get away with treating women like crap and they come back for more. For some reason, being a selfish, emotionally unavailable jerk is attractive to women. It creates a desire in women to prove themselves by transforming this badboy into boyfriend material. I've seen it happen time and time again. It almost always ends in tears, with women getting pumped and dumped, abused or trapped in toxic relationships, but like moths to flame they can't help it.

Dating studies have also shown that when it comes to rating male attractiveness, women consider 80% of men ""below average"". Most men will be able to attest to this. If you don't have male model goodlooks, women won't even notice your existence. That's why ""looksmaxxing"" techniques don't really make much of a difference if you aren't genetically blessed in the first place.

Of course, it's not ALL about looks. As I said, if you have superficial charm and a badboy persona you can attract women without being the bestlooking guy on the planet. Also, women (especially later in life) will look for a provider to settle down with, usually a beta-male to fund her preferred lifestyle. Generally, women are not physically or romantically attracted to guys like this, it's simply a marriage of convenience.",02May2020,1

1061,"I am a binge eater. I live with stubborn family members who do not allow me to cook in the kitchen, therefore I cannot cook myself healthy meals. The main cook in the house is absolutely awful, she burns half of the things she makes and under-seasons everything. In essence; inedible. I have stores of food in the fridge and pantry that I keep for the rest of the week because I know I won't be able to stomach eating her food. The other members of my house constantly pillage my designated food. I've tried notes, asking them to stop, and getting not so nice about it. One particular family member has even faked eating certain food items just to see me get upset and close to a breakdown. He thought it was hilarious. 

Having an eating disorder is seen as ""weakness"", so I haven't told them about it. Showing vulnerability of any kind is looked down upon and used against you. It sends me into rages, panic-binges, and bouts of food-hiding paranoia when they take from my designated food. This can't be good for my body and their toxic behavior is fueling my eating disorder. I am constantly paranoid about whether or not my food has been eaten, I stash food in hiding places, and I'm tired of the blatant disrespect. They know damn well that they shouldn't touch my food. They don't care and they think it's funny. I'm at my wits end, I feel like some day soon I'll have some sort of meltdown. I realize food is a weird thing to get so bothered over but that's what an eating disorder does, not to mention other things in my life that have caused me to want to reserve food.

1065,"So, for starters, I'm currently in a long distance relationship and have been for 3 months now, and all this time I obviously wasn't telling my mother, however, recently during yet another argument with her she ended up finding out about my sh scars, which I never wanted her to know of (she is possibly the main cause of my harming problem) which then followed up with a long conversation about my mental health, where I ended up lying (more like masking the truth) about my so called female ""friend"" whom I met on social media and have been talking to for around 2 months, and how she really helped me and explained to me what the root of a lot of my problems is and how I can try to deal with them before getting proper treatment (which I have been denied by my mother multiple times) and for anyone who might be wondering, no , I can't tell her that its actually my boyfriend we're talking about here, and not because she won't accept it, maybe mostly because the woman gives me zero to no privacy and right to my own personal time/space, and gets extremely mad and defensive when I ask her to leave me alone or let me have my room to myself, and in that case she wouldn't change her behavior even if I told her I have a boyfriend who I'm trying to spend time with. Going forward to yesterday (and technically today too) in the middle of a COMPLETELY UNRELATED ARGUMENT, she let her overly narcissistic side take over, called me a bitch because I spend ""more"" time with this ""friend"" of mine than her, and for obvious reasons because shes clearly a stuck up bitch, and today when I was trying to watch a movie with him and she kept going into my room, talking about crap I don't care about, while there's a person on call with me and we are watching something together, and when, after I let her do that for about 15 minutes and getting both of us pissed, I kindly tell her that I am watching something with my friend, her reply: oH i aM SO soRry fOR iNteRRuPtiNg yOu TWo, I cAnt eVEn ComE in TO Say anYthiNg nOw SinCE I Am bEInG So bOTheRSomE, fUck yOU stUcK up BRat"" and being a bitch to me yet again.

Since having the ""relationship conversation"", they've been much less invested. They'll go quiet for almost 24 hours with no explanation when they come back, or they'll hold conversation with short, apathetic responses. We used to have long, random conversations and now we're in a routine of topics. When I try to introduce new topics or jokes, they are usually shut down. I don't know if this is a part of our relationship settling down or if we're losing our spark. 

I realize that I don't really feel appreciated, though he has said on some occasions that he does appreciate me, and I trust him enough to believe him. The inconsistency and lack of interest in the things I do or say really hits hard though. I tried talking to him about it, and he said he was tired from work but was glad we were talking about it. There was never any talk of change though, and being the only one ever bringing up the issues makes me feel like maybe I'm too much in my head and I'm just expecting too much. I've never had a healthy long-term relationship, and I don't want my bad experiences to make me too guarded, but I also don't want to throw my instincts out the window. The bottom line is that our energies don't match up. I show interest in all that he does, giving in-depth responses when he talks about his goals and obstacles, and make him a priority even on my busy days. On his end, I'm the last on the to-do list, and while it's nice to be reliable, I feel like I deserve to be a priority on his end too.

She wants me to come but I decline and eventually tell her that their son raped me (i was 5-6 at the time).This guy also fucked his own sister infront of me and my cousin (he also made my cousin fucked her too). I think this messed up my view of women since i felt left put and 6 year old me became a pervert. Anyway, She calmly sites down then tells she knows and that my sister and my cousin have/might've been assaulted by him too. 

When I told her that we should press some sort of charge on him because he has baby with his wife she tells me that the family has dealt with it already and that God will deal him justice if he does anything rape-y again. We get into an argument and she tells me I'll be responsible for the deaths of any of their family members that die from the shock of finding out even though they most likely know about it. 

I tell her to leave me alone and she looks up in the sky and tells god she can't take it anymore. She goes to her room and cries like a gaint baby. My sister must of given her a great pep talk because she goes to their house and comes back and now she's laughing to some Steve Harvey skits in her room.

1087,"My mother is 42 and has self diagnosed herself with OCD, anxiety, depression, and a multitude of other mental issues. 

By self diagnosed, I mean I've asked her if she ever went to any mental health doctor and let herself be properly diagnosed, and she told me she hadn't- but she has taken a lot of quizzes online saying so. 

She thinks that because she likes her house to be clean (she doesn't clean. She makes my brother and I clean.) that means she's OCD.

 She claims that she struggles with anxiety but her ""anxiety"" and ""panic attacks"" are very selective. I.e, my dad will ask her if she can buy groceries and and she will start breathing very heavily and dramatically, and say that she can't because it makes her anxious and people give her panic attacks. But she doesn't have any problem shopping for herself or getting her nails done.

She is also always very eager to tell new people that she meets about all of these mental illnesses, and has a history of gatekeeping mental illness based on how serious she thinks it is.

I don't mean to try and gatekeep or tell others that they have to act a certain way or else they're taking their illness, but it all seems very faked.


Now that I'm done with the background, I'll move onto the issue.

I have reason to believe that I'm struggling with depression. I'm very creative and I have a lot of artistic hobbies, and I haven't had the motivation to keep up with any of it lately. I don't see the point in a lot of things anymore and it's very hard to shower and take care of myself. 

So I asked my mom if maybe I could see a therapist.

She went on to tell me that just because I saw that she has mental illnesses doesn't mean I can copy off of her and get an excuse to be lazy in life, and that I have no reason to be depressed about any of it. She forced me to sit in the living room while she brought up pages from her Facebook group stating that teenagers will fake illness for attention and she berated me for ""needing attention"".

I don't really know what to do here. 

I need help.",02May2020,1
1088,"Since I came back to my birth country I have lived with my grandfather and my grandmother ( who lives somewhere else) is the most generous person I know,  I woulnt be in college if it wasnt for her financial support. She makes a lot of money and is always helping the rest of the family when it comes to that. The problem is she is very similar to my mother and one of the reasons I left was my relationship with my mother... As generous she might be she also loves to be right in everything and correct all my behaviors she doesnt consider ladylike or whatever. I hate people correcting me all the time and repeating things over and over. Im very introverted and had to deal with bullying and toxic friendships through most of my childhood, because of that I went through depression two years ago, I fixed a lot of about me since then and feel a lot better but I am still prone to short depressive episodes. It doesnt help at all when she compares her academical achievements and apparently amazing abilities to me, significantly lowering my self esteem. She forgets many things she has said to me so I already know a ton of stuff about her just from her repeating it ( I understand that. Shes almost 80 years old). Also when I say that I already know it she mentions that there are things about her life shes never going to tell me and I dont get it ( why are you saying that then??).  Talking to her always ends in discussions with no end and sense and her hearing loss paired with my weak voice doesnt help at all. Most of the family actually has no courage to defy her word but I hate not being able to say my opinion in a conversation, most times I do that she says Im talking back to her. Because of that she has threatened me of slapping my face the next time I do it.  

These things happen every time I see her and I often loose my patience because of that. At the beginning I would shout at her, hit doors behind my back and the avoid her. Now I know this only makes things worse and do everything she asks me for, most of the answers to her are ""yes"" and ""ok"" but it still gives me a fucking headache. Ive started believing that understanding her and being a friend to her is impossible for me because she sees me as this antisocial hot headed brat, even though i try my best all the time. She calls my hobbies and behaviors childish and doesnt accept me as a young adult, more like a pre teen or something. I want to know how to be more patient with her and such because theres no changing her...

1092,"So our roommate has spent the last eight weeks on an elaborate beach vacation in California, despite the quarantine. She’s been taking a flight about every week or so, using public transit, going out every night to the beaches and stores, without a mask. She thinks this whole social distancing thing is insane. Hasn’t affected us, her roommates, who live in a different state. However, she’s moving out in a few weeks, because when our lease runs up she’ll be in Europe. So she’s coming back home to move all of her stuff to a new apt. Her options are either: we help her move and box all of her things, or she invites about ten friends over to our 500 sq/ft apt to help her move. We’re nervous about having someone who hasn’t been socially distancing in the apt, because one of our roommates has a history of lung issues. But we can’t exactly be like “don’t come here to move out”. We don’t have anywhere to go if she has a bunch of friends over, so the best option is to help her move so we only have 1 potential carrier in the apt at a time. But none of us have masks (she doesn’t care and myself and our third roommate haven’t left the apt in 8 weeks). And if we help her move we’ll all have to be in a confined space together for hours. I know I’m probably over reacting and she isn’t contagious, but how do I proceed? Our other roommate and I have been doing great at avoiding any social contact, so the idea of her tracking in god knows where puts me on edge. But we don’t have any other options. How best do we socially distance if she invites herself into our lives again?",02May2020,1

Today I went though my list of Snapchat friends and noticed I was friends with a girl that I haven't talked to at all or met before. We became Snapchat friends because she showed up on my quick add list back in November, so I added her and she added me back. That probably means we have some mutual Snapchat friends. However, we haven't had a single conversation or snapped each other at all.

1101,"I will not deny being hotheaded at times in the past. But for the most time, I can control my anger, unless I’m drinking (haven’t had more than a few cans over the past month). My ‘best friend’ has all but avoided me for the past 5 months. I have received a handful of emails from her (having lost i.e. deleted her number when I was angry and drunk one night), and although in these she has expressed that she has been feeling increasingly anti-social, and affirmed her valuing our friendship, I am left with a bubbling anger at times.

For the most part, I just rationalise and say ‘there’s nothing to be angry about. She hasn’t ended your friendship. She’s just taking some time to herself, to get better.’ I have offered her my support, saying a couple of times that I care for her and will listen to whatever she has to say. I’ve emailed her memes, recommended her music, videos etc. But I can’t shake this anger. My life hasn’t been all that great over these 5 months, and numerous times I would’ve killed to have a close friend to talk things over with. I can’t with her, as she can take over a week to reply, for whatever reason.

Even the idea of me having a go is hypothetical at this stage. In our weekly/fortnightly emails (which rarely span more than a few paragraphs), there’ll be a few minor points to discuss. I’m just trying to kill all this email business off, as I’m not bothered for being part-time friends with someone who makes close to no effort, and is never available in any capacity. If she does get to the point where she wants to text me again, so I can contact her easier and more frequently, I will find it very hard not to go ‘oh you want to talk now, do you? And we’re friends? Ah, right.’ Stuff like that. 

I get that a large amount of this is irrational. But I do feel I have a point to make to her, but I’m not sure exactly what it is, and how I should express it exactly.

I should add as disclaimers: 
1) We’re both in our late teens
2) Neither of us are employed - I’m a university student (19) and she’s just finishing compulsory education (18)",02May2020,1

I get a message from my father indicating that he's refunded my monthly rent and wants not a penny from me moving forward. I was taken aback by this because I had no idea what I had done to cause this. Next morning, I ask my mother what had happened and was told that I was behaving like I owned the house just because I had paid rent. They told me that I acted superior and started to behave arrogantly during family dinners. Another factor seems to be that I've mentioned the fact that I pay rent during some arguments, and they saw that as being ungrateful, which I totally understand and shouldn't have done.

1106,"Hello, I am needing some advice on my current living situation because I just moved to a very small town and it's making me feel small and inadequate in my relationship. 

So a little less than a year ago my boyfriend of 5 years and I moved to his hometown(Ill call him josh). We met in another state and eventually moved in together, we've had an apartment and a house in a big city together. A little over a year ago our landlord went a little crazy and we had to find somewhere else to live on very short notice. My boyfriends grandmother is going through alzheimers and started needing a care taker, so after talking to his parents about it my bfs mother told us she would help us get a house close to his grandmother if he could check on her twice a day and give her meds and make sure shes eating. His parents live in another state and his mom has a few years until she can retire and plans to move back to be closer to her mom, but we told her that until she can retire we will watch over grandma. Like I said we were in a bad situation and so we jumped on the opportunity. The house she helped us get is great, I really am grateful but it's been an adjustment to me because it is a very small town. My bf grew up here so hes fallen into place immediately but I am intimidated. Before my bf and I got together he was engaged to a girl here for years(let's call her sara). They were almost like a celebrity couple in this area because they were both big in the community and his ex fiance is like the town's sweetheart. There are people that still tell him they wish him and Sara would have worked out. Everyone loves her and knows her family very well, her dad is the mayor. Now he brought me back ""home"" and it's hard for me to feel comfortable because her presence is everywhere. I was previously driving an hour to work so I didn't meet many local people yet but accidentally totalled my car and had to find a job much closer now that we are sharing a vehicle. I work at a restaurant in town and it didnt take long for people to know who I am. One of my coworkers started introducing me to people in town and I know she doesnt mean to be rude, but she is introducing me as, ""this is carricriss, shes Sara's ex fiance's new girlfriend!!"" Ive noticed customers watching me at work after this, it's weirdly intriguing to people to try to figure me out as this strange girl Josh brought back to his hometown. I dont like it. Part of it makes me feel like everyone in town is already judging me and the other part deeply regrets coming here because I feel as though I'm shoving us in her face. We've already run into his ex, it's bound to happen again. Idk. I know this is probably dumb but it wouldnt phase me to run into an ex if we still lived in the state we met in but we literally moved to her small hometown where everyone gossips and idolizes her. We do plan to leave once his mom can retire but I need advice on how to get through the next couple years here. What do I say if her family comes into my restaurant? Do I avoid, should I hold my head high even though I'm in her ""territory""?",02May2020,1

I still called the cops, and got him on record though. Another time, this happened multiple times, but hasn't happened for over a year. He use to come to my house, because hes my moms friend with benefits, even though they dont talk much anymore. A couple of thos times he was obviously drunk. I'm not completely sure if had driven there, or if I just for some reason dodnt think drinking and driving were wrong at the time. Well, I'm going to be working at his house this summer doing yard work for a few days. If hes visibly drunk, and tried to drive off, I'll obviously try in stop him. I've just known so many people who drink, and drove, and it's so fuckinf stressful feeling with them. I really don't want to say anything, but feel like a bad person if I dont. I've been working at his house for the past 2 days, and he hasnt been drunk, so idk.",02May2020,1
1115,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I just remembered something kind of concerning from my childhood.

When I was young, maybe 12, my dad was interested in adopting an older daughter. I was kind of happy about this, bc I always wanted an older sister. He was on some website that showed pictures of adoptees and the girl was I think 16 or 17. He said that she would live in a different house separate from ours and he would go there and I forgot what he said but it was along the lines of caring for her and so I won’t be jealous. He said she would be old enough to have her own place. At the time I thought it was an interesting proposal bc I was only 12. But now that I think about it, I think it’s kind of weird? Is it weird?",02May2020,1
1116,"Okay, so I’ve had this friend which I’ve known since I was about three. We’ve gone to every school together, and basically have spent the whole time together and she’s made it both incredibly fun, and complete hell.
Sometimes she reminds me of a narcissist, in the way that she successfully uses her ‘charm’ to get what she wants and to belittle others (often me). A lot of people wonder why I haven’t stopped being her friend, but she’s good in the sense that I can trust her and she can be a lot of fun, when it suits her and when she needs someone. 
She’s always been ‘perfect’. Always the prettiest, always getting good grades without having to work hard. Eats shit but still has the perfect body. Great family, big expensive holidays all the time, nice house, nice pets, chill parents. She has everything, and has never really had any big issues. She has the ‘hottest’ boy in our year, and yet flirts with boys all the time, including an ex who she knows still likes her. A boy cheated on his girlfriend with her (who is close friends with us), and it kills me that I know and can’t tell her. When she told her boyfriend (they weren’t together at the time) she made it out like she did nothing wrong and basically victimised herself. Despite this, she’s never been majorly called out for any of this stuff she does. She knows exactly how to charm and manipulate people. All the teachers love her, she’s popular, all of the boys think she’s some kind of angel. 
I’ve helped her out in school many times, and she usually ends up getting similar grades, when I work non stop and she works hardly ever.
Please please please give me advice, as in September I will be jointing sixth form (college) at the same school as her, and she has such a toxic impact on my life, it’s getting unbearable. I know the best advice would be to stop being friends with her, however I can assure you this is so so so hard to do, I’m shy and bad at making new friends, and she’s pretty much the only person I’m close with starting at our school. I just don’t know what to do, I want to make a new start but I haven’t a clue how to stop her making me feel miserable all the time.",02May2020,1
1117,"We're teenagers that work together, I will ask her questions while we're working, like if she's seen a certain TV show or something. she will give me a normal length answer, for example, i asked her if she's seen a tv show, she said no, then later i asked her about another one, she said no and then said she's not too into tv shows but rather movies, and the conversation continued from there. But I'm always the one asking most of the questions, she never asks me anything. We're both pretty shy people and she's even more introverted than I am. Is this a sign of disinterest from her, or is that just her being introverted?",02May2020,1
1118,I've been talking to this girl for about a month now but she takes forever to reply. My friend set me up with her and we connected pretty much instantly and in the first 2 weeks we went on 4 to 6 dates and made out and cuddles everytime. My friend who set me up with her warned me that she takes forever to message back. I dont want to come off as obsessed so I wont message unless she messages first. We are supposed to kick it wednesday but what am I supposed to do when I go back home for the summer and cant connect her. Do some girls just not like texting or is this an usual case?,02May2020,1
1119,"*Trigger warning self harm*

So I (17f) have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was twelve and struggled a lot with cutting. I’ve seen multiple therapists as psychiatrists and I am currently on antidepressants. I used to be extremely suicidal to the point where I couldn’t be left home alone or close/lock any doors because my parents would suspect I was cutting myself or attempting suicide. Now, I’ve gotten help and I no longer want to commit suicide. But after a few years of being clean from cutting, I’ve recently started doing it again within the last month or two. I cut on my hips so my parents won’t see it, but I feel ashamed that I’m doing it again. it’s an addiction. Sometimes I feel like I want to tell my therapist, but because I’m a minor she would tell my parents. The main reason I can’t tell my parents is that they told me if they suspected I wasn’t doing well mentally, they won’t let me go away to my dream college in the fall. College is the only thing keeping me going so if they knew I was self harming again they would keep me home or possibly have me committed. I need someone’s advice. I’m not suicidal, I just love the feeling I get when I cut. Please help.",02May2020,1

Right now I am seeing this guy(22M) and I really don’t want to catch feelings until I know what he wants.

1123,"I was tormented all throughout secondary school. Called ugly routinely. I never even considered the possibility that I might be ugly until I went to secondary school. I always thought of myself as attractive, I still do sometimes although I fear that this is narcissism. In my instagram pictures, I think I look good. I don't manipulate my features or anything. Even on pictures taken by other people I don't see anything below average. What's wrong with me? I know that i'm ugly but I can't see it. But at the same time I know i'm pretty. It's such a head fuck. Is this dysmorphic disorder? Is it possible that, despite all the negative comments made about my appearance, that i'm not ugly? I'll spend days at a time thinking about every time i've ever been called ugly, blaming my social downfalls on being ugly. Not wanting to go outside because, even though I see an attractive girl in the mirror, deep down I know that i'm ugly and it hurts to even type that out. I'm delusional. I'm not superficial and I don't care if i'm not the pinnacle of beauty I just sometimes fear that i'm so unattractive that people can't look past it. And if I look over the way that i've been treat during life, it could very well be the case. But at the same time people have called me pretty, told me that I could model etc. But i've had very little male attention. And the insults have kept me up at night for years. I just want to know if i'm ugly so once I get the money I can correct it with surgery so that people can see me for who I am.",02May2020,1
1124,"Today I was at the store I work at, and after a crappy shift, I bought a couple liquor bottles and beer that my buddy requested at the self checkout register. The person there needed someone else to verify my age. I sorta spaced out because I was tired, and the employee who came to verify me got snappy and yelled at me for not having my ID out already. They probably thought they could get away with it since I worked there. I apologized sincerely and got it done. At that point I was shaky and paranoid about what was happening around me. I left the store and drove home feeling more terrible than I did before. 

This happens a lot with me. If anyone outside my family or friend circle scolds me, it’s like a stab in the heart and I don’t know how to respond half the time. I wish I could quit getting offended by things like this, but my mind can’t help it. Anybody ever had something like this? What can I do to deal with it?",02May2020,1

1128,"I need advice. I am the mother of 2 amazing boys. Some years back, one of my sons went missing. We continue to search for him, but years later, and the investigation has proceeded painfully slow. Hopefully my son will see justice, but i have very little control over what can be done regarding it, so the wait is unbearable. All we can do is try to raise awareness. However, since this is more of a personal question, i will refrain from putting his name here. Him going missing has taken a heavy toll on my mentality. I am currently seeing a therapist, and on medication, and have been for a little bit now. I live by myself. I feel like life would be so much better if he were around. I keep asking my other son to move in with me. I am very persistent about it, but i truly feel like it is urgent that he move in with me. He insists that it cant happen, and that he leads too busy of a life. I truly feel like i need him here with me though. What i want to ask, is, am i being selfish for constantly pushing him to move in with me, even though he insists he cant due to being so busy? Should i be looking at this different? Am i wrong for being so persistent? Or am i being sensible in my push to get him to be here with me? How would you act, if this were your mother, and you were in my sons shoes?

I'm noticing on some of these questions that I used to fully believe in myself and my goals and aiming high but right now, I feel less inspired in myself. Is this just a normal part of adulthood? I've been called Leslie Knope a lot but in the past semester or so, I've just been kind of apathetic about the future.

1132,"So we live in a multi acre farm and have a great pyrenees. She is a sweet girl but loves to wander and the neighbors have been complaining about her going on their property. We have plenty of room for her hear, acres of fenced in fields but that doesnt stop her. Neither do the fences, their isnt a fence on out property she cant climb (Pyes are great at climbing when they want to)

We have had pyres before but never got them to kick this habit and from what I understand this is normal behavior for them but that wont appease the neighbors. She has been fixed and is not aggressive but I cant blame the neighbors for getting nervious about a large strange dog on their property. So what is a good way to train her to remain on our property?

With the lock down on I have extra time to train but Im not sure how. I dont know what to do to encourage her not wander and we cant afford to try to upgrade our fencing, again we have about 14 acres. How would you train a dog who naturally wanders not to wander?  


Im willing to get creative but we dont have unlimited funds. It would cost thousands to upgrade out fencing and same for an electric fence. How would you train a dog not to wander?",02May2020,1
1133,"This just happened to me. I was asleep when I heard someone banging on my door. I wasn’t expecting anyone so I was really confused. I didn’t answer. I then heard a man say “no ones home.” Then they tried wiggling the door knob and trying to push my door open. That didn’t work so they tried going through a window. As soon as I heard them next to the window I dialed 911. A while after I heard moaning?? These people started to have sex on the side of my house. While I waited for the police, they finished and then used my hose to wash themselves off and then just left right before the police came.

I posted the incident in a group chat for my town and everyone’s telling me that calling the police was overkill and I should have went outside and said something. I’m a very small 19 year old girl. I have no self defense skills. I didn’t know what these people were going to do so I made a judgement call. What should you do during something like this? I live in a town where crime is pretty high so stuff like this isn’t rare and I just want to be prepared if there ever is a next time. Thank you guys.",02May2020,1
