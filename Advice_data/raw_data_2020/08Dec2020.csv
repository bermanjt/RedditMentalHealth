1,"So, there's this girl that I've liked for a while. She's absolutely perfect. Funny, sarcastic, ambitious, isn't awkward around anyone, super easy to talk to. So we have been friends for around six years now, but we only became really close around a year ago, which is when I started to like her. So we are very good friends and I want to tell her I like her. But here's the problem: she is super busy with air force academy and she even had her own etsy business that is surprisingly successful. So she has almost no time on her hands, and on top of that, her last boyfriend was a lying cheating cunt. And she said to me that she is not gonna date anyone for a while. But some of my other friends told me she was teasing me and actually wants me to ask her out. I'm 15 and confused. Plz help! Thank you for taking the time to read this.",08Dec2020,1

4," Could really use some advice from anyone who has been through anything like this, and a better perspective. Dont judge me please, love makes us so blind. I was with a woman for almost 2 years on and off, and it ended up being more toxic than I ever imagined. Before we were official, she was my date for dinner and the bar, and she ended up grinding on some other dude. Months later, I forgave her, talked more and became official. Keep in mind, she has a baby from her ex, who is abusive and she said he raped her. Throughout the relationship, alot of red flags occurred that made me feel unsafe in the relationship, though she has done good for me as well and my kid too, it was more bad than good. From false promises, saying never to break up, but she left first, to telling me her love wasnt the same, making me feel my attention wasnt enough, always bringing her abusive ex up and admits that she knows I dont like it, to other men and their attention, and attention on social media. Alot more, but yea. She wanted my phone when I never did anything shady, and was so adamant on me seeing hers, but she asked for my phone out of random, and then offers hers. She compared me to her ex when I know Im nowhere bad as that guy. She became pregnant, we tried to work it out, she suckered me back in everytime, says nice thing here, degrade me the next. I left the relationship but of course not the baby. Until not even weeks after I ended it, she sleeps back with the SAME MAN that she said raped her. Everything changed, I definitely questioned if its my kid, I know women who have been hurt like that and wouldnt ever look in that person's direction, let alone sleep with them. She went wild when I asked for a paternity test, called me so many terrible names and degraded me. Is it wrong that Im questioning if the baby is mine? to feel like the relationship was a whole lie? That she was deflecting most of the relationship? Because she told me from the start that she would never ever go back or do anything, and had a whole domestic violence order that she violated when she slept with him. Sold it as a ""mistake"" then tells me ""well I never said I wouldnt sleep with him if we werent together"" and told me it was easy. How would any of you handle that? She even had a scare that she was in labor but false alarm, and told all of social media, but not me....",08Dec2020,1

I’m absolutely terrible at reaching out so I take part of the blame, but they knew something was up and we even talked about it, but they haven’t checked in or anything, something I know for a fact I would do (and have done) if it was the other way around.

10,"I (15M) I'm typing this asking you guys what should my mom and I do? My mom (34F) and her friend, who I will call R (for obvious reasons) took a dog 3 hours away to what they thought was a good home for her. The dog was for free as well. Some information you should know the dog was a coonhound. They're not cheap. Mom and R were doing something good by taking time out of their day to drive from my hometown all the way to Oregon. The people who got the dog acted very kindly and they thought that was the end of that. But apparently a week or two later, my mom got an update from R. Apparently that same night that they bought the dog, they chained her outside for the night and the neighbors called the cops on them. According to my mom, the people got a ticket and R called these people out for selling the dog for $300. Mom and I were shocked when we heard the news. I will give you guys an update if there is any. I just want advice on what we can do.",08Dec2020,1
11,"I’ll keep the context private because then you’ll be biased (though I am myself) and I need honest advice.

Basically, someone I know sent me a phone screen recording where she shows that my girlfriend sent her a rude message on Instagram. She shows the app, the profile, even replies to her message while recording. She has other screenshots where she claims my girlfriend did some innocent stalking, like visiting her LinkedIn profile or sent and unsent messages on Facebook.

Now, the LinkedIn and Facebook stuff is true apparently. The message she sent “live” appears on my girlfriend’s phone. But she claims she didn’t send any text, let alone a rude text, nothing from her side appears, and she hasn’t even searched for this person recently.

1. Is it possible that this person faked the whole video recording?
2. Is my girlfriend lying and she just deleted the message/history? 

The recording seems legit and that person contacted me because she was creeped out. She is not the kind of person that lies. But I trust my girlfriend even if she was jealous of this person, I don’t think she’d write her something rude.",08Dec2020,1
12,"I just recently caught myself realizing i don't really care about life or death, i'm not suicidal, sometimes sad about all aspects of life (politics, friends, ex's, family, etc...) but not suicidal. I just dont want to be here, on this planet, with these people anymore. My closest friend on this planet has been showing me the brighter, more spiritual aspects of living for the past few years and, for a time, it as working. But lately i've just kind of lost all of it. I can't feel emotions for anything except my cats (my sons) I've seen people in bad situations and just cant summon the energy to care. I've become a shell when, for the past few years of my (enlightment) I've been trying to help others avoid the same fate. Typing this up i realized the irony of it all, again, not feeling suicidal just want to know if anybody has found better ways to cope with this ""fuck this physical manifestation i just want to move past the restraints."" type of feeling. Its been creeping up more and more lately, i could be having the best time of my life and immediately find myself thinking ""oh this wont matter tomorrow when you wake up and the fun is over."" also, i've become extremely misanthropic, i cant even trust my roommates, even though i would consider them ""close friends.""

23,"So, interesting story regarding this one. As a kid (I’m guessing I was 14-15 at the time?) I was really into frontflips. I’d do them on the trampoline, on the grass, even on tarmac. However after trying to learn how to backflip and unfortunately coming across a few unsettling videos of people trying to perform a backflip and landing on their head (thus, breaking their neck) i’ve lost the ability to perform a frontflip on anything other than a trampoline or my bed. Attempting it on the ground sends my body into shock for a few moments (keep in mind I use the exact same technique) and my head tucks down and my legs go up, just to land back down on my feet without being able to turn my body mid-air. Is something the matter with me? Is this my survival instinct kicking in after seeing that upsetting content? Will I ever be able to frontflip on hard surfaces again? All and any advice or clarification would be much appreciated, it’s just so odd to me. Thanks :)",08Dec2020,1

25,"Tw: self harm, sexual assault 

Hi, okay so I don't really know what I'm asking for advice on specifically a part of me feels like I'm just crazy and everything is pointless and I'm stressed I have exams coming up soon and I can't concentrate or focus on anything and I keep almost reliving a memory and it's horrible my body goes all shaky and it's hard to breathe and I don't know how to stop it

When I was a 8 my parents went away on some trip and left with a family friend who did things to me and it bothers a lot now but I didn't realise how much it bothered someone reached out to me and started to tell me about their experiences when they were older and then the conversation turned to bad coping mechanisms and I realised that's what I've been doing for a big part of my life like drugs and alcohol and I've been cutting for nearly 2 years now.


Another way I copied which was probably the most counter productive was sleeping with older men and letting them do whatever they wanted to me which has just left me with more bad memories. I know it's an obvious solution just stop but I feel like I'll just lose control if I do and people would probably say go therapy but I can't tell my parents that I'm too embarrassed and they wouldn't understand. 

There are people out there that need therapy more than me but a part of me just wants a diagnosis so I can have an excuse it's really selfish I know but it feels like it would be reassuring. Any advice. Thank you x.",08Dec2020,1

28,"Hey guys, yesterday was my birthday and on Saturday, the day before my birthday, I was very clear with my parents that I wanted to go on a (relative) cut beginning on my birthday. We argued about it a little bit but I put my foot down and I thought that they'd respect my decision. 

Then, yesterday, despite this conversation and knowing how I felt about their buying me unhealthy food on the day I had planned for the last two weeks I would begin cutting, they decided to go all out and order sushi (not the healthy Japanese kind, I mean the deep fried American kind with all the works), pick up my favorite pastry (a Napoleon) and a cheesecake from a pretty amazing bakery, and they even got my favorite kind of ice cream. 

I compromised on my cut and ate the sushi, because it's my favorite food, but I made that my only meal of the day so I ended up skipping dinner and not eating any of the pastries or anything sweet. A dinner which was also one of my favorite foods, baked beans. 

This didn't really upset my parents (who are pretty awesome) at all, they seem to have taken both of those things just fine, but I still feel guilty and angry at the same time. 

Guilty because despite them going to all that effort for my b-day, I didn't eat dessert like they really, really wanted me to. Angry because they went against what I wanted and got the desserts and unhealthy shit anyways despite my drawing a crystal clear boundary.  

And now, to compound the situation, those amazingly delicious desserts are lying in our fridge and I'm trying to resist the temptation to eat them. 

This is a really, really light, first-world, and privileged problem to have and I recognize that there's no real wrong decision but I can't help but wonder if it's worth sacrificing my cut to eat these desserts. 

Thanks in advance!",08Dec2020,1

In 2019 I was given a significant raise, so much so that I was even considering myself way overpaid for what I was doing and trying to find ways to contribute more. Now because of Covid my job description has completely changed, definitely making the job harder and more complicated than what it was originally, and these changes are looking to stay for the future. This past summer I absolutely felt I earned my money, again so much so that I've been thinking about asking for another raise.

34,"Hi everyone, this is my first time on this community so i’m kinda lost but I’ll explain my situation. So I’m 20 and i was living with my abusive and manipulative parents. I worked for their company making pennies( 60 a day for 8-12 hours of work). I was also doing school full time but was falling behind because of how much work i was doing. Despite this, my parents would refuse to let me go to any doctors appointments, and would force me to reschedule if it was during work ( it ALWAYS was). They supposedly gifted me a car when I turned 16. Anyways, I got tired of the abuse when i saw my dad kicking my senior dog, and began packing my things and told them i was leaving. They got mad and kicked me out anyways lol. I told them i was taking MY car. Well they got mad and said they would call the police and report it as stolen. My abusive and crazy father also said he would call the police on me so that i would go to jail for 5 years because I was intimidating HIM ( i’m 4’11 lmfao and he was the one yelling loud asf and beating the dog). All i said was that if i ever saw him kicking my dog again i would report him to immigration lmfaooo ( he’s undocumented). He said he didn’t care and would kick the dog as many times as he wanted because we were in HIS house, and plus he would ensure i go to jail ( he said the police have records that i am “crazy” I have depression lmfao).  Anyway, I left and i took my dog. In the rush and panic of violence ensuing, i took whatever i could with me. Half of my stuff is still over there, including an expensive fridge that i had bought. Ive asked them if i can finish grabbing the rest of my stuff and they said no. They’ve also made it clear that i must leave my refrigerator there lol. I am puzzled and to what to do. I don’t know what they are capable of, and would frankly not want to know. However, I do want to get the rest of my things, but am also scared of what they can do to me if i go in the house. Can anyone give me advice? Thanks",08Dec2020,1
35,"Yes, I already tried the r/legal advice sub. No dice. I'm desperate, and scared.

My background: I am 37F. I live with my long-term boyfriend 36M. I have a 13 y/o daughter and 5 y/o son. My son's dad is a 35M deputy sheriff/Army Sgt, and he and I are attempting to get along, although we have been broken up for a long time &amp; share custody. My daughter's father is 41M, works at Target, and he and I have been divorced since 2014.

Ex-husband is the problem. I'll call him ""Chet"". 

I have had voluntary sole custody of our daughter for nearly four years. She lives with me 7 days per week, and I am responsible for all of her life events. School, homework, friends, grades, hygiene, diet, housing, clothing, etc. She's a great kid, straight-A's, on the student body counsel. 

Chet was always controlling. We were together from 2008-2014 (he adopted my daughter in 2012). He took my paychecks and spent them on pot and alcohol. He was a major alcoholic, heavy marijuana user. I raised our daughter solely, even when we were together, as he was too drunk/high with his dad to help. Sounds white trash, I realize that. They're ""classy"" drunks...as in, the town doesn't realize what abusive pricks they are because they portray themselves as amazing men who just golf and hang out. 

There's a TON to this story, so I'm skipping ahead to 2020 to get to the point as to what I'm dealing with now. June 2018: I am forced to live next door to him, as he took over his mom's house and forced her out so he could live next to me. 

2020: I start dating, after three years of being single to focus on kids and my business. Chet finds out. All hell breaks loose. HE can only have me. He said we're still married ""in the eyes of God"" despite being divorced, and seeing other men, therefore, is cheating on him. 

He takes our daughter to middle of nowhere and tells her he will kill himself if she doesn't say she wants to live with him.

He forced his way into our house one day around that same time.

He stalks our house, flipping off security cameras, taking pics of house, etc. for HOURS. 

Made threats, called and texted over 50 times in 20 minutes, etc. 

Got Order of Protection granted. He is forced to leave and go stay with his dad.

Peace and quiet. We have the hearing, and he brings up custody. Judge dismissed Order of Protection, citing the intent to let us mediate our parenting plan and hopefully coparent. Chet uses this as a floodgate to harass and stalk me and my daughter even more.

We are forced to move. I keep address private to protect us. We block his number, as we are constantly under siege of his texts, calls, etc. full of manipulation and threats. He gets desperate.

Since about September 2020, I've been picking my mail up from my old mailbox, as the house is being renovated and no one lives there. I don't dare get a change of address done, for fear he will find me and my kids. Once a month, he leaves manipulative notes for daughter (""Do unto others as you would want done unto you"", etc). and a check for ""child support"". Not nearly enough, but whatever. This arrangement works for us both, and keeps my address private and keeps me from having to be in-person with him. He has been arrested for Partner-Family Member Assault on us before, so he's not safe to be around.

This weekend, my BF gets the mail, and to my shock, there's a letter in there from my ex-husband. He knows where we live, and his sole intention I feel by sending the letter was to let me know that he knows where we live now. It's meant to scare and intimidate me. 

This scares me to death, as the week before, I was walking down the hallway and noticed one of our family pictures hung upside-down in the hallway. Nobody here did it, and we were all confused.

Two days later, same picture is found in the ground (glass intact) but frame taken apart, when I come home from work.

We think he was in our house, but we can't prove it. Setting up security cameras tonight.

I called the police. They took a report, but it was the same cop who took the report a couple months ago when chet was harassing and stalking us again. No charges pressed. This cop is retiring in 2 months and doesn't seem to care anymore. We live in a small state. 

Is this stalking? When I asked Chet how he got the address, he laughed at me and said, ""Paranoid much?"" and refused to tell me how he found out. He has stalked me in the past, including stealing my Verizon bill from my mailbox and calling every number on it to see who I was talking to while we were separated. He used to masturbate to me sleeping, after he'd pulled my nightgown up to see me naked. He admitted this to me and laughed. He's done a lot of other stuff. I'm scared of him. 

Is this stalking?? Should I file another order of protection? We have our custody hearing coming up next week on the 16th, but I'm scared he'll do something before then. I am sorry if this is hasty; I am shaking as I type it and trying not to cry. It's been 12 years of Hell with this man. Thank you.

TL;DR: Ex-husband somehow got my new address and sent letter to let me know he knew where I live with my children now. He mocked me and refused to answer when I asked how he got it.

38,"So I got an A- in genetics but missed an A by 1% in the class. I wrote this email to my professor and did not receive a reply:

Respected Dr. Dotson,  
My name is --- and I am in your --- class. I am emailing you to request your consideration for a grade change. As described on your syllabus, an A requires a grade at or above 93.33 %. Having scored a 95% in the final and a 92.4% overall, I am short only 1% for an A in your class.   
Your class has been by far the most challenging but rewarding courses I have taken during my time at Tulane and I'm sure that if you were to look at my progress from tests 1 to 6 as well as the final you will be able to see that I have consistently worked hard on improving my skills and knowledge in your class and adapting to the format of the flip-model classroom. If it is possible, I would like the opportunity to write or do any extra credit assignment that you would be willing to give me in order for me to increase my grade by 1% before you input the final grades. I apologize if this email seems inappropriate, but a difference of 1% in your class will have a relatively greater impact on my GPA which is why I considered contacting you.  
Thank you for your time and consideration. Wishing you and your family a happy holiday season!

39,"We have 4 cats and live close to a street but it’s not a very busy one. We had a 1 year old cat who got hit by a car and died about a year ago though. I asked my today, “if 1-2 more cats dies from a car, will we start having indoor cats?”, and he said that we will always have outdoor cats even if that happens. Now our 8 year “old” cat got put down like two days ago because they found a thing in his body which pressed against his heart and he couldn’t breathe. We don’t know if he was born with it or if he got it later, but i just feel like out cats are gonna die so young because they’re outdoor cats.

I’ve talked to them about it and they think it’s abusive to have cats inside, they never play with the cats because their “play time” is just being outside. We have a two-storey house, three if u count basement.  

I’m also bedbound so i don’t get to choose when they let them out and every time i call for a cat they’re always outside. Beside from indoor cats living longer, what are ways i can try to convince them to at least stop having them outside so often? I’ve already told my dad all of this but he barely listened and barely gave me an answer except that they won’t change their mind so this is gonna be my last try. 

TLDR; Parents think having indoor cats is abusive, i’m bedbound and can’t decide when to let them in or not i barely get time to see them, 1 cat has already died from a car we live next to a street and my dad basically told me today that they’re not gonna change anything. Our cute orange cat was put down 3 days ago because of weird mutation that pressed against his heart and lungs, so we’re getting a new cat soon but i don’t want him to die fast. Can i convince them to have them inside more? :/",08Dec2020,1

42,"Hi folks, I'm posting here mainly because myself and my partner have another issue this evening with our two roommates (another couple). A quick backstory is that the couple we rent a 2 bedroom basement apartment with is my best friend of over seven years and her boyfriend. 

We moved in together mainly to save on cost, and she told me and my partner that they were generally very clean people and they'd be fairly quiet. Which normally might've caused some suspicion if they were random people, but why would I have any reason to not believe someone who has been my friend for many years?

Unfortunately, they've both just been downright messy. Leaving leftovers in the fridge for days and sometimes letting them go moldy/bad (an example, recently they left a piece of pizza in the fridge in a giant pizza box when it could have been moved to a much smaller container to save space). We also got a long message from them complaining that there was ""no room"" in the fridge/cupboards, however we reorganize our food often to prevent a lack of space and they're the ones leaving their massive takeout boxes for weeks. 

They smoke weed heavily, which I am okay with, however they smoke outside our front door multiple times a day and each time will come in and have a coughing and hacking fit, without attempting to get water or anything? Seems like a mild annoyance, but it happens regularly each and every day so it tends to become a grating noise after so much time. Other than that, we need to consistently remind them to take trash out, do dishes, switch their laundry over, etc. It's getting to a point where I've started to resent my friend and would be totally fine if she decided she no longer wanted to be friends. 

My only issue here is that I'm not sure if we've been too harsh? Neither myself or my partner want to be a doormat, so we've obviously brought up issues, but nothing seems like it gets through to them and each time we bring up an issue it's another, ""Okay thanks, we'll get that done,"" and then it just continues on a cycle where we remind them to do their part or pick up after themselves. 

We will be moving out hopefully by next August, but unfortunately we have to stick around till then. Any advice to make things a little easier for living like this?",08Dec2020,1

I’ve always hated moving houses, but I honestly couldn’t pick one house to live at because I love my parents equally. A couple weeks ago I moved to my dads house. He was out of the house at the time, but he had left me a letter. The letter basically said that he could tell I didn’t like living with him and that if I wanted to just live with my mom he would continue to support and love me. This BROKE MY HEART because I love him so much. I had a conversation with him about the letter and told him that I didn’t feel that way and would continue moving houses. Its been a few weeks and I honestly cant shake the feeling that I’m failing at being a daughter. I feel like I spend a decent amount of time with him. I try and cook dinner once a week, and go out on walks with him. I mean we don’t hang out every day, but I’m also a college student that is being forced to do school from home. Watching a movie with my dad is not necessarily what I want to be doing on Saturday night. I don’t know really how to approach a conversation with him because I think we’re both struggling a little bit with quarantine and I think he’s been really lonely.

46,"So I’m going to start by saying we’re coming up on 4 years, we have a beautiful daughter who is 2 years old, im 20, she’s turning 20 December 13th. Lately she found a new place to work, she’s doing absolutely amazing, already full time way under her hours, well she met some friends. One in particular, she’s a female, 22 years old with a child but her baby daddy isn’t around. Just her boyfriend who’s 19. Now she introduced me one time after work (we worked at the same place) and she was ok, she flirts too much with my wife I think, usually it’s okay but saying some very sexual stuff to her when I’m not around, no worries she’s happy, she finally has a friend. Well one night she was mad about always being in the house, so I said alright go to your friends house, stay the night, stay for a week if you want to, I don’t suggest it but you can it’s okay. So she did. She was very happy. Stayed there for 4 days, well we missed eachother, so she came back and we hit it off right. The next day her friend called her asking to come back, wouldn’t tell me why until I left, finally she told me it was because she needs to go somewhere to get food for her baby, okay cool, I’d want my friend to do that too. I just told her don’t be long becasue we have to pick up our daughter from my dads, well she stayed there till about 1 in the morning, after 30 minutes of being there she said they changed their mind about going, she was there for 5 hours, now our kid is asleep and we have to wait for the next day, I was very irritated. The next day we had our kid for the weekend (we both work so we have my dad and mom to watch her, usually when we get off we pick her up and bring her back before we leave for work). Well she said she wanted to go back, this time with our kid, I wasn’t happy but I said ok, just please try to be home soon, I miss her. Well she went, she stayed for 10 hours that day. I told her I don’t care if she has friends but when I ask to be home soon I’d really appreciate that. That turned into a huge argument. Well she said she won’t go there for a while now. Out of 10 days she’s been here for 2 of them, last night her friend called crying, needing help, again wouldn’t tell me. So I said go ahead and go and stay the night, it was already 9:00, she she went and said she’ll be back tomorrow after work. Well now she texts me saying she’s tired and just wants to stay at her friends tonight. I said i really want you home, you’ve only been home for 2 days and there for 10, she said she has to ask her friend if that’s okay because she already told her she’s staying the night. Don’t make much sense to me cause she said she would be home tonight, that was yesterday, why would she ask her friend for permission. Anyways, I’ve asked to come meet them, I’ve asked if I could go with our daughter with them, and she said no it’s a girls night, come to find out it’s just her friend, her boyfriend, and her kid. Then my wife and our daughter. So that didn’t make much sense either. If she says no to coming home tonight because her friend don’t want her to, I’ll have to call it quits. I’m scared man. Please anyone, I just need a couple advice, anything will help, my mind is racing. I can’t talk to her because everytime I do she automatically thinks I’m going to be hateful even when I said right before that I’m trying to make it sound as nice as I can. Idk what to do.

47,"Bought a used 2013 Hyundai Sonata from a reputable dealer in my town in June 2020. Purchase price 7k with an additional warranty on top of this. I was aware of several recall notices, which I was assured by the sales and finance department could be taken care of by them since they were a former Hyundai dealer (mistake 1). 

Fast forward to the 27th of November. Car stalls with no warning, no engine lights and full oil. Have it towed to same dealer. Seized engine. Lo and behold they are not allowed to perform recall repairs. Call Hyundai who tells me that I will need to tow it roughly 170 miles to the nearest Hyundai dealership. Actual Hyundai dealership says ""save your money on a tow, we won't fix it anyways since there is another recall that should have been fixed first."" 

Hyundai customer service says nothing they can do. Original dealer offered to return my extended warranty and hold the car there until the bank can voluntary reposss it. 

This whole deal stinks and smells fishy to me. I can make the payments, but have other vehicles to drive as well. I cant afford to pay for a new engine out of pocket.

51,"I'm 27/F and have been working in corporate for a few years. I basically started working for a company right when I graduated college in 2016, and switched over to a different (great) company earlier this year when I landed a new role right before the pandemic began. I have a TON of motivation, and I work extremely hard. I take pride in my job, get along with others, am grateful for every opportunity that I've been fortunate enough to receive, and genuinely listen to and respect the people that I work with (I've realized that when older folks give you advice, you should take it because it's usually tried &amp; true!). Anyway, I was talking to my vendor the other day who is 43/M, and he mentioned how over the years working with my company (roughly 16 years) he's seen so many young people get hired into roles where they have absolutely no experience except a college degree, and how they're in turn very unprepared for that job. He was expressing that it felt unfair, because even though he doesn't have a bachelor's degree (he went to a 2 year tech school), he has 20+ years of real world experience and many employers don't consider him for roles simply because he lacks a 4 year degree. I couldn't agree with him more, and I had to refrain from getting too heated because this topic really pisses me off. I personally don't agree that college should be the sole qualifying factor for obtaining a specific type of job. But any who, after we were talking I sort of had a bad taste in my mouth. I felt guilty... guilty for having my job, which he probably deserves, and guilty for being given so many opportunities simply because I have a 4 year degree. He's right, real world experience is what matters. But I don't know, I've just been thinking about it a lot and I almost feel like I don't deserve my job.

Ill spare you a lengthy background story and also I am aware of the pros and cons to apartment living and or bad nieghbors.

So I am living above an ""artist"".  He likes to paint, as I often use to see him outside spray painting on canvas, or air brushing.   Recently he doesnt come outside at all anymore.  It seems he has moved his painting activities indoors which is making one of my rooms smell like paint 24/7.   Even with the windows open, I cant seem to air it out, let alone use that room which I have set up as an office without getting headaches.

I know I am over sensitive to smells, but want to know if I am being overly sensitive by putting in a complaint against him at the apartment office.  The smell is quite strong and noticable. Odd thing is he will know its me, as due to the apt layout, I am his only nieghbor, which I dont care too much about.

I really want to know if I am being oversensitive by submitting a complaint. I honestly do not feel comfortable to approach him directly, nor do I want to (he is an offbeat/eccentric guy, although he is the same age I am.  Ive tried saying hello to him in the parking lot, but he is either not socially developed or he is rude - he just ignores me so I stopped trying to greet him - he seemed to want to be left alone).",08Dec2020,1

61,"What is the best way to handle a situation where you are mistaken for much younger than your age?

The other day, I walked into a building to run an errand. You have to sign in at a kiosk to enter. As I was signing in, the receptionist asked me if I was with someone. It so happened that I came there with my mom, but she was still in the car. So I told the receptionist as much. 

As my mom and I were heading out of the building, the same receptionist stopped me to ask if I was over 18 (because of covid, people under 18 aren’t allowed in). 

I’m 22, and this threw me since I’m usually at a college campus where I don’t get mistaken for a younger person. But it makes sense that she would make this assumption;  I’m 5 feet tall, don’t wear makeup, I had on a mask, and my hair was up. So I’m sure I looked pretty young. But this same scenario happens to me all the time when I’m off campus (I get asked if I want a kid menu at restaurants, people are shocked when they hear that I’m in college, people look around for a parent when I’m trying to pay at the grocery store etc.).  

Every time it happens, no matter what I tell myself (Own your age! It’s ok, she was just doing her job! Don’t let it get to you!), it still bothers me.

So one of my best friends live with me and my fiancé and my stepson keep in mind my step son is 3 ,so we recently had a covid scare because she tends to be around a lot of people and not wear a mask and I’ve told her multiple times this is a very serious situation and she never listens so we went to get tested after she found out she was in contact with someone who had covid . I was negative but she was positive so she decided to leave to go stay with a relative who she caught it from so they could quarantine together but neither one of them is taking it serious . Her relative has went out almost everyday to stores around people and she invites people over to see her while she’s suppose to be quarantining . I feel like it’s incredibly selfish and dangerous especially with her trying to come back to my home when she hasn’t been taking this serious . Oh also I forgot to add my boyfriend was negative and my stepson was negative but he has a cold . So I told her if she doesn’t start taking it seriously she cannot come back to our home because it showed me in serious times like these she doesn’t think about anyone but herself . After I told her she couldn’t come back if she didn’t quarantine right she went on this rant and tried to play the victim saying she thought I was her real friend and that every time something happens we hang over her head about her having to leave when in all reality every time we’ve ever even talked to her about her leaving it’s because we’ve given her chance after chance to get herself together . My fiancé and I have opened our home to her because she was having family issues and she was tryin to save up for her own place but she wasn’t taking that serious and lost her job because she literally worked 1 week when she first got the job and then missed two weeks and then worked a good 3 days and then went out of town with one of her friends for 2 more weeks so they fired her that was literally the first month of her living here and now she’s been with us for 6 months .

70,"hi, im a senior in high school. i have friend in the same school and i have known her for a very long time but we r friends for about 2 years now. Her father died when she was 14 and i know how bad that time was for her, and she is still not over it. last year, some of her „friends“ betrayed her, and me and my friends helped her a lot. we became better friends, she trusts us now, but me and my friends realised that she often whines about school, how hard it is or how stressed she is. Although we all kinda feel the same, we always talk with her, but it feels like we r talking to a brick wall. i feel like she just wants ppl to listen to her problems, but she never does anything to change her situation. its always the same topics. Rn she talkes about how fat she is („how uncomfortable she feels“), even tho she isnt even fat (maybe just 5 pounds) but she instins to talk about this topic with everyone except some of our friends who are actually more fat. and they feel bad bc they see that someone who they consider as „not that fat“ whines about that a lot. we tried to convince her that she should try to love herself and her body, but she says that „we dont understand“. She added that she loved her body but just feels uncomfortable. I dont what she expects from us. She already tries to go the gym etc. We talked with her for 6 months about how bad her previous friends, who betrayed her, were, gave advice, tried to help her, but i srsly started to think that its useless to talk with her. she always makes me feel bad after a conversation and tells that i dont understand her. 
i srsly dont know what to do with her, we talked so many times with her to help her but its like talking to a brick wall.",08Dec2020,1
71,"So my sister who we’ll call W is honestly a bitch. She has always made my life harder and bullied me and my other sister to hell because W believes the whole “because I’m older I automatically can tell you what to do, no consequences.” 

As a kid, I obviously stayed off social media but when I was around 9 I got Instagram with my friends (I know, I probably shouldn’t have but I realise that now) and everyone knew abt my acc and saw the things I posted.

Well fast forward a year, W did some pretty awful things and basically went into my acc and posted some pictures that I don’t want to go into detail about (I’ll tell you this much, it was hardcore porn) and it obviously got taken down and I learned my lesson about social media.

So I made a new account when I got my first phone, new passwords new everything, went private, didn’t even block W because I know she has the app that lets you see who’s blocking you. I’ve been telling people I just use Twitter but recently my sister got into my phone and I got it back quick but then she realised I still had social media and now she won’t stop badgering me about my details.

Like questions such as “are you talking to guys on there?” “You better not be posting porn (she keeps thinking I am a porn addict, even though she was the one who posted that stuff...)” “why won’t you just tell me your details what are you hiding”. I really hate it because I know she’s going to do something bad and make the blame on me, or something similar.

Is there anything I can do to get her off my back? Btw I am not a very confrontational person. I’ll admit because I’m younger and she was stronger I just took everything and probably enabled her behaviour (but come on I was like 6).",08Dec2020,1

75,"This will probably come off more as a rant, but I really do need some advice for how I can get some work.

I'm I 19yo/ woman, have an RSA (Responsible Service of Alcohol) certificate, a forklift licence, a Working With Children's Check, a motorcycle licence, and I've finished year 12. I also have a pre-apprenticeship course because I want to go into the electrical industry, but that's not relevant to the entry-level retail jobs I've been applying for.

Where I live, you have to be paid more once you're 21, so I'm cheaper labour than someone older than me. For liquor shops in particular, they can't hire someone under 18, so my age range is the cheapest option. I've applied for every opening within a 30min travel time of my house, I've gone into shops that have a ""Now Hiring"" sign up in my interview attire (so that I at least appear professional) and I've not gotten a single call back from anyone.

I have ADHD, so I didn't want to work throughout school in order to let me focus on my studies, so I have no work experience other than some recurring volunteer work at the local archery range. I'm just having trouble getting my foot through the door.

I know that I won't cope in a fast food environment as I don't do well with the constant stress and loud sounds (I can't even sit in a McDonald's to eat). I'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong.

I've gotten calls back from about a dozen apprenticeships I've applied for, but all of them have said to call them back once I have some work experience ""in any industry"" just so that I can have some references other than the organiser where I volunteer. What can I do to get my foot in the door?",08Dec2020,1
76,"So a little background: My brother is 16, I’m. 19. My brother has a job, and worked with a coworker who was positive for COVID, and showing symptoms while they worked together. I don’t know the full details about the night they worked together, but during the end of their shift, they both took off their masks. My brother gets the notification from his job, and we got him tested. His test came back negative, but since it was the cutoff for the virus to start showing, the doctor recommended we get him tested again after 5-7 days of the initial exposure. A day after testing, my brother begins displaying symptoms. A few days later, my brother also starts to lose his sense of taste &amp; smell. 

Now we’re here. It’s been a week since his initial exposure, and it feels like I’m the only one being proactive in the house. 

I asked my father about retesting, and he said we’ll do it eventually, but it’s not going to do anything for my brother recovery. That is true; however, I feel like knowing if my brother had a false negative, would put everyone’s thoughts at ease.

My mother, who’s a nurse, told me we won’t be retesting him till Friday. What the fuck? I’m just kinda lost here. Am I the one being a hypochondriac? I just want to mwke sure that I’m doing my part to protect folks.

My brother can’t do much since he’s still a minor. What should I do to speed up him getting tested again?",08Dec2020,1

Yesterday L posted an Instagram story in close friends where she says she's pregnant and she's like serious about it, it's not a joke. 
They blocked each other on Instagram and me and other mutual friends know for a fact that M doesn't know anything about this pregnancy (they supposedly conceived in late August so it has been some months).

78," I'm 23, started college a bit late due to personal issues. First semester, I failed a class. I was bummed, angry at myself because if I'd just done the homework and attended class I wouldn't have. Did okay the next one, but my third I failed 3 classes. Another issue with not doing the work, but it didn't happen until the last month. There was a situation with family and it became increasingly difficult for me to maintain a sliver of sanity so I gave up. The semester after was when covid started. I failed 1 class because I got mixed up about the final and my professor wouldn't help me out. Now I'm an entire year behind where I should be and I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail 2 more classes. One of which, if I'd turned shit in, I'd have been fine. Possibly 3, but I still have the ability to save it, I think. That will bring me up to 7 possibly 8 classes in just 5 semesters. I don't even know if I'll be able to maintain a GPA high enough to not get kicked out. It's evident to me at this point that my severe depression and anxiety do NOT mix well with school and it's extremely difficult for me to stay on top of all the work I need to do. I'm just terrified of what I'm going to do. If I get kicked out I'll have to start from scratch again, if another college will even take me. But should I even bother when the same cycle will just repeat itself? Should I e-mail my adviser and ask what I should do? Is there even a point anymore to keep trying? I feel lost and hopeless and I don't know what I would even do with my life without a degree. Has anyone been in this situation before? Does anyone know what I should do?",08Dec2020,1
79,"We've been dating for quite some time and have found love and comfort in each other. Before we dated we knew each other from college and I knew the people shed been with before me. Before my time with her, my love life had just been disastrous; coming out of a mentally abusive toxic relationship- I came out with lots of insecuritys and trust issues(which I won't go into). And as time went on I finally started to get relaxed around her and started opening up, but due to previously mentioned issues I was still paranoid. 

Early this week I must've been drunk and not in my scenses, asked her a bunch of questions that has lead me to this dilemma. I asked her questions like: 

""have you ever been slapped on the butt by your guy friends?""

""I'm sure you've must've gotten so much phrases already on your boobs right?""

""I feel like can never treat you the same way like guys before me did, never can satisfy you""

I can admit that I was in the wrong for saying this type of shit to her. After all the continuous love and support she gave me and all the times she's been there for me when I'm down; I kept unknowingly and unintentionally hurting her. I fucking crossed the line, I made her cry. 

She told me: ""you think I'm a whore don't you! That I'm willing to flash everyone my boobs and grope me!?"" 

 I immediately started apologising and crying 

""don't you think I'm already embarrassed and ashamed of the few things I did do, you being upset and me trying to cheer you up makes me even more upset and keeps reminding me  what was just said to me!"" 
""this is always been a repeat, you making us both sad constantly and each time it affects my anxiety and you know that"" 

For the past few days I've been trying to apologise and make amendments, what really breaks my heart is what she told me next:

""im more upset at the fact that someone like you, loving and caring thinks I'm a whore, what will the normal people or my future husband would think or say of me?"" 
""don't you dare start to apologise, everytime I'm hurt and want to share I can't because I feel less entitled because you're upset and start going into self-deprecating mode, that hurts me more"" 

I love this woman more than anything in my life, I don't want to lose her. 

Can anyone help me, how do I fix my situation? 
What should I say?",08Dec2020,1
81," Okay this is a long one. 

My partner really likes his alone time and has strict boundaries around it or else he freaks out . It’s the best way for him to decompress. His motorcycle used to be his main source of this, but it’s in the shop awaiting costly repairs. We moved in together 8 months ago due to COVID and soon after we got engaged. It was awesome at first. We had so much fun together, it was like an endless sleepover. When I moved out, I technically still had my apartment and there were a few occasions where I decided to go back home just to “be on the healthy side” and he even asked me to come back because he missed me. When I first moved in officially, we had a roommate who was living with him at the time and I didn’t have the best relationship with this guy. It constantly felt like I was encroaching on their “bro time” even though we all played video games, watched movies and ate dinner together during quarantine. He eventually moved out because he didn’t want to live with a couple anymore. And mind you, we weren’t the super PDA, in your face about our relationship type. Like I said, we kind of all hung out and my partner and I did our displays of affection in private. After this guy moved out, something almost instantly changed. My partner started to get irritated with me more often, and we fought constantly. I hadn’t ever moved in with a partner before, and neither had he. We didn’t really know what we were in for, going from seeing each other on the weekends, to having a roommate as a buffer, and for me to separate myself at times to spending 24/7 together and all of our behaviours on display at all times. 


Fast forward a few months, we had our ups and downs. We move into a new apartment, which is much nicer than our old one. I start taking very good care of this new apartment. He gets a new job where he’s working 40 hrs a week as a sprinkler fitter. I’m in school full time, but it’s all online. He starts getting frustrated again because we’re spending too much time together and I talk too much. I feel like I take up too much space. We find that we communicate about how we’re feeling but some of the issues aren’t getting resolved and it’s like “spinning wheels” as he describes it. 


He has anger issues and gets frustrated easily, and has avoidant tendencies, hasn’t worked on it a whole lot yet because he feels like all the work he’s done on himself so far is good enough. I am codependent and working very hard on loving myself more, doing more for myself and not pushing my needs aside to meet his, or anyone else’s. I still do all the cooking, the vast majority of the cleaning and general upkeep of the house while I’m in school. 

We book an appointment with a couples therapist. He goes into the appointment in a shitty mood which makes me feel horrible going into it. It was terrible. The therapist made us both feel like we were a married 40 yr old couple on the verge of divorce. All we wanted is some clarity from one another, and to find how to communicate more effectively. She did not validate either of our emotional responses and encouraged me to “shut it off” when I was crying because he snapped at me for looking at him while he was talking to the therapist. I wanted to get up and leave. I barely got a word in. It was just her talking about what we’re doing wrong, instead of on being solution oriented. And I don’t know how couples counselling works so correct me if I’m wrong, but all I wanted going in was clearer, more efficient communication. 

We left the session both feeling shittier than when we came in, and the ride home was awful. I have never been angrier at him in the entirety of our relationship. He drops me at home and drives off. I scream into a pillow. He comes back about 30 mins later and we talked about it as we always do. She encouraged us to ignore the problem and not talk about it, but we always talk it out and don’t go to bed angry. 


During the session, him feeling the NEED for space (which was dismissed by the therapist as a childish want) was addressed. He said he wanted 2 full evenings during the week to himself and one entire day during the weekend with me out of the house, for all three occasions. That’s not feasible for me. I don’t drive, and with the COVID situation I am not seeing friends or doing anything outside other than going for sanity walks and getting groceries. I felt this as an attack, because he well knows that I can’t really go anywhere and I’m trying to get a job, trying to learn how to drive while I’m in school to better myself but also to bend over backwards to meet his needs. He knows I’m trying because we’re in the middle of a goddamn pandemic and I’m focussing all my time and energy into school, where it should be &amp;amp; that I am okay for money right now. He doesn’t truly want to compromise but knows he has to, or it’s not gonna work. He’s envious of me because I get the whole house to myself, 10 hrs a day, 4 days a week while he’s working and he doesn’t get the same. In reality I’m struggling to balance school and keep up with all the housework, cooking, and cleaning while struggling with anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, and codependency.  The codependent part wants to make myself do exactly what he wants to make him happy but the logical part of me knows I am doing all that I can at the moment and there’s nothing more that I can do other than to retreat to the bedroom and give him basically ZERO contact when he asks for it. I’ve been to several job interviews that I’m waiting to hear back from, and spent 3 grand on driving lessons that don’t start until February. What more can I do here? Looking for honest advice. Is he asking for too much? Am I not doing enough.?  If you read this far, thanks for bearing with me here. 


TL;DR: My partner needs more time to himself, but wants the house to himself. I can’t really go anywhere because we’re in a pandemic. What is the best way to compromise?",08Dec2020,1

He called him ""baby girl"" after he lied and said that he drank urine

He's scared to go to somebody about it because he doesn't have enough evidence. He's also afraid to do something about it because he knows that it isn't hard for the man to figure out his location apparently.

This would be less of an issue if she were farther away when we eat but I sit only a foot away from her when we eat. And the breathing. It drives me nuts. She takes deep dramatic breaths and I can't stand it. I can't even look at her while she eats because she shovels the food in her mouth and chews with her mouth open. 
She cannot cover her mouth when she sneezes and her snot it often runny. I have had to spend 15 minutes of my day cleaning the snot off of my dash/window of my car after she gets out because she never wipes it down. 
I am constantly pushed and move my self out of the way for this woman. She's very pregnant right not but even before she was pregnant I was constantly moved away from the chore I was doing.

89,"

In August, we met on a 4 day group vacation and both clicked in a way that felt like a movie. We both felt like we found our soulmate and everyone around us felt our passion. As we got to know each other, I learned that she was transitioning her life from a recent break up from a three year relationship. She learned from me, that I broke away from a six year relationship earlier this year. Both of our relationship experiences were similar, and the way she spoke about not loving him anymore was identical to the way I felt about my ex, which established my trust that she was over him for good. 

Moving forward, our love has been something that I never thought was possible. One of a kind. We got married at the end of October and moved in together (I know how crazy that sounds). A month ago, she told me that her ex reached out to her through text. He reached out because he wanted to express how much he still loves her and has been depressed ever since. She stated that he has expressed suicidal thoughts in the past, so she didn’t want to blow him off completely. She responded a couple of times to him, and then stopped responding altogether. Yesterday, out of regret, she confessed that she began responding to him again. They met up once to talk. She said that she told him repeatedly “no,” while also letting him know about her current marriage. He insisted, and met up with him. I asked what the feeling was that made her accept meeting with him, and she responded that she just felt like “FINE. I’ll go.” He grabbed her and gave her a peck on the lips at the end of their meeting. Same texts happen again, and she goes to his house to meet up for a second time. She said they kept talking, and then had sex. She told me that there was no passion on her side, she reciprocated nothing, and let him have sex.

I love her so much. I’m in so much pain. I want to be with her forever. She has expressed immense regret, sadness, self anger, and willingness to work with me if we continue. But every time I think about them, I start shaking my head, I don’t know if it’s possible to ever look passed it.",08Dec2020,1

93,"Ive had the roughest 2 months of my life , I was broken up with after finally giving someone a chance after a really bad breakup before that , found out my dad has terminal cancer , sexually assaulted by my brother, found out my mom has been pretending to like me and actually dislikes me , had my apartment trashed and some expensive stuff (like my stove) broken till this day, was left deserted in extreme cold 500miles from home with no credit card or anything ,had a severe panic attack that made me go to the hospital , reconnected with my ex fiance but its been off , bleached my hair got piercings that I just removed today because this doesnt feel like who I am  ,was drugged with ecstasy,shrooms some other heavy drug pill (Ive never done drugs before and have suddenly done these once, havent again nor want to) got my first tattoo too done by someone unproffessional &amp; inexperienced and started smoking... 

in conclusion just the most draining 2 months of my life . After the brutal breakup I let a girl stay at my place but she turned out to be a leech of energy and dragged me into her toxic bad friend group , I barely drink (once a month at most)  so this change was a lit but in my vulnerable breakup stage just two weeks after the breakup I was very easily peer pressured  into things although one of the drugs was completely nonconsensual

I know , its not that simple tho , I need someone whos gone thru this type of a scenario to tell me how they started , whats the first step , simplified, example ”I _______ from time to time at first and then _______” since advice like ”learn to love yourself ” without any basis , for a Person who doesnt understand the real concept of self love is not even a concept to understand , theres no told to how just the solution , I need a guide .",08Dec2020,1
94,"Hi, this is my backstory. I was in second grade when the my childhood abuse began happening consistently. My parents owned a restaurant and I had to work there everyday of my childhood. Starting from when I was in second grade I had to work at the store for 12 hours a day. Being a second grader, I could only do so much and I couldn’t do my parents job for them. I was beaten for being too slow or too weak. Not only that, I was told that I was worthless and told to go kill myself. Yes I was told to go kill myself as a second graders. From then on, I entered into a state of depression and very lonely. Then my parents almost beated me every single day, and not too long after that they started to starve me. I was forced to collect cans in front of the restaurant to recycle and feed myself. I had to do this in front of people eating in the restaurant and people usually just stared and laughed at me, I was so embarrassed. This stopped after I got a skin disease and had to go to the doctors. When my doctor asked me how I got this, I lied fearing a beating. Fortunately, my dad decided that I should stop collecting cans and starving me after he though someone at church knew about his abusiveness. I attempted suicide once in third grade but my brother stopped me, and I never tried it again holding on to the little bit of hope I had left. After a few years, my dad stopped drinking and stopped abusing me, however my mom did not. In fact she started to pin to the ground and beat me till I bleeded. My dad however always defended my mother and never done anything about it while I was getting abused. When I turned 18, I left for college and never went home once. I never called home, I never texted my parents, and I do not plan on attending their funeral or letting my kids visit them. I am horrified by my past and by the fact of how evil parents can be to their kids.",08Dec2020,1

100,"This may be triggering for people who’ve struggled with suicide, so please take that into consideration before you read.

And I don’t use Reddit a lot, so I’m sorry if I’m posting this in the wrong place. 

So, to start off, I am not suicidal in the context of taking action. I was suicidal two years ago in my freshman year of college. I almost ended my life, but didn’t because of some unintentional kindness from a friend. At the time, I was on an epilepsy medication, and I came to the conclusion a while later that the medication was the cause. My mother had me stop the medicine, and take a CBD oil alternative. I didn’t know until months later when I did my own research that there’s no definitive proof that CBD oil prevents seizures. I’d had seizures during the time I was using the CBD oil, but it was always when I missed a few doses, so I thought it was my fault. 

I had another seizure while on it, and I finally went to the doctor about a month ago to get back on medication, much to my mother’s grief. I had to organize the appointment with the help of my boyfriend, because my mother was so appalled at the idea. 

When I spoke to my doctor at my appointment, he told me I could have died. That the CBD oil isn’t a replacement for my medicine, and that I could have killed myself. Part of me was sorry, and part of me wondered whether that would have been the merciful thing for my family. 

I’ve always been the odd one out in my family. I read a lot, I’m socially awkward, I like singing and theater and crafty things. The rest of my family is athletic and social and comfortable in their own skins. And I’m okay with that, it’s just that I always feel like the ugly duckling pre-metamorphosis, like I’ll never come out of my shell and be secure and beautiful. 

I frequently wonder if me dying would be easier for them. My medication is kind of expensive. If I have a seizure, I might not be able to drive for months at a time. I’m not going to make a ton of money (I’m an English Major), and because I’m a student-athlete (track and Cross Country), I can’t even make a ton of money now. I feel like I’m a boat constantly at the mercy of a sea I can’t control. If I’m not under my own control, it’s my mother or my coach or a professor’s or my medicine’s or religion’s. 

I’m a Christian, but I keep having doubts. I love God, and I will always believe in a God. But the school I attend is Christian, and my faith, my political beliefs feel so different than other people’s. And I feel lesser than because of this. 

I’m dating someone wonderful. But he’s a missionary kid, and strong-willed. He’s never dealt with something like depression or suicidal ideation before, and I don’t like burdening him with my struggles. He’s been very kind and very understanding, and I love him deeply. But I don’t know how to tell him how I feel entirely. He urges me to communicate, and I try my best. But part of me (due to childhood trauma with my mother in regards to her oversharing emotionally/betraying my trust) doesn’t know if I can open up with him entirely. 

I’m in my junior year of college. Every time I turn a paper in late, I think about suicide. Every time I embarrass myself, same thing. Every time I think about the possibility of growing old, I can’t see myself living that long. 

I’m also bad at writing papers unless I’m under some kind of pressure, and even then it’s iffy. I can write poetry or stories, but essays are a struggle. When I write them, I get A’s, but it’s a struggle to write them if there isn’t supervision/distinct pressure. Professors treat me kinda like I’m Peter Parker in the original Spider-Man movies: they think I’m brilliant, but lazy. And I’m not lazy, I just don’t know how to write without pressure. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever survive the real world. Honestly, I don’t know if I’ll survive. And I feel like no one understands this in general. I keep messing up with my grades, and I keep getting grace, but I’m a screw-up and I know it. 

All this keeps piling on my head. I’m dodging texts from my Coach about my grades. I’m trying to avoid my home because of family drama. My boyfriend’s family has let me live in their apartment while they’re visiting family for Christmas vacation (yes Corona, but they isolated for a week and a half before they left, and it’s not my business anyway) but I’m lonely and confused and I don’t know how to deal with myself. And they’re coming back next week, so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to stay for much longer. 

I know other people have dealt with worse than me. I just don’t know if I’m strong enough to deal with myself. I don’t know what to do, and I know rationally that I shouldn’t kill myself, but I’m not strong enough to lift myself up and be better.",08Dec2020,1
101,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for two months; we met a university through mutual friends. And thus, we’re in the same friend group. Anyway, I’m close to another group of students, but my girlfriend isn’t so much. They’ve invited me around their house for a hotpot, alongside some other friends. After making my girlfriend aware of my anticipated plans, she seemed confused and hurt, mainly due to her hanging out with them a few times, in the past, through me. And now I feel guilty and ignorant. We spend most days together; she pretty much lives at mine house. Plus, whenever there are parties, we’ll attend together. It’s just — these opportunities are the only ones I get with which I can completely relax and get drunk with my friends. I’ve attempted to explain this to her, but she’s still confused — and in some way, guilt tripping me over it.

106,"Ever since I left the military I was set to continue to serve, but as a police officer. Its highly competitive in the Bay Area, so I decided to pursue a Criminal Justice Degree at San Jose State and use my GI Bill.

I suffer from a cervical strain disability from excessive physical stress on my neck, and the disability has become worse since I have left. I thought to myself as my disability has worsened how this would affect my life as a police officer since nowadays officers are packed with weight like an infantryman, mags, radios, gear, non lethals, bunch of other stuff that adds up in weight. 

I decided to solely seek counseling from the VA voc rehab program. I just needed someone to talk to. I was surprised how happy she was. She said most people here come for just the benefits. She offered me voc rehab benefits that would pay for my bachelors, I was reluctant at first because I just wanted counseling, then I thought to myself it would be ideal to seek a different but related career option since my neck is going to get worse, they already found some arthritis in the area. 

I decided to take her advise on accepting the voc rehab benefits. I was saddened to have to give up my dream of being a police officer. I have always been a man of uniform, k-8 strict uniformed school, my high school specialized in policing and firefighting and had strict standards with uniform. Enlisted in the Marines and did my thing as a Infantryman. 

She then gave me a ultimatum, and said that she would support me in getting a Masters Degree, but that I would have to give up the dispatcher dream too. She was so nice about everything, she left me with time to think. 

She made it clear its up to me, I can use voc rehab to finish my bachelors and pursue dispatching, but her offer on the masters made me think twice. I don’t know which route to take. 

Friends I need advice: I have been looking at social worker, but at the same time I am scared about how hard a masters program can be, but also given the opportunity to finish my BA and get a masters free under voc rehab sounds intriguing while also still getting my monthly bay area BAH stipend along with it.

112,"I started on a bad anxiety train back in the spring. I can't even remember suffering from anxiety before that. If you would have asked me, I would have described myself as the world's least anxious person lol. I'm 37, fit, and have never had any health problems. Overall everything is pretty good right now. Everyone is happy and healthy.

I own a small business and the lockdowns hurt us for a while. I was also very worried, early on, about what was going to happen with Covid. Was society going to collapse, were we going to run out of food? Thankfully, none of that happened, and looking back it seems silly. Everybody suffered from stress in those days I can imagine. They were very real fears at the time.

In early May, I got a strange skin infection. With the hospitals still overrun and doctors' offices busy, I settled with remote care. It was a fairly serious condition for some, but based on my age and health history, the odds of it becoming serious were extremely rare. Still scary. I was prescribed an antibiotic and given care instructions. Every night for a week or so, the infection would get red and I would spike a low fever. These nights were bad for me. It eventually went away and healed up fine, but it started me on a bad anxiety train.

My wife and I have different schedules, which leaves me alone for a few hours at night while she is sleeping. This is when the anxiety started. Googling medical stuff, constantly taking my temperature. I used to love the evening and night time. I would read, chat with the wife, enjoy a glass of bourbon or watch a movie. Now I dread night time and the evening being alone.

Over the last week or two, everyone in the house got a little cold...sniffles and such. I just started getting it a few days ago with a running nose and little cough, while the wife and kids have recovered. We all had a Covid test over a week ago but still haven't gotten results. My logical brain tells me I'm fine and even if I had it, I would most likely be fine.

I keep up a brave face for the wife and kids, but here I am, checking my temperature every minute, using a pulse oximeter, unable to relax. My wife falls asleep and I'm alone with nowhere to go. A feeling of impending doom, elevated heart rate, tingling, tightness in my chest. I find it hard to focus, relax, and enjoy myself. Tomorrow morning I'll be fine, sunshine, and feeling busy.

I was in the military, in a combat unit deployed overseas from 03-05. I survived war and luckily never battled anxiety afterward as a lot of my fellow soldiers did. I made it through that, how is this kicking my ass so bad? Again, my logical brain tells me I'm fine. I just wish I could kick this nighttime anxiety in the ass and get back to enjoying my evenings.

118,"So our company is rather small and their policy surrounding covid is vague and poorly written like they made it last second. Im  a department manager but have no real authority compared to our store manager, who im sure will stick to enforcing policy. It basically says if you test negative, you're good to come back immediately and are expected to show up to your next shift. If you do test positive, you need to quarantine for ""12 days,"" which strikes me as odd because everything else I've seen specifically says 14 days to quarantine.. but whatever thats a different matter. 

Our policy however doesn't cover this situation;
My coworker lives at home with her parents and two brothers. Her mother tested positive, im unsure of when that happened exactly, but coworker got tested Saturday and got a negative result today. They really only seem to share a kitchen, otherwise my coworker mostly keeps to herself in her own living room in her basement.
 If she comes in tomorrow for her next shift, will she be putting the rest of the staff at risk, regardless of her negative test result? 
And correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it possible to test negative initially when its early on in infection? 
I certainly don't want to take hours away from her,  but our company policy does not factor in these possibilities and that worries me about how to handle this situation for the sake fo the rest of our staff.. She would get two weeks paid if she did test positive according to our policy but doesn't mention anything about what to do about exposure to others with Covid other than to get tested.  
So should Invite her to come in tomorrow for her shift and take the gamble of her possibly still having it? How likely is it that she'll still get it while sharing a roof with someone who has it?  Should I try to use what little pull I have to ask our store manager and upper management to give her the two paid week quarantine  to stay safe? 

 I don't mind covering her for the time i have left here but I also start a new job in exactly two weeks and my final day here is in 7 days.  The last thing I want is to get COVID before I can even start this new job, ld hate to ask them to wait on me to start any longer. Part of me wants to tell the store manager ""you know what, if you ask her to come back, then im resigning early becasue I can't risk getting it between jobs,"" but I'm unsure if that worth possibly burning this bridge for work.

I've grown to hate my major, and feel like im trapped because my junior year is already halfway over. What do I do if its too late? My college transcript isn't the most decorated either considering I spent my first year at school drinking and getting nothing done. Im bored in class, and usually find something else to do while I turn my mic and camera off.

First off I want to say I don't know how to feel here, and think I may be overreacting. But I just wanted some second opinions here. Thanks!

So, I'm going on a first date with a friend in a few days. We've been friends for about 6 months now, and have gotten pretty close since. We share a few interests, a very similar sense of humor, and she seems to genuinely care about me. I've never really felt that before. I know that she's pretty religious, and she knows I'm an agnostic. To be clear, I don't have any issues with her religion or holding those beliefs.

I thought about the possibility of a relationship a little, and thought about asking her out, but she didn't show any signs further than friendliness. I was completely comfortable staying friends, and was glad to have another close friend. Two days ago she confessed her feelings for me and asked me on a date. After a little thought I said yes, and am honestly looking forward to it and seeing where any potential relationship goes. I've never been in a relationship before, so this will be a pretty big leap and learning opportunity for me.

I would want to have a healthy sex life in a relationship. I wouldn't want to rush into it, and would be completely comfortable (and honestly would prefer) to wait a little while (like several months) before doing anything. And of course I'd never want to pressure her or make her feel uncomfortable with anything.

This is where my concern comes in: I know she's very religious, and we've never talked about sex in any real way, and she seems to even avoid the topic. This could just be her being nervous/courteous and avoiding a potentially awkward topic, and she is a shy person, but I'm a little concerned that all these might mean she might want a ""no sex before marriage"" kind of relationship.

I know it's silly to make assumptions before asking her straight-up, let alone before we even start dating, but it's just been on my mind.

So, my questions are: Is it silly to be worrying about this? How should I ask her about this, and when? Should I be up-front about it, or wait a few months in? Am I just thinking about this way too early?

Also, is it wrong that I feel this could be a dealbreaker in a relationship? I'm only 20, and many years away from wanting to get married. I'd feel like an ass breaking up with a girl over that, but a near-term sex life is something I would want.

Thanks so much for the help!",08Dec2020,1
124,"For some context, my husband and I work together. We have a coworker that has become infatuated with him. We went through a rough patch over it because I suspected an affair. He has since proved to me that they are not having an affair and that he has made it clear to her that he is happily married. Our coworkers have also told me that it is completely one-sided and that she follows him around like a lost puppy. Since her and my husband were work friends, I initially tried befriending her as well. I invited her over for dinner and I was very welcoming to her when she first started working with us (I showed her where the break room was, told her who to avoid, how to place her lunch order, etc.).

While she hasn't overtly attempted to seduce him, she has made it clear that she does not like me. If my husband isn't in sight, her attitude towards me completely changed. She goes from being civil and pleasant to hateful and rude. The entire time she was in our house, she spoke to me maybe three times. She ignored every person (and pet) there except for my husband, so I put my foot down. I told him that I am not comfortable with their relationship anymore and I asked him to stop speaking to her unless necessary for work. He stopped and her attitude towards me has gotten so much worse.

She either will not or cannot take a hint, so I did some Facebook lurking and found out a few things. 1) she still lives with her parents and 2) they are ultra conservative. I created a fake letter from Planned Parenthood (it looks legit) regarding ""what to expect at your upcoming appointment"". I showed my husband the letter and envelope I printed and he agreed that it looks real. I grew up in a conservative house hold as well, so I know the personal hell that a Planned Parenthood letter could create. In my opinion, it's eye for an eye.

But then I felt out college to go home over thanksgiving break, I live like 6 hours away and she live like 30 mins from our university. But I didn’t see her for like 2 weeks between thanksgiving and the week after she was being kinda doggy with plans but she did keep on rescheduling. Until she like admitted that she’s been in a bit of a slump and didn’t want me over cause her apartment was mess n such. I told I didn’t care and would help her clean up. So I went over and I did help clean up and shit. I really didn’t care cause I just wanted to hang a bit as I am starting to like her more romantically i guess. But after a while of it being clean we were just laying in bed when she told me that her ex’s roommate found a bag of her stuff in the apartment and then she decided to go grab it then and there. She didn’t ask me to come with but she didn’t tell me to leave, so she ended up telling me I could stay and her place and wait for her to come back. Which I did, but I have the feeling she wanted me to leave in hindsight. So after like 40 mins she texts me that she ran into her ex and that he called wellness services on her and that she might not be back at all tonight. So I went left and went home, pretty annoyed at how’d the night gone cause I just wanted to spend time with her. But I made a passive aggressive comment like “ well damn I hope it was a nice hairbrush” (that was one of the things in the bag, but I knew there was other shit like a sketch book and photos n shit I was just being a bit pissy) and I think she picked up on that. I feel bad about it now I was being inconsiderate of what she was actually going thro. But she told me that she gonna be evaluated if she needed to stay overnight at an inpatient place cause of the 51 50 psych law (her ex said she was suicidal in the call I believe) and then I never heard from her back. I texted her this morning to apologize for that comment but she has read the message yet it’s still on delivered, but she has opened my snap and posted on her Snap story. And I can’t help but think she’s really mad at me for the comment, or that she’s losing interest and that’s why she’s been so doggy with plans prior to last night, or if I’m just over reacting

Long story short I feel paranoid af cause I’m just an anxious person and needed to rant a bit.",08Dec2020,1
126,"My brain is always conflicted when I think about this. I have two POVS when thinking if my parents are controlling or not, me and then my sisters POV. My sister is my “half-sister” but i don’t consider her that. Also for reference my sister is 20 and I am 14. My sister never truly experienced the “lifestyle” that I live until now bc she has never lived with us full time until four months ago. Basically she thinks my parents are very controlling over very strange and specific things. They are super unpredictable and it’s often hard to ask them things or tell them something bc you won’t know how they react. I know this it’s just hard to accept bc they can be really nice sometimes. Like when my dad gets angry he yells and is so mean and aggressive over little things... but the most RANDOM little things. Then I am angry but feel bad when he’s being nice to me later (bc ik he feels bad for yelling). My parents never apologize for yelling and being downright nasty. My dad makes fights for no reason with my sister (who is the exact same person as him) which causes more stress. I almost have to challenge my loyalties and play both sides so my parents don’t hate me and also so my sister doesn’t hate me. My brother (22) is submissive and listens. Idk how the move to my house is for him since I’m not close with him, but I can imagine it’s hard for him to live in a controlling environment. My mom is not as aggressive as my dad but shows clear favoritism towards me bc my siblings are not her biological children. It’s embarrassing bc it’s so obvious. I think she also has OCD bc she thinks a clean room is a messy room and it’s so irritating. Today I actually said to myself “i’m going to be risky and tape a picture to the wall in my bedroom”. That’s right, I can’t put any pictures on my walls or have any sense of self expression on my walls. It’s just ANNOYING!! I just want to be free and live my life. I cant dye my hair or remotely explore myself. Sometimes my sister and I joke about this house being jail. We literally have a bedtime of 10 PM and have to be up by 8PM. I feel like my parents just control to no end. My mother complains about not being able to sleep in when she literally can any day of the week. They do this to themselves. Try controlling a moody (and sometimes mean) teenage and a rebellious 20 year old along with a 22 year old who just goes along but also talks back sometimes. I confuse myself ho ugh because my sister doesn’t show them respect sometimes. My father has told her not to vape in the house and she still does, along with smoking weed which they don’t know about. I always talk back too and I have to keep an ipad that has social media and where I can have feee reign (not allowed to have social media either), so do we deserve this?? is this normal parenting??

127,"Hi, im almost 27. Made some mistakes, hiding a big secret, lost and don't know what to do, legal or illegal. I relapse into drinking and drugs use. I now stare at this screen and trying to understand life. Still living with father, he has 2 kids with step mother. I see them grow, makes me realize.

128,"Hoping this is the right sub for this.

So, background information just in case: I have always been very sexual my whole life, for as long as I can remember. Since I was pretty young, I would do things like ""make out"" with pillows, chairs or toys when no one was around. I watched porn for the first time at 7, had ""sex"" with my pillow at 8, let my dog lick me *down there* for the first time when I was 9, and orgasmed at 10. At 8, both *King Kong* (specifically the scene where he picks up the girl) and *Me, Myself &amp; Irene* (got milk scene) aroused me (they still do lol) and I would pretend to get my boob sucked by one of my toys. As for the *King Kong,* I would wrap my blanket around me really tight to pretend that I was being grabbed by him (at night, laying in my bed). 

Okay, so I'm not sure if this is normal or not, because as far as I know about the people around me and what they've said (including my boyfriend M19), none of them would relate to this. So, I have had sexual fantasies since I was 8 years old about being kidnapped or abducted, but it wasn't until I was around 10 that I started fantasising about rape. I'm not sure where it started but I remember that seeing sexual violence on tv would arouse me, and I always played the scene over and over as long as no one else was around. If people were around, then I would usually leave to go masturbate. 

Overtime, my sexual fantasies and kinks just got stronger, which I assume is normal. I started watching only forced porn, forced gangbangs, bondage, etc. But it's not just the physical force that arouses me, emotional and psychological manipulation turns me on as well. I mean this in more than just watching porn. Manipulation in general from my boyfriend turns me on. I'm not easy to manipulate...it just turns me on. So, obviously, I also like unfair power dynamics (doctor/patient especially for some reason). Now that I'm thinking about that, I just remembered that in 4th grade I got my first male teacher and I had a lot of trouble not staring at his pants. 

Since then, I've gotten to the point where I can no longer finish unless I am imagining a scenario where I am either being abducted, raped, murdered, drugged, sexually tortured, or multiple at once. But this specifically needs to be being done to be by a sadistic man. Sadism, I am very very aroused by. And I wouldn't even consider myself a masochist. For example, a man could be forcing himself on me, and it not be exactly pleasurable for me, but as long as he is sadistic and deriving sexual gratification from my suffering, then I will be wet and horny until it ends. 

A pretty big portion of my day is spent thinking about my fantasies, and I masturbate on average 1-3 times a day. Of course, I'm most aroused at night and I have always had very sexual dreams but recently it's been almost every night. 

I guess the part that I'm mostly asking if my arousal to sexual violence and sadism is normal to this extent? I don't feel comfortable talking about it in depth with any of the people in my life, so I thought my best shot was reddit. If more information is needed, I will reply, because my memory is not so great and I am probably leaving things out.",08Dec2020,1

130,"Hello r/Advice!

I received an invoice recently from my local pest control for $200. I recently bought this house from my landlord, and it's the same company my old landlord used to pay for the house.

The letter states my account is way past due, and they've made many unsuccessful attempts and are threatening sending to collections, despite this being the only letter I've received. 

The last time they were scheduled through my landlord, they didn't even spray and tried asking my landlord for $200. The usual service is $75, so my landlord cancelled the services and I sprayed the property myself.

Now 6-7 months later, I get this in the mail. I contacted my old landlord, asking if she transferred the account to me, which she says she didn't. I've left a message with the company stating I don't have an account and I'd like to resolve the matter.

131,"Currently my life is at a low and idk how to handle it. I got accepted into a position in Korea that will start at the beginning of February. This is a long term position and I don't know when I will be back in the states. I was supposed to start in August but it got delayed due to covid. 

Before covid I had it all planned out, I would use the remaining months spending time with friends and family. I imagined all the going aways and festivals/events I would enjoy for the last time before I move. Once covid hit, it resulted in me losing my job, a lot of my friends stopped talking to me, and had to move into temporary housing to avoid signing a new lease when I had plans to move.

I’ve been to so many doctors and have had a bunch of testing done and no improvement with treatment. And I’ve also seen 4 different treatment facilities for this in the past couple years.

Please install xyz to make it better."" So I didn't install it, there were two buttons, one with a link that lead to the APK to install something and another one that said ""continue""

She clicked on the continue button and then asked me for help. 

I asked her if anything popped up, like a download starting or something and she said that didn't happen.

——————————————
I’m 20 years old, male, and for my future plans sake, I used a throwaway account. 

I’ve been smoking weed since my sophomore year of high school and drinking since my junior year. Neither have been a problem and frequently decline offers for both and take breaks from both.

I’m currently enrolled in school. I went out of state for my first year and met this guy who I’m still great friends with. I consider him my brother. But he got me on coke. I subscribe to the idea that I want to try everything, at least once. Unfortunately that also means drugs. 

I never thought I’d like coke. I don’t like the feeling of things in my nose, and when I snorted sugar with friends because we thought it was cool for some reason, I hated the feeling.

But coke got me. There hasn’t been a day since October 27, 2019. For over a year straight, I’ve been doing coke. I do almost 3 grams daily. Yes, it’s as expensive as it sounds. 

My issue isn’t the price. I can afford it, I’d like to have that money for other things but it isn’t the big issue. My issue, and why I want to quit, is because it consumes me. 

When I wake up, I do a line. When I do homework and listen to lecture, I’m doing lines. When I’m raiding in Destiny 2 or playing Wizard101 with my friends (yeah, i know. but it’s fun), I’m doing lines. When I’m with my friends in person, I’m doing lines. I even downed a half gram before lunch with my high school Spanish teacher a few weeks ago.

I know this was long winded, but I plan to quit at the start of the year. I bought my last bunch to get through the holidays with my dads side of the family (who don’t support my major course and planned profession) who I absolutely need coke to be able to function around them. 

I’m looking for former addicts and other people around addicts (family, friends, group leaders, etc.) Though all advice is welcome, I don’t want advice from people who haven’t had experience with it or in the field of recovery. This is only because my experience from seeking help from those people is mostly negative, they have this “holier than thou” approach because they don’t understand what I’m actually going through.",08Dec2020,1

151,"So, I'm 19 and work a full time job during the week, and have a part time job on the weekend. Neither employer is aware I have the other job (however both are in drastically different fields). I got the second job when my semester ended, and planned on keeping both going into study next semester. I've realised I'm completely burnt out, and struggling mentally and emotionally when it's just the two jobs; I can't imagine how it'll be when the break is over and the study workload is back. 

I'm scared I won't get anywhere in life, and have a *massive* fear of failure, hence piling on the large workload and frantically trying to make something of myself. I know I need to quit the weekend job for my own sanity, but I only just started that a month ago. I'm scared of the judgment from the employer, and I just don't know how to go about explaining why I want to quit.  I'm the type of person who will push through it to avoid that confrontation, even if I'm dying inside.

152,"Hi there, 
I'm a 20 year old Female in a happy steady relationship that's been going strong for 4 years, we have lived together for over a year and have gone through thick and thin (a butt load of past issues that we both helped each other through). 

I have decided that in rise of the recent events in my life I'd like to have a wee little baby of my own, I have discussed this with my partner and he is 50/50 on the matter however I have explained to him that since I'm the one wanting a child if he wants no responsibility that I'm prepared to raise without needed to him to have any (e.g. he'd basically be a sperm donor). I am completely fine with this is 100% can financially support myself and a baby for at least the next 3 years before having to take up a job, this is without any child support etc. If he wants to be involved though, that's even better!

However my main concern in all honesty is going to be the way it may appear to people and their opinions. The number one thing people say is travel, go crazy partying and other activities, the classic a kid will slow you down attitude. But I've either done this things or would rather do them when I'm older. 

The advice I'm seeking is should I go for it! It's something I've been speaking about for the last 2 years. Here are some of my reasonings...

Part of me thinking this was due to an ovarian cancer diagnosis however very early stages and we stopped cancer growth. They predict if it does come back I'll be in my 25-30s and thay it would be best to remove if anymore problems occur. To be clear I'm not having a child due to this panic it's just more of a way to reaffirm what I'm thinking. 

The reason I state 21 instead if my current age is I've been on birth control since I was 14 and it can take at least a year to get back to full fertility and my last shot (Depo-prevera) wears offs in January. This also gives me another 2 months of thought and discussion.

The third and final reason I'd like a child now is I believe within myself that this is the best time of my life. I'm the best I've been mentally and physically plus a nest egg from savings. My next goal is all certificates/degrees which all offer online courses which allows me to get qualified for dreams jobs, this allows me at least 3 years at home without the need of maternity leave etc. I feel a calling that this is the right time!

Thank you so much for making it all the way through, apologises if it's a tad unclear  happy to answer any questions in the comments and also take advice of where else to post this :)

It got to the point where I was the only reliable male. People who started at my time were utterly incompetent. Couldn’t even do basic things like stock correctly so that it wouldn’t fall.

Suddenly, a coworker told some higher up that I was too stupid for my job. I got put on a PIP. My boss, who was pissed off about this interference, scrambled to help me out, but he wasn't going to stick his neck out for me. Fired!

Job 3: Things are great! My boss is a straight forward kind of guy. He's open about giving feedback and how I need to grow. I like and respect him. I don't really trust many people, after Jobs 1 and 2, but he's a good guy in my book. Over the next couple of months, business becomes crazy busy, so my supervisor hired a manager to help manage me since he was stretched too thin. (My coworker quit one day, so I started to take on his responsibilities.)

My boss hired a friend of a friend. This lady, Carole\*, who is an ambitious go-getter. She assigns me these crazy research topics to teach her how things work at this company. Carole also solicits work from other people to dump on me, even though I'm doing the jobs of two people. As I start to fall behind, Carole sent me an email telling me how I was too slow. Carole offers to put together a tracker of my projects ""to help \[me\] stay organized"" She is also doing other annoying things like constantly changing the parameters for my projects and assigning me tasks that I know will fail. ( I can't speak honestly or else I will look lazy). I sense she is trying to get me fired.

So, what's wrong with me? Why do I keep getting involved in these situations? What should I do?

What is going wrong in my life? How do I fix my career?",08Dec2020,1

This sounds stupid, but I feel lost and mediocre and identity-less on my bipolar meds. I was really dysfunctional and failing at school, work, life in general before I got on meds but now that I’m on them, and a bit more functional, I feel like all the good parts have been taken away. I experienced some major academic success during my hypomanias. My professors were all so enthusiastic about my work and wanted me to publish and I felt happy and loved and intelligent and like I was good at something. I pretty much formed my whole identity around my hypomanic symptoms.

Now I feel like it’s being taken away from me, or like it was all I lie and I’m not really as creative or intelligent as I thought.

Even before I got on meds though I noticed a major decline in my work and was starting to have the same feelings. It’s all going downhill and everyday I become stupider and more mediocre (and worse). Before meds, I still cling to the hope that I would maybe get to have another hypomanic episode but I haven’t produced anything as good as used to, or had any moments where I felt proud of what I was doing and excited about it like I used to in a long time. 

It’s like I’m finding out that all of my good qualities - my only redeeming qualities — are just part of my illness and no longer me. I’m not really that smart or creative or energetic or sexy. But I’m still all of the depressive stuff. That’s me. 

I know that my hypomania is not all good and often leads to full blown manias, with psychotic symptoms and everything. 

Still, I don’t know, I feel like I was using my bipolar symptoms (principally the hypomanic ones) as way to almost compensate for my constant feelings of inferiority and worthlessness and unlovability. But now that my bipolar is starting to get under control, it feels like my coping mechanism has been taken away and I’m left with no self esteem or identity. I just want my old self back. 

Anyone else been through this or have any insight or advice??",08Dec2020,1

167,"Back in sept/august (I think), I started talking to a guy (who is now currently my boyfriend). We quickly became good friends, I also developed a “crush” on him pretty quickly at the same time. I talked to who I thought was my absolute best friend about this guy, but after a little while I stopped even mentioning him to her at all because anytime I brought him up, I was immediately told one of the following:

“He’s gay, probably, and not interested.”
“He’s using you to fulfill some weird fetish he has.”
Or simply just:
“It doesn’t make sense that he’s talking to you.” 
(For context, he was a decently popular guy from our high school, who used to hang out with some asshole guys bc, you know, it’s high school, where she was an art kid who actively hated popular kids and I was pretty much an unstable almost high school drop out turned annoying class clown junior year. She also admitted she had a crush on me in middle school, if that adds anything) 

It really, really messed with my self esteem. I went through all of middle/high school feeling like the “weird girl,” and my best friend knew this well enough. I have bad anxiety, even worse self esteem, and a pretty paranoid brain. I have difficulty trusting people, and I especially did at the time this was occurring, bc I had recently gotten out of an unhealthy three year relationship in January. So, taking what she said to me to heart, I began to believe that he had ulterior motives in talking to me. But we kept talking everyday, usually all day long, and I was able to force myself to not listen to her. He became my best friend, and eventually I cut her off because she overall made me miserable, and he didn’t. I believe that part of the things she said to me were only said bc she was in the process of breaking up with her boyfriend, and maybe she was just sad/jealous? I forgive her, I guess is what I’m saying, whatever her reasons were. I’m now dating him, and I think the last time I felt this happy and content with life consistently might’ve been when I was a really young kid. I feel like I’ve met my soulmate. So she was wrong, of course, and it honestly feels kind of nice to say that. Recently I’ve been feeling bad about cutting her off completely, especially since she did try to reach out like a month or two ago by sending me  a paragraph of everything wrong In her life, and then random pictures of her new boyfriend a week later, which made me feel less bad about what I did lol. I had a conversation with her yesterday, and even though I don’t feel the desire to be her best friend anymore, I think we could be friends, I guess. Is it worth it though? It feels weird NOT to interact with her at all; we’ve known each other since junior high.",08Dec2020,1
168,"Hello, I really need advice. My neighbor is leaving their young dog outside in below freezing weather. The dog does not have adequate shelter for the weather. The dog is young (&lt;1year) and new to their property (last 3 days or so). The dog is not built for this kind of weather. The only interaction I have seen with the person and the dog, the person aggressively told the dog to get away from him. The dog then cowered away from the man.

These neighbors have seen me petting the dog through the fence, because our houses share an alleyway and, after some coaxing, the dog came up to the fence to say hi. They don't have any signs that say ""don't pet the dog"" or anything like that.

I want to help this dog, but I do not want to upset my neighbors or make the situation worse. I am worried that if I call animal protective services, then the neighbor will know it was me, and then be harmful to me or my property as ""revenge"".

I'm going to be turning 27 in a week. I don't have anything to show for it. Even if I want to be in a relationship I don't feel like I'm mentally capable to handle all of the hassle out of it. Besides meeting some crappy people, I think it stemmed from something deeper - once suggested that I might have not received much emotional attachment or development from my earlier years; I do think that it's a possibility of an underlying disorder that stunts my social capability. So I suspect that I will be alone for a while, if not the rest of my life.

I did finally obtain my undergraduate and started to pursue graduate school. But I feel like I still didn't know what I was doing and that I probably shouldn't have pursued if not having clear goals.

My academic advisor even confronted on the matter because I'm not doing well in one of his courses and it hit me, but in the end I think there's truth that I wanted to keep denying that maybe he is right about it not being for me.

178,"I have been friends with a person I’ll call J for about 10 years. They’ve always been my best friend and I’ve frequently said that they’re the person I most love and respect in this world. I’ve just always thought they were a phenomenal person. The last few years have been rough on J. They struggled in school and to maintain a job or have a consistent place to live. When their mom moved suddenly back in March/April, my roommates (who included a mutual friend of mine and Js... let’s call him D) and I let J crash on our couch indefinitely to “ride out covid” obviously that didn’t happen. During Js time with us they put a shit ton of their stuff in our attic and left even more of it hanging around. They stayed here rent free and even often eating our food and the like. When D moved out and we needed to find a new roommate, we told J that if they got a job we’d front them a month or two of rent to take Ds room. This way we’d have a roommate we love and they’d have a proper room with a bed and a permanent place to stay. Well, they refused to up their job searches and weren’t able to get one. So we needed J to leave so that we could find a roommate who would pay rent without some stranger living rent free on the couch. This was in July. J crashed with some other friends for a few months and even got a job. They found a place to stay and asked if they could spend 1 night here over the Halloween weekend to be in town ready to move in on the 1st of November. That weekend they brought over even more stuff. Even though much of their stuff was still in our attic. Including a brand new bike. They also came with the news that they had been fired from their job. And then the next day they dropped that the arrangement they had to move in to their new place had fallen through. And that they actually needed to stay one extra night while they sorted everything out. Sure. No problem. After that whole fiasco yet another friend came to pick them up (oh yeah, they also don’t have a license) but all of their new stuff including the bike got left here. 

Here’s where the real kicker comes in. After the election J and I had some words. J is a firm believer that voting doesn’t matter, that the system is stacked against them (as a gay, black trans person, J isn’t entirely wrong) and that nothing they can do will ever change the system and anyone who tries is foolish. I’ve told J that if they ever wanted support in joining protests, activism groups, or any sort of help in taking action against the system that they feel is so fucked (outside of harm or violence obviously) that I support them and will be with them on every turn. However, in the meantime, the thing that feels most within my power is voting and encouraging others to do so and continuing to challenge our government to do more for us. But I don’t believe it’s going to change in a day. I believe in fighting for steps in the right direction even if it’s nowhere near good enough. During the course of this discussion I got heated. I told J that I couldn’t support them in their endeavor to do nothing. I wouldn’t agree to disagree on whether or not voting was helpful. And then I told them to “keep doing nothing with your life and see how that works out for you” this was uncalled for by me. I regret saying it and getting so heated. 
Since then they have not spoken to me until today. I didn’t  know where they were staying, if they were safe or if I even had a good number to reach out to them. Even though I was shouting into a void, I’ve sent several messages to both J and our friend D who also had some things in our storage to please come get them as we need space for our holiday decorations. D obliged very quickly. J has not responded. This morning I sent the following message to J “Please let me know what we can do with your things. We really can't hold on to them much longer. Hope you are well.”
At 8pm I get a text saying that J will be by tonight pick up their things. No other info. No time. Nothing. 
So some time rolls by and sure enough J comes to get everything. But they can’t fit the bike in the car. 
At this point I’m devastated that a 10 year friendship has gone down so quickly. I haven’t even had a chance to apologize because I can’t contact them. At this point I am mourning for a friendship I no longer want. J is clearly depressed and over the last few months had frankly been miserable company. I’ve been there. I know that when your friend is hurting that’s not the time to up and leave. But I’ve tried everything to get them to a free therapist, to get a job, to seek medical attention that they need. They won’t follow through. I’d do anything for J should they ever need me but I am having extreme mixed emotions over the loss of our friendship. I just want it all to be over. But now it still can’t be. Their bike is still in the living room. Blocking our Christmas tree. What do I do with this bike? What do I do with this friendship? How do you help someone become themselves again?

181,"Hi guys,

This will be a lengthy post so brace yourself, I will try and keep this as straight to the point as possible.

My sister who is in her mid twenties suffers from depression, anxiety, epilepsy, agoraphobia and various physical disabilities due to being premature. She is also as the title suggests, an alcoholic. She lives with my Mum (this is relevant) in a different city to me, my wife, my Dad and my other sister, so my Mum has been essentially her carer for want for better wording.

To put this briefly, she has been an alcoholic for the past few years now and it began with hiding bottles under her bed, sneaking a vodka into every soft drink she would have, and it is now at the point where she was removed from the hospital two days ago as she was going outside for a ""cigarette"" but was actually drinking. Nurses caught her, from my understanding she had a stash outside. I honestly have no idea why she was even allow out considering Covid, but I understand the risks this puts on the hospital and other patients which would explain why they decided to remove her from the hospital. 

She refuses any help, will lie and manipulate and has got to the point where she has no friends, has never had a job, has never had a stable relationship, even hospitals refuse to help her because she throws it back in their faces. The day she went into hospital, she asked to borrow £100.00 for Christmas presents. I gave her the money of course, only to find this is what funded her alcohol. I have no idea how much she purchased and I feel like such an idiot for trusting her.  

As I say this has been ongoing for years; all the help offered from support groups, therapy for her mental health, etc has all ended with her going with the help she needs simply because she would not take it seriously, would show up to support meetings drunk, etc. She is at the point where literally no one will help her unless she helps herself, and she won't.

Before she left the hospital, she promised she would get clean as she understands even at this point, family have started to turn their back on her. She was sober for 6 months before and we were all so proud, we finally began to trust her and it was amazing having my sister back. Well tonight my Mum was awoken at 2am to her sneaking to a local 24/7 shop to purchase 4 bottles of wine. My Mum has told her she needs to leave in the morning and seek housing through the local Council as she cannot do it anymore. My Mum has aged by about 30 years in these past few years and it breaks my heart so much.

I don't want to turn my back on her, even if the rest of the world does, but I have ran out of options and I know she will be dead within the next few weeks if this carries on.

Any advice that could be offered to a brother who is trying to save his sister would be appreciated.

Thank you for your time.",08Dec2020,1

In the beggining, everyone would do it, one'd be saying something and then they'd just stay quiet. After a few days it became old and not funny anymore and most people stopped doing it. Everything went great until a couple of weeks ago, during our English class, a girl was talking about a sensitive discussion topic, and she was muted by someone else. The teacher started saying that this is super disrespectful and that whoever did this must have a really sad life and blah blah blah. I mean, I agree, i find it annoying because it's a private school, my parents are paying so I can be there and some clown decided it's funny to make the lesson go slower and waste our time as well as the teacher's. The teacher made everyone an atendee but that takes up so many time and we could avoid this. I had an idea of who could have done it, and so did everyone else in our class. I reached out to my friend R and asked her if she had done it because she also enters to our kahoots under the nickname chicken, when she knows we can only enter using our name. Again, this is something that only makes us waste time. I politely asked her to stop because there are some students who actually want to learn and said that it was really obvious she was behind this and that everyone in the class knew (this is true). Anyways, who I thought was my friend is now calling me pathetic and someone with a sad life because I can't take a joke and she said other mean things. She's also death threatening me on social media but I couldn't care less. What I want advice on is what to do about the muting situation. Should i snitch on her? Or should i let her keep doing it? Usually, i would stay out of this and I would just let her be an AH but her little joke is affecting me and my other classmates by slowing down the class and stuff. Really I am clueless. excuse my grammar, precisely the reason I take English classes lol.",08Dec2020,1
184,"Hi, everyone, I’m brand new to this sub, I read over the rules but I’m sorry in advance if I say something or post incorrectly.

This is going to be long, and I’m changing names for those involved. It may seem a little crazy, but that’s why I need advice. I need help navigating my current feelings and am so so lost on what to do. 

My boyfriend Adam is friends with someone I used to be extremely close to, Rachelle. She and I were very close when she started to get to know Adam a few years ago and the person Adam was in a relationship with back then, Delilah. Rachelle and I were best friends, and more than best friends at the same time. We had this compassionate, very deep love but it wasn’t sexual. There was no disdain over it, we just couldn’t fulfill each other sexually, but emotionally we could barely be away from one another. Adam and I had known of each other and lightly communicated, but Rachelle was what kept me rooted. We even “got married”. Not for real, but we had a romantic night, exchanged vows, and told everyone we got married. It was silly, but we took it seriously to an extent.

She and Delilah had started to grow very close during and after this, which was all fine, R and I weren’t sexual so an actual relationship wasn’t in the cards that way, but we made a promise that it wouldn’t come between us and whoever we had as partners would have to understand our relationship with each other, but we’d support each other through anything. Over time, things began to change. Delilah was an entrepreneur and regularly got us all involved with business ventures, which she and Rachelle were basically partners for. Mostly involved DJing and throwing events/big parties. After a while, I began a relationship with someone outside of the group that turned very abusive, so I wasn’t physically present at these gatherings and parties for a time, but Rachelle and I didn’t slow in our relationship/friendship. 

We talked every day, all day. She confided in me secrets of Delilah’s, Adam’s, and others that Delilah was bringing into the relationship, kept me in the loop and...really, nothing was very different. Delilah was growing more controlling, over her partners, our friends, and the businesses/gatherings, both in financial aspects and social. She had always been that way to an extent, spying on us and whatever, becoming a pillar we had to rely on in our personal lives. Rachelle loved it, she loved being Delilah’s favorite and helping her have a rein on others, be it those working for them or just friends, loved being involved in spying and making sure everyone acted how Delilah wanted. Everyone sort of knew this, but didn’t pay any attention because everyone wanted to be Delilah’s partner, friend, associate or...just anything, really. Her personality drew you in. 

After a year or so, I started learning that Rachelle was keeping me a secret from our friends and those we came to know as family, downplaying our relationship to the point everyone thought I was ignoring her, not seeing her, blowing her off and being an all around terrible person. At the time, I was slightly bothered, but I also felt...a little elated, maybe? Because I was still her confidante and we had something special. I also want to mention that I was still open about our relationship with Delilah and everyone else, so for a while when they made comments about Rachelle not having me around, I just brushed it off. Things started to slide when my sister (who was also a part of this group, but admittedly closer to Delilah and Rachelle than me) was in a relationship with someone online that supposedly knew Delilah and was her sibling. He’d disappear for days or weeks, gaslight her, and was all around secretive/abusive. She knew something was up, but this guy (and Delilah) made her appear crazy to all of us. We got a hunch that perhaps this person wasn’t real or was actually Delilah, but he was so good at having a different personality we didn’t pay any mind. Rachelle agreed with us, and also shared doubts about Delilah keeping some fairly big secrets, but was okay with it. She hoped, in part, that our suspicions were true. Also around this time is when I started noticing things a little odd at the parties or at home with all them. People who worked for Delilah or friends would confide certain things to me that they heard from Delilah about various people or situations, and it didn’t often match up. (People came to me with this stuff because I was fairly relaxed and stayed away from drama, so I was like a known secret keeper they felt they could trust. I wasn’t really, I was just...anti-drama lol) Some of the stuff was serious, over money problems and cheating partners. I shared some with Rachelle, who was glued to Delilah at this point and they did everything together, built, created, recruited, they were partners. Rachelle was okay with everything Delilah was doing and fully supported the financial control, lies, rumors and everything else. There was talk at one point about turning into a cult, and to outsiders, that’s what they thought we were later on. And by then...well, it was pretty true. Anyway, by now Rachelle had joined in on how my sister was being treated. They blamed her for drinking (which she did have a problem with), belittled her, and blamed her suspicions in the relationship with her online guy all on her and that it was all her fault because she was crazy. It was becoming an extremely toxic place. 

My sister ended up cutting them all cold turkey and getting out, in which time I supported her and agreed that she wasn’t safe around them. I decided to get more involved in an effort to brighten things up, maybe mediate everyone and help out, but the lies and secrets kept coming out. Delilah and Rachelle had turned into very toxic, very mean people and their personal group were basically mean girls who didn’t see beyond themselves. No opinions were allowed if it didn’t agree with them and if you did disagree or go against Delilah, you were kicked out, slandered or just made miserable. Our friends, staff and family began talking and figuring out the different lies or secrets, and when Delilah got a sniff of it, she went crazy. Was blaming everyone for spreading rumors, not appreciating her and all she’s done for us, for treating her terribly, and Rachelle was along for the whole ride. 

I discovered Rachelle was still underplaying our closeness, keeping our relationship secret-at the time, I had convinced myself it was so Delilah wouldn’t get jealous, but a friend from their “inner circle” would send me texts showing Rachelle talking poorly about me or insulting me, and began telling me when this would happen. I was hurt, but justified it to myself because I cared about her more than anything. So when some of our friends told me all of the stuff they were uncovering about Delilah, different stories and lies (both involving people still there or others who had been fired/threatened to leave), I made the mistake of going to Rachelle about it. 

I confided in her, asking what we should do, but she only wanted to tell Delilah. I asked her many times not to, but she did anyway. Only...she told Delilah I wouldn’t tell her specific names of people, tell her the whole story, and so Delilah zeroed in on me. We got into a massive fight that a lot of people were privy to, she told me I was causing this to happen, people to feel unsafe, starting drama, and all this crap and just made it worse because I couldn’t be honest with Rachelle, who I apparently treated terribly anyway. And for Rachelle, she was right there. I wasn’t about to say I was honest with her, I had been there for her every day, I haven’t gone anywhere, she still came to me, confided in me, loved me, trusted me, else it would be Rachelle under fire. She thanked me after for lying/covering for her to Delilah. 

Adam was present for most of this timeline, but he was never really involved with drama or problems, he adored Delilah and kept on the edge of everything social. He was a sweetheart, focusing on school and games and hearing what they wanted him to hear. So all he was aware of was that people were treating Delilah poorly. Rachelle had told me at different points they didn’t involve Adam in most things on purpose, because that wasn’t his position to be included in this at the time. 

After this happened, I left. Had nothing to do with Delilah or anything they were part of. I told Rachelle that I would stay available for her 24/7, but I couldn’t be in that environment anymore. Those who were left were barely hanging on because it was always such a terrible atmosphere. And after seeing what had happened to me, others either left or just kept quiet. 

It didn’t take long for me to start hearing that Rachelle was telling people I left her, that she didn’t know what she did, that I was being cruel to her, and meanwhile I’m over here entirely confused at to why THAT is even being said. We still talked the same as we did before, albeit with more tension. I confronted her about what I was hearing, she started telling me the same things. She couldn’t understand why I left them, they didn’t do anything wrong, why would I treat them this way when all they did was love me? 

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve made mistakes. I didn’t go to the parties or gatherings very much for a few months, but I never stopped supporting her, I was there every time she came to me, needing me, wanting to talk. 

After a while of hearing that, I stopped talking to her, too. I had left an abusive relationship, I had left their unhealthy situation, I was single, working, writing, healing and I felt happy. Things were good for me (and my sister, I want to add. She left the online dude and was blossoming, growing, doing so well) and for the first time in a long time, I could feel my heart and mind healing. 

A few months passed and I did end up going back with my tail between my legs just so I could see her again. I missed Rachelle and wanted to be around her. I still had friends there, and was getting romantically involved with an old friend who was there (I don’t know if I mentioned this, but the place everyone was always at was a building owned by Delilah that was the hang out spot, where they threw parties and events, etc, so that’s where I refer to by ‘there’ hah) 

All in all, after a few more months, Delilah left with Rachelle and Adam. Everyone went their own ways, Rachelle and I were back to some semblance of friendship, Adam was going through a lot of turmoil because they came clean to him about secrets and certain lies that threw him for a loop. I came to a realization that I couldn’t be in Rachelle’s life anymore because it was so unsafe and unhealthy, with or without Delilah. She hadn’t been a real friend to me in a long time, if ever, and the relationship I thought we had simply wasn’t real. Delilah did end up breaking things off with Rachelle, but they do keep in touch and talk. Adam and Rachelle had grown close in all of this, he ended up leaving Delilah and wanting to move on and heal. 

Rachelle and I did talk again (around April this year) and she, Adam and I hung out. He and I became fast friends, and despite everything we’ve individually been through, we’ve worked hard to have a healthy and honest, loving relationship that did become something serious, something we want to last. Because of our relationship, Rachelle is still around. Earlier this year I wanted to test the waters with her, but did realize the same as I did before-that she’s not good for me. As much as I miss her sometimes, she’s not good for me. I have terrible anxiety around her, I don’t feel safe, period. I’ve forgiven everything, but these feelings won’t go away. Sometimes it feels *okay* when we play games together, but there are other times-especially when it comes to her and Adam, that everything just...intensifies. I panic. 

He’s been very understanding, and I’m not the kind to tell my partner they can’t be friends or talk to someone, and I understand why they’re friends and their history, all of our pasts, but sometimes it feels unbearable when she’s around. I sweat and shake, feel that tight jitteryness in my chest and like I can’t breathe. I’ve been honest with him since day one, but neither of us have a solution other than that she can be part of his life and not mine, but that feels worse than dealing with it when she is around. I don’t want there to be part of his life I can’t be involved in. But at the same time...I can’t be around her. And I have no desire to be. 

Short of breaking up with him (which I don’t feel is an option, because our relationship is otherwise so so wonderful and loving), cutting her out of my life but getting used to her in his, or dealing with her when she’s around, I’m not sure what to do. 

I know my options, but what I’d really like to know is what would you do? Or what would you tell me to do? The anxiety I feel over her makes me feel broken and stupid, so I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is even valid still",08Dec2020,1

He calls me every now and then when he’s drunk (2 days a week average) and I don’t always get back to him because it can get to the point of him rambling or repeating things over and over and it’s annoying 

My mom just says don’t worry about it and don’t call him back if you don’t want to but I just kinda feel for him because if I was lonely and I have a kid that loves me and I can actually talk to id want him to ya know, talk to me.

187,"FIL moved into my house almost three years ago under false pretenses and has been manipulating my wife into feeling sorry for him ever since so he can live in our home and we're at the end of our rope. He's such a burden on our family and relationship that our quality of life has really suffered. If anyone can help suggest resources or programs that can help get this man out of my house it would help tremendously.

He's mid-50s, so can't draw social security yet, and he's been unemployed for years so he doesn't qualify for any unemployment assistance that I know of. Because he lives with us, the state wants to factor in our joint income as support, which disqualifies him from every other program we've looked at.

Then to make matters worse, he's in poor health with no insurance. A lifetime of alcohol and drug use has left him nearly blind, his teeth are nearly all rotten out, his hands tremor, and (in my non-medical opinion) he shows early signs of dementia. So he doesn't work and can't drive.

This last year has been especially hard on us. Because of COVID and job changes, we're not in a position to keep supporting this man indefinitely. I certainly can't afford to buy health insurance for him without defaulting on my own bills, so what can I do? We don't have enough money to get him any medical care, and he doesn't have any money of his own. Are we just stuck?

Tl;dr: Father-in-law in poor health can't support himself, but doesn't qualify for assistance. How do I get him out on his own?",08Dec2020,1
188,"I am not used on getting gifts – it never was a tradition in my family. I don't even get birthday gifts. Sometimes, friends or relatives will give me something like chocolate or beauty products but honestly I don't like it very much.

At first, I thought about board games because I want to have some, but then I thought it would be a little sad for him to buy something for me to have fun with other friends but him.

189,"Hey everyone, this is a throwaway account.

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 5 months now, however we've been friends for over a decade prior to entering this relationship.

We met when we were really young and used to be best friends, however we had to break off our friendship many times in the past because I had noticed he would always call me names or treat me disrespectfully, I had noticed a pattern and there were times where I couldn't handle it anymore, so I broke off our friendship and we stopped speaking for a couple of years.

However, we were able to reconnect early this year and he apologized profusely for the way he treated me, he said he realized he had so much internalized misogyny he ended up taking it all out on me, said he could never forgive himself for what he did and stated I always meant so much to him and he never wanted to lose me again.

When we started speaking again, he truly seemed like a changed person. He seemed more stable as a whole. He confessed his feelings after a while and said he had always felt this way for me, but never had the guts to tell me. We started our relationship and it seemed so perfect at first.

However, the first red flag came up pretty early when he was so eager to define our relationship even though I stated several times I wanted to take things slowly, he seemed unable to understand I needed time to process things.

Whenever I go visit him, or he comes visit me, he never wants me to leave. He gets really upset whenever I leave and he always tries to make me change my plans so that we can spend more time together. But whenever I stay true to my decisions, he starts acting cold, dismissive and when I confront him about it he says it's all in my head and he's actually ""acting normal"".

He doesn't understand the concept of boundaries very well, whenever he wants me to do something I'm not comfortable with, and I say ""no"", he keeps pushing me and asking again and again until I end up saying yes out of exhaustion.

He's very vulnerable and has suffered a significant amount throughout his life, so he's often in a bad mood, mostly sad or defeated and constantly needs my attention or support, which I always try to give him as best as I can. But whenever I'm busy, he blows up my phone and acts like he's so worried about me because I can't answer straight away. It's also worth mentioning that whenever I'm dealing with something and I try to talk to him, he's really dismissive and acts like it's not a big deal, and he goes back to talking about himself. 

He's also extremely jealous, to the point where he brings up my past relationships and asks several questions trying to compare himself to the people I used to date, and forces me to answer things like who's more good looking, who's better between the two, etc.

He's also talking about getting married and living together as soon as possible because he can't stand the idea of not being with me all the time. 

He often claims he loves me so much and he's never loved someone like this before. The thing that scared me though, is that we were having a conversation the other day and he straight up said to me that if I ever were to leave him, he would kill himself, because his life would have no meaning. 

I really care for this person so much and I see all of the pain he's been through, I can tell he's extremely vulnerable and I'd really like to help him overcome this suffering, I try my best to communicate clearly with him. I told him about many of the things I mentioned before and he actually listens and tries to better himself.

I'm just so scared about the whole thing because he seems so obsessed with me and sometimes it honestly feels scary. I feel like I'm forced to love him and help him out because otherwise he might do something dangerous to himself.

What do you guys think?
Thank you so much for reading until this point. I'm sorry for any mistake I might've made, English isn't my first language!",08Dec2020,1
190,"Where I'm from, you can't be charged for sending nudes of yourself to someone when you're under 18.  

So I'm 21 and my ex is 20, we dated before and she sent me nudes when she was 18 and I was 19. We had a bad breakup and I told to delete everything but she wants her nudes saved on our chat, and I can't delete that chat as it's saved on Snapchat, so it's there permanently. I've blocked her but the chat will still be there if I unblock, meaning I'm still in posession.

So what's stopping her from just going to the local police station and being like ""Hey, I took these nude photos when I was 16 and he still has them"". Even tho she sent them when she was 18, she could lie and just say they were old. How can I prove that the photos were actually overage? All I have is the timestamps which prove she sent them when she was 18, but they don't show when she actually look them.

Reason why I'm worried is because we had a breakup and she said that she'll get revenge 1 day

I’m lucky to be working at all and I’m working from home due to the pandemic. I’ve been ready to move but I was stuck in a 12 month lease and then I found another apartment to move in to since I hadn’t found any better job opportunities in December last year. Then the pandemic happened and now I feel like I need to start looking for job opportunities in a completely different career industry since radio, tv, film is nonessential and I don’t have the resources to move to an expensive state and work only part time since that’s usually all that’s available for entry level. 

The fact that I’m working remotely makes it the perfect time to make a change! So my idea is to move from DFW area to Austin , tx. I’m not happy here in DFW anymore and haven’t found anything worth turning into a career here and haven’t had any luck in the relationship department. Austin, Tx would be great since I do like that city a lot and I have a friend that lives in a city nearby.  I could move there and continue working remotely while looking for new job opportunities that are remote or in Austin. I haven’t figured out what industry or job roles I would enjoy doing other than video production/tv/film but I feel that I’m going nowhere and doing nothing by stating in DFW.

195,"So basically I'm going to go into detail about what the title says... I just turned 17, and last year I built my first pc, which has served me very well throughout gaming and schoolwork. I will openly admit that I don't work as hard as I should on school, but I get mid to high 80's in grade 12 (which is above what I need for entry in a uni I want to go to, but just shy of shared my parents want me to go). Today I showed my dad a prebuilt that I'm considering getting which has a 3070 in it. I'm dying to try out RTX, and for the price of the prebuilt, there's absolutely no competition. I planned on selling my old gaming laptop, some shoes, and my current PC to pay for the PC (which I'm perfectly fine doing)... But my dad just told me that starting next year, he wants me to quit gaming completely. 

This shook me in more ways than one. Firstly, my parents don't know I struggle with depression due to existential dispair/anxiety, and that I use gaming as an outlet. I also have made bonds with friends on games and I have so many memories and good times playing. And they just want me to give it up? Why? It seems they think society frowns on those who enjoy video games past teenage years and I know for a fact they do. They mock my cousin's for continuing to play and also look down on any adult who admits to enjoying games. This has literally got me in years writing this because I don't know what other outlet I have. I make music and play some sports, but gaming is just such a mental break. They can't tell me that it's any different than making music or watching tv/YouTube/Netflix I mean COME ON! 

To conclude this rant, it's my money so why shouldnt I be able to decide what I do with it? It's a somewhat justified purchase as I actually would use it for school as well as gaming. Additionally, I literally benefit mentally by clearing my mind thanks to gaming! 


P.S. I absolutely adore my parents, and they aren't bad people at all! They are honestly the best parents I could imagine and they're incredibly supportive. I just think they are both somewhat ""archaic"" when it comes to gaming... Please do not hate on my parents as that isn't the goal of this post, I just want others opinions on the matter.",08Dec2020,1
196,"I have two people in my life who talk and talk and don't notice the cues that I'm done with the conversation. They are my boyfriend (20m) who has ADHD and my sister (10f) who displays a lot of ADHD symptoms but isn't diagnosed.

I asked a question similar to this about my boyfriend on an old account but the replies I got were asking if my boyfriend had ADHD (which he was recently diagnosed with and we didn't know about it at the time) and saying that if I bring it up then I need to do it when he's not talking so it doesn't hurt his feelings...but the thing is he just doesn't stop talking.

The only time he doesn't talk is when he's focused on his videogame or watching videos but if he isn't actively telling me about it then he's so zoned in that I can't have a conversation with him because he can't hear me or I've become so exhausted from listening to him that I just sit completely zoned out and unable to talk and I just try to regain my energy so I haven't been able to bring it up. We're long distance right now which makes conversation a lot less and I can regenerate energy while we aren't talking.

I have issues with being too nice to the point that it hurts me and I convinced myself that I was the problem for not being interested enough. I'm very introverted and conversations exhaust me. I ignore it too long and then I have no energy to stay present but I still blamed myself and I'm only now realising that I don't have to subject myself to it all the time if it affects me the way it does.

My sister is similar but I don't know how to talk to a child and what is off limits or if I should bring any of this up to her. My parents didn't teach me anything and I had to learn from my friends which was really embarassing a few times. She's very sensitive similar to how I was and I don't want to embarrass her. I know I've brought up some other things to her like not interrupting my mom while she's talking to other people which she did get a little embarrassed by. I feel like if I'm complaining about her to her then it makes it more embarassing and it's really stressful for me since I don't know what to say.

In these situations, I've tried to give short answers, I've tried to leave the room, I've tried to say that I'm doing something that requires my focus, I've tried to not talk at all, and I've realised that they don't see the cues.

They both continue talking if I give short answers. My sister is better at stopping if I don't respond or tell her I'm doing something else but my boyfriend doesn't stop talking and has talked for close to an hour on several occasions with me giving no replies. If I leave the room, my boyfriend starts talking again as soon as I come back and my sister just follows me and talks.

I don't want to insult either of them but it's costing me our relationships and my mental health.

I still want to support them and listen to their interests but not to the extent that I have been.

How can I bring up the conversation in a nice way and should I talk to my sister or let her learn herself in her own time?

TL;DR: My sister (10f) and my boyfriend (20m) have issues with not noticing my cues that it's time to end the conversation. I feel bad bringing up things like this and don't want to insult them by bringing it up but it's starting to affect my mental health and our relationships.

197,"So I’m looking for some opinions/advice on gift giving during Christmas, for someone who never reciprocates. 

I know Christmas isn’t all about receiving things or even gift giving. But I have a sister who I always buy for. Every year I buy her decent gifts. Nothing crazy, but I’m 19 years old and I spend a chunk of my small paycheque on her. She rarely returns the favour. 

I would understand if she had no money, I wouldn’t expect anything. But I have not much money yet I always manage to get her a few things. 

I can’t help but feel irritated because I know she has enough money to buy gifts for her family. She has CONSTANT packages coming in the mail and she’s constantly buying things for herself and her boyfriend. Yet she can’t return the favour for me? Every year?? She is 24 years old. 

The other issue is she does this for birthdays too and to my father. She never buys him anything for his birthday or Christmas even though he drops a ton of money on her for her special occasions. She always openly expects gifts but has no plan in giving back anything. 

I ended up buying her a few things this year. But I’ve just been thinking maybe I should keep them for myself or give them to someone else considering I never get anything from her. Am I just being selfish/greedy?",08Dec2020,1
198,"I am a 24yr old female. I have been living on my own since I was 18, states away from my family. I have always considered myself very independent, as my parents instilled in me. We are very close, but i set out on my own path to fulfill life goals. I still see them relatively frequently. I have paid for school myself, bought my own car, house, etc. I give back to my family as much as I can, and I can generally say I am proud of that...

However, roughly 8 months ago, I got out of my first ""big"" relationship, which was extremely toxic. It was the first relationship I have had where we lived together, shared bills, loans, life goals, visited each other's family, etc. As sweet as things were, he was horrible, with an increasingly bad temper and ego. I was in that daze for a year and a half, before my close friends held an intervention. I won't go into the details, but he was verbally, financially, and mentally absuive. I was living in a cloud. I was so used to being numb that I didn't even realize this. I got the courage to leave him, and a weight was lifted. 

Suddenly, things got a little better. I started to find myself out again, find interest in things, etc. I wouldn't say I was depressed, but just suffocated. I wouldn't say I have fully recovered, but I felt ""normal"". 

Sometimes I get really sad, and feel really lonely. Sometimes I cry. Other times I am so happy amd proud to be on my own. But deep down I crave emotional connections and affection. Sometimes I feel like I am one of those girls, that always needs validation from someone else. Other times I feel like that I value my independence so much that I will never be capable of love. I can't find a balance, if there is one. I feel like this most times. When I am at work, I am more chipper and social. It is because I am distracted. Everyone views me as really happy. But I come home and feel so lonely. Like I need to be hugged and told I am cared for. Or comforted. Or texting with someone. 

I recently started dating again and found someone who I thought was different and similar to me. I have them discovered I have a pattern for going for the type of man that feeds off this vulnerability in a negative way. My already small friend group has been suffocated. I feel anxious if I see them because I am berated for not answering phone calls/speaking to him a certain way/being accessible. It makes everything feel worse. But at the same time, I will ocassionally get that emotional aspect that I so badly want. From someone who so badly wont give it. I recognize that it is negative, but I dont know how to stop. To get out of this loop. Either way, I am lonely. I feel as if I rather be lonely talking to someone than lonely by myself. I cant tell if this is depression, or me just not being comfortable with myself and secure with myself. How can I tell? When is too much, too much? What can I do to not feel like this?",08Dec2020,1

200,"I'd like to start off and say i am in no way shape or form in the right. I have done so many things to hurt her and I dont think I will ever forgive myself. These are the reasons she has bad memories. I am to blame. 
 
A few years ago we started dating and stupid 12 year old me I guess lost intrest. (No clue why id ever leave such an amazing person) At this point in my life i was really depressed and felt like all hope was lost. This one girl (that i now know is a phycopath that was using me to try to kill my amazing hopefully future wife that i will refer to as L for now on) was really nice to me and i believed it. This person manipulated me into thinking i was loved and cared for. At this point in life my life L was sucidal. When i was getting manipulated into believing lies i was too scared to tell L how i was feeling. I didnt want her to hurt herself. Sadly:(( this led to me cheating because i was too scared to just say the truth. I now know how wrong and evil that was. But i feel so so terrible 😿. Theres nothing i will do to forgive myself. 

Long story short she faked the love for a while and then cheated on me. Throughout all of this L was trying her hardest to tell me and i dont know why i didnt just listen. Shes always done the best for me. The best person i know. But no. I had to cheat. Lie... and i feel like im hating myself for it... But thats not what this is about.

Those memories of me being with another girl haunts L every night and day. Its killing me that ive hurt her so bad and i feel like theres nothing i can do to fix it.

When she is not having bad memories we feel like the best couple ever. We laugh and show so much love and affection. We are here for each other no matter what through thick and thin. We are amazing... 
But when the memories come😿-- she calls me stuff like liar, cheater-- says ive never loved her never cared. 

We are still young (~15 - ~17) and i do not believe either of our parents would help us with this. 
We both have said we wanna marry each other. We want forever and loyality.

I just want to prove to her that i will always love and like and want her and her only forever. I wanna prove im gonna be here for her always and forever. I wanna prove im hers.


someone help please😭",08Dec2020,1
201,"This may be a long post, but I NEED genuine advice.  Preferably from someone who has been in this situation. FYI, I’m a 28 year old female.

In 5th grade I was teased by a boy. We will call the boy, A.  He used to pick on me a lot, but I would just ignore him.  Nothing much to say about middle school or the first part of high school. Junior year, A and I got really close.  We tried to date, but he had a drinking problem and I didn’t want to be a part of that so things kind of fizzled out.  However, spending time and talking to A made me extremely happy and that’s the first time I felt like I was in love.  That’s when I felt like I met my soulmate.  I can’t really put it in words, but he was my person.  My parents fought a lot during that time and I could ALWAYS call or text him and he would just listen if that’s what I wanted or he would distract me from it.  He always knew what to do or say.  I loved this man.  We talked junior year and senior year, but only “dated” a couple of weeks during that time.  I actually got a tattoo of something that reminded me of him (not his name or anything even close, but it was and still is a very sentimental tattoo). I didn’t tell him about the tattoo until months after I had it.  He loved it.  

After high school we lost touch, but I thought about him all the time.  Sometime in 2013 we reconnected and started dating.  He was sober, but was fine with me drinking around him.  I moved into his apartment with him and his brother and everything was fine and perfect.  In 2015(ish) we moved into my parents house to save money for a down payment on a house.  That’s when things got bad.  One night, while making our dinner plates, A just fell out on the kitchen floor. He started sweating profusely and wouldn’t “wake up”.  My dad somehow got him up and I ran a cool bath for him.  He ended up saying that it was just anxiety and he passed out.  I thought it was weird, but why would I question it? 

In 2016 we bought a beautiful 1 bedroom/1 bath bungalow on the lake.  It was perfect.  We had two dogs and a cat and life was amazing.  Until it wasn’t.  One Monday evening I was laying in bed watching tv while A was outside doing yard work.  When A walked into the bedroom he collapsed on top the floor.  I called out his name and there was nothing. He was still breathing, but not responding.  I frantically called my dad and basically said “he passed out again and isn’t waking up, I need you to tell me it’s okay to call 911” (I didn’t know if I was being overly dramatic at the time).  Anyways, of course my dad tells me to call 911. When the paramedics got there they KEPT asking me what he took. And I kept telling them that he didn’t take anything. The only thing we had in the house was Tylenol and my birth control. They told me a couple of times that he overdosed on something and I just didn’t believe them at all.  Anyways, he finally wakes up right before they take him to the hospital and he has zero explanation other than being tired and dehydrated.  The paramedics kept telling him that they needed to take him in, but he refused. I was pissed at him. He scared me half to death and didn’t even care to get checked out.  I was pissed for days. He refused to go to the doctor because he didn’t have health insurance.  No answers ever came of it and we just moved on. 

Fast forward to December 2017. A, my mom and I go on a trip together for my moms 50th birthday.  My mom was sick at the time so she had pain meds with her.  One night on the trip my mom pulls me to the side and tells me that some of her pain meds are missing and that she thinks maybe A could have taken them.  I confront A and he completely denies it.  Again, I’m naive and I believe A.  Which I know is stupid. 

Two weeks after getting home from the trip I find suspicious items in the bathroom trash can.  Q-tips without the cotton, alcohol wipes and a tin can that was burned on one side.  I took pictures of it all because I didn’t want him to deny anything. I went to work and googled what all of those items were used for.  I realized he was an addict.  When I got home from work that day I packed up a couple of bags and left.  He denied everything for a while and then finally admitted that he was addicted to opiates and started shooting up.  I never went back.  I realized I didn’t know who he was.  I never wanted to date an addict.  Once an addict, always an addict and I didn’t want to always have to question if he was sober or not. 

Anyways, I ended up having to file bankruptcy because I found out he wasn’t paying our mortgage.  We also had a joint credit card that he racked up.  

I learned a lot of lessons in that relationship.  However, I have NEVER gotten over the feeling that he’s still my soulmate.  I messaged him on Facebook this morning just saying hey basically.  (During the 3 years apart he lost his dad and I lost my mom so we chatted about that).  I miss him so incredibly much, but I would never admit that to him.  I’m still mad for all of his lies and betrayals.  He let me watch him OD twice and he did nothing to stop.  Not only did he ruin my credit, but he also ruined my trust.  So WHY do I still feel so attached to him?  I hadn’t talked to him in a couple of years until this morning, but I think about him every single day.  I’ve dated other people and nothing has come even close to the feeling I had/have for him.  I still feel like he’s my other half.  He moved one state over so we never run into each other or anything.  I know this whole thing probably sounds like a jumbled mess, but that’s kind of how I’m feeling right now.  I love him so much. He says he’s two years sober, but why would I believe that?  Even if he is, I still don’t want to be with an addict... but I want HIM.  Ugh.  Idk what to do.

202,"I was alone for most of the day, a feeling I haven’t had to endure much as of recently. Or at least, I’ve had external factors keeping my mind at bay. But now that I’m alone, without any drugs to tell my mind to shut the fuck up, old habits are slipping in. Old habits of self hatred and existential questioning. Maybe it’s because I watched Euphoria and Her in the same day but I just don’t feel good today. I see parts of myself in each of the main characters and it caused nothing but unhealthy introspection to see them play out on screen. The one question I can’t get off my mind; why can’t I ask for help? No matter how bad things get, no matter how sad I feel, I just feel this inability to reach out to anyone. It’s not that I don’t want to reach out to people it’s more that I just feel like I can’t. And I don’t know why that is. I’ve run through 500 different possibilities in my head and none of them bring me any sort of comfort. Why is it that when I’m feeling at my worst that I just freeze up and isolate myself from anyone else. I’ll run to instagram to indirectly scream for help 10 times out of 10 before I reach out to anyone and let them know how I’m feeling. WHY? THAT’S NOT NORMAL.",08Dec2020,1
203,"My grandfather passed away while I was living abroad. He was unwell when I left 3 years ago and I knew it was the last time I would see him. I grieved then and had to terms with his death over time even though he was still alive. He died back in March after a long battle with illness and I watched from afar my family struggle and the pain they went through but I wouldn't allow myself to go back to that place. I had to return home in September due to covid-19 and haven't been able to acknowledge it. I have cried once with my mum and spoke with my grandmother briefly. We were supposed to visit his grave and I bailed because I just can't bring myself to. I'm afraid my family thinks I'm callous but I want to remember him reasonably healthy and happy like when I left. I want to hold on to that memory. I have been avoiding visiting my grandmother more because of it. I'm perplexed on how to feel. I'm always on the verge of crying, unsure whether that's because I'm heart wrenched about having to leave my home abroad or my inability to face reality. Maybe a mixture of both. Any advice/reassurance would be great.",08Dec2020,1
205,"I (20F) am an oldest child, and was raised by religious parents who really limited my access to lots of information and activities other kids were familiar with. I didn’t get a phone until I was almost 14, and even when I did I wasn’t allowed to use the internet or even know my own passcode (my dad had to sign me in and had access to all my accounts, including my email). My mom read my journals. I wasn’t ever allowed to use the oven or stove, wasn’t allowed to make social media posts without running them all by my parents, and couldn’t even post the stories I wrote to entertain myself on Wattpad (I was a lonely kid) because my parents thought any online friends I made would somehow come after me. My dad would, every once in a while, go through my phone, including all of my texts and emails, then get mad at me for what he found without asking about context. This was humiliating, especially as I got older and started having crushes and boyfriends (I wasn’t allowed to be in a room alone with my first boyfriend until I was 16). Any form of rebellion on my part led to shouting matches, threats to withhold financial support for college, yelling “get out of my house!” and then months of grounding. I’ve got ADHD, OCD, and Anxiety, so that mental cocktail mixed with lots of loud noises and conflict made for some really stressful nights.

All this would be upsetting but okay—I know other kids have it way worse—if some of it wasn’t still going on. I’ve been at college for almost three years now, but because of COVID I’ve spent most of the past year at home, and that’s been...draining. I worked hard in high school and currently attend college on a presidential scholarship, meaning I don’t have to pay tuition, but my parents pay for my housing and this past year they got me a car (it’s my grandpa’s old one). I’d be grateful for the help if they didn’t constantly hold it over my head. They keep threatening to take the car, and withdraw their support for housing, if I talk back to them. Even my own money isn’t my own, because my dad has full control of the savings account where my steady paychecks go, and I don’t have access to the account. I have to ask him and justify what I want to use the money for every time I run out of money in my debit. It’s embarrassing to have to account for every purchase to him, and I can’t even lie about what I’m using the money for, because he also has access to (and monitors) my debit’s purchase history. Plus, dad is absentminded, so sometimes he’ll forget to transfer the money and I’ll be broke for more than a week. To make matters worse, he still has access to my email account and goes through it all the time. He gets on me about assignments and classes and grades—but he’s also read emails of a much more personal nature and can’t seem to understand why I hate that he’s got my life under constant surveillance. 

I’ve kept clashing with my parents, especially now that I’m out (to immediate family and a couple friends) as bi and distancing myself from my childhood religion, and I really can’t take feeling so helpless. True, they’ve never followed through on the financial threats, but those threats aren’t empty. They really do have full control of my money and they get offended every time I ask if we can renegotiate the power balance. I really think that I’d be willing to give up the financial support altogether just to feel like I can live my own life, but because they’ve always refused to let me do anything for myself I don’t know the first thing about financial independence. Plus, we’re in the middle of a pandemic—I don’t know if my current tutoring jobs would be enough to pay for housing, a vehicle, insurance... 

Oh, and I’m unmedicated for my mental conditions, which has been messing with my brain and giving me depressive episodes, and my parents keep saying that they’re not opposed to medication but they think I should do some sort of therapy first. I keep telling them that I’ll do it, but they never sign me up and I don’t have access to ready funds so I can’t go behind their back to do it. I’m at my wit’s end. 

Ugh. I love my parents, I really do. They gave me a good start in education, lots of good memories, and a loving home. I think part of the controlling is just because I’m their first child and they’re used to taking care of me—and understandably terrified that I could blunder and mess up my life. But I’ve got to be able to have my own life in order to mess it up, and right now I don’t! I want to get out there, have a career, try new things, travel—but they’ve never let me do anything on my own, so now I’m overwhelmed by everything I don’t know, and sad, and scared, and stressed to the max. 

So yeah. How would I go about becoming financially independent? What options do I have? Is there any way to make my parents see how trapped I feel right now and give me more control over my own life? Should I just wait it out until COVID is over, or until I get my bachelor’s degree? I was thinking maybe I could go get my master’s in England—surely an ocean of distance would do something. But I’m overwhelmed by all the different considerations, and I don’t even know where or what to research. Some help would be very much appreciated.",08Dec2020,1

207,"The title is gonna make me sound like dick. Of course hooking up with someone your friend likes is an asshole thing to do. But there’s a little more to this. Basically I graduated in 2019 with some great friends, one being a girl I was super tight with. About a month after graduation she told me she had a little bit of a crush on me. Nothing crazy just a little crush. She said next time we hung out she’d 100 percent be down to hook up and I was definitely down too. Fast forward like 20 months later we have yet to see each other. We live 12 hours apart from each other and both have been super busy to visit each other. Well about a month or 2 ago she had seen one of my guy friends from school and they had hooked up. I had no issue with it as I don’t have any romantic feelings towards this girl. She told me this hook up with my friend was just a normal hook up and was cuz she was on a dry spell. Well apparently my friend has taken an extreme liking to her. She texts me everyday and complains that since they’ve hooked up he won’t stop texting and snapping her and thinks that they’re gonna date. She’s got zero interest in him. I assumed after this she had no more interest in hooking up with me anymore, but she told me today she would still 100% do it. I definitely wanna hook up with her but I feel like it’s just not right. I put myself in his shoes and I feel like I’d be pretty upset by it. I think her and I are gonna see each other in February and she wants to hook up. But idk if I can do it. Should I wait it out more to see if my friends feelings go away? Should I ask him? Do it and not tell him? Or just completely stay away? Typing this up is making me feel like I might be being selfish. I mean it’s just one hookup right? There’s hundreds of other girls out there for me, lol. I’m curious as to what other guys think of this. Maybe some of you have been in this situation yourself? 

TLDR: year ago made a deal to hook up with one of my best girl friends next time we hung out. Haven’t seen each other since then (live 12 hours away). My guy friend has recently taken a liking to her. I’m seeing her in a few months probably and wondering if I should not hook up with her.",08Dec2020,1
208,"I know it’s long but please read it, but here’s a TL;DR: Parents rejecting me at almost every attempt to meet their daughter or them, what can or should be doing?

Long story short, about a month ago I started talking to this girl I met on online class and we really hit it off and love talking to each other and now we both feel like the next appropriate step is to see each other in person. However herein lies the problem; hopefully your first thought would be “this girl cannot meet with you due to COVID.” However this must not be the issue, as her parents allow her to go out with her friends as she pleases or upon request despite COVID. The next issue you would think would be “well her parents aren’t dumb, they’re not going to let a boy meet their daughter by herself.” However(again), they let her do this with a male friend who they also met on FaceTime when he was introduced to her parents. However I probably shouldn’t have included this because they’ve currently known him for about a year now and he is now a neighborhood friend to them. Despite this, the point I’m trying to make is that the same way I’m trying to meet their daughter her friend went through the same process but MUCH easier and MUCH faster. After trying multiple times to set up our meet we haven’t given up, but it’s definitely much more slow-paced as she mentions her parents keep brushing it off nowadays instead of just blatantly saying no and are most likely irritated by our attempts. I will say I’ve seen some improvement as they’ve gone from No to we’ll think about it but her mom refuses to talk to me 1 on 1 about the situation but I haven’t tried her dad. But now they’ve recently began taking her phone away really early (like at 8) as they claim “she’s on the phone too much” or usually whenever they see I’m talking to her and it just forces me to ask...what am I doing wrong? What can I do different to meet this girl? How can I build a rapport with her parents if they literally will not let me?",08Dec2020,1
209,"I lost all my friends a bit ago except for one, so I made new friends. now my brain is telling me they only stick around because they feel bad for me. my old friends told me that's the only reason they still hung out with me too. so it's always plausible.

all I do at this point is sit in my room playing on my switch,  do my homework, and knit blankets whenever we don't have class. when we do, my routine only varies slightly before I go back to that stuff again.

210,"I’m going to apologize for formatting as I am on mobile. 
    My wedding is coming up and I am doing something small with my fiancée and our parents. My mom has made excuses since we told her the news starting with she is afraid of flying, she doesn’t want to leave my siblings(who will all be teenagers except one who we said can go), and now is starting arguments. There was a miscommunication on thanksgiving. I asked her previously what her plans were and she said since my older sister was taking her three kids to her in-laws that she would rather work and get together as a family that weekend. So I took it as she said it. I call her on thanksgiving and she is upset we did not invite her. This led to an argument where she said rude and disrespectful stuff about my fiancée. I’m not a confrontational person and until she was disrespectful I tried to hear her out. My fiancée spoke up and my mom got angry that I had her on speaker phone. She hung up saying she will call when she can talk to just me and put emphasis on “just my son.”

  A few days go by and my dad, who is still with my mom and they love each other dearly,  but it’s complicated, called me and asked what happened. I explained it all and he said. “you know how she gets. Give her a couple days. I will talk to her.”

    I called today and she said my dad explained to her how he thinks she needs to apologize. She said she doesn’t feel she said anything wrong. I started asking her what is wrong and is this how life is going to be because I am going to be with my fiancée for the rest of our lives and I’m not going to have them fighting. She said it’s a choice I have to make and left it at that. She said she will not apologize. I brought up future grandchildren and it was the same response. I told her I want my mom at my wedding. I don’t want to feel like no one is there for me. She said, again, that’s a choice I am making. 

   She called tonight and said she is willing to talk things out, but again, she said she will not apologize. She is willing to talk to my fiancée to find the root of the problem. I told her I will talk to her and am planning on meeting with her later this week. 

    Now I know my mother. This is going to end in a bigger argument. I love my family, but I know how they are. I am at a point where I am tired of arguing. We are having a destination wedding and we cannot have constant controversy where someone says they aren’t going one minute and then are going the next. I feel like I’m not being respected as an adult neither is my future wife. I brought these issues up, and she turns it back onto me that I don’t know how hard her life has been. I don’t tell her because I don’t want to fight more, but she had me young. I have been there for most of her life. I understand a lot of what we’ve been through. I am in a better place now but she refuses my help when I try because I haven’t “lived my life and learned through struggle.” She has allowed my three teenage sister to all drop out of high school recently and things like that have annoyed me because I want better for them.

   I am going to visit with her later in the week. I am again going to state my grievances. I will allow her and my fiancée to talk things over, but I do not expect anything to come out of it. My fiancée is giving this one more chance as this is fr from our first issue with my mother. At what point is it pointless and I’m just spinning my tires in the sand?",08Dec2020,1
211,"Obligatory “I’m on mobile” statement 

I [22F] and my friend [21F] both do theatre in the same company. Recently a show the company was planning on doing had to be postponed due to a problem with the rights. She was very upset, as she was cast as the lead in the show. However, it was replaced with  a musical which I was very, very excited for. 

She knew I was incredibly excited and was really eager to get a specific role (which is one of the main female leads). She said multiple times about how she didn’t care about the show and was only going to audition to full time. Despite the fact that she has some characteristics which make her not very good for the role, she basically told me to my face in front of the music director (our mutual friend) that I should probably be ready to accept a worse part because she wanted that role and since her show fell through she should be able to get whatever role she wanted. 

I was hurt, but basically ignored it and decided to audition and see what happened. Well, I got the role I wanted and she got the smaller role. The role is still a pretty good one. She called me sobbing about the role she got. I told her the role was good and her other show being postponed didn’t necessarily guarantee a role in this show. She basically said I didn’t get it and we said goodbye. 

Since then she hasn’t contacted me and I haven’t contacted her. I’m upset that she isn’t happy for me. I’m upset that she thought I had no shot at the role. I’m upset she basically undermined me in front of someone who helped cast the show. I don’t know how to talk to her about this. I’ve been declining any group invitations because I know she’ll be there and will likely bring up how she got “screwed” out of my part. 

Should I just wait it out until we both calm down? Should I talk to her about it and how should I approach it? I don’t want this to ruin our friendship, but I’m seriously hurt.

She makes significantly more than I do and keeps asking me to buy things (I said I would get us a washer and dryer, as my parents will help pay for some of it, etc) and some of the things I have supplied I have aquired through other means other than paying full price for them (Family donates them to me, find for cheap at thrift stores). She asked me to spend about $200 on our bedroom on top of all this and I tried explaining how tough of a position I am in financially paying for all this while she makes more than me even after putting money in her savings. She went off on me saying “you didnt even pay for half those things” and it really rubbed me the wrong way. I got them fair and square, either through luck or hard work in return for the items. 

Long story short, I am annoyed that she is trying to tell me despite furnishing most of our appartment, somehow its invalid and I havent done enough souly because I didnt pay outright for everything I supplied. 

Am I wrong to let this bother me? 

Im cool with being wrong, I just want to know why.",08Dec2020,1
214,"I apologize if this isn't the correct sub to post it in, but I didn't really know where to ask. I also apologize if this has been answered before, but it's not something I wanted to search for.

This is a long story but I'll do my best to sum it up. Our 13 year old nephew sexually assaulted our 6 year old daughter. He's done it a few times when we go over to Grandma's house. Usually the adults will hang out in one room and the grandkids will play in the next room over. The nephew will get our daughter to a somewhat secluded area and ""play"" this ""game"" that our daughter doesn't like, where he grabs her, pulls down her pants and underwear and won't let her go. Fortunately, that is all that has happened thus far. His clothing has stayed on and both of them have stated that the only touching going on is him holding onto her around her waist.

We were obviously horrified when our daughter spoke up, but we spoke with he and his parents and he is now in counseling. We went to counseling on our end as well. Everything about this is terrible, but at least it appears to be affecting us more than our daughter.

One of the things we've been trying to figure out is why this happened. We can't figure out how you go from a little dorky kid to predator just like that. We assume something happened to our nephew, possibly some sexual abuse. His parents have said there is no possibility for that and the root of this stems from him getting into porn about a year ago (his parents claim they put a stop to it). Everyone we've spoken to said there is more to the story and a 12 (13 now) year old viewing pornography doesn't usually lead to sexually assaulting a child.

We just found out that the porn he got into was porn ""involving children"". (I don't honestly even know what that means and his mom couldn't clarify.) What they told us was that he stumbled onto it the first time and then he went searching for it. This doesn't really seem plausible to us, but I wanted to see if other people knew better than us. I've heard of the dark web, but I don't get the idea that this kid is that technically savvy. 

TL:DR

1. How easy is it to ""stumble"" onto child porn?
2. How easy is to find child porn if you were to search for it?",08Dec2020,1
215,"So my (20f) sister (15f) has a host of diagnoses. When she was little, she had a sensory disorder but eventually grew out of it. We're now finding out that she probably has Reactive Attachment Disorder, borderline Borderline tendencies (no pun intended), depression, and anxiety. I feel bad for her (sort of, given that she's verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards me) but growing up with her was tough. 

I know that the term ""special needs"" usually refers to people with Down Syndrome or who are on the autism spectrum or something similar.

My bf the other day questioned why I do that. He got so upset that he even wondered if I send the sexy pics for him... to other men too. He said that it seems like I love attention from other men.

He later on said “I’m gonna sleep.. I’m Probably pissing you off with this argument. Why don’t you talk to those men and maybe they’ll say the right thing unlike me. Goodnight”

I have skills, a Bachelors and have job experience, but not a lot that i myself am proud of, always things i thought others would like for me.

221,"This happened when I was 14. I had a hyper fixation with a certain a movie. I saw a tumble post asking for a roleplay with a certain ship. So I contacted them. This was my first ever time roleplaying. Through them I met this other roleplayer, who was 22. We did do nsfw stuff with the characters. This person I was talking too claimed to be a stripper, and we had crazy different time zones. He was a bisexual guy, like I am. He claimed that he also had a boyfriend. While roleplaying he would tell me stuff about his personal life. He once told me that he’s going to go to a gang bang, and asked if it bothered me that he told me that. I said no but it did make me a little uncomfortable. He would tell me about the fights he’d get in with his boyfriend. One night he got really drunk and started texting me. He told me that he loved me, and that I was his ‘precious little boy’ and he cared about me so much. I was so creeped out and I told him that what he was saying wasn’t okay. He said that he meant love in a friendship way, not in a love way and that I should calm down. I blocked him, however the next day the same person I met him through texted me something that he said and basically I ended up unblocking him. At first he apologized, but then he started saying stuff like “I thought you would’ve been fine with it.” “You shouldn’t have lead me on.” “Im a very affectionate person it’s not my fault.” He actually ended up blocking me a while later, and we haven’t talked sense.

224,"So I’m a 23 year old college student who suffers from PTSD due to childhood abuse. It was mostly emotional and physical but I was also sexually abused on a few occasions (that I can recall anyway). My parents are separated and both parents remarried people whom I’d consider toxic. They always managed to work sexual themes into conversation and both step mom and step dad have told me things about their sex life (with my parents) I should never have known. 

With all that being said, the trauma and unstable environment I grew up in has pretty much fucked me up on the inside. Most people who know me think I have it all together, and that’s partly due to the fact that I repress my emotions. The wall I put up has started to break down during the last 9 months of isolation because I can’t really do things to keep me distracted anymore. Being stuck in a house with my step mom has really taken its toll on me and everything I thought sucked before is just amplified. I know distraction is not a healthy way to approach life but I really thought I was managing. I was previously away at school which was great, but I’m forced to be home now. 

I’ve started to remember things (my step dad raping my mom has been the most horrific) and have been using sex/porn as a coping mechanism. I’m sad, go masturbate, I’m happy, go masturbate, can’t sleep, masturbate... you get the idea. I’ve also sought outside gratification through onlyfans subscriptions and at first it felt great to interact with someone and have a mutual understanding. But now it just feels hollow and like I’m chasing some sort of high that never feels quite as good. 

I’m actually starting to feel shameful about it. Is this the rock bottom that I always hear addicts talk about? What can I do to end the cycle? Any and all advice is appreciated even if it doesn’t directed answer that question. 

Side note, I’ve been clinically depressed since I was 14 or so and in and out of therapy. I have horrible health insurance at the moment so my options are limited in that sense.

236,"I'm beginning to see serious man child traits in my fiancé. I currently live with my fiancé, we've been together for 3 1/2 years and engaged for 1. I love him to death but he expects me to come home from working an 8 hour day and make dinner every single night. 

I'm not bothered by the thought of cooking I'm just annoyed with him expecting me to start cooking as soon as I get home. Mind you he and I are on different work schedules. He goes to work at 7am and gets off at 4pm. Where as I go in at 10am and get off at 7 pm. On top of that our eating schedules are different, he HAS to eat 3 times a day or he will start to feel cranky and I only eat when I'm hungry. 

A little background on him, he's from a Hispanic home where his mom made sure he ate 3 times/day and would even serve him his food up until he finally moved out. I'm Hispanic as well and we have a word for this called ""machismo"" which means that Men have certain expectations from their female partner. When I get home he's just playing video games, not that I have a problem with games I just don't see why he doesn't take the initiative to learn how to cook himself. I tell him to make a sandwich and his response is that he hates sandwiches. I end up making what he wants and he complains about the food I make. Not only that but I do most of the cleaning at home, put up the groceries, do the dishes and such. 

He and I have gotten into actual arguments about this. Whenever he complains about me not cooking (which lately has been a lot since I'm also working full time and doing school) I'll call him out about not even trying and he'll get all pissy about it. 

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I absolutely love him and he treats me very well it's just this one aspect of our relationship that keeps rearing it's ugly head. Well that and he feels left out if I want to hang out with my friends. But still I'm not in the wrong am I?

we have important things in common, yet just today I have found myself a little concerned..

241,"This is going to be a long post. My life has been messed up for a long time and I'm really trying to get it together. I'd really appreciate any comments.


My mom (62)  and I (24f) cant stay at our houses anymore. She lives in a house with a lady that she does home healthcare for. They are telling her she has to leave tonight. They were charging her to live there at first which is unfair because my mom literally cleans the ladies shitty blankets and more like every day. Eventually they told her she could stay there for free. But the lady has been getting more aggressive over time and the family is there (for once) pretty much making my mom leave

My mom receives social security checks every month and says she can spend up to $700 a month on rent. She also does hair at a shop. She wont tell me exactly how much she has total or how much she gets from social security and she says its disrespectful for me to ask her about money. Once she did admit to making $2000 dollars some months. But she claims theres nothing left because she has bills. When I asked her what bills she has she wouldn't tell me.

I live in a nursing home that doubles as a psyche ward (24F) I dont really need to be here because mentally I'm not crazy (trust me the other people wear dirty, holey clothes and talk to them selves) it's just that I cant afford an apartment. 

I try looking for jobs while also applying for disability but both are just taking a lot of time. I do have two appointments with some local job placement companies this week so it shouldn't  be long. 

I used to be homeschooled until I was 14. I dont know a lot of people because of all the time I spent at home. Plus it took me a long time to learn social skills. But now I'm pretty normal and know how to tell if someone's crazy or cool by looking at them and talking to them. 

At 18 I felt like I had to move out of my mom's place because she wasn't letting me learn or go out with friends after school. So I searched for jobs for a long time and the only thing I was really qualified for was bike delivery. I had no concept of what an office job was, had no restaurant experience and I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license because my mom is very protective so car delivery didnt really occur to me.

I didnt know bike delivery wasn't sustainable and I'd end up with chronic fatigue and injuries. So I moved out. I did that for about a year and used the experience to get a job at potbelly sandwich shop working in the shop. I worked at different restaurants over the years but never really had enough money to save for emergencies. Plus I have always felt a little tired ever since the bike delivery thing and working on my feet all day was a struggle. But I always went and did my best at work.

There have been points where I didnt feel safe at the rooms I rented on craigslist and tried to move back with my mom but sometimes she doesn't even have a place for us to stay.

I have lived in terrible shelters and slept on the train many nights. I have always kept hope out that I'd be able to improve my life but it's just difficult finding my way when I dont know many people and honestly dont know much about life.

She says the reason she doesn't trust me is that sometimes I do get angry at people and lash out. She feels that I might get her into trouble with my temper. I feel that a lot of the people I've been around are crazy which eventually leads me to go off. Like one time we were living with a lady and I used a piece of tape that belonged to her to seal a package. She got very angry because she doesn't like people using her things (she was a hoarder) and pretty much started yelling at me and blocking me from going to my room. I told her I was sorry and that I'd buy her more tape multiple times but she wouldn't quit yelling or me get away from her. Eventually I got frustrated and told her she was retarded. She attacked me and beat me up then moved out leaving us no way to pay for the house. I moved into a shelter and I think my mom moved into a Christian shelter on the other side of town. 

Also here's another obstacle encase you guys dont really think I'm stupid enough lol. 2 years ago I was living with a guy I met working at chipotle. At the time I didnt have a job and he was doing lyft. We never had sex, I just lived at his house for like a month. I asked him if I could use his car to get my driver's license so I could do lyft but he said I wasn't allowed to drive his car even if he was in the car. I feel that he was a bad person. He was pretending to be my friend but why wouldn't he let me use his car to get my license and rent a car through lift. He knows all the times I had no place to go and worked at restaurants while staying in shelters. 

Every night he would leave the key out and one night I took the car and started driving around for fun. He woke up and texted me asking if I had his car and I said yes and that I'd bring it back. He told me not to bring the car back and that he was calling the police and that I couldn't stay with him anymore. The next day they sent him a new car since it was a rental. Pretty much after that I was sleeping in the car and got arrested and went to jail. Now I'm on probation and and I wont legally be allowed to do grub hub, uber or lyft for the next two years.

I told the judge I was homeless and he put me in this nursing home so I'd have a place to stay. It was ok at first but I can hardly stand being here anymore.

The people  are all way older than I am and they walk around with dirty holey clothes on talking to them selves and smoking cigarettes. It leaves me feeling extremely alone because its impossible to even have a conversation with these people.

But to make matters worse, IT STINKS SO BAD. At first I was in a room by myself and I was already developing constant pain from allergies from being in this building. But yesterday they moved this girl in my room and SHE REAKS. even with the window and the door open you can actively smell her from across the room. I feel like the smell is going to make me sick. 

The staff is also disrespectful. They came in here and moved my dresser to be between a bed and a wall so I cant even open the drawers. The furniture was fine where it was and I feel like they only did it to disrespect me. They told me I need to throw away my things and that they looked like garbage. All I have is paper work, a few clothes, non perishable food and basic necessities. 

I get the feeling that my life shouldn't be this bad, considering I have a great personality. It's hard to tell but I think I'm smart enough and people say I'm funny. There are people out there that live in houses and nice apartments. Have jobs, cars  friends they can trust and I feel that I should be one of those people

My one hope is that I'm working  with two job placement companies this week. what jobs do you guys think I should apply for with the staffing companies? I could see myself at a desk signing people in and taking their information down. Or some kind of office assistant job. But with my record I might end up with a truck driving job. Any suggestions?

Also do you think it's worth it to even try to make things work with my mom. Because I'd really like to leave this place lol.",08Dec2020,1
242,"I'm 20 years old and my younger sister is 15, currently due to everything in the world her school has two options, one which is Half online half in person but currently only doing online, with zoom meetings with teachers, and the other which is self motivated and you do the work at your own pace, with deadlines. She chose the second option since she didn't have a laptop that could run zoom very well (it was my old broken laptop) , which we recently got her a new laptop. She was doing amazing for awhile then started lying and not doing her work and getting huffy and puffy with me and my parents (I currently live at home, working to save money for college.) whenever we ask her if she's doing her work.

She will lie, have a tab open for school, then go onto Tumblr, Instagram, Youtube, and discord. When you walk over to her she'll quickly switch her tab to the school and act like she's working. We've tried taking her phone away, which never works because again she has access to her socials on her laptop. If you push her too much she'll try to get up and leave to her room and close the door, or she waits till 2-3PM (Even if she got up at 11AM and worked for only an hour or so give or take.) and will say she's done and wants to go to her room. She does this since that's about the time her friends are done with their zoom classes or her partner who's 2 hours ahead of our timezone, will be home from school so she wants to go and play video games or just be on the phone with her friends or partner.

And it upsets her. And I've even tried what \*I\* personally hated growing up which was ""You're going to flunk all your classes and won't be able to graduate on time you NEED to do your classes."" And I feel awful about doing it, which naturally, she gets upset.

I don't know what my parents or I could do, she failed her all but one of her classes last quarter or semester and is redoing the TWO classes she flunked, plus three new classes. We told her we don't even want an A at this point, just a passing grade is okay, and it doesn't seem to work, nothing does. I'm just lost at this point and have no idea how I can help motivate her or get her to work.

244,"Hello all!
So I am a healthcare worker and am currently employed at a local hospital as a PRN.
Recently I have been butting heads with my boss about my schedule. I am a PRN employee and how it works is before nexts month schedule is made my boss will send me a text with a list of dates to confirm I am available to work said dates.  My contract states as a PRN employee I am required to work 4 shifts a month and I usually average 12-13 shifts a month. I have no set availability and pick up shifts when I am available.

The problem: 
Another employee at my job had an impromptu emergency pop up next week and is unable to work certain shifts. I receive a text this morning from my boss asking if I can cover the two dates that were provided and I told her I could only cover one day. Moments later I receive a very passive aggressive text from my boss essentially reminding me that I should always be available to pick up last minute shifts. I very politely respond back saying that I appreciate the shifts being offered but again am only able to cover one of the dates. She counters one last time very rudely again that I need to make myself available. At this point I’m too upset to respond and am taken aback by what she’s just texted me. I feel as if my boss wants justification as to why I am not going to work both days and quite frankly I feel it’s none of her business. I now fear that anytime in the future if I deny a shift there will be backlash from her. How should I continue?

249,"Hi everyone! Skip to Paragraph 3 if you don't want to read the whole thing :)

I come from a Hispanic family and like the title says, I'm 18 years old (turning 19 in March). I bought my phone with my own money, along with AirPods and also a laptop for school. I don't have a job at the moment but that's because I'm focused on college and COVID has also made it harder to look for job opportunities, especially a seasonal one. However, I do have quite a bit of money  saved up from working my ass off and buy most of my own things (besides groceries) and am also paying for my college tuition on my own. 

My parents are super Christian (the conservative conspiracy theorist type, if you know what I mean) and have forced a lot of their ideals on my siblings and I through the years. I've been the ""outcast"" for a huge portion of my life and have broken almost every rule in their book, most notably smoking the ""devil's lettuce"" to having premarital sex. There is very little trust between us at this point and I've caught them looking through my journals and my room numerous times. 

Like I said, I bought my phone, laptop, and airpods with the money I earned from work. However, because I'm out of a job, my father has offered to pay my phone bill until I can find a decent job or internship. The last few weeks, every night around 10 (or whenever my parents are going to sleep), they come in my room and make me hand all of my electronics over, regardless of what I'm doing--whether it's studying or talking on the phone with friends. They've made it clear that it's because they don't trust me/what I'm doing online. 

I have an older 20y/o sister who also lives at home and they don't do the same with her, probably because she's a mini version of them who is VERY faithful. I'm not trying to diss on Christianity by any means but while I am somewhat faithful I've kind of been driven away after my relationship with my parents has gotten strained. How do I tell them I don't appreciate having MY rightful property taken away like a child? I know 18 isn't very old but I'm not 12 either.

Even if you were to tell me something as simple as trying something new the problem is I'm perfectly happy with this lifestyle of wake up, school, finish homework asap, and then burn time from YouTube video games, etc. It sounds really unhealthy and I acknowledge that but having this habitual routine and being able to enjoy things without much commitment is what makes things like these so enticing.

252,"edit: I live in Europe

I  was convicted of assault and carrying a knife. Do you think employers  looking at my criminal record will misunderstand and think I was  convicted of assault WITH a knife? That is not what I'm convicted of.  Maybe they will think that's worse than assault with no weapon. I have  the option to appeal the knife conviction. Don't know if I should or if  it won't make any difference to my life. My public defender said he  thinks I won't get the knife conviction overturned because I was  aggressive while carrying it. The court order said it was a type of  knife that you are allowed to carry but they said I didn't have a  legitimate reason to carry it and that I was aggressive while carrying  it and therefore I'm convicted for it. I realized after I got the  conviction that I should have answered questions about the knife if they  had any. I didn't want to answer any questions at all and I let my  public defender speak about the knife and what he said was fairly  accurate, although not 100%. Maybe the court thought that because I  didn't want to answer questions that I had something to hide. Last day  to hand in the appeal is today, or maybe tomorrow, not sure. I hate  myself for procrastinating so that the time is almost over now. Maybe I  should have talked to a lawyer about this. I only sent an email to my  public defender and he played stupid in the reply he gave me. Maybe I  should have asked a lawyer about what to write in the appeal also, if I  do hand one in. I probably don't have time to send it by mail, so I hope  they have a mailbox I can put it in. I probably have to write the  appeal without the help of a lawyer now, don't know if that makes any  difference. Anyway, my main question is, should I appeal the knife  conviction or not? Regarding the assault conviction I don't think I can  get it overturned or lessened. Although it says in the court order that  witnesses stopped the assault, even though neither the plaintiff nor the  witness said this at the trial, and it's not true. I don't know if that  makes any difference to the sentence, what do you think? If I were to  appeal the assault conviction in order to tell them about this I would  probably have to plead guilty. I pleaded not guilty to the assault at  the trial.

edit 2: I forgot to say  that the knife conviction did apparently not affect my punishment. Or  they said in the court order it didn't affect the punishment to any  noteworthy degree. But as I said I'm worried maybe employers will  misunderstand my criminal record. But maybe it won't make any difference  to my life.

to the point it takes most of my free toke and i find myself doing it a lot at school and dance and everything i do as well.

i have my own reality/s. but my main reality has become more important that actual real life. i am almost always in a daydream state it feels like. i don’t really have any friends, and i don’t really want any because i have them in my day dreams.

things in my life don’t even matter when i’m in that state. when i didn’t day dream as much, i was very sad and anxious all of the time,  my mom was being mentally abusive and my dad had passed away. but now it doesn’t even matter or faze me. if i don’t daydream for too long and actually think about real life then i become very sad and anxious again.

so it feels like it’s better to not really be here.  but i feel as though it’s consumed my life. i constantly miss the characters in my false reality, i feel so connected in this made up world and  i feel no connection to real life.

i guess sometimes o feel sad that my best friend that i love most in the world doesn’t actually exist, and that truly makes me feel sad, more sad than the losses i’ve been through. i will even mix up realities, my current real life doesn’t even feel real anymore.

264,"Context: I have an anxiety disorder so I act weird around people which I'm sure looks suspicious. This ordeal made my anxiety sky rocket and I was incredibly embarrassed.   
I went to a large corporate store about a week ago to pick something up and to give my brother a soda (he works there). When I was at self-checkout I was having issues with my debit card so I had to call my bank to figure out why they were denying it. I ended up changing the pin and it still wouldn't work so I was pacing around near the front while on the phone with them. Eventually I got fed up and just left after handing the cashier the product (apparently I shouldn't have offered to take it back to electronics, I thought it was polite to offer), anyway, on the way out I was asked if I paid for the can of soda and I told the guy that I brought it in with me.   


Here's the reason why I want to say something- the security guy must have followed me out to my car because he was pacing around by it and he scared the crap out of me. He weirded me out ever since I walked up to self checkout because he had this intense creepy non-blinking stare. Anyway, I decided to try calling one last time when I was in my car to change the pin again then went in to try buying a candy bar this time, on the way in I found my brother and gave him the soda. My card still didn't work so I was like fuck it and left again. I stayed on the phone with customer service in my car when my brother came up to my window saying that it was an emergency and that I needed to talk to the manager now. This security guy starts accusing me of stealing cords from electronics, saying that the associates saw me back there when I never even returned to the electronics department. I told them that he could check the cameras, I walked into the store with the soda originally, gave the product back to the cashier, and never even returned back to electronics. I feel like this guy just wanted to start drama or had some sort of PTSD paranoia (my brother says he's a retired cop), I don't know. His story didn't make sense though, they had cameras everywhere that would have proven my innocence. When I started asking them to check them he suddenly started to backtrack. I'm so glad I didn't start crying until after they left, the bank lady I was on the phone with was really nice trying to comfort me...  


Anyway, apparently I can't go back to this store because my brother doesn't want to start awkward drama or lose his job. Which I'm pretty sure would be illegal anyway? I was humiliated though and I can only imagine this guy doing this to someone else and escalating the situation, I think he only stopped because my brother worked there. I mean, black people have been murdered by cops over false accusations after situations were escalated, I think this guy needs to be reprimanded? If he really does have PTSD then I feel for him because I have anxiety too but goddamn....",08Dec2020,1

All of this started when I asked my dad to order my twin siblings (20) a birthday cake. He asked me where he was supposed to get it from. It might not seem like much to just ask a question but it was the way he asked as if he had never ordered a cake before. Since then, I just haven't been feeling emotionally well all night. I haven't spoken to him since. This was sort of the tipping point. 

I am not the oldest child of his but I am the oldest in the house. Every major holiday, every birthday, or special event, everything is my job. I have to come up with a menu, find or prepare the food, find or prepare a dessert, clean up, etc. My mother and I are the only ones that cook for the family most of the time. My siblings chip in on occasion, but it's mostly us. Same with household chores. I will say they've improved when it comes to helping around the house, but for the most part, it's just us two carrying the load. I am the only child that can drive. I run errands, take my siblings to appointments, make store runs, run errands. I have so much responsibility and I'm tired of it. This has gone on for years and got worse when I got my license. 

I don't fault my mother much because she is the only one with a full-time job. My father hasn't had a serious job since his old company let people go and although he says he is looking, I don't think he's really putting in effort to get one.

She has her own things to deal with, covering bills and taking care of things around the house. I don't want to increase her load. I'm lost and I want a break. Before the pandemic, I could go out and sit around somewhere by myself for hours. With cases rising again in the U.S. and getting worse, that is not a safe option. I'm not sure what to do.

278,"We were married. He was an addict and an alcoholic. One one occasion, he beat me and choked me and gave me a concussion. This was years ago. 

Due to money and other circumstances, we didn’t divorce. Recently, I texted him saying I’m finally working on the divorce and will be in contact about the divorce papers. 

He proceeds to tell me about his hardship. I feel like he’s genuine. His pet died, he’s had health concerns like seizures and concussions recently... he goes on to explain how sorry he is. How he’s been through so much recent trauma that has forced him to grow. He’s in therapy. 

I didn’t get the sense of an agenda. He just apologized and opened up about his hardship. He was never evil. He was just fucked up. 

It sounds like he’s on the mend finally, but... I’m  left feeling like shit. I want to cry. 

I’ve grown up in abusive relationships and love is hard for me. I’m 31 and all I want is to build my own family. I don’t have money to adopt. I don’t have a current partner and I don’t know anyone I’d want a future with. I barely have money for rent let alone children. 

I have so much love to give. I don’t have any hate towards my ex. I just wish I could carve a life out for myself, but I’m stuck fixing all the mistakes from my past. Like when I paid for my abusive ex and he took my money. 

I feel like I spent my whole life surviving and now I just want to live. I’m in therapy... I’m making upwards progress.

281,"I lived out side of the US, and in several places in the US and I personally cannot stand the culture anywhere I've lived in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

I can explain why in what I think are pretty easy to understand terms:  


I'm from the south. Frankly if it weren't for large aspects of the south I would love the south a lot more. And just to be clear I'm not talking about the 'back woods' type areas because those vary greatly.  


What I mean is this. In my home town there were basically two cultures. One was normal people living normal lives. The other was red-necks. These two groups (given the small, borderline medium, nature of the place) couldn't **STAND** the other. What I'm about to attest to is all accurate to my family, and everything I've witnessed in my town, about half of whom are the rednecks, and the other half are not.  


The redneck part of my town would literally show up to bars, start fights with other locals, lose and then call the cops. Who got arrested was based solely on if the cops were rednecks or not. This happened almost every time I went to a bar. I can remember multiple times one of the bar owners I knew seeing a few trucks pull up outside and just saying ""god damn it, I might as well call the cops now."" This behavior led to a bar opening that was openly anti-redneck. This led to tons of disputes and their windows being broken out at least a solid 25-30 times and red-necks waiting out side of the bar to fight patrons. Wanna hear something better? I hated that bar. Everything was way over priced and the staff was really snobby.  


Lets not even get me started on how every bar or pool hall always slowly becomes a club. (At least in the US.)  


The more 'normal' side of the town has quite literally started trying to basically 'quarantine' the rednecks. Mostly by hanging up signs that piss them off like ""No rebel flags in this establishment."" So is it every red-neck and non-redneck thats the problem? Nope its not even half of them that are the problem. Its the ones that see themselves as the ""real culture"" in the city. Neither is frankly.  


Hell I would even go so far as to say the fighting portion of it wouldn't bother me so much if the aggravating side and the losing side could just admit that they lost and they started it but that literally never happens.  


Ok so the problem is just being in the south? Well no.  


There is this thing that literally every culture on earth participates in: Sports. Now I like sports. But I don't like watching those sports on television. In fact I fucking hate hearing about the game. I hate hearing about this team or that team. I fail to see the point. I'm not playing so why should I care? Why watch basketball when you could play it? I just don't get it. I'm mostly into rock climbing and muay-thai and Jujitsu. But you would never find me talking about the UFC or watching the Olympics when it comes to climbing.  


The number of people who will bitch when you don't watch their sport is also really high and frankly fucking annoying. The number of times I have said ""No I don't watch \[insert sport/team\] I don't know anything about \[insert sport\]"" to hear ""Are you serious?"" with psighs and the rolling of eyes as if its something I'm just supposed to know. Then they just burst into ""You have to hear this \[Red team\] has \[player\] who \[did something I don't understand\] and thats just \[somehow impressive.\]""  


I've started countering this by asking if they had ever been out to some of the local climbing spots and acting shocked if they haven't. If I say ""I hand foot into a bread bowl then double dyno'ed from that  bread bowl onto chips with my thumbs."" they act like I'm being pretentious. The problem is **THERE IS LITERALLY NO GOD DAMNED DIFFERENCE IN THOSE STATEMENTS.** ***I UNDERSTAND LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL. I'M NOT EVEN AWARE HOW YOU GET POINTS.***  


Now lets talk about gaming:  


My mindset, maybe its why I like rock climbing and mixed martial arts, is the person having the most fun is winning. Keeping score is a confusing concept to me entirely. Back in my FPS days (10+ years ago now) I quite literally wouldn't even turn my mic on. I bought a pair of headphones and just ripped the cable out and plugged it in so their voices wouldn't come through the TV.  


I got sick of hearing how much everyone sucked and how awful the team I'm on is, frankly, when I would be carrying a team of 4 in Halo 2. It got to where I would just stop mid-game, write their names down, and put them on my ""do not play with"" list. If you are razzing the other team I get that. If you are razzing your own team you are retarded. All of the Gamer Gate ""You are trying to win by pissing your opponents off.""   


*""Oh wow really?* **THEN WHY IS MY TEAM BITCHING AT ME WHEN I'M 25 AND 0. SHOULDN'T THEY BE PISSING THE OTHER TEAM OFF?**""  


The ""We aren't trying to have fun we are trying to WIN, Only winning is fun!"" Great, Have fun having fun for all of 5 seconds. Why would you limit your fun to 'winning.' All of the best times I've ever had playing games wasn't when I had a team and we were really ""kicking their asses."" or whatever. It was more like the times in various MMO's where the entire \[party, group, raid, battlegrounds, whatever\] turned ourselves into Orca whales and just floated around Azeroth.  


Frankly I think that behavior is what led people to start playing table tops. Its why I stopped playing any kind of online games honestly. And then there are the people who just want to use knowing every rule as a bragging right...  


So seriously what do you do? How do I escape this hell of not relating to other people at all?",08Dec2020,1

286,"I (27m) love my girlfriend (22f) of 2 years very much. However lately we’ve been arguing. 

When I first met her, she wanted to know everything about my past relationships and hookups, I was abrasive about this because why bring up people from the past? Yet she insisted so, eventually, my discomfort subsided and I would tell her the stories and show her pictures of past exes, experiences, etc. 

Now she a slim yet very feminine build, beautiful sun kissed chocolate skin (Bahamian) and a GORGEOUS face. A lot of the women I used to date and deal with were more of the “super thick” side. So after a while I would bring up past things from time to time not knowing this whole time, it was making her question her own appearance. 


About 3 weeks ago, she expressed this to me and says she feels just skinny with no body and not very attractive because of how I talk about curvy bodies. No I never say her body is bad, I constantly compliment on how sexy she is (which...dear god she really is) I just got into a habit of freely talking about these women with her. 

Tonight I showed her a picture of a girl who was trying to hit on me despite the knowledge of my girlfriend. My girlfriend wondered why I even told her in the first place and now we went to bed, yes say the “I love yous” but I definite pain in the air. 

I have this idea that sure just because you’re dating someone doesn’t mean other people can’t be good looking people, I don’t want them, but hey, there are all kinds of forms of attractive and I got comfortable talking about this with her after she would dig for so LONG. Now she’s a bit insecure. She wants to feel like she’s the only woman I prefer and the only woman in my world. 

My question is, how do I do that? I know to stop bringing up other appearances but what else can I do with my actions to show her that she’s special and the only woman I want?",08Dec2020,1

291,"Hey all, 

So I am in a tough situation this Christmas. I am an only child of divorced parents. I have isolated myself during most of quarantine and haven't broken that in the past 3 months. Here is the lowdown:

Mother: I am closer to her and my stepfather. They are also geographically closer. Both of them are immune compromised because of past illnesses. They have been very good about social distancing and we plan to all get covid tests the week before christmas, isolate, and then spend a humble christmas together with just the three of us.

Father: Lives in a hotspot with my elderly grandmother. Does not obey guidelines. Most likely spending Christmas eve with lots of family and the multitudes of my cousins young children and his girlfriend's family. Intense about me being there for the holidays.

So usually I spend Xmas eve with my father and xmas with my mother, this year however, I don't feel great about going to my Dad's not only because of being afraid of getting exposed, the idea of exposing my mother and stepfather is not an option. I have already resolved to not attend, but im struggling with how to approach my father about my decision. He will be upset since i plan on going to my mother's but not his. Mind you, I'm an adult, but I still struggle with this knowing that he will be super upset with me as will that side of the family. He was already upset that I didn't come over for Thanksgiving and was super short with me when I tried to Zoom call them. He has been super cavalier about the pandemic and I just don't know how to handle him

Idk how to describe it but I think for a long time she has been depressed, like she feels like a failure or is going nowhere in life.

     The constant reminder that she is isnt married, doesnt have a boy friend, has a normal retail job, doesnt own a car or apartment,has no buisness, has no friends is always there. She is a very tough cookie, I bet no one else has noticed, since everyone here lives in their own world,but I can tell but every time I ask her if something is wrong she just replies with,""I'm just tired from work"" or ""I'm just sleepy"". It hurts me I can see her hurt. 

     I'm the closest one to her, she mean more to me than my parents, she the only person that accepts me with all my flaws, she even accepted me when I told her I was lesbian, something I know my parents would be disgusted by. She is like my mother,bestfriend,she is my one true family.

296,"So my university is all online this semester and next semester which really sucks because I really miss being on campus and I hate living at home because I’m missing out on my college experience. So me and my friend signed up for on campus housing for next semester because they’re only allowing under 3000 people an option of living on campus in a suite or a dorm.

unfortunately, my friend is going to have to cancel her housing application because she can’t afford it. We were planning on living together in a suite but now she can’t. And I don’t know if I should just keep my application but I don’t really see the point in living in a suite all by myself without her. Like the whole point would’ve been so that we could live together and like hang out all the time and still do work.

also another one of my friends has a house off-campus that she like pays rent for. And before finals I would literally just go to her house every weekend because she doesn’t have a roommate currently so she basically has two beds to her self and I end up using the other bed when I visit. And I love her and all, but I feel like we wouldn’t live well together. She offered me the option of living in her house which would mean paying rent, but I feel like it just be cheaper to just stay at my house where I have free food and don’t have to pay rent and can just visit her whenever I want.

But I just really don’t know what to do. I can’t live at home anymore. I hate living with my parents. There’s so many rules that I have to follow and I don’t really talk to my immediate family.

298,"Hi all. I am turning 18 and graduating from high school in January and I have decided that I will be taking a gap year. I am taking a gap year for a few reasons, mainly financial reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I will not be receiving any financial assistance from my parents, and they will not fill out the FAFSA for me for college. I also live in a state with really bad colleges. Low graduation rate, low rankings, low career prospects. My GPA/SAT scores could most likely get me into good out of state schools/private schools, but I wouldn't be able to afford those without my parents giving the colleges their financial info. To clarify, I might be able to get into an ivy league school and I would get full ride, but w/o my parents financial info they would make me pay full price.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan right now is to move to Texas for my gap year. As long as I am financially independent for that year, I will get the in-state rates when I start college. Texas has good schools, UTA and a&amp;m as a back up. Texas also seems to have good paying entry level jobs. If I could get a job at an amazon warehouse paying 16 dollars an hour I could save a lot of money up, and hopefully switch to doing that part time when I do start school. Beats the 11 dollars I make right now in fast food. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my high school counselor about my plan and she told me I would be making a huge mistake. She said that it is virtually impossible for an 18 year old to be fully financially independent, and that the financial aid people wouldn't give me in state rates even if I took the gap year. My research shows differently but IDK. Plus, worse case scenario I could always return to my home state. Her advice was to stay on good terms with my parents. She also said that no landlord would trust an 18 year old, and that there is good reason that colleges have dorms. I feel scared about going on such a non-traditional path, and I am kind of starting to doubt my original plan. I still think I will do it, but I am wondering if I can get some input from some other sources. This is the first time I will have any actual control over my own life, and I really don't want to fuck this up and be homeless or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried college but mental health kept getting in the way so my GPA was abysmal.

Decided to take a mental health year because of Covid and now I want to apply to universities again. All the universities I want to apply for are in the UK. I'm actually excited about the idea of attending any of the universities I want to apply to buy they all want a letter of recommendation as part of the UCAS application (universal application the UK uses).

I don't know anybody who would give me a positive recommendation.

My favourite teacher in high school, my theatre teacher and the reason I want to study theatre, probably hated me. I was a terrible student that constantly skipped doing anything outside of class, never did homework, I auditioned for the musical every year and was at least ensemble every year except for my senior year.

My senior year was also my worst year. I could make excuses and say it was my awful home situation coupled with my mental health issues but I should've at least put forth some effort and I didn't.

In college I was constantly fighting my anxiety and depression to even show up to class. I managed to get a 98% on a music theory final but in the class overall I think I had a C because I rarely showed up and routinely forgot about homework assignments and deadlines. Only reason I passed that class was my prior knowledge on the subject (I really should've been in the next class up but I wanted a to refresher on the subject).

In my sight singing and ear training class I got a near 100% purely due to having perfect pitch.

Every other class I failed. All of my green eds, I failed.

I failed so spectacularly at math that somebody could've guessed and done better than me and it made me feel really dumb. I mean I'm not smart but I didn't think I was actually that stupid.

That repeated each semester for about 4 years and each time I did worse and worse in my other classes because I kept internalising this idea that I was an idiot and that I couldn't succeed at anything.

And that's what brings us to now:

My professors probably hated me and are glad I'm not longer attending their school and my high school teachers probably don't remember me and if they do they'd not have anything positive to write about me.

Ironically, I'm finally in a healthy enough head space to try school again but the only schools I'm actually excited about attending I have no chance at being accepted to.

So what do I do?",08Dec2020,1
311,"Not sure how to put this, but I used to be able to get drunk all the time. Ever since I did molly and had an awful time, I can not even take a sip of alcohol without panicking or feeling an overwhelming sense of anxiety and I think it may be because of the molly I took months a go. It doesn’t hinder me too much as I never really drank too much, but now I just want to have a fun night drinking again. Any advice on this?",08Dec2020,1

318,"Hi, if you are reading this, thanks for taking your time I am 22 and I am a Concept Art student, over the last couple years I turned my life around and I started studying what I am passionate about, started working out and being more social, I become more mature and I gained confidence in myself.


Right now I am about to finish my portfolio (The thing artists use to present their work to get hired) and I am going through some heavy anxiety, I am very fearful and i feel like I am going a thousand miles per hour, I am over thinking everything, I can’t focus, I can’t relax, I work on my stuff for the most part of my day but I spend most of my time worrying while I am working and when I got some free time I worry even more.


I even tried some weed to see if I could chill and calm down but, it didn’t work, I am afraid I might not be good enough for work, that all my effort is in vain, even though everybody has been confident about me, I feel desperate to calm down but I feel rushed, I feel anxious and idk why, I have friends I am studying what I want I even lost weight working out, idk why I just can’t stop worrying, I am sorry if this sounds so desperate but I have been like this for months and even my chest is starting to hurt, I am stressed and I am not enjoying my work because I am so damn anxious all the time, I keep working and grinding because that’s what “they” told me to do, I took a lil break because “they” told me to, but nothing seems to work.

319,"so I'm dating someone but things are kind of confusing. Shes great, but I think maybe I should break up with her.

I just feel like we are growing apart because we barely see each other and I haven't had a moment alone with her in like a month. The other thing is that I've been a bit confused about my gender and I think I might be a trans guy, and I pretty sure she doesnt like men. I dont really want to break up with her especially because neither of us are in good mental places right now, and it doesnt look like this is going to work out long term. I want to love her so much but I just dont feel it.

And now, I don’t see anything for me to do in the future, and I just sit at home gaming all day and watching youtube. I’m not a bad kid, I don’t do drugs. My only issue is that I have an anger issue and I curse at my family a lot.

323,"I’m F 25. My mom (60) has been in a relationship with a physically and emotionally abusive man for the past year. He has hit her multiple times, and even spent time in county jail for his actions. After these incidents, my mom has said she’s done and blocked his number in an attempt to end things. The problem is, he’s her neighbor and lives directly beneath her apartment unit. So their close proximity makes it easy for him to worm his way back into her life. 

The other problem is, my mom, while being strong in many ways, comes from an abusive background since childhood. I don’t think she’s had one healthy relationship with a man in her adult life (she was married to my dad for 25 years, and he was also emotionally abusive). Because of this, she is weak-willed when it comes to this current man and is unable to hold her ground for long. The only thing that’s keeping him from prison is my mom refusing to press charges. She won’t even sign a restraining order we spent weeks trying to put together.

She displays the textbook symptoms of an abuse victim, such as making excuses for him, and saying “she deserves this”.  She says she loves him, despite everything he’s done. We have tried multiple approaches to convince her to leave him, including living with her for a month, confronting him ourselves, and even sought out the abuse hotline for advice.  None of these things have had lasting effects. I honestly just think my mom needs therapy, but even that won’t correct the problem overnight.

So in the meantime, all we can do is be there for her in the event something else happens, but we also make it clear that we do not accept this man under any circumstances. This includes holidays, in my mind. I had at one point asked my mom what exactly she thinks is going to happen when Christmas rolls around and if she expects us to spend time with this person and act like everything is okay. She didn’t have an answer, and I know for certain she’s just hoping we’ll acquiesce and accept that this man is going to spend the holiday with us. As far as I’m concerned, that’s not going to happen.

While I don’t want to hurt my mom, I can’t sit by and further enable her relationship with this person by sitting around a table with him and pretending things are perfectly normal and acceptable when they’re clearly not. Furthermore, this creates stress and anxiety for me as well, and I don’t think I need to subject myself to distressing circumstances when I don’t have to. My mom is 60 years old and in retirement. It pisses me off that she’s going through this when she should be relaxing and actually enjoying life with someone who genuinely makes her happy. But since she refuses to leave this person, I think I need to set up boundaries for myself. I’m a grown woman, and if I really don’t want to spend the holidays with an abuser, I think I’m well within my rights to say so.  

I think I might be wrong to do this since I’ll basically be giving my mom an ultimatum. Either she refuses to invite this person, or I won’t be joining her for Christmas. 

I’m planning on telling her this tomorrow, but before I do, Reddit, I just want to know your take on this shitty situation...Will I be wrong to create this ultimatum for my mom? Will I just be making things worse?",08Dec2020,1

325,"so i’ve been talking to this guy for about four months now? he’s my best friend’s friend, and he and i do this thing where we pretend to flirt with each other and act like a couple because it’s lowkey funny to see the other person’s reaction lol. i’m completely not into him, because he’s sort of a player not in an asshole-ish way, but more like he loves to flirt with multiple girls at once but he doesn’t lie about it and doesn’t mean anything by it, it’s just no strings attached. i think we both just like the attention and it’s funny because we both know no feelings are going to ruin it.

like, straight up, i would not trust this man to be my boyfriend lol. there are so many reasons as to why we couldn’t be with each other. our lifestyles are completely different, he has habits that’d be a pain in the ass to deal with (for example, he smokes and i don’t like smoking at all lmaoo). he wants to go into a completely different career path than i do, so it’s pretty obvious we wouldn’t last. and i’m not sad about this at all, because it’s fun to flirt with him and joke about us knowing that nothing will happen. i’d even be down to cuddle with him, just because we both like the attention. 

am i weird for thinking this way? i feel a little cold hearted because my friend told me she couldn’t understand how i could do these things with someone and not catch feelings, and i have no idea how to formulate my feelings without sounding crazy. it seems that everyone keeps saying one of us is going to catch feelings, but i highly doubt it, because i want a serious, committed relationship, which i know he won’t give me.",08Dec2020,1
326,"I’m 19/M and I’m having a really rough time right now. I don’t feel fulfilled or happy with myself right now. I know most people have awful problems in life and I’m not trying to sound like a baby but I’m just genuinely not happy. 

I’m a freshman in college right now and I have maybe a handful of friends. However, most of them are in the Marines and the ones that stayed in college have girlfriends and never want to hang out. I haven’t met anyone I really enjoy talking to at my college. Maybe it’s because of corona of just my personality but it’s really eating me up. 

I’m taking general courses atm and have literally no idea what I want to major in. My one buddy wanted to get into distilling or brewing after he got out of the military and I asked him if I could maybe help (making alcohol has always been a hobby of mine) and he basically said no friends and business. It kinda hurt but I get where he’s coming from. 

I’d like to get a girlfriend at least for a little while so I could share some new experiences with someone and have a little fun. I’ve tried taking to people but they’re turned off by my height. I’m a short fella. 

My life just consists of working in retail, doing assignments, playing video games, and drinking. I have seasonal hobbies like hunting, fishing, off-roading, wine making, etc. they aren’t things I have the time or money to do often. 

I just find myself watching everyone live their lives. Everyone’s so happy and enjoying themselves while I’m basically sitting in some kind of depressive stagnation. I wouldn’t say I’m super depressed. I’d say I’m just really bored and lonely is all. I’m afraid that it’s going to be like this for a long long time. 

TLDR: I have no idea what kind of career I want and I’m watching all of my friends live their lives while I basically suffer. I can’t get a girlfriend because of my height and I can’t seem to find new friends. I’m afraid this will last for many more years.",08Dec2020,1

330,"So a few years ago I moved in with a person who had 4 cats. At first I thought this was a little weird because before Ioved in Kathy (fake name) lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I soon realized the apartment complex only allowed for two cats and that she intentionally lied to them. usually I wouldn't care about breaking the rules, but the apartment smelled so bad and the cats were constantly fighting due to the lack of space.
She would only clean the apartment everother week and the lilter one a week. All of her cats were/are clinically obese (because she ""didn't have time to put them on a feeding schedule""), threw up at least twice a week, and tried to escape the apt multiple times a day. 
After about 6 months I started looking for a new apartment and tried to stay out of the Apartment as much as possible. She then started to go on week long trips without telling me, meaning they went without food or water for at least 2-3 days. Kathy did say after that her sister checked on them every two days.
I do want to say that durring this time she was going through alot of mental health problems. I'm guessing this may be why she neglected them? In her words ""the cats keep me from having to go to the pshy ward"". 
When I moved out she got 2 more cats but she stayed in the 2 bedroom. I don't know how she is with the cats now. She currently has 6 cats.

333,"Hi!

So I'm in grad school getting my MFA. We had a major assignment due Sunday and I was so relieved when I had submitted it that it was done. Well, today my prof emailed me saying that there were major problems with my work. He's offering for me to resubmit it next week, which of course I appreciate because I'd rather not fail.

Like I said, I dropped the ball on the assignment. I could have done better. Some constructive criticism on this makes perfect sense to me. My issue is that I feel incredibly discouraged because I feel he really ripped apart my work. I really like this teacher and I feel like he hates me based on what he sent. There were tons of long comments all over the document from him, and some of them seemed kind of sassy to me. I feel really stupid. I cried to my fiance about it for an hour (not seeking sympathy, just trying to paint the picture of where I'm at). 

On top of this, I asked my classmates about what they submitted. One person had, I think, gone into less detail than I did based on his page count (the main criticism on mine is lack of detail). Instead of getting the pages of comments on his work like I did, he basically received a simple ""Thank you!"" from this same professor. He submitted earlier than I did, so maybe that impacted things?

Has anyone else been in this situation? How do I deal with feeling stupid/discouraged after looking at his comments? I have to work on this re-submission for the next week and I don't know how I'm going to deal with this every day. How do I move on from this? I feel discouraged as this is my career.",08Dec2020,1

For example, I helped him come up with an idea for an essay of his, and although he appreciated the help, he couldn't help but feel guilty and worried about someone thinking he was plagiarising. He describes that it feels like someone is constantly out to get him, and that he needs to be on eggshells around others to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone (even though he's genuinely a great person). He feels that he overthinks a lot, and doesn't like that he cares so much about what other people think of him, as he's been feeling like this for a really long time now.

He retired early. Like then I was 8 years old early (he was around 46 I’m guessing. He used to have back problems but surgeries made it very manageable. He was just diagnosed with diabetes, and works out very consistently (he’s pretty buff). He’s a healthy but his sleep and activity habits are just out the door. He’ll sleep till 3-4PM and go to bed at 2AM-4AM. When he’s not sleeping he’s exercising, mowing the lawn, or watching tv(and you can only exercise and mow for so long). This has gone on for as long as I can remember. I always thought the exercising would be sufficient for a healthy life, but he forgets everything now.

I’m in college and I call him every week, and he will consistently tell me the same story. I used to dismiss it like “why would he remember”, but now its very time I talk to him. Not “oh I told you this a year ago and mixed up who I told” but “Dad, you told me this last week and the week previous and the week previous.”

My mom says she’s told him, but like a bickering angry couple he blows her off when it’s not really worded “nicely”. He’s really stubborn about it now. How can I get through to him? Is there even a way to stop the memory decline (medication, games?)",08Dec2020,1

I had a low-end PC to play some games for the daily dose of some entertainment but it died around 2 months ago. Since then my grades have dropped significantly.  


I have to attend online classes for 6 hours on 6 days/week. After sitting for 6 hours on chair staring on a screen I am not able to concentrate on my homework and studies. I used to study for 4-5 hours daily but now I can't even concentrate for more than 2.

346,"I’m a 19 year old second year college student. Last year and all the prior years before that since freshmen year high school were amazing. Life was always going up for me, I always overcame everything thrown at me, and nothing was ever a problem to me. I was confident in myself and thought high of myself. I was present with friends and everybody loved me, my personality was myself and I always felt amazing about life.

This year has been completely different. Maybe because of Covid, maybe because of other factors, I don’t know. This year I have been much less comfortable with myself. I consider myself to have great achievement and I’m usually confident that I can do anything I set my mind to. It feels like I have everything I should have - a promising career, fulfilling hobbies, healthy habits, good network of friends, and a great girlfriend. But I feel insanely unsatisfied to prior years. I feel like this is the first year where it hasn’t been better than the last.

I think part of this I can blame on covid, maybe part of it on having a girlfriend, maybe part of it on smoking every night. This semester in college did not hold a candle up to my freshmen year of college. Living in an apartment was lame, literally never joined a club or any social activities because everything was through zoom. I have my closest friends living with me and my girlfriend a 5 minute drive away. But everything just felt unsatisfying. Towards the end of the semester I didn’t feel like even going out into the living room to talk to my roomates ever. This is the first time where I don’t feel comfortable where I am in life. In order to counter this, I have been insanely focused on my goals. Maybe this is because I think it will make me feel better? It’s not. I got an interview with google, I’ve been spending hours playing piano, I’ve changed my sleeping schedule so I can workout in the morning, I started meditating again and I’ve been focusing on building better connections with my family. Despite all of this though I still have this HUGE nagging feeling that something just isn’t right. I don’t feel like myself, and I absolutely hate it and I don’t know what to do.",08Dec2020,1

Hi, sorry for the long post and also sorry for my English. I need advice, help, maybe compassion, or just someone to tell me to stop being so goddamn insecure. 

I'm a 21yo woman, he's a 22yo man. We were best friends for 3 years, until he confessed his love to me last New Year's Eve when he still had a girlfriend, who he broke up with a week later. We've been dating since June.  (backstory) 

He currently has a female friend who he's been getting along with great. They text all the time, they call each other every now and then, he plans on cooking for her someday (cause he's a great cook) and they are going to study together during Christmas break for the upcoming exams.

I'm happy for him ofc but, you know, trust issues. I was once 'that friend'. He had a girlfriend but I was his best friend and in the end he was just in love with me (basically since the beginning of our friendship).

It bothers me that he keeps bringing her up and that he texts her more than me, but on the other hand, it's kinda stupid to be mad about it, cause I was once the friend. I talked to him about it and he knows I'm not fond of it, but I don't wanna be the psycho that doesn't want him to have female friends.

He also tells her about me (like he told me about his last girlfriend) and she asks him how I'm doing, so I feel like she doesn't have bad intentions. I'm more afraid of what he feels, does, wants... I told him to let me know if he ever falls out of love with me or likes her more than me, to which he replied that I had to chill out.

So ehhh, what should I do? Is it weird that I'm worried? How should I talk to him more about it? Thanks in advance.",08Dec2020,1

355,"I don't know where else to put this but it needs to be said because I cannot watch it happen anymore. I'm sorry mods if this is in the wrong place but I really need to know where to put it if it is.

I have a friend I have known since 3rd grade, and his parents are bottom of the barrel kind of scum in my eyes. They act all ""happy family"" as a front but then do everything they can to make their child's life a living hell. He is currently 17 with plans to move in with my group of friends as soon as he can but I'm getting increasingly worried about his mental state. In the span of 2 months it has gone from ""I can get through this, I have faith things will be better"" to ""I don't think I can handle this much longer, I don't see the point in living anymore."" He has thoughts of cutting, suicide, and the whole lot of emotions to go with that, and I'm more than positive he has already cut himself before.

Back to the parents though. These people have consistently emotionally and physically injured their child. They haven't ever left a mark with what they have done, but the mental mark is what I'm worried about. The most recent case was them yelling at my friend because he didn't do the dishes immediately after they asked and I then got told that their dad said an off comment about how if he wanted to go outside and kill himself, he would lock the door behind him. They know what state of mind he is in and just encourage it. They yell at him for any little thing, even just crying because of the last thing they berated him for. I don't know what exactly they say, but I do know that it's nothing light. My friend has tried contacting CPS in the past (about a year ago or so I think) and his parent's played it off as him being overreactive because they told him to do the dishes. I've read countless messages at this point of my friend being unable to do anything to help himself because if he gets defensive at all, they will either start piling on top of him with yelling to the point of making him cry, or hurt him in some capacity. Sometimes it's both..

I've tried for the longest time to do whatever I could to help my friend, but with Covid it's just harder. He is trying to get out of the situation but he doesn't have anyone other than me and his girlfriend to offer him help, and neither of us can offer him a place to stay at the moment due to both of us living with parents who don't care about his suffering. I can't even offer any financial support because anything I would give him would go straight to his parents, just like what he earns from his job. Anything that he tries to get to better himself goes immediately to them.

He's just continuously losing hope, and while I try to make sure that I can do anything I can for him, I can't do much without his parent's making everything 100x worse. Me and other friends of mine are trying to figure out anything we can do for him, and it's just not looking good. He was told he was getting kicked out on his birthday in 3 months, and I don't want him living on the streets. I also don't want him dead before he even has the chance to go anywhere and that's looking like what's going to happen..

I don't have everything that's happened on here, because if I did it would be looking more like a novel.

They've all said I've changed and I'm not the same they used to know. I don't know what changed but I'm aware I'm not outgoing and as bubbly as I used to be. I guess I prefer more alone time now.

I want to become a better friend but when I try it feels like I feel forced and am obliged to. I feel like there is just a switch where I just shut down and don't feel like talking to anyone. I'm not depressed or anything I just want to be alone most of the time and I feel like it's becoming a problem.

I want to care as well but I just Idk how to say it without sounding like a b word. I just can't care how much we talk or hang out.

I'm in a bind. And it's scaring the shit outta me. 

I am in serious debt like I never have been before and I really need some advice on how to get through this.

I have just gone back to work after looking after my elderly mother, who is disabled, and my income is barely paying my rent let alone bills. I've gone through all my savings looking after her.

My husband cannot work due to an accident he was involved in a few years ago and needs assistance for day to day things too. 

I literally have $50 to my name but I have debt collectors calling me whilst I'm at work constantly. I owe over $5000. I know it doesn't seem much to some, but having a husband who cannot bring in income and the responsibility of looking after my mother, I'm getting really overwhelmed.

Finding someone else to take care of her is not an option plus her government payments go onto all her own bills, mortgage etc. 

I can't move as I was lucky to get the place I am in now and am binded by a contract.

My husband is receiving a small government income , and that was a struggle just to get that. It doesn't go far at all.

Does anyone know how I can either earn more of an income (say at night, when my mother doesn't need me there) that would work around my current job? I'm in Australia if that helps.

Does anyone have any advice to get through this?

I don't feel as though I can go to a charity place for food etc as I am working and there are people around me who don't even have jobs or homes and need it more than me.

I have very little I could sell, and those items are heirlooms which aren't worth much anyway!

Can't go to family for money, they are not doing very well either..

Last year, I went through a pretty messy breakup. At the core of it it was just petty high school drama, but I had a friend (let’s call her Annie) who I had trusted who I complained to about my ex boyfriend who then twisted my words and told everything she knew to my ex boyfriend, who used my twisted words to try to turn our whole year level against me. He didn’t have the best reputation however, as he had broken up with his long term girlfriend right before he had started dating me, and had started dating Annie right after breaking up with me (although me and a friend who was living with Annie at the time suspected that they may have had something before we broke up, but theirs no proof of that)

Anyway, ever since then I have found it extremely difficult to trust people. As a result, I have turned to lying to prevent people spreading rumours about me. The biggest one has been my virginity status.

I am a virgin. Although I believe that virginity is a social construct, it remains that I have never had sex. I tell half the people I know that I have had sex, which is a lie, and the other half that I have never had sex, which is the truth.

My reasoning is that if anyone starts a rumour about me, there will be no way to prove it. Someone says that I’m a slut, well half of the people think I’m a virgin, so that can’t be right. Someone says that I’m frigid, well that can’t be right, because they know I’ve had sex before. Anything everyone knows about me is contradictions.

But I don’t want to keep lying. Before Annie abused my trust, I was a fairly nice and honest person. Now, if I’m being frank, I’m a lying bitch. I don’t like it, but I feel like this is the only way I can protect myself.

I want to come clean to one of my friends. Let’s call him Noel. He’s a great guy, and he wholeheartedly believes that I’ve had sex, because that’s what I told him. I also think he thinks I’m a bit of a slut, not that that’s a bad thing if you want to sleep with as many people that you want, and he would agree, but I don’t want that reputation for myself. I also have a little bit of a crush on him, but that isn’t motivating my want to come clean. I want to come clean because he trusts me, and he deserves to be treated the same way.

I’m not sure how I should tell him. Of even IF I should tell him. He knows about my history with Annie and my ex, so I feel like he would understand. But I find it really hard to admit to my mistakes, even though I feel guilty about my mistakes very often.

I don’t know how to finish this really, but I don’t have anyone else to ask about this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",08Dec2020,1

371,"My bf (male, 24) and (female, 23) I are high school sweethearts. We got together when we were both seniors and 17. We’ve been together 6 years. 

Overall, he is a great bf! Extremely patient, logical, caring, affectionate, super smart, confident, never judges me. He is a family man, my whole family loves him, he has a great job he worked hard for his age &amp; I know he would be a great life partner/father without a doubt. 

I would say I have more flaws then him .. I am impatient, can be pessimistic, sensitive, get hangry, indecisive, don’t make good money/don’t have a set career, I talk too much &amp; I could go on and on. He has his flaws too but I don’t think they are as bad as mine. He is forgetful, too logical, uncreative, apathetic about most things, not spontaneous and isn’t self aware of his emotions. These aren’t deal breakers at all just make things a little frustrating sometimes.

We have been talking about marriage more recently &amp; we decided to wait 2.5-3 years more until we get married. This is because he wants to spend time with his parents more before he moves out when he marries me. Also, although his job pays very well for his age &amp; for the state we live in .. he wants to finish his studies credential and masters (which he will complete next March 2021). This will give him a significant pay boost and fully secure his teaching job.  We both graduate  college last year &amp; I struggled to find a job with my broad degree. As of a few months ago I work at his moms office and get paid mínimums age but I love my job, schedule &amp; the people I work with. I feel truly grateful especially during these unexpected times to have a job. 

So basically our relationship isn’t totally perfect but I am overall really happy with the way he treats me. He is such a great communicator, makes me a priority, I know we will be financially well &amp; we make a good team (he has told me himself multiple times). He vocally tells me her loves me often, tells me I am beautiful and that I make him extremely happy. 

Now.. here is the one issue. After our first 1.5 years together I found out he had been messaging multiple  girls in appropriately. I found out by complete accident. He was blatantly flirting calling girls cute names, complimenting them, saying he wished he had a chance with some of them. With one girl I particularly he told her he would leave me if she she gave him a chance to be with him &amp; continued to profess his love for her. I was devastated. I was never a jealous gf, never checked his phone, I would have out my hands on fire for him.. and I was just shocked he would do that to me. Especially because our first year together he was extremely jealous/controlling not allowing me to txt other guys/checking my phone .. not letting me where certain things... threatening that he would stalk me to make sure. It was hell. After I broke up with him the first time (October 2015 for like 2 days) he promised he would change. He got therapy and he actually DID improve. So when I found out about the girls (June 2016) it have been about 6 months where things seemed perfect.

I was so hurt.. I cried .. after that I got extreme acne (which I had never suffered from) &amp; started to over eat because I was so emotional. I gained like 10 pounds in a month. I started to become jealous/ more sensitive when I never was an unhealthily jealous person. I always assumed that is a guy loved you and you had open healthy communication that he wouldn’t do that. Fast forward to (February 2017) because of my sensitivity.. we were having problems. I then again checked his computer (on purpose this time) and found out he had been talking to this new girl at school. He was telling his guy friends that she was more attractive then me &amp; that maybe he should give her a chance. Since she was flirting with him and was clearly interested. He had given her an extra ticket for an event he was going to playing at (his a musician) and that maybe he would see her there. I was devastated. I had gained weight.. had horrible acne and now this. I confronted him and he apologized &amp; said that he had been dumb. He had just found out a few days prior she was much older then him and that she had a kid. I felt like a second choice yet again... But I forgave him. 

My jealous and behaviors became even worse. I became such a bitter person because of it. After that I caught him in multiple other lies pertaining to girls. I’ve found messages of him flirting with a girl he told me had no interest in when I found out they sat together in class. He called her gorgeous and other flirty comments.. she asked him out and he agreed to maybe get together some other time. She asked him is he had a gf and he told her we were on a rough patch/break (which we were but I was direct and told him I just needed time because I did not like who I was becoming.) It was only a few days and I made it clear it wasn’t to breakup just so I can gather my thoughts. She told him it wasn’t a good idea then and then he agreed. He started telling her about me once she asked and she told him he was lucky to have me and to not stop fighting for me. She was really nice.. I just know not all girls would encourage that like she did. 

There’s been other lies about girls, secrecy.. found messaged that hurt me . I got to the point that even when I knew he lied about it .. I would still ask him to tell me the truth. He always lied .. and even when I made him swear on our kids or pinky promise (it’s silky but it’s “sacred” to us) he would lie. I just stopped pushing him on it because I know I would stay. I found out he had tried a sex app once (although he never meant to use it) he said he was curious. 

I know he isn’t staying for sex because we were each tienes first and because of all our issues/my age I never felt ready to take that step with him. We barely started having sex 6 months ago.. yes, we waited 5.5 years &amp; I don’t regret it at all. He never pressured me although he would be honest that he wanted it. 

I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t trust him.. and know he will lie to me about other girls. He liked the attention and does not set boundaries. I’ve sent him articles, explained to him a ton of times how it hurts me, what is not okay with me, how it’s not fair to our relationship. There’s no other way I could possibly state how I feel and what I am not okay with. I have cried, begged, yelled, sent text messages, tried to give him pointers on how to set healthy relationship boundaries. I got to the pint where I realized I am not his babysitter. I am not longer extremely jealous .. and when he tells me something I just assume he is probably lying. It’s not in a negative way, I just know he wouldn’t tell me the truth/ I don’t trust him to make the best choices. 

He now tells me when girls message him &amp; he tries to share the conversation. He is trying to be transparent and work on it with me and I thank him and listen. However, there’s a tiny part of me that knows he probably deletes the txts, apps or just lie to me and I’ll never know. I admitted to him a week ago this &amp; he cried and was extremely hurt that I did not trust him. That I thought that lowly of him. I told him it was hard for me to blindly believe what he tells me anymore even when I ask for the truth. I’ve been disappointed so many times to the point that it’s easier to let him believe that I trust his word then to stress myself about something I can’t prove. I got the point where I rather not find anything because I know the relationship is good in all other areas. He cried and cried and begged me to try to believe him and that he was desperately trying to be better. That he did not want me to believe in him just so he could deceive me. 


Anyways, today I accidentally found out he had tiktok. His friend who I know messaged him and it was weird that he did not open it (he always does). I pointed it out and he reluctantly opened it. He showed me a mem he sent but ignore the previous video txt. I asked him to open it and he got super defensive saying he did not want to.. which I found odd. I asked his to open it and he said he did not want to and to just leave it alone. I told him that he either opened it or i would. He said he was super ashamed because he got tiktok after we had an honest conversation months prior about him wanting one so he can relate to his students better. I advised him against it because of the temptation to potential message other girls and that I wouldn’t prohibit him to get it but I would feel better if he wouldn’t. He agreed not to get it and told me it had just been an idea. The conversation went super well.. I gave my honest opinion, i was not mean or jealous about it. I just wanted to protect our relationship. 

He then admitted that he got it to see what it was about then realized there was a lot of sexy girls on it so he used it instead of porn to do his bush es sometimes. I know he watched porn and I am 100% okay with that, we even had talked openly multipleeee times about what he likes to watch, his fav girls to watch, fetishes etc. I am genuinely an open understanding person. I am really trying to be able to have open communication in my relationship without fear of judgement. I was so hurt he has felt the need to hide the app when I had just shared I preferred he wouldn’t. He told me he wasn’t using it to message any girls but then OF COURSE I found out he had message one girl about her only fans account &amp; message another one about how sexy she was with hearts, kisses and how he was blessed to have her on his feed. He has gotten the app in July and now it’s December. He ALWAYS says he never remembers doing those things and it’s because it means nothing
To him. I am not even sure how to feel anymore ..

This isn’t the worst thing he has done .. so maybe that’s why I did not cry for more then 5 min on my own. It’s so confusing. How can somebody who treats me so amazing everyday .. not respect me the same way behind my back. I really don’t get it. I don’t think he does it on purpose I just don’t think he thinks about things.

I just feel like pathetic for always staying ... But I know there are a ton of Shitty men out there. Men who are mean, judge mental, impatient etc. I know he genuinely loves me because he does a million good things for me. Helps me with my email, encourages me, brings me food, he is truly consistent ..

I just worry one day things will escalate to more. That they could become physical. He is insecure about his looks .. and he feeds off the attention. I just worry that if another girl doesn’t put on the brakes or I find out about it then the relationship could intensify and not just be him trying to get his ego boosted. Marriage is around the corner .. and I don’t know.. 

What would you do? What would you suggest?

386,"   My boyfriend, his cousin and I all live together. The cousin moved in a little after my boyfriend and I got together and brought his cat with him. This cat is amazing. However, he is not a good cat owner. I had to give the cat a water bowl as he was content to let her drink out of the dirty toilet and rain puddles. He also never bothered to get her a litter box so I stepped up and did that too and clean it daily. Twice now my boyfriend and I have had to give her flea baths and recently we found out she had worms and we took care of that as well. The cousin is also never home. So my boyfriend and I make sure all her needs are met and that she’s spoiled and taken care of. When he is home he finds it funny to torment the cat by spilling her around in backpacks and even sprayed Lysol in the cats mouth when corona first started. It could have killed her and now she’s terrified of any air freshener. Overall, he’s horrible. 

   Now he plans on moving out. But I don’t want him to take the cat. On top of all the previously stated reasons, he’s moving out with people who have two large dogs. The cat is absolutely terrified of dogs and broke the screen off one of our windows trying to escape last time he brought one of the dogs around. 

    I plan on asking him directly to consider letting the cat stay here. I’m even willing to pay for her. But how do I go about it in a way that won’t offended him and ruin our chances? 
    To be clear, if I knew the cat was going to be taken care of and loved when he moved out, this wouldn’t be an issue. I love her and would be devastated to see her go, but this is about her quality of life. I can’t watch her go back to a life of dirty toilet water and neglect.

390,"I was in a very long relationship with him. He was abusive and manipulated me during that time and I realized this many times but I didn't really know how to break up with him, but we finally broke up last year's August. This year I started going to a new therapist and she pointed out how that relationship started out of his harassment, which is true and I didn't notice till she mentioned it. But since I had already gone over that relationship it's not something we talked a lot about. But anyway. 

Ever since January someone has been calling me late hours at night (between 1 and 4 am). I didn't notice at first because I always had my phone in the ""do not disturb"" setting, and never picked up. I once forgot to do that and picked up but the caller didn't say anything, so I blocked the number. He got a different number and this went on for months, only stopping for a few months in summer, I can't really recall how long. I've blocked about 10 numbers. The only thing is I never knew it was him.

Today I decided to pick up and said ""who is this?"" And he said it was him, I asked ""what do you want?"" But I couldn't really understand so I asked once again, what do you want? and again I didn't understand, so I asked once again, and then he hung up.

I honestly didn't care about him as we didn't have much contact after breaking up except from me asking him to pay me a big amount of money he owed me, but he totally stopped paying me about a year ago and said he'd paid me when he could, but we haven't spoke ever since. If iy ever saw him in the street I'd just ignore him.

Now that I know he's the one who's been harassing me I'm totally mad but also scared. Last week I went out with my current boyfriend and when he brought me home he said he thought he saw my ex walking down the street. I didn't see him so I just shrugged it off but now I'm scared he might have been lurking around my home to see if I go out or what I do.

I don't know what to do, as authorities won't really do anything unless I get hurt, and even in that case they're known not to help. I can't really talk to my therapist right now since my mom got covid and we're all in lockdown till next week but I'll message her in the morning. I totally want to face him and tell him to stop bothering me but I don't have his phone number and I erased him from all social media, I'm not sure if that's the right way to tell him to stop or if it'll only get worse. I don't know where he lives or where does he work. All the numbers he's been calling me are not active, I think he might have a separate phone he turns on just to call me.

397,"I've never done this before but I'm hoping to get some advice! Basically I am a first year university student and that's not ideal for a lot of reasons. For the last year a half or so I've been really struggling with motivation to do my schoolwork. It's basically been an endless cycle of wanting to do well having a panic attack because I might not do well wasting my time procrastinating and then doing projects/assignments/studying right before something is due. I always been a really gifted student but I also put a lot of effort into school because I felt like it was expected of me to do well. I think a lot fo it had to do that my dad was allowing me to live on my own ( basically had been since I was fourteen it's a long story). If I didn't get good grades I would freak out and spiral but I would do it in a productive way. I remember in grade eleven I had done horribly on my first chemistry exam and I made a promise to myself for the rest of the year I would put in as much effort as possible. And that worked and I did really well. 

But then came grade twelve in high school I felt like I was slacking off. I had done most of my required classes the year before including the highest level chemistry and math offered at my school. I was expecting grade twelve to be a walk in the park in comparison. My entire high school career I always put a lot of emphasis on not wasting time choosing to take core courses instead of electives. That meant my senior year I was essentially taking two classes a semester. Honestly it wasn't really that bad I was finally enjoying my time hanging out with friends and I even got my first boyfriend. And then obviously covid happened half way through my senior year and it just destroyed me. Obviously I am not suffering as much as most but it's really been detrimental to my mental health. I suddenly cared so much about how I was doing in school but I just wasn't willing to put in the time anymore. I would learn material right before a quiz or test. I would read a book right before an essay was due and in the end it worked out. 

The real issue comes when I got to university. I was no stranger to taking difficult classes I figured this would be no different. Unfortunately my habits from the year before carried over and I found myself cramming the hours before. I was taking tests right before they were due at midnight. I was even falling a class and ended up having to withdraw from it whereas previously I had never even failed a test before. Every bad grade I got sent me into a spiral where I would be crying for hours, having panic attacks, etc. I feel horrible for my boyfriend who's had to bear with me though it all. My constant anxiety has been causing my chest to hurt right over my heart and I'm getting really concerned about my mental and physical health. I tried talking to a counsellor and I had a phone call but I felt so guilty about taking time to work on myself instead of my school work.

I ended up decided to move in with my siblings who were in the city where my school was located (I'm not in class) to try to get away from the distractions from my home town such as my friends/boyfriend but it hasn't worked. I feel just as bad as before and I'm just finding new ways to distract myself. 

I don't know what to do. It's finals time now and even as I'm writing this I'm procrastinating taking a test I know I'm not prepared for. I feel like none of the information I've learned in my first semester of university has stuck and it's really frustrating for me. 

Anyways, I've been considering taking some time off school to really work on myself. Get my anxiety under control, start eating healthier, start being cleanlier. I want to figure out how to be a good person and for myself before I continue on this big challenge that is university. There's a couple issues though. 

1. I got a ton of scholarship money and honestly I feel like I'm cheating the people who gave it to me if I decide to take some time off school. I intend to go back when I feel ready but I don't know how long that is going to take. 

2. I receive money from the government every month because I'm in school. It's a survivor's benefit because my mom passed away when I was really young. Basically my dad received 200 ish dollars a month to help take care of me but when I stopped living with him he started sending me the money. If I stop going to school I stop receiving the money which isn't a huge deal but it always pays for my car insurance so it's been really nice to have. At least that's what my dad has always told me but I talked to someone else I know that also receives it that they were able to contact whoever sends it once they went back to school and they started receiving it again. 

3. If I stop going to school I have to start paying rent. I live with my two older siblings in a house that my dad owns and rents. The deal is as long as his kids are in school we don't have to pay rent. Which leads me to my next point. 

4. My older brother went to school and my oldest sister went to university but she dropped out and moved across the country. Obviously, this was not well received by my family. There was a lot of turmoil and I'm not gonna lie I think the rest of my family thinks they're big disappointments. Part of my anxiety needs me to be like by everyone especially people I see as authority figures which is most of my family. I'm worried dealing with all of them is going to be really stressful and make things worse. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm worried that I'll never get my working hard habits back. I worried that taking a year off won't help my situation. I'm worried about all the financial drawbacks. I so worried all the time and I hate it. The worst part is when I try to talk to my family about it they just tell me ""that's what university is"" or ""you're one of the smartest people I know you'll figure it out"". I don't think it's the lack of ""smartness"" or ability I just feel like I've given all that I have and I'll never be able to give anymore. I hear things online like ""I peaked in high school"" or ""gifted kid burnout"" and I am terrified that that is me and I'll never be the hardworking successful smart kid that every teacher, every parent, every relative thought that I was. I'm worried that I'm done and all I'll ever be is a stressed anxious incompetent lazy shell of a person I used to be. I really need help or advice anything that you could give :) because I am just so tired. 

In conclusion, I intend to finish the year but I'm taking less classes next semester so I'll see if that helps. For next year though I'm really need some guidance.",08Dec2020,1

Long term leaker and reader. I’m looking for some outside perspective. I moved in with my grandmother just before COVID kicked off, left my flat and changed jobs and area to provide a bit more support. Fast forward to now, I’ve meet someone very special, and worked my bollocks off trying to get myself back on track after a rough couple of years. We’re at the point of looking for places together, and moving out my my grandmothers. I’ve looked for places close and if everything goes to plan I’ll only be 15 minutes up the road. But I have guilt about moving out and leaving her. There’s know one else in the house apart from her dog and she’s 72. I do quite a bit  for her, sort her bills, make sure she eats correctly and house stuff. Just have guilt about leaving which effecting me. I’m very open with my other half and she has concerns and cares very much about the situation as well as my Nan. Don’t really know what I’m asking for. Just need an outside point of view or something.. cheers",08Dec2020,1

403,"I'm 21 and I've been babysitting for years. I'm currently doing an internship for 2 days a week and I have to study for two days as well. 

This family I'm babysitting for is taking up my energy and causing me to do less for school as I should.

She's a 3 year old girl, super sweet and really talkative when I'm around. When her parents are around, not as much. She gets very clingy and has meltdowns all the time. Lately, her mother had been talking about how ""traumatising"" it is when her kid will go to school next year.

I'm currently the only person she actually talks to apart from her parents. I feel a responsibility to teach her some skills for her future, which is definitely working. I can say no and she listens, she'll be nice to me and she doesn't have meltdowns. I'm worried for her, because her parents have all kinds of faults that they won't fix and it's not my job to help them fix it.

I don't have the energy to do this every week. I also don't have the guts to tell them what to do, let alone how to fix it all. I also don't want to leave the kid alone. What should I do?

404,"I tried really hard to look for a job again after losing my last contract to COVID.

I am very much an introvert. So, while I know that I can do the job, it's extremely hard to show that in what limited time your given during an interview. This has been compounded on top of my confidence slowly bring destroyed whilst unemployed.

Many people who interview me even question my skills. 

Example 1:

""Did you actually complete the Cisco courses on your CV?""

""Yes, well I can show you the certificates if you like""

""Well it's just that some people put it on their CV, and they never completed the course, they just sat in but never passed.""

""...""

Example 2:

""We're you actually part of the military?""

""Yes.""

""It's just that some people say they were in the military but really only worked with them as a civilian.""

""...""

So.. I get really upset when employers doubt the skills and experience I put down on my CV. It's frustrating that supposedly there are a lot of people lying about themselves.

Anyway, I finally get a job. It's barely above minimum wage working as security on graveyard shifts for minimum wage 60+ hours a week.

While I can do the work, I suffer sleep problems, panic attacks, depression, anxiety. I'm concerned for my long term health and want to find a better job real quick before I run into health complications.

He was always so excited and he brings out efforts just to make the people around him, especially me, happy. But when he started to do some work, he became more dry as each day passes, until I found out that things he kept as secret, like gaming all night (which is completely fine with me, he could've just told me so I won't have to wait too long for his replies). He always promises that he'll make it up, but never did. Also found out he started seeing someone he met at the game, and when I saw it he tried so hard to hide it from me. I don't understand why. I never demanded anything from him. And since on, he's become cold during our ol conversations, but he acts as if nothing's wrong when we meet. It's like he's a completely different person.

407," 

I(22F) am on my gap year after graduating uni and planning to either do my masters degree or find a job. I have been battling with anxiety for a long time and have intrusive constantly. My latest is about the time I had an argument with two people in my class (separately). I can't help but feel anxious about the possibility of them being in the same work environmet and having a resentment against me, or the stupid idea that by the time I finish my masters and apply for a job they'll be in a superior position than me and reject me or cause some sort of harm to me somehow.

I am aware how stupid this sounds but it unfortunately the mere fact that the posibility is not 0% is making me anxious. I think I highly exaggerate the saying ""it's a small world"" to the extreme. At this point my mind is almost convinced that they will remember the argument and somehow be in a position to affect my life negatively. I don't know how to battle with such intrusive thoughts and feel incredibly useless as if I sabotaged myself by arguing with them and made a huge mistake(btw the argument wasn't even that big or anything). I know that just because we studied together doesn't mean we'll work together necessarily or that they'll be the ones judging me somehow, but I can't help but think I ruined sth.

I was going to apply to work at a bookstore but they told me that I would get to stressed and I need to focus on school. They don't do the whole pocket-money or allowance thing. I don't want to be assumed as a spoiled teen. I don't have a phone either. I don't fight with my parents a lot, I don't yell or swear at them- I respect them. I don't nag them for a lot of things and I try not too. 

We aren't poor but we aren't rich, we are more in the middle. My mum is a teacher &amp; tutor, my dad works for a pharmaceutical. My dad worked from home when Covid got bad here, my mum continued tutoring two students over zoom. My mum doesn't have a lot of tutoring students. I have a family of 5, I am the youngest. 

This month is my birthday month. My dad already bought me pants and a shirt and spent $80 buying the family dinner. We don't eat out much (usually the most is pizza every month) but we did because it was my birthday. Where I live, the school year is over. I already purchased my books for the next school year and it came to about almost $300. My brother needed a new laptop so my parents got him one. In the past week I bought 2 novels to read online, they are about $40 in total my brother also bought some novels. My point is- my parents have spent a lot this month. They say it's fine but I hear them fight over bills and sending money overseas to family back home. (They migrated). On top of that, we are going out of state for 3 days next month for a holiday. and we're going to stay at a holiday house sort of thing.  I don't know how much it costs but it's probably a lot. 

This coming weekend is my friends birthday party. (Covid restrictions have eased quite a bit here so it's safe and everything, the state hasn't had any new cases for a while, I am not American). Which means I'll spend around $25-30 buying her a present. 

I came across this hoody for $28 and a $5 earrings online, shipping is free for my order which is a relief. I really want this hoody, it's on sale right now and I have my heart set on it. I don't buy clothes often and I don't ask for things too much because I don't like bothering my parents. I pretty much only ask for clothes when nothing fits anymore or my clothes get ripped.

417,"I’m her 19 year old son, only child, and throughout my life my mom has never been in a stable, healthy relationship. They’ve either all been abusive, (either one sided abuse or mutual. She’s proven to me she can be very toxic too) or absolutely loveless (She keeps running back to men that clearly are only using her for sex). I understand a major reason why she can’t be in a stable relationship is because of the trauma she’s endured in her past relationships. My biological dad fucked her up mentally, her ex fiancé is now in prison for 19 months for domestic assault+strangulation (he was an alcoholic too..they were together for 8 years. He abused me pretty badly, and he hasn’t acknowledged it to this day.), the next dude she was with couldn’t hold a job, stole $700 worth of instruments from me and held them for ransom (and decided to back together with him like a week later, for whatever fuckin reason), and physically abused her. Lastly, this dude she’s been messing with for nearly two years now keeps stringing her along knowing that she is emotionally incapable of moving on, so he’s able to use her sexually. 

My family and I have reached a consensus that she needs to see a therapist. The reason why she keeps attracting toxic men is because she’s easy to prey on. These men recognize that she is vulnerable and desperate to cling onto a genuine person, so they manipulate her. And in the meantime, all the genuine dudes out there that actually have their life together are running to the hills because she can’t handle herself. 

A part of me feels incredibly sympathetic. However, when she spends over a thousand dollars on a dating coach she found on Facebook, it really bothers me. Her issues go far beyond what a dating coach can solve. I’m getting to the point I need to be firm with her, and tell her she needs to re evaluate her life and start back at square one. At her trajectory, she will be single for the rest of her life. I’m sorry if this sounded way too harsh, but my family and I are really getting fed up with it. Especially me, because I’ve also endured a decent amount of that trauma growing up, having lived in the same house as her.",08Dec2020,1

423,"My sister ( F, 40s) is getting married to her fiancé (M, 30s) of a few months.  

I (F, 30s) called my sister a couple of weeks ago to see how she was doing.  When she answered, she questioned me about a post I had seen from her fiancé.  It was regarding a woman accusing my sister of ‘marrying him to collect money when he dies of cancer.’  Her friend had seen another, unrelated post and it turned out that he had changed customs on the status to block her circle but had missed me.

I rushed to her defense regarding the thread.  I don’t want anyone to talk stuff about my sister.  Her fiancé told me not to say anything to her.  I agreed as we never met each and also, I don’t want to break my word and I did not want to be seen as a busy-body.  It was a minor red flag to me but I trusted him to keep my sister happy.  She has been married and engaged before and does have kids.  Although she was quite accusatory and curt at first, she said thank you for having her back and acknowledged and was apologetic for her fiancé to put me into a difficult situation.  She also said they rectified and he deleted the post.  

During the conversation, I found out that I was not invited to their wedding.  I am hurt and I expressed that over the phone.  Some other family members are invited but I am not.  Our mom abused us but she still wants our mom there so she chose our mom over me.  She said she doesn’t want drama at her wedding.  My mother has caused a lot of pain to me.  I am saying this lightly.

I do understand that couples can invite anyone they want at their wedding.  Although I feel slighted and am ready to go no contact with my sister, I do want to inform her that her fiancé is lying.  He did not delete that status, which is a big red flag to me.    

AITA for not alerting her to his lies.  I was ready to leave the bridge she burned but at the same time, I know the truth.  I hate drama but I don’t know if my intentions would seem wrong.

You can be mad, just please don’t slam things.” He starts saying “Oh so I’m not allowed to be mad? I cant say or do what I want?” He proceeded to turn off the lights in our bedroom, roll over, and fell fast asleep. Now I am laying here trying to calm down, sick as a dog and freaking out.

427,"So, I’m an 18 year old who just started university and is also working part time (4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week) in a warehouse job.  

I’ve wanted to move out for months now because my room at my parent‘s place is pretty small, and my parents can get really annoying sometimes. We don’t argue on a daily basis or anything, but it’s still pretty bad.

So a couple weeks ago I’ve finally gotten an opportunity to rent a student dorm at a cheap price (only a quarter of my salary). Kitchen, toilet and shower are shared, but I have one room for myself which is twice as big as my current room (still really small). I only had two days to decide wether to take it, so I took it.

The main problem now is, the commute from my dorm to work is over an hour long (instead of the 15 minutes right now), which is really bad when you’re exhausted after work, in addition to having to cook myself. Also I’m worried that I won’t be left alone in the student dorm either, I mean I‘ll be pretty much living with other students. 

For this reason I still haven’t moved into my dorm even though it has been over a week. I study in the morning, and go to work in the evening. When I finally have weekend and some free time I don’t feel like spending it by moving into my dorm, so I just ended up staying home. Everything is kind of overwhelming right now. So I’ve been thinking of just cancelling the rent contract (it would waste 2 months of rent but whatever, I can afford it) and staying with my parents until I find something better.

So, last Friday was the day.  It was a conference video call thing and 2 other people showed up.  I talked to them about if they were going to say anything and I told them I was going to ask, ultimately, for his parole to be granted.  One said she was going to do the same, the other said she wasn't going to speak.

I asked if She was okay with Him getting parole and she said she'd not really thought about it and didn't care.  Since the other person didn't show, i decided to go ahead with it.  

So, they asked if the victims had anything to say and the first woman spoke up and said that she was going to keep it short.  That she forgave him and thinks he's done his time.

It was my turn to speak and I told the panel that I was going back and forth about it but that I think that over 10 years is plenty of time spent thinking of his actions.  I asked to address Him and was granted it.  I told him about what I had said in my previous post about having agoraphobia, etc and that He could have 100% derailed my life that night.  If not by shooting me but by making me more terrified to go out than ever.  However, I had made it and was making the best of my 2nd chance on life and that I hoped he did the same.

He was granted parole.  I decided to leave out any additional stuff as that was probably a bit much.  He cried when they told Him and I feel like the gravity of his actions really finally came to Him.  He thanked them, thanked Us.  Said He had a job lined up for when He got out and was hoping to get right with his ex and his kid.",08Dec2020,1

434,"So a colleague of mine messaged me yesterday to block someone as that person was harassing her, that guy is a known pervert, she knew and still talked to him, so it wasn't surprising. 

A little back story, I used to help her a lot before, but she was always rude to me, she din't wanted to be my friend, she din't even wanted to have a proper conversation with me, I was always nice and kind to her, it was her birthday and she invited everyone except for me, I asked on here and everyone told me to concentrate on myself and not to help her anymore.

So well I avoided her after that day, it's been more than a month and it made me feel better cause now I don't have any expectations from her, before the only expectation I had from her to be at least be nice to me and have a general conversation with me as I always helped her. 

I did feel hurt yesterday that she actually used to talk to that pervert but used to ignore me. 

I just get confused that where do I even go wrong? even back in Highschool the people who I had thought were my friends just used me for my money and when I had an injury and was in bed for 6 months, none of them came to visit me, I had only one person who was my best friend came to meet me and sadly he died 12 years ago. 

Even the Nerds were given more importance to me as they were at least good in something and I was good at nothing. 

Yeah maybe I am not a cool person, I don't drink alcohol, I don't do drugs, but I am not a bad person that people don't even want to talk to me. 

I am just so confused. I just feel like a loser.",08Dec2020,1
435,"I (M19) met this girl at a social, super my type. We were both really drunk and made (what I think) this cute bet where we held each others hands and first one to let go had to by the other a drink. 
So during this time we chatted, we vibed and got along really well; couldn't stop laughing. 
We walk to the next bar and there we make-out and end up going back to my place. And would you have guessed it, we ended up shagging. Best shag of my life.
So she goes that morning, yaknow fair enough, and I message her later on if she wants to meet again. Long story short she says yes but isn't looking for anything serious at the time, so we organise to get drinks anyway. Plan falls through. 
Anyway one night, few weeks later I think, I'm out with my mates blasted out of my mind, and I get a message saying if we wanna hook up. I'm like ""Sure but I'm way to drunk so dont think I'll be able to make it."" So nothing happened.
I've not been able to stop thinking about this girl for about 9 months and I really want to message her, but what do I message? By this point Is it creepy? Should I just move on and wait for fate to intervene? By messaging her am I ruining future chances? When should I message (I'm on a 5 week break from uni atm so)? What do you guys think",08Dec2020,1

438,"Hello. I'm a 16 year old girl, I have no siblings, I live with my parents and I don't have any other family members like grandparents and all. My country is in the second wave of Covid-19, which brought us all into a far worse situation. Our previous lockdown had lasted for 3 months and the cases were not that many, however, things have changed and as of now, we have 2.5k cases per day and approximately 100 deaths. Luckily, I am allowed to go outside for one hour per day (for physical exercise, something I was not entitled to earlier), however, I'm not allowed to see anyone. My parents NEVER leave the house, my dad is a hypochondriac so all of this situation is getting to him really hard and results in him constantly shouting at my mom and I. All that happens in my home is a bunch of whining, arguing, unhealthy interactions and an obscene amount of diet culture. I want to escape from that. Voice calling on Discord does not seem to help me. I have tried my hardest to deal with the entire situation but I can't take it for longer. I genuinely can't. I have focused on my goal of getting fit, I've formed a band with a friend of mine and we're somewhat planning it so that keeps me somewhat occupied, I'm trying to get back into vocal practice, I'm trying to get myself motivated to study more, however, the lack of social interaction is something that has taken a huge toll on me. I'm trying not to interact with my parents too much for a multitude of reasons. In my view, family relationships are not supposed to be too warm and close. Family members are supposed to love and trust eachother without intervening in eachother's lives. My parents have always been slightly intrusive, something that could possibly be the outcome of the fact that my mom has been retired for 9 years and my dad has been (almost fully) unemployed for 8 years. To cut a long story short, I have two stay-at-home parents, I never have time for myself and I'm pretty sure their ""unconditional"" love is conditional and it comes under the condition I correspond to their social expectations in the future. Further developing our relationship will not benefit me in any way, since I do not expect to be treated respectfully in case I come out to them in the future. I want to cut down our contact, I feel like I've come too close to them and eventually, they're going to get used to me being their beloved child to a slightly hyperbolic extent. I want to become more distant with them and I do know how, even though proceeding to do so will possibly drive me insane even more since there is no other human being in physical form around. This text probably ended up becoming too long. I don't know how to handle this situation other than isolating in my room and trying to make it aesthetically pleasing and more viable by keeping more useful objects in it so I don't have to move around the house much. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know, I'm willing to try anything at this point.",08Dec2020,1

So I have been with my girlfriend for 4 months officially  now and things are going well. However about a month into dating she tells me she has Major Depressive Disorder. It hasn’t made me any less attracted emotionally to her but has made certain situations stressful and confusing to handle. Disclaimer, I have never dated with nor dealt too much with people suffering from depression and I want to get better at understanding certain parts of her behaviour that will help in the long run. 

Some examples of things that can cause tension in our relationship are things like her casual dismissiveness to tense or confrontational situations, the amount of long overtime she willingly puts into her work (she also has taken on a weekend job cause ‘’it’s more money’’). Her admitting to being not being very thoughtful/selfish and her general bluntness/distance she shows me after work for quite a few hours after. 

Please keep in mind that I do enjoy her company and we have had a lot more good times together and she is very affectionate and loving towards me and has been very thoughtful with our relationship. I just wish to understand the more difficult times so I may better support/understand her and lessen the feelings of inadequacy it can leave me feeling. I also understand that the time spent dating is short and I’m certain we will both continue to develop our communication and understanding of one another.",08Dec2020,1
440,"So in aus if you are under 18 and you share nudes, you can't be charged for creating, distributing or possessing these images? But the person you send them to could be charged for posession? Is this true? What's stop someone who's 14  from just sending intimate images to someone they hate, and report them? They won't get charged?


Reason why I'm asking:::::
I'm asking because I'm freaking the fuk out. My ex sent nudes when I was 19 and she was 18. Anyways we had a breakup, it's been like 2 years now, I'm 21 she's 20 and we had another argument today and she said she's gonna get revenge on me by telling the police that she sent me older nudes of when she was younger. On our Snapchat convo, the images are there as she saved them and I blocked and deleted but they are still there and I can't do anything about it.. so please someone help me out here. All the images saved on the chat are timestamped to show that we were both overage, but that doesn't help if she told them that she was underage when she actually took the photo. IF she goes to the police and tells them that for example she was ""15"" when she sent them, then that would mean she doesn't get charged for creating or distributing, and I'll get charged for Possessing? Is this true? She has nothing to loose by reporting me??

As U can see in freaking the fuk out, can't eat can't sleep coz im so fkn scared that I'm gonna be labelled as a sex offender... I posted this on some legal thread and they said it's true and I'm basically screwed. Are they trolling or being serious? Ur telling me that if a 20yr old is  gonna go to the cops and show them our convo that clearly show she sent them when she was 18, but she'll claim that they are ""old nudes"" would be enough to charge for possessing these images?? Even tho she's fking lying and I would've had no idea if they were old? Even tho they're not as she literally had a tattoo is some of them and she looks like she's 20??

442,"I (21NB) have lived with my boyfriend (23M) for about 2.5 years out of the 3 that we have been together. i have never regretted living with him! i love him as a partner and roommate and i only have one discrepancy. 

he snores. so. loud. 

he works mornings and i work evenings. i am also naturally a night owl while he is more of a morning person, so naturally he goes to sleep a few hours before i do every night. this means that i have to tolerate his loud snoring every single night while i am trying to relax and have some quiet time to myself. and it makes it hard for me to fall asleep. 

i’ve been told that giving him a simple nudge and asking him to roll over will do the trick, and it did for a little while. but now it is multiple times a night that i will ask him to roll over, and often times that doesn’t even stop the snoring. 

we live in a one bedroom apartment and there is nowhere else for me to sleep. we’re not in the financial position to send him to a doctor to get some sort of medical solution. i intend to have separate bedrooms when we buy a house one day, but that is a solution that has to wait and i seriously can’t take this anymore. 

i love him. i intend to marry him and be together forever and of course i won’t let a problem like this stop that. but i would really, really like to not have him snoring in my ear every night. it’s making me sort of insane. 

if anyone has experience with this and has found a viable solution, it would be so greatly appreciated you have no idea. 

TL;DR my boyfriend snores like a chainsaw and it keeps me up at night. i need some sort of temporary fix in order to salvage my sanity.",08Dec2020,1
443,"I’m 20(f) and until September I was working in a small private supermarket and a bar. Originally I had plans to move to a different (neighbored) country in Oktober to study at a private University but that didn’t work out, mainly because of covid. I quit both of my jobs before finding out it wouldn’t happen and afterwards I wasn’t sure what to do anymore. My mom was excited about me moving out because she really wanted my room for herself, but now that I had no income and couldn’t find a job that doesn’t possibly expose me to covid, that would have to wait a bit longer. In July I got together with my current boyfriend, who I’ve known for four years and he’s the best thing that has happened in my life so far. I started spending 2-3 nights a week at his place, which was fine as long as I was not working. I couldn’t visit him at all while I work because his parents are old and have pre existing conditions, so he obviously wants to minimize the chances of them getting covid and I would be exposed to several people if I worked in a supermarket (which really is one of the only jobs available to me right now in my country). Technically I’d be fine with working and staying at home. I wouldn’t be happy about it but times are tough and it has to be done for now. But my mom insisted that I should take a break from working and spend more time at my boyfriends place, which I was fine with at first. She told me to stay there during the entire lockdown and only come over for a few minutes if I needed clothes, medicine or anything else that was important. The first time I went back home to pick up some stuff, I found out she had already completely taken over my room, packed all of my stuff into moving boxes and even moved her entire work desk into my room. My dad and little brother said she spends all of her time in there and almost never comes out. When I did spend one night at “home”, because I wanted to go on a hike with my dad and brother the next day and get up early with them, she made me sleep in the living room on the couch. She didn’t even ask or talk to me or anyone, if it would be ok for me, my boyfriend and his parents that stayed with them permanently. Fortunately they have all been extremely nice and welcoming and they say I always have a place to stay with them but I hate not having a fixed living space. I’m a very creative person and I work on all sorts of creative projects that I can barely work on now. I can’t get a job because I couldn’t stay here then and even though my mom says I’m always welcome at home, having my room taken away so sneakily and making me sleep on the hard couch doesn’t make me feel welcome. 
My birthday is coming up in 2 days and the lockdown is over at this point. I was going to obviously spend it with my boyfriend, who’s birthday is actually a day before mine. We were planning to stop by my parents place a day after my birthday but now she insists that I spend the day before with them as well. She always acts nice towards me now, but I feel like that’s because even she knows that what she did was a dick move. She won’t give up my room for anything. I was offered to sleep at my parents place on my birthday so we can celebrate the next day but even then she won’t give my room for just one night. I still have all of my instruments and other big things in there I miss using so much every day. I’ve been playing the piano since I was 5 and was always one of the best in my school. I love playing it so much and I even write my own music but I can’t do anything now. I’m stuck at my boyfriends place, who I really do love and I love spending so much time with him, but I can’t do anything aside from some simple pixel art on my laptop and some simple drawing on some used notepaper. I can’t practice my instruments, I can’t compose any music and worst of all I can’t even get a job.
I did talk to my dad about all of this and he says that if I studied something he’d be happy to pay a small Appartement for me, so I’m going to start studying Mathematics in March. I wasn’t a fan of studying in my city because there was nothing I was interested in. The first 2 times I stepped into the university building I had a panic attack both times. I still don’t know why that happened, I’m guessing it probably reminded me too much of school but I’m not sure. But I was willing to try again if that meant I could get my own place and even a job. But that’s still 3 months away and I just feel like I’m a total burden here and I don’t know what to do. 
On the one hand I’m very glad I can stay here because it’s always very toxic at home, but I’ve lost so much as well and I don’t know how to let my mom know that what she did was a dick move without her hitting me with a bunch of excuses about me being ungrateful or some shit.",08Dec2020,1

So yesterday my SO and I were talking about things and he even showed me couple goals photos saying how much he wants to create memories with me and that he wants us to have baby in the future. He even told me : I got you. No matter our misunderstandings. You are the most important for me dont forget. So it was all fine till he dropped an idea for us making money. He has charity organisation and well told me to look for emails of people and give them to him so he can make the people donate willingly and ask if they can donate some money to him too since he is broke. I didn't like the idea. It was like doing something bad and I felt weird so I was hesitant. And I asked him why he involved me in that and why he doesnt do it himself and he started saying things like "" ""Why dont you do it yourself.""

This is a sign that I am dealing with a stranger in my life""

I am not stranger to him. I actually have helped him in the past and even recently...so I am hurt. He also said: I have seen it all now with just one hurting word. I cant forgive this word easily.

At some point he said he wants me to do that because he doesnt have time but I still think it's silliness at very least. Anyway he also said he wanted me to be canvasser t and he would pay me lots of money for it. And supposedly this was surprise job he gave to me and I upsetted him turning it down. His last messages were very angry.

I know for sure he has charity organisation and all that but the whole thing was stupid to me at very least. Also it fully blowed and he ended up blocking me again (he did in the past too but unblocked) it's like 20 hours passed and now I am super confused

The party was very fun, got very drunk and a bit high.

At the end of the night I was puking a lot.

My ex girlfriend insisted she take me up to my room, she put me into bed and again insisted she slept in my room.

My friends who were there said that she shouldn’t sleep in my room and it would be taking advantage of me being out of it, she didn’t listen.

One of my other friends said he would stay in my room to look after me, she refused.

Everyone invited states that she was moderately sober the entire night as she took care of multiple puking people.

That night I think I was taken advantage of, both generally and sexually.

I woke up in my boxers, being fully dressed when I went to bed, I believe we had sex and I could not have consented being drunk, high and slurring my speech at the time.

I might have initiated it but I have no recollection, all of my friends said she should not stay in my room and sleep downstairs.

I remember saying to her ‘please sleep downstairs’ and she didn’t.

Previously I told her she cannot stay over multiple times before the party, I then found out in the morning that she brought her work clothes assuming she’d stay over for that morning.

I recall waking up in the middle of the night to her in my bed and I told her to sleep downstairs or on the floor, after asking multiple times she slept on the floor.

It is multiple people against the word of her, a person whom I trusted, being with her for a year. 

In the early morning, still half asleep and drunk, I said she can get back into the bed because I felt bad, we also had sex after that I believe.

I have hickeys all over my body, certain that we did have sex.

After confronting her, she said that everything that was said was a lie, she said that the witnesses and people who have the same argument were a lie.

461,"Hi! Today I had a heated duscussion with my therapist who insisted I was being paranoid and wrong confronting my neighbor about their behavior. I was very hurt by that but I do want to know if I'm truly being paranoid about my neighbors' behavior - so I desperately need some outside perspective and advice how to proceed.

Backstory: The house in question belonged to my grandparents who died many years ago. I lived there for a long time but moved to a bigger city for studying a couple years ago and have spend less and less time in my home, mainly due to my mother who is frankly a terrible person. She's drunk, unemployed and has a myriad of psychological issues. She used to bring very terrible, loud people to the house and was generally very disruptive and despised in the (otherwise calm and nice) neighborhood. Recently however, she's been sleeping at her drinking bodys' places and has barely been to the house, which has mostly been empty and abandoned.

Now onto the inciting incident: A couple months ago, my mother told me that (several different) neighbors had been asking to buy the house from her, which she rejected (which I didn't believe because usually everything she says is a lie to stirr up drama). Then, I actually heard a neighbor making her an offer while I was on the phone with her (he was polite, she sreamed and cursed in response - I was mortified). And lastly, when I checked my facebook for the first time in forever and found messages from two different people expressing interest in buying the house.

That freaked me out a little bit. I haven't been in my hometown for almost a year and they somehow tracked me down online (so they had to have some information about me since there are several people with my name). Both mentioned having been advised to contact me by my neighbors. All of these past incidents lead me to the following conclusion: the neighborhood (or at least part of it) are making a joint effort to get my family to sell and leave. What are the chances? The house has been largely empty for a couple years and now all of a sudden within weeks 5+ people insist on buying the it?! I believe they tracked me down because my grandparents and mother told people that I was actually supposed to inherit the house (all of them like(d) to brag and overshare inappropriately).

So here's what I did: I politely responded, telling them I couldn't sell the house as I was not the owner (I never officially inherited anything). I asked how they found me and espressed that I found their sudden interest a bit surprising. And (here is where my therapist told me I made a mistake): I told them I found it odd that my neighbors all of a sudden had made it their priority to get us to sell the house, but I still thanked them for their afford and once again apologized for not being able to help. My therapist told me I was being paranoid and wrong to insinuate that there was some kind of neighborhood conspiracy. But the thing is - based on the aforementioned incidents I find it logical to conclude that there is at least some kind of coordinated effort to get us out of the neighborhood. I simply don't think I'm being paranoid, in my opinion I am drawing a logical conclusion and I feld very invalidated by my therapist. Was I being irrational?

And secondly, I am wandering if I made a mistake in confronting the potential buyer about the neighbor's intention. My therapist thinks I essentially showed them I was paranoid. Regardless whether there actually is a conspiracy, I put my cards on the table and I'm inclined to agree that might not have been the smartest thing. My intention was to call them out and let them now that I was aware about their intentions (which does sound kind of paranoid :/). They're most defenitely not wrong in preferring a ""better neighbor"" but it is very hurtful (especially since the house is now mostly just empty now, so no more drama with my mother &amp; friends). What should I have done? How should I proceed? I will be spending some time in the house in December and January when my apartment is being renovated - do you have some advice on how I should respond to the neighbors?",08Dec2020,1

466,"My dh was diagnosed with cancer last year. He’s been doing well since his diagnosis (got all his treatments etc). As his partner I’ve been by his side as I should and have taken on more responsibility as I am now the main source of income. I work two jobs, care for him as well as our child. However, the past 4 months or so have been for lack of better words, “rough”. DH got out of the hospital and had almost daily doctor appointments (which is fine) &amp; now having once a week visits. Lately, I’ve noticed that nothing matters but him. He makes it known that it doesn’t matter what I’m going through, what our child is going through or even any other family matter. His response is pretty much the same...you’re not the one fighting cancer, you’re just one upping me, *sarcastic* awwww etc. Yes, I understand what he is going through is important and that it is a life battling disease. But it just seems unfair that he makes me feel like I can’t tell him anything. It’s to the point that if I were to have gotten shot or broke my leg, I wouldn’t tell him because I know his response wouldn’t show any care, but rather “you’re such a one upper”. 
Dh keeps talking about wanting to buy this that and the other, travel and do things he’s wanted to do (bucket list type of stuff). I support that, I really do. But knowing that I’m the one to pay for it all breaks me down as I just can’t afford it. Heck...it took me two weeks to be able to buy eggs. 
I’d like to think I’m a strong and caring person. I’ve ruined my credit for this man, gone without eating for this man, been a wife and a caregiver for him. All is fine, I don’t mind all of that, but is it wrong for me to feel like I should be able to say that hey I’m in pain or this is what’s wrong with me? I just don’t know if I should have this feeling of guilt whenever I have a migraine or for saying that I want something. I guess my question really is...how do I numb myself?

467," 

The guy disrespected my property during this one time when I was in a classroom. I was looking at a video, called ""How to get a girlfriend"", and minimized it to look at colleges when he came up to me. In front of me, he put his fingers on my laptop, pulled up the video, laughed at me, and then told some classmates.

He has also done other mean things to me too, such as taking this embarrassing picture of me without my consent and distributing it with people, and laughing and saying that the whole school had it. He also said mean things to me here and there as well, calling me things like ""bank robber"" and ""school shooter"".

For some odd reason I never interpreted it or even registered any of these as mean things. I don't know why, but I never even picked up on the fact that this kid did something really mean to me. As a matter of fact, I was never even bothered by any of his words/actions. Now I'm looking back and wondering why I didn't react to that, but for back in the moment I never even realized that someone was being mean to me, both in the moment it was happening and any time before quarantine really.

But now, as I'm looking back, and I have more time to think about what happened, I'm starting to realize that what happened was not right and very mean. The dude is a jerk, no doubt about that.

I was never really afraid or intimidated by this person either.

But I'm wondering, just out of curiosity, why is it that I never picked up on his meanness in the moment it happened, but rather a year later?

Why can't I just pick up on this stuff right away? Why the delay?

And how normal is it for people to not pick up on stuff like this in the moment it happened?",08Dec2020,1

My mom often expressed her frustration about how much she has to clean, and I'm afraid she's becoming abusive to her. One time on a video call, I saw my mom threw a plastic bottle at my dog to stop her from barking. She would shout at my dog for being naughty, even her friend commented on how mean she was with my dog. 

I explained to my mom that the reason why started peeing in different places could be that she is stressed out. No one is playing with her or giving her attention, and the only person around the house is always angry at her. So I asked if my mom could spend around 10 minutes a day to play with my dog so she would be less tense.

As soon as I suggested that, my mom immediately closed the call and started guilt-tripping me by text. Basically she said that I worry about my dog more than I worry about her, that she is also stressed out with work, and that I am selfish to ask her to pay a little more attention to my dog.

I don't know what to do. I miss my dog and worry about her sometimes. Is my mom right? Should I give my dog away? I don't trust other people enough to give her away. Where I'm from, most people treat pets really badly, sometimes downright abusive.

475,"When i was 13 i had a friend (14)... everytime she was offended or was defenfing her humanitarian rights as a feminist she would pull out her pen and say ""im gonna stab you""... not in anger but as a threat to defend her point.

I admired her and wanted to be just like her cause i thought it made me cool. So i started doing her big phrase too. Whenever my brother would annoy me i would say ""im gonna stab you"" and pull a pen out. Using it as ""self-defence"" when we bickered.

In school i was sitting next to her and a friend of mine said something that triggered her feminism that now also became my feminism. She pulled out her pen and said ""im gonna stab you"" and i did the same.

Having ADHD and being super impulsive in a funny and dramatic scenerio did not help. He said ""do it"" to which i stabbed him, not too hard as it seemed like a joke to us. But i ended up doing it accidentally hard and wounded him, i felt bad and apologised.

She was also very violent always talking about violence ect. So i adapted to her mannerisms. Once a boy bullied me as a joke and i was actually pissed off. So impulsively i threw a pin (the ones they use on styrofoam boards) into the hood of his hoodie.

I soon realised that he could get hurt and didnt want that so i told him and removed it. I know, crazy. Being around such a violent person made me one, always talking about the things she did. I was a creepy kid then.

She even turned me against my family, they tend to make jokingly mean comments to eachother which was funny. But eventhough it was mean and i would get mad it was all fun and games with no ill intent. But she told me that this was abuse and i became very difficult and hateful towards my family, oversensitive.

I was so afraid that i was a psycopath for this but it was all her influence. Im not blaming her for me becoming an oppositional and creepy teen as it was all my desicions but she played apart. I noticed that i improved on all of these things after she moved to a different school.

Firstly, it could be because I spent around 4 months talking to this girl while on mandatory lockdown with plans on seeing each other but in the end I slowly started to realize she wasn't (or maybe never was) into me. This shattered me. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't have reacted this way, and under normal circumstances I would have quickly vetted her and conclude if she was into me or not, but via text there's not much I could have done. Contact ended 3 months ago, she found someone else, but now currently single.

The loneliness and boredom of being in lockdown didn't help in this case, either. Sometimes when I find myself bored it's like this crippling darkness starts taking over me and I start to freak out and become depressed.

So. I'm thinking maybe she isn't the cause of this depression, but boredom? I've read about how dangerous boredom is and how it can lead to one damaging oneself just to feel something.

Could it be both? This mild heartbreak + boredom? 

Has anyone else developed this kind of depression while on lockdown?

# Drinking blocks a chemical that promotes attention

.Norepinephrine release to cells is diminished, causing a cascade of effects.

N a new paper, researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio), report brain chemistry that may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

The work is funded by generous support from the Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and Helen C. Kleberg Foundation and by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute of Mental Health. Findings were published on Dec. 2 in *Nature Communications*.

""When we want to focus on something, or when we stand up from a chair and become active, a brain stem nucleus releases a chemical called norepinephrine. Acute alcohol exposure inhibits this signal in the brain,"" said senior author [**Martin Paukert, MD**](https://lsom.uthscsa.edu/physiology/team-member/martin-paukert-m-d/), assistant professor of cellular and integrative physiology at UT Health San Antonio...

Over the summer I worked a retail job at a big-box store to help contribute towards costs for schooling. To be transparent, my parents are paying for nearly all of my schooling (thank them so much!) but my major requires lots of materials to construct models, make drawings, etc which costs money and my parents expect me to work to have the funds for this (this is a very fair expectation, no problems here).

My parents are expecting that I resume my retail job over winter break because our school extended the time between semesters. Though I worked this job over the summer, I'm feeling a lot more uncomfortable with this idea for this winter. COVID case numbers are obviously much worse. There have been two cases of positive tested employees at the store I've worked at, and in my opinion the highest risk area of the store is the break room, where employees take lunch and breaks without their masks on. Additionally, I work the cashier position, and while the company has taken some precautions with glass partitioning and spacing markers, customers often forego these precautions when convenient for them which sometimes feels unsafe.

I'm writing this just to get some outside thoughts on this situation. I don't want my parents to think I'm trying to weasel my way out of paying for anything, it just doesn't feel like the right time to be working towards that money. It should also be said that I plan to use winter break to improve skills relevant to my major so that I can have a more successful spring semester, I certainly am not going to be doing nothing.

We've already had multiple discussions about the topic, and my parents have said that their position hasn't changed. I hope this all makes sense, I'm just trying to get some clarity on this situation. Thanks for any help.",08Dec2020,1

499,"I (f21) matched this guy on tinder like a year ago and we have each other on social media, we’ve never met irl and when we got talking I basically helped him discover his sexuality as bisexual as he had been bullied before and he try to talk to a guy friend and they were disgusted whereas I managed to just talk to him about it all and how common and fine it is so now he gets with guys and is more open and is really happy and comfortable.

This is my dilemma; so I randomly posted on my story about a new vibrator I liked but it was expensive (I’m super open about that stuff) and he messaged me saying let me buy it for you which I didn’t expect and at first I was like no no it’s fine you don’t have to it’s like £89 but long story short he insisted and said I can just give you the money you don’t have to give me your address I don’t wanna see it or see you use it just tell me if it makes you happy. So I got the vibrator and this was about a month ago and I thank him all the time cause it’s great and then yesterday when I thanked him again he said I’m here to treat you what do you want.

I said no you don’t have to do that I feel bad and he basically said no I’d like to treat you regularly. I said why you aren’t a sugar daddy and I don’t really do anything for you aside from chat here and there. After talking more he just said he is grateful for helping him with his sexuality and he just wants my friendship and happiness and that he has a gambling addiction so if he spends money on me it’s actually going to use and making someone happy and not just wasted. I did say you do need help for that and he is getting it and has been reducing his spending on gambling considerably but shall I be accepting his gift every couple of weeks because he wants to make me happy and not waste it on gambling or am I a bad person?",08Dec2020,1
500,"On mobile, so bear with me.


I (18M) live with my father and step-mother, along with my three sisters. And to say we are in bad terms is an understatement. It has reached a point where my father and step-mother have told me to leave the house by the 1st of January, or pay them approx. $550 in rent.


 The pressure they put on us is immense, and it's a miracle that I and my siblings have been able to stay sane through it. My eldest sister was diagnosed with severe depression, and was going through therapy, but my parents cancelled it and made fun of her for being so 'mentally weak.' 

There is plenty more where this comes from, but I hope this gives the general idea of what I'm dealing with.....

This is a problem because I have no way to have an income, and my current qualification is just a high-school diploma.

Part-time jobs do not exist here, as they are illegal by the law, and civilians are only allowed to stay here if they're sponsored by somebody. And my sponsor is my father, through the company he works at.

And it is through the sponsor you're allowed to live here, and if your sponsor cancels your residency permit, you'll have to be deported and sent back to your homeland.

I've never been to my home country, and I most certainly do not want to. There is almost no career-making opportunities over there, and I have nobody over there to help me either. I'll be next to blind in that place.

I've tried applying in so many places, but all of them require at least a year of experience, but I certainly do not have that.

I am at a loss about what I should do, or where I should go, and I've asked the same once before here, but to no avail....


So please, if there is something I can do to get out of this mess, then let me know. I'll be immensely grateful.

I'm sorry if this all has been a garble of words, and I'd have written it better, but I'm just severely troubled at the moment.

Thank you all in advance.

509,"19/F here.

So this morning i was crying in my bed at 7:17 in the and I was supposed to leave at 6:55. I yelled at my mother after she told me to calm down and that I was being hysterical. 

So let me explain. I am in this school where I get payed to work and make a product. I started at a music class because I loved music, making it and learning it. Now I have been thinking about selling my instruments.  2 days a week I was a teacher in a school 4-9 grade and the other days I was not being helped to learn what I wanted, there was no time for it. Most the day I sat in a room and did nothing. I didn't have the freedom to relax , because when there I felt like I was supposed to do something but I didn't feel like I got the help I needed. About 3 months ago I started feeling anxious and sick every morning. I actually worried I was pregnant, i took some tests at home and i'm not pregnant. But every morning I feel sick, nausea , headache, stomach pain, witch made me go to the doctor. I had an absolute nightmare explaining how I was feeling and my doctor kept saying things like there are many girls your age who don't know what they want. I felt so misunderstanding and I broke down crying.  HARD. I kept crying even after I got home, I feel so vulnerable. I talked to my psychologist who I got after an event at a party (scroll down my post history if you want , I made a post about it a while back) she said I might be depressed and told me that we should try to get in contact with another psychologist who would better be fit to help me . We talked about moving me to another class. 

And now is now. Over the last week I have been turned down my the psychologist I have had called. So many of them have more than 6 weeks wait time. I started in a class called idea and shape. My first day yesterday.  I sat in a room for 8 hours making paper stars and when I asked (about 3-4hours in) if I could possibly get to do something else, I got a hard stern no. And that would have been fine. But I dont know why it isn't. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. The other day I slept for 14 hours out of nowhere and I am so tired. I feel sick and I dont understand what to do. I feel like I'm complaining about nothing,  but at the same time I know I'm not supposed to feel like this , I'm not supposed to be feeling like this. I feel crazy. I'm making stars for 8 hours a day at the low low cost of my sanity.  I just want to feel okay. But as soon as I feel okay for just a day I get put straight back and it starts straight up. I can't eat. I feel like time is slipping out between my fingers. The way my mother reacted made me feel like I am not allowed to feel this way, like I am suppose to be okay with all of this, but I just don't understand how I am supposed to be?. Am I just overreacting to a problem that isn't as big as I make it feel?.. I have even had strong thoughts hoping they would have found cancer sells in my blood work so I could just have an excuse for feeling this way. I dont wanna wake up in the morning. 

I dont feel like I should be be dealing with these sort of feelings and I dont feel like its fair to myself if I try and bottle them up.

             It’s been three months since we have moved in to our unit but we’ve been having problem left and right please give me an advice.

The first problem we had is that each time it rains our carport and storage area flood because our driveway is uneven. The middle part is a little deeper than the rest causing the water to stay there for days at a time. Our outdoor furniture and stuff in the storage have been slowly getting ruined because of the water, like our tables and chairs have been getting rusty. 

They sent maintenance about 4 times and each time they keep fixing the wrong thing. The first was the roof and second was the garden (they dug out our dirt saying it’s uneven and the water keeps coming because of it) but unfortunately we are still having the same issue. 

Now we noticed we have a mold growing inside our unit. Not little amount but a lot of them all over my dining wall and living room walls. 

I’ve contacted them about it but they won’t do anything so I requested to get move to a different unit. 

Now they are refusing to pay for our furniture to get move. 

I have a very sensitive skin and i’m very prone to infections. Lately i’ve been getting lots of skin rashes and check in with my doctor to find out that some of those rashes are fungi infection. 

My dog also licked some of mold of our wall and now she’s having diarrhea.

I, 23F, am married to my partner of 6 years. I love him dearly but I also suffer from intrusive thoughts about being a lesbian that severely hamper our relationship. I don’t know what to do. Are the thoughts something I should put stock into or are they just me overthinking. I will demonstrate below.

Women - I found porn at a young age and it was nearly always of erotic photos of women. I am still more aroused by erotic photos of women more than men but this does worry me that a nice set of abs isn’t a turn on. I don’t think about touching the woman and am usually the sexy woman in my fantasies but this does worry me that I find women easier to sexualize. I’ve danced on women and seen them change throughout my life but never felt anything more than friendship. I am not aroused by scantily clad women in real life, like at beaches or something 

Men - I’ve kissed men and felt absolutely nothing which terrifies me. Granted, I was not attracted to 80% of them and was young and just wanted to try kissing boys. I do fantasize about kissing men but it often isn’t as great as I expect. I try to spontaneously push my husband up against walls and kiss him and am disappointed by how lackluster it is. I don’t know if this is because it’s out of nowhere, because I have so much pressure to recreate a movie scene, or what. I do want a dynamic kiss and I often feel sad I don’t have one, but there is a lot of anxiety and fear in my head with each kiss. 

I also have issues with sex and a lack of enjoyment. This bothers me because, again, I want good sex. I think about sex with men frequently and often have pretty big crushes on guys that feel real in their emotion and heat I feel in my body when I’m close to them. I am just sad that sex with my husband isn’t great, although we are each other’s first partners. I’m also not aroused just by seeing him naked which scares me and convinced me I must not be attracted to him. These thoughts make me cry.

When we first started dating, I thought about him constantly and felt warm just when mentioning his name. We were constantly touching and I had to be around him because it felt so good. Touching was so new and amazing. I genuinely feel I was truly attracted to him. But as the years have gone by, my ocd has gotten more severe and I doubt myself more. 

Based on what I’ve said, what should I do? I do desire a good marriage and I love him. I want sex to be good, but I’m terrified I’m in denial. I’ve been so miserable with these thoughts and can no longer tell if they’re true or not. I just want some guidance. Am I kidding myself! Will we ever work? I just need some help, any at all.

I'm in a very difficult position here and I honestly don't know where to turn for help at this point. This will end up long and I hope you don't immediately dismiss it because of this. I need help

A quick overview - I'm in my mid 30s, I've spent the last three+ years suffering from gastroparesis. Literally starving, puking and ugly crying on a weekly basis. Its almost amazing how fast years flew by, while my only focus was food and water. I lost &gt;20% of my bodyweight from an already thin body. This has fucked me up mentally more than physically, I think. And this came just less than a year after surgery and rehab for heart disease. I haven't worked in four years. The end of 2019/beginning of 2020, my gastroparesis really started making big improvements. I still can't eat ""normal"", but I'm eating solid food, vegetables, etc. I've put 20+ pounds back on. Then my dad, who I lived with, died from a stroke out of nowhere. Right in front of me. I heard the fall. I'm beyond fucked up from this. To put it short, he was really my only friend and my best friend. The last fifteen years have been horrific.

Three months have flown by since his death. I have no idea what I've been doing, other than coming completely unraveled. I've reached out to the bereavement counselors, a separate psychiatrist office (seems uninterested, just take pills and go away), therapist (waiting.. waiting, still) and some organization that the psychiatrist referred me to, which they said could help with my situation. This organization basically told me that they can't help me because I'm too ""independent"". Independent - I'm in my 30s, lived with my father my whole life, who is now dead, have no job, no income of any sort (no disability, unemployment etc), no family or friends in this state and have to find employment and a place to live in the next month or so. I was already struggling mentally (decade+ of nothing-ness will do that to you), barely recovering from my body being ravaged for years from this fucking disease. Then the pandemic hit and then my dad died and now I am literally lost. Days are flying by. I dont know what I did today. Im lost in worry and re-living the night my dad died (he spent two weeks in the ICU, but basically died that night I found him). I make plans to watch a show or movie, and never do.

To detail some of the major issues here, preventing me from moving forward in life, it's probably easier for me to just make a list, in order to avoid huge text walls and re-living the past too much. I'll try to put them in chronological order somewhat.

-Convicted of a felony in 2004 (burglarizing an unlocked car. yes, I still hate myself for this). I served three years probation and haven't had a single issue since. Though it seems the second part doesn't matter much. Obviously this was a catalyst for hating myself.

-Paruresis (even spell-check doesnt know this one. thats how you know its a good one). The term ""shy bladder"" is how most doctors only even know it. Using the term ""paruresis"" gets confused looks. I had ""shy bladder"" maybe in high-school. When I'd go into a stall to pee, rather than the urinal. No big deal at all. But Paruresis is a full-on disability. It destroyed my entire life. I know its a psychological disability (anxiety, ocd based) but its nonetheless a disability which is very poorly understood or accommodated. If there were single person restrooms everywhere, like other handicapped accommodations, people like me could lead a ""normal"" life. I could actually ya know.. leave the goddamn state. Sorry, Im ranting now.

-Chronic Prostititis that lasted over a year. Pretty much hell from 22-23 years old. I don't even like to think of what it felt like. Like its going to come back and get me again. Basically the urge to urinate constantly, for over a year. Straining to get a few drops out, only to do it again 10 minutes later. Doctor was giving me pills that numbed everything and made my pee bright pink.

-Very little work over the 20s. Scattered ""cash"" jobs. Basic construction laborer, landscaping/mowing, tree work. Really liked the tree work (when I was healthy) and did that for probably three years total. Worked for a general contractor for about a year, around 29/30, and actually enjoyed it. Learned a bunch about all sorts of different construction.

-Diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease at 30 years old. I spent my life playing sports year-round. Working out on my own through my teens and 20s. Eating pretty damn healthy and just all-around very active, including active jobs. With the exception of a couple years in my mid 20s where I got fat, I thought I was living right. Well my genetics are just that bad, apparently. I was really into weight lifting and biking at the time (got really into it about two years prior) and started having tight chest/discomfort while working out. A couple trips to primary care Dr and they were certain it was just anxiety (on my chart, of course) and that I was fine. Turns out that the treadmill stress test did not give a false-positive for me, because the CT scan found the blockage clear as day. So I'm 30 years old, 5'11"" 180 pounds, with two stents, at the hospital doing cardiac rehab.. fielding questions every day about why I'm there. This completely destroyed any will to live that I had left. I honestly just gave up again... then for whatever stupid reason our brains want to survive and keep going. So I did...

-Gastropareis hit hard, about 6 months later. It started slow with reflux. I kept having that sore/tight throat feeling so my Drs were worried about heart issues, because thats a symptom of heart attack, apparently - tight throat. So when I brought it up at the rehab session, the nurse put me right into the hospital/ER downstairs. I spent the night and was fine. Went to ENT Dr, scoped my throat and it was all eroded from reflux. Sent to gastroenterologist and failed every test they gave me, within the next couple months. Endoscopy showed gastritis and hiatal hernia. SIBO test came back positive and gastric emptying study showed gastroparesis/delayed emptying. I slowly lost the first 10 pounds, 180 down to 170. Then I went from 170 down to 138(my lowest) over the next year I guess. I cant describe the feeling and don't even want to try. The next couple years were just trying to survive. As my psychiatrist once put it. ""You weren't living, you were busy surviving."". That's all I feel I've done since my early 20s, barely survive.

-Fall 2019/winter2020 - gastroparesis getting better slowly. Eating actual food. Cooking again (loved cooking and baking). Eating with my dad again. He used to feel so bad about eating in front of me, that he would go out to eat by himself a lot. Things are looking up.. finally. Eating bowl of oatmeal with peanut butter and banana, browsing reddit this summer late at night. Extremely loud bang above my head (my dads bedroom) at 2am. Run upstairs to find dad laying on the floor. Had a stroke and a bad fall. APN of neurosurgery kept using the word ""catastrophic"". Spent two weeks in ICU with dad. Never recovered. My best friend is gone. I'm all alone in our house with our cat. Our cat is very old (stray, so not sure) but vet says 15+. Hes losing sight, lost his hearing and is getting extremely thin. I don't know when to take him to the vet. He is me and dads best friend, but hes not looking or sounding well.

So the house needs to be sold. Im unemployed. I don't even know if I'm employable. My health is horrific. I spend at least a couple hours per day in the bathroom. My gastroparesis has gotten better, but I clearly have most symptoms of IBS now, and have for a year or more. But havent bothered going to the gastroenterologist yet. I just cant take anymore. I struggle immensely with emptying my bladder in public. I need to find a job and a place to live. I need to rent a ""room"". I don't even know where to start. I don't know how I will exist in ""normal life"". I've had several Doctors tell me to file disability for years. I never did though, because I lived with my dad and felt like I didnt deserve anything. I never have any money or buy anything. I just eat and survive each day, kinda.

How does someone like me get a real job? I mean people will want proof of income, background checks, references etc. And I don't blame them. I would gladly go live in the woods if I could. Im basically living a 24/7 panic attack at this point and don't know what to do. Any job Im ""qualified"" for, will basically put me in direct harms way with covid. And I'm high risk as hell. I sat down here to apply online for a local grocery chain.. I dont know what else to do. The pandemic is spiraling out of control, and I'm here with heart disease about to apply for a job at a grocery store... because I dont know what else to do.

I am so lost with how different everything is now. I may as well have been in prison for the past decade. Cover letters? Resumes? Everything online? I don't want to work ""cash"" jobs anymore. I fucked myself by doing that and I knew I was.. but didn't see the big picture. I cant do that hard physical work anymore with my health. I need a ""normal"" job. I need any job really. I have a legit disability, Im not fucking lazy. I want nothing more than to work. To socialize, meet people, make friends, do things. I don't even know where to start. My entire life was tied to my dad. He's gone now. Im basically trying to build an adult life, from scratch, in my mid 30s, in several months, after witnessing the most horrific thing that I could possibly imagine, just a couple months ago. Im absolutely terrified every minute of every day.

I would try to shorten this, I know its long, but then I end up reading through it, re-living everything, and having another breakdown. I've been up all night as usual. I've just reached grief overload at this point. I feel like at my age, with my health, the fact that I have no kids/family, single, etc..the world sees me as a lost cause. I know I'll never have a ""normal"" life. I mean I've missed a huge chunk of my adult life. But I deserve.. something. Anything is more than I have now. I don't know what my specific question is.. I just need some sort of advice? I dont know.. I'm desperate for any bit of hope. Im just so fucking tired of being all alone and having nothing. I need some way to literally survive at this point. I'm not looking at building a 401k or investing in some long-term future. With my health, and with heart disease especially, this could all be over any time. I legit have no plans of ""retiring"". Its just not happening. I want to live something that resembles a life for the next 20 years, I hope, and have some memories when I die.",08Dec2020,1

But they tell me I have to buy a meal plan of ($1,505 per semester, I believe). I would be earning just enough to cover the rent, and they really expect me to pay an extra $1,500 for four months...to work for them?!? Apparently, they checked my financial aid and said I can use it to pay, as if it was free money. I am already almost $20k in debt and they really expect me to take out yet another loan, with interest, to pay for food that I WILL not use most of the time. Also, Covid.
Is there something I am missing here? I don’t even know when they were planning to tell me, I know this just because I asked. 
I had already accepted the offer and just need to take the drug test, but I don’t know what I am supposed to do. I got a job to earn money, not spend more, this doesn’t make any sense. I don’t even know if I should try to explain this to them because I doubt they care.

I graduated in 2019 and had a difficult time looking for a job. I did manage to get bootcamp training for a month starting December 2019 but did not manage to get absorbed in the company. A few months after that, I finally got an offer from an ideal company to work with but the pandemic spread to our country by that time and lockdown happened. The offer eventually got rescinded due to hiring freeze. Ever since, I have been having a difficult time landing interviews due to a combination of less job posts and my increasing gap.

534,"My partner and I are renting a house owned by a landlord who runs a home cleaning business and part of our rent covers monthly home cleaning services. They temporarily shut down but reopened after a few months with a very reassuring email informing clients they are taking the highest precautions on safety. We felt we could trust them so monthly cleaning resumed. Our cleaner thanked us for providing him with work and we tipped generously every month.

In November we were alerted by the landlord’s assistant that the cleaner we had was in contact with a positive covid case. We were alarmed and my partner disinfected our entire home and we self quarantined for two weeks. During this time we both felt distressed as I am high risk due to pregnancy and the entire situation put things in a heavy perspective for us. It served as a grim reminder that despite being careful and not letting family or friends visit, trusting our landlord’s cleaning company was severely naive on our part and believe me, we are both shaken with guilt over it. Thankfully we exhibited no symptoms but decided to cancel further cleaning appointments. Landlord did not contact us at all regarding this scare. 

Now yesterday we received a message from the landlord telling us an internal appraisal for the property is scheduled for this Friday and someone will need to go into our living space to take pictures. I am currently on bedrest due to being at risk for preterm labor, we informed landlord we are uncomfortable having a stranger in our space, especially considering last month’s cleaning scare and offer alternatives with pictures or videos.

Landlord’s response was a bit aggressive telling us that an appraisal will be quick “as oppose to a 4 hour cleaning session” as in she was guilting us for accepting the cleaning services our higher-than-average rent pays for these last few months. She then goes to say that she’s happy we cancelled cleaning as her family has cancelled cleaning since March and she does not think home cleaning services are ideal during the pandemic. Mind you, this is HER cleaning company. Those emails to clients ensuring the highest safety were signed by her.  

I haven’t drafted a response yet, I’m just a bit shocked. It doesn’t seem like landlord cares about her clients, employees or us as her tenants. Any advice?",08Dec2020,1

Basically my boyfriend (22) and I (20) haven’t been going out long, probably like 4 months now, it feels like we’ve known each other forever and I love him so much it just feels like it never stops growing.

So, being intimate with him as I have I know he is a very clean person and it’s a dream because I am too, we both like clean, tidy, organised spaces and the showers together are regular so it’s perfect, he also brushes his teeth semi regularly so idk

I began to notice some plaque at the bottom of his bottom teeth, I’ve had it behind my teeth before, it happens, so I picked it off and upped my brushing routine again. I think I’ve always been so good with it cuz I didn’t have the best childhood and as sad as it is the dentist was where I’d get the most compliments, so I may just unconsciously focus on my teeth

He does smoke so that may have something to do with it. He has such a lovely smile and I don’t want other people judging him for that, but then again this may be me judging him for that so I’m not sure 

Sometimes it makes me feel weird when we kiss but most of the time I don’t care, I just don’t know what to do, do I tell him? Is that c*nty?? Do I wait for longer along the line and tell him??

540,"Sorry for formatting. I’m on mobile. 

I (17f) have no friends. All I have is my boyfriend of over a year (18m). He’s the only person that I hang out with and talk to, but I really want to make some friends. All the friends I did have either abandoned me, stabbed me in the back, or changed in a way where we weren’t very compatible as friends anymore so we just simply grew apart. I don’t know if I’m the problem here or what. 

I’m a Junior currently. My best friend since seventh grade pressured me to start dating my boyfriend to the point of calling my mom every day to tell her to make me go on a date with him. I was really uncomfortable being in a relationship at the time because of personal reasons I’d rather not discuss, but I relented and went out with him because of the constant pressure though. But she really knew what she was talking about though because him and I have been inseparable ever since. She then drew away and I later found out it was because she was jealous and she had a crush on my bf. I was really confused because she literally was the one who pressured me to date her. This was a year ago and we haven’t spoken since. 

My other friend I chose to go NC with because she hurt me really badly by hanging out with my ex (despite knowing everything he did to me) and I refuse to talk to her or give her any explanation as to why I can’t stand her. She really hurt me and betrayed me so I refuse to keep her in my life. She knows what went down yet decided to choose him over me anyways. 

And lastly, my other friend used to be a really nice sweet girl but the last few times we hang out she would insult my boyfriend and just be outright mean to him (my mom thinks she has a crush on him, which I also think because when we played DND she’d always insist on sitting next to him and such) and even went to the point of blatantly laughing at him when he got a different haircut. I really didn’t like how she changed so I decided to stop talking with her. 

I have no other friends and I don’t know how to make friends. I really want a good friend group to play DND with because it’s my favorite game ever and it’s my only hobby. It’s the one thing that I look forward to at the end of every week and it’s the one thing that makes the school day less worse because I’m thinking about what could go down in the campaign.

i was brought to this page when googling about a phobia i have about eating fruit/vegtables. the post i found was from 4 years ago and i was wondering if anyone had any new ideas on how to overcome this fear.

i’m 15 and i’m not a small 15 year old i’m 6’2 and around 130kg and have had a fear of eating fruit and vegtables since i was about 3. i believe it’s because of when i was about 3 i got food poisoning and a lot of sicknesses which made me very sick and nearly caused me to die. since then i haven’t ate a fruit or vegetable since and i’m honestly sick of living like this i play lots of sports and i am very active yet i can’t lose weight because of this.

it’s not like a desicion really it’s more like my instinct to just not eat them and i will try not to eat them as much as i can.

Well, I'm with my parents since I finished college 2 years ago. I know I've fucked up a bit not getting a job or something but I wanted to take time off and learn a few things here and there. This is not the problem.

The problem is I have never seen myself as a burden to my family. In my opinion, a family gives time to one of its members if they want to do something or are ""figuring out life"". My parents haven't forced me to go out (yet). But some relative mentioned burden in some conversation to them. So it hit me. I honestly from my heart don't believe in the burden thing. Like as I said, I feel like its natural for a person of my age to say that they are trying to ""figuring what to do with their lives"". But for some people, they think it as a burden. 

I am just not sure what it really is? Am I really a burden? I honestly never had that idea in my head. If its true, I will try to find a way to ""go out"" and find a job or something. Basically, is my understanding of the world lacking in some way?

She has childhood sexual trauma and is working through it with a therapist, so I completely understand how sex can be triggering, anxiety provoking, traumatic, etc. I have gone back and forth about being at peace with that vs being sad about it and wishing it were different and trying to talk to her about it or being insecure about it in my head, thinking that she just isn't attracted to me and doesn't want to let go of our relationship. She hates talking about it, but we have. She says she feels ashamed of it. I get confused about why it is this way. Sometimes she says it's that she doesn't have a sex drive because of her depression meds, but she has switched off of SSRI's and switched meds a couple times. Sometimes she says it's that the idea of sex just makes her so anxious, sometimes because ""we haven't done it in so long,"" which, if that's the case, nothing is ever going to change if we don't try things.

Every time I try to talk about it she half engages, but mostly avoids it and kinda shuts me down or just says sorry I don't have any updates there. She keeps saying ""our relationship just isn't going to be like it was in the beginning."" This always confuses me, when people act like things are so different now. If we want to be excited about our relationship still, and make it exciting and be passionate with each other, why couldn't it be like it was in the beginning? Not exactly but just the energy and excitement and passion and fun and intimacy. I think that those feelings can be cultivated.

I just want to know that she is trying to work through it and that at some point when she's ready we can incorporate that back into our relationship. In my head the past few weeks I've gotten impatient and depressed about it and I think she senses that. I try to hide it until I've thought about it enough to where I can bring it up maturely and without pressure. She has kind of even eliminated all romantic parts of our relationship, which makes our relationship sometimes just feel like a friendship. We still hold hands and cuddle a little. We don't ever make out or talk about how we love each other or have dates even though I tried to establish a weekly date night so I could feel some intimacy. I feel so rejected and stuck. I don't want to break up. I don't think she does either. But there's just nothing I can do, right? I'm never going to pressure her into doing something she isn't comfortable with, but it also feels futile to wait until something changes, because she is perfectly content in our relationship as it is.

553,"I posted about this on some other subs when it had more recently happened and I was in pain from the relationship ending. To sum it up, I stayed in touch with one of my professors from college after I graduated for a few years and during the pandemic and lockdowns we got too close and it spiraled into a sexting/emotional affair (never met up for various reasons). We were eventually caught by his wife and stopped. I enjoyed it at the time but I now realize that there was a lot of manipulation and questionable behavior - for starters, he didn't lay consistent boundaries, which led me to believe this kind of connection was acceptable. There were a lot of other red flags that I saw at the time and chose to ignore, like saying we ""shouldn't be doing this"" and then going right back down that road, telling me he loved me for the first time soon after the first time I DMed him an intimate image (which he asked for and I asked multiple times if he was sure), messaging drunk a lot of the time when he had previously said he had problems getting sexual with people when he drank, and just general things he told me about previous sexual behavior/partners like a pattern of hooking up with ex-students. Now, I take full responsibility for my part of what happened. I should have directly asked about a lot of things. But I have a tendency not to realize how toxic something was until I'm out of the situation. This was a person I looked up to, and they knew how much I looked up to them, and they're literal decades older than me (I'm in my mid 20s, so an adult at least), they knew I had a bad home life and would weirdly mix trying to be parental with sexualizing me the next minute, etc. I know they aren't an awful person. I know a lot of this is my fault. But I feel like I got taken advantage of.

So my question is this. As part of healing, I am working on an art piece to share on my Facebook page with a caption explaining what it's about.

I'm in a situation where I have 3-4 other friends who are looking to do the same and make around $1000 a month each as well.

There are houses and apartments to rent around us that are 2-3 bedrooms and cost between $1400-2000 a month. Most of us already have our own cars (I'm the exception). 

We can cook, and the rentals that we're looking at have stoves, fridges, and dishwashers, but no washing machines or dryers.

Does the plan to get a 2-3 bedroom rental for $1400-1700 a month with a $4000-6000 monthly budget sound feasible? Is there anything special that I need to consider or plans that I need to make in order to do this?

Any advice or place to turn would be appreciated. I'm hoping to move out and into a place within the next 2 weeks or so.",08Dec2020,1
560,"I (25f) love my SIL (28f) but there have been things she has done that have just been adding and adding on that make me want to avoid spending time with her for the fear of the truth coming out. I really need to let these things go but it is difficult. The build up began about a year ago without invalidating my own feelings. She owns MY personal experiences as her own trauma and wants to be part of my intimate life. She was insensitive with the death of my child and I hate knowing that she has photos of him dying on her phone, not knowing who she has shared them with. She invited someone i don’t care for to the hospital while I was in a vulnerable state. She recently borrowed (without asking) an article of clothing and made it seem as though I knew she had it (with an attitude) and didn’t offer giving it back (twice this has happened, once with a memorable article of clothing from my aunt overseas). Because of this built up resentment, I find myself “hating” her for other things that do not involve me. Today is her birthday and I do not feel a single ounce of happiness in my heart for her. I’m more anxious that she will reach out about my sons death and try to be a part of MY intimate experience in honoring his life.

563,"My oldest son is 7. We chose virtual this year. I felt kind of bad about it, because I know he would benefit from that in person environment, but due to vulnerabilities in our family we couldn't justify the risk.

At the beginning of the year he was super excited. He got a chromebook and was just ready to go. Slowly over the course of weeks until now he has just become a mess when he has to do homework. He's throwing tantrums when he had stopped doing so as much a while ago. He is whining all day about the work and at  night while we talk before bed he is taking about dreading the next day of school. 

I'm very empathetic to the fact that this year is different. He's confused, he misses friends, this is all new and hard for everyone. We talk as much as possible about why we have to do this, how it's what he would be doing in school etc. He just is not having it. He will literally rather sit on the floor staring at me than doing the home work. I sit with him and we do it together, and I can see he is more than capable of doing it. He just doesn't care to. 

We have tried to make it fun. We take breaks. We get up and eat breakfast first. We have a schedule put up in our main room so he can follow it. We go outside and get energy out. He likes video games so we made the rule that no games until you finish homework. He doesn't care. We made a comfy space for him to do the work where he picked out the items to put decor up. We let him go at his own pace. We stay firm on rules and if he doesn't  do the work by the end of day he does get a priviledge taken like his games or to bed a little earlier. That seems to work for a day but then the next he is back to the same. 

But even when he is doing it he is fighting the entire time. 

What do I do? I don't want to make his experience with school bad and give him memories about it that make this a continuous cycle but clearly we are doing something wrong here. I want to help him succeed.",08Dec2020,1
564,"Hi everyone. I don't know if it's necessary, but here is a trigger warning for suicide and depression.

I just learnt that a friend has been cutting herself. I don't know the full story, but there are definitely cuts on her wrists, and her mom says she tried to kill herself. We're not super close, she's the daughter of one of my mom's friends. We both struggle with serious anxiety and started taking anti depressants this year, so even though there might be something else going on, I can at least relate to some of it, and since I'm older, hopefully give her some good advice. I've tried giving her advice before, but she always changes the subject and I've never wanted to push too much. But now I feel like I have to say something and try to get her to open up. 

She's already scheduled to see a psychiatrist but because of covid it will only happen in the weekend, but besides that I really want her to know that she can talk to me, and that will only happen if I ""force"" the first conversation. So, this is where I need your advice.

Should I talk to her, even though we're not close but definitely consider each other a friend?

I have a bunch of self help books about depression and anxiety, should I give her one? (only one, so it's not overwhelming and she doesn't have to decide which one to read)

What can I say to her that might change anything or make her feel better in any way? I'm afraid to say the wrong thing and make it worse.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",08Dec2020,1
565,"Hi everyone. So I have been dating my boyfriend for about 3 months and I have met his family twice.

My bf knows I can’t really get out of my house to see my friends because of the pandemic, so he thought it would be a nice gesture if he invited my best friend over to his house while I was there so that we could see each other. She stayed for dinner. She was meeting my bf and his family for the first time.

At dinner, she over shared lmao. She talked about her family’s divorce and how much she hates her dad and pretty much about her whole life. Not that it’s bad, but if she’s meeting my boyfriend’s family for the first time, it’s kind of a lot of information to unload on them. She went on for like an hour. My boyfriend told me his parents were pretty much like “well that was pretty weird lol” after she left. His older brother was also like ""I don't like the way they spoke of their parents"" and he grouped me into what she said. I don’t want her over sharing to be a bad reflection on me. I understand her family life is hard, but I just don’t know why she would share like that. Maybe she felt really comfortable with them since I was there but idk. His parents are very nice people and they were listening attentively to her the whole time. 

Do you think his family would think of me differently because of what she said/did? Should I text his mom and apologize on my friend's behalf? They really liked me before and I’m sure they still do, but I’m getting in my own head about this and I really want them to like me. Thanks",08Dec2020,1

567,"*tl;dr* I’m 24 years old with $60,000 in student loan debt. I went to school for teaching, tried it, and realized I hated it. I also realized how little teachers truly make, and that I was taking a pay cut from my former job, which was waitressing. I don’t want to teach, don’t want to waitress forever, I want a solid “office setting” 9-5 job. I feel like life is passing me by and I have no plans of how to become successful, and I really don’t want to go back to school given my age and the student loan debt I already have.


I went to college for 5 years and graduated a year ago with a Bachelors degree in education. I started teaching shortly after graduating, and I realized I really hated it. I had been ignoring the idea that maybe I truly didn’t like teaching throughout the last few years of college, but now that I’ve taught it’s confirmed that I really hate it. I left my first teaching job after the 2019-2020 school year because my mental health had plummeted. Also teachers get paid shit money, especially compared to the type of work they have to put in. I don’t know why I didn’t think about this more seriously before, but most teachers I know have an very stressful job that requires taking home work at night and on weekends, and they’re barely scraping by. I don’t want that for myself.

Now I’m $60,000 in student loan debt and I’m unemployed. I was waitressing and making better money than I was teaching, but I am still unhappy.

I could see myself really enjoying a 9-5 “office setting” career field. I’m highly organized and a great communicator. I’ve been looking into entry level office jobs like being a receptionist, but the pay is so bad (like $15 an hour), and I don’t know if it will lead to anything bigger. I don’t want to go to school again for an administrative type degree, because I don’t want to make another huge mistake if I’m wrong again and put myself even further in debt, plus I’m already 24 years old. I feel unsuccessful, depressed, broke, and like my life is passing me by and I have NO plan of how to become successful.

Thanks if you read the whole thing. I’m at my wits end. If you have any words of advice or want to say what you would do in my situation, I would really appreciate it.",08Dec2020,1

572,"Hello there everybody!

Once the pandemic hit, a domino like series of events happened. First, everything was locked down, my community college classes went online, my theatre classes were cancelled, I could only see one of my friends because of Covid concerns. Then that friend went off to college, and I basically wasn't hanging out with anyone. My school/theatre friends and I kept in contact for a little while, but then lost touch.

Currently I am feeling very lonely. I am having trouble finding a job, my church (which has no teenagers but me to begin with,) is shutting down again, and my friend is back from college but I won't be seeing him much anyway. I have chatted a bit with my school/theatre friends but it doesn't seem like they are interested in hanging out or even doing a phone call. Which makes me question my whole past two years because they were the highlight of those years, and now I am wondering if they were really friends or not.

So my question is, what should I do? I know it is very broad and probably a difficult question, but I don't know how else to phrase it. I want to connect with people again. Should I try reaching out to my school and theatre friends more? Should I make new friends? How do I do that if there are no kids my age in my neighborhood, I can't get a job, I can't drive myself yet, and my church doesn't have any kids my age?

I (F16) feel like I am taking advantage of my parents during this difficult time.

Kid, lets call him R, sits behind me (although hes not supposed to) and hes pretty annoying. Says stupid things like ""Gang bang"" (which I just figured out what it means) and ""Berta"" (which I dont know what it means so If you'd like to tell me then go ahead)  but anyways I enjoy wearing touqes/beanies and I wear one almost daily because it calms me. R thinks its funny to make fun of me for that even though his own friend wears a beanie daily too, he also enjoys to call my hair greasy and ask when I last showered (which is dumb, I shower daily) and he makes fun of my friends too.

One time we were just playing a game for gym and he decided to target and hit me in the nose, arm and stomach on ""accident"" aswell as claiming my friend J is on narcotics (the happy drug) then I ask if she's on drugs then what is he on because hes almost quadrouple as bad as her then trys to tattle on me for bringing drugs into it even though he was the one to bring it up.

579,"A little over 3 years ago I was in a yoga class in college and developed a little crush on one of the girls over the course of the class.  We never actually spoke though and I knew she had a boyfriend because he’d walk her to class every day.  The class ended, then one night a month or two later I saw a message on my inactive Tinder which ended up being a match &amp; message from her.  I didn’t even know I’d seen her on the app since I usually didn’t pay attention while swiping.  She asked me out for drinks the next night and we met up.  It went great.  Within an hour or two we were running back to my apartment to smoke, make out, and ended up having sex.  

While laying in bed afterward, without me ever having revealed I’d had a crush on her, she told me she’d had her eye on me throughout the class and would purposely try to look cute for me, wearing spanks to class.  Just about made my head explode when she said that, still one of my favorite sexy moments of my life.  We were getting along great at this point and went to put on a movie to relax to afterward.  Things were still going good, lots of laughs, until suddenly she froze up and said she was going to leave.  

You might be able to guess I did not hear from her the next day.  When she eventually did get back to me she said something about having had just broken up with her boyfriend and having been overwhelmed by what had happened, or something like that.  I was disappointed because we had great chemistry and we only met that one time, but I chalked it up to a loss and actually ended up in the Army about two months later.  I was gone for a year.  When I got back I was on Facebook and randomly tried looking her up, but I didn’t know her last name.  A google search later led me to her FunnyJunk profile, a website I also had an account on, and then her Reddit profile (obvious from the name and age).  I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw a post from a year before about how she was nervous to be getting an abortion.

It turned out that this was a few months *before* we hooked up, but the moment struck me enough that I remembered it.  I basically fucked off and did my own thing at this point for the next 2ish years, working on my career.  But recently during quarantine I’ve had a lot of free time, I remembered about her and looked her up.  Lo and behold she was active again on Reddit, and was posting in obscure anime subreddits... ones which I also happened to be posting in.  And she was posting about running.  Guess who ran their first marathon this year?  This guy.  *And* she was posting on r/advice responding to random people’s problems.  Well I’m one of the “super helpers” on this sub on my main account.  Also she might see this but I don’t really care.

The point is that I’ve convinced myself I would have incredible chemistry with this girl, but I’m fully aware of how intrusive it is to stalk someone’s profile and I would not respond positively to that if it were me.  I’m torn between telling her all this, or warning her that she should delete her account because anyone with some internet detective skills could find very private information about her.  Or of course, just minding my own business entirely.  I have never told anyone about any of this, no one even knows I ever hooked up with her in the first place and so I thought I’d tell the story and try to gain some perspective.",08Dec2020,1
580,"Hello, I don't have a therapist, so I decided to ask a bunch of strangers. I'm going to give context now.

I decided to move to a small town with a close friend a couple months back. This lease is only for one year while said friend figures out their schooling life and working life. Things were super rocky at first and it really sucked with all the racism and other crap I had to deal with due to being brown and queer in a small town. But I knew this would happen going in. However, I had only made one other friend since moving. And this person was a friend of my friends. So not exactly MY friend, even lol.

Anyways, it took a while for me to get a job out here (shocker) but then I finally got one. And I became almost immediate friends with one of my co-workers (they're actually one of my managers). And we have a bunch of things in common. And this is the touchy part.

I get attached to people WAY too easily. And I form these attachments pretty soon after meeting people. (I.E.: I got ownership of my cat from someone I'd only known for like a month, and took her in as a favor. Another one: One of my longest friendships [around a decade] started because of a band t shirt the guy was wearing.) So I obviously have some type of co-dependency issue. I'm deeply aware of this.

However, I also form crushes on people fairly quickly. And they usually either last a couple weeks and then they're forgotten and I move on with my life. Or my crush will last years and I'll think of them as ""What could've been"" forever. But again. This lease only lasts one year. And I don't honestly want to be here any longer than needed. However, my new friend - who I'm deeply attached to - owns a house of their own. And has no plans to move from said house especially while their brother still depends on them.

But lately, my crush on my new friend has been a little strenuous for me. We've been cuddling on the couch, either at their place or mine. My other friend / roommate is also friends with my friend / manager, because we all work together. So when hanging out between the three of us it's all fine and dandy, but usually my (r)friend will fall asleep while my (m)friend is over. And then things get a little awkward. (M)friend is fully aware of my crush on them because I'm a dumbass and made a mistake on snap chat.

My (r)friend keeps saying it looks like (m)friend has a crush on me as well, considering they sometimes are the one to initiate the physical contact. But I tink that's just what a healthy friendship is?? And I'm not very concerned either way about the possibility of them liking me back, lol. It does not change how I do it will act.

Anyways, I suppose my question is very simple in that. When my (m)friend is around, they will hold hands with me, as it's my favorite form of affection, and cuddle me while I play with their hair. I don't believe in the ""friendzone,"" I think it's a way to shame women and people in general for not feeling like they owe something to someone just because the other person wants it. I also think it perpetuates rape culture. So I'm not even slightly complaining about being in the non-existent ""friendzone"" because having a friend is great in itself.

But I'm worried my having a crush on (m)friend makes me a bad person for wanting to be more than friends. Even though I'm not ever, ever pushy about it. I even go so far as to message my friends (all of them) if I'm worried about the possibility of having upset them, and I want to make sure our boundaries are clear and understood. But I think my being so affectionate with my (m)friend is weird now that they know I like them.

Also I feel the need to include that we are all functioning adults, in case it wasn't clear from the beginning. I'm 21, (m)friend is 22, (r)friend is 25. Also, please consider that I'm a human person with emotions before you say something super mean, lol. I'm just wanting to know if I'm being a bad friend because of circumstances, lol.",08Dec2020,1

First-time renter here. I signed a lease on my grandpa's acreage for Sep.1st, 2020 to Aug. 31st, 2021. I have had never-ending problems with him. I don't think I'm a 'problem renter', especially when compared to his past lessees. I pay rent on time, don't trash the place, and don't bother him.  


As for a short list of problems with the place itself, the house hadn't even been swept at my move-in, half the light bulbs were out (some fixtures were broken), the kitchen sink had a very fast drip, the M Ba toilet did not flush, there was no deadbolt on the back door, and the fridge still had food in it from the last renter. There aren't any obvious smoke detectors. The insulation is awful, even at full blast, the unit can only manage about 10 degrees either way.

As for what he's done, he only fixed the sink and the toilet. Said everything else was on me. He has repeatedly shown up at my door with no notice to show prospective buyers. His newest trick is depositing the rent check (he will not accept any other form of payment) a day before my payday (which he is aware of and has agreed was fine), thus hitting me with both an overdraft fee and a $50 bounced check fee for him. There have also recently been many unknown people on the property, most recently a guy he invited to deer hunt.  


As far as the sale goes, a good part of the things we verbally agreed on as being included in the lease will no longer be possible. Those include deer hunting (with myself being the only one doing it), raising cattle, and a small garden. He has stated that he ""isn't going to invest anything else into a property that isn't going to be \[his\] in a few weeks."" when I tried to discuss things with him.

This is after finding out what exactly an engineer does (by working at the industry for 3 months and observing what my supervisors and their supervisors do), which I find I'm not too passionate about, or do I find enjoyable in the slightest, because of all the reports that I have to do, a variety of meetings I need to attend that I just have to listen for a lot of time, sending emails, and in my case in particular repeat the same tasks over and over and over again, without no one to talk to.

Which brings me to medicine, ever since I started engineering I have always considered switching to medicine because I find it is a noble career and one that actually helps people. And in other hand, doctors are needed everywhere, it seems. It also involves in a more direct way what you studied for, instead of engineering where the work I do only requieres common sense and remembering what form you use, and who should I send and email to. Just to clarify, I'm just starting to investigate more about medicine and I know that it is a long career, and where I live and my family's financial situation is able to sustain it, and in any case it might take a year for me to graduate from engineering. After which I would have a more clear idea of everything that involves being a doctor and then start to apply at the medical school.",08Dec2020,1
586,"So for context, this happened to my girlfriend, not me. She went to the store FYE in 2018 and purchased some items. At the checkout counter they told her that she can apply for a free store card that will give her %10 off all orders. Obviously this sounds great when you're told it's exactly like all free store memberships.

What they failed to mention is that it's free for a month, and then there's an $11.99 fee every month. So, ever since she's been there that one time, she has been charged over $350 for what was told to be a free membership. Is there any way that the store might refund her this money?

I'm from France and today my friend received a package from Germany and it contains a small box with dirt in it (??)
It's kinda creepy because there was also a small note in it that says ""I hope you will keep it for a long time"" and it mentions her boyfriend and her 
And ofc we dont know anyone from Germany 

And so we don't know how to find who sent this (we all thought that it was a prank but it really seems to be sent from Germany)

However, she’s recently started selling a homemade moisturizer on her IG (for a whopping 25 bucks) and the ingredients are literally just coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, and beeswax. I’m not sure about avocado and beeswax, but olive and coconut oil are terrible for people with oily or acne prone skin. Before I knew this, I would use a homemade olive oil and brown sugar scrub all over my back and body.. it felt so nice but within weeks I was getting these tiny clogged bumps/ pores EVERYWHERE.

598,"Hi everyone, please excuse the long message but I really need some advice in my current situation, also this is my first Reddit post so I apologise for any mistakes!!

I (18f) have a sister (21f) we'll call Maya. Maya and I also have a brother we'll call Kaden (23m). Kaden and Maya were very close as kids and are still to this day as they are the elder children, which meant for me, I’m closer with our dad. 

Maya and I went to the same boarding school, me being 2 years below her, and have a rocky relationship. In her words, I am the favourite child of both my parents and ""get whatever I want"" to which I can understand how she sees this but feel it is untrue as I worked hard for my accomplishments. In 2016 I was selected into a state team and my mum and I bonded over the sport as she often drove me to training, games, etc. My sister is far more successful in other aspects of life compared to me. She is the academically gifted child and I am the sport gifted child while Kaden is the only boy, so I always thought the attention was shared between the three of us.

Maya and I fight often, we don't have a lot in common and I often feel judged on a lot of my decisions. She often berates me and is nasty, calling me abusive names, talking behind my back to mutual friends, barely speaks to me unless she wants something, like to borrow clothes or wants me to do her washing. She does the same with my parents too, taking money from them for clothes and other things since she left high school. For example, earlier this year, Maya had been at her boyfriends in the country the whole isolation (about 7 weeks) and had not been to our house, while I had been going to and from a house I dog sit and the house I share with them every few weeks. In this particular instance, Kaden had left the house a mess, dishes everywhere, rubbish full, and just generally dirty, which isn't unlike him, so during iso I often would clean it if I was home as he works full time. The week before Kaden left, I was dogsitting, and Maya and I got home within a few days of each other to our house with Kaden gone. I made us dinner, and had done the dishes, and asked if she could take out the rubbish as we needed to work together to clean as Kaden wasn't there to do it himself. She flipped out yelling it wasn't her mess and she shouldn't have to clean it and when I tried to discuss it with her saying it wasn't mine either but it'd be easier cleaning it together she told me to stop acting older than her, mimicking my words in the process. I got frustrated and we were quickly in a verbal fight with me yelling she needed to help me and her saying no, essentially ending with me in tears after she yelled at me that no one wanted me around nor liked me and I was just hated really and complained to mum who then tried to get me to continue cleaning. Another example is when she screamed at me because I forgot to hang out her washing she needed the next day because she was running late for a lunch with the in-laws (about the 10th time I'd done it and first I'd forgotten). 

I really want a good relationship with her. I have never intentionally tried to take mum and dads attention away from her and I really look up to her. She's stunning in looks, has lots of friends, is extremely smart, amazing at tennis and netball and I often hear from others how nice and funny she can be but never see that side of her when we're together. My friends have seen how she treats me and comment that it isn't acceptable and that she bullies me and I shouldn't have to deal with that. I need to know if there's anything I can do to solve this problem and fix our relationship!",08Dec2020,1

600,"I (20F) am living with my parents while taking online college classes full time. I usually am taking college classes online without a pandemic due to my struggles with anxiety and depression.

I had a job at the end of last year and into January of 2020, but was let go because they were a small business and couldn’t afford to keep me at the time. Then a few months later as everyone knows, the pandemic hit. I had an excuse to not look for a job for a while because everything was closed. Since things reopened though, I have been feeling pressure to look for work even though the pandemic is still pretty intense in the US. I have been putting off looking for work because 1) I don’t want to get COVID and 2) it’s hard for me to find jobs that sound doable to me anyway because of anxiety.

Of course I understand where my parents are coming from with wanting me to find a job, as I am an adult and need to start planning for life after college and practicing general life skills. I don't believe that my parents are in the wrong here.

I guess my conflict is between me and myself. Is it right for me to not want a job right now, or should I be forcing myself to get a job I won’t be happy with just for the sake of having a job? Am I being an entitled brat by resisting work during this time?",08Dec2020,1
601,"Hey. I'm a 19yo girl in my second year of art school. Classes have been entirely online this semester, and I'm living at home. I have a ""part time"" job as a caretaker for my three younger siblings who are developmentally disabled. This means I get up every morning, change diapers, make breakfast, bath them, feed them, dress them, etc. I get paid because we are on a government waiver for caretakers, but we can't hire anyone new to come into our house because of the virus. Even if I didn't formally take the job, I would still have to help care for these kids, because even if I shouldn't have to, if I don't, they just don't get cared for the way they should. I love my sisters and would fucking die for them, no questions asked. 

I'm falling seriously behind in my classes, I went from straight A's to B's and C's. School also sucks, I don't have access to the facilities I paid for, which is a pretty big deal at an art school (thank god I'm not a sculptor lol). I can't make any friends. Art school has been my dream since I was a little girl, and so far, I've experienced none of it, always pseudo-parenting by choice freshman year, and only realizing how much it sucks now that I don't have a choice. I am throwing my grandparent's savings down the drain on a shitty bare minimum scrape-by education at this point. I don't have the time to invest in myself.

I'm not super well disciplined, so when I have time free from taking care of these kids, I usually waste it on video games or naps instead of doing schoolwork. I just procrastinate until right before it is due. I used to be a passionate student who would show up to class early, seek out opportunities with teachers, go for optional extra crits, etc. Now school is just a chore and I'm exhausted. 

Since school began I haven't made any new friends. My roommates last year hardly even saw me, because I'd go home to take care of my siblings. 

My mother always criticizes me for not working hard enough but I just don't know what to do at this point. It's hard for me not to fall into a depression, but I've been clinging on as hard as I can. I'm just sick and tired of this shitty situation. It's not fair that I'm stuck taking care of these kids that I never chose to have. It's also not fair that if I leave these kids won't get the care they need. I want to have my own life, and friends. I'm so jealous of my parents' stories of all their fun times in college. I've experienced none of it, and don't know if I will at this point. I'm so fucking lonely, if it weren't for my bf, I'd probably be catatonic. 

I want to take a gap year and wait to go back to school until the virus is no longer a huge deal and I can make the most of it, but when I last brought it up to my mother, she yelled at me like it was ridiculous. I don't want to be a year behind my peers, but I also am not getting anything out of these literal tens of thousands of dollars down the drain.

603,"So I sort of have a unique situation/request and can't decide if it's inconsiderate to a hairstylist's time. It's not difficult or anything, just might be tedious.

Basically, I have kind of long hair right now, and I can decide if I want to get it cut to a medium length or pretty short (I have two specific styles in mind, so I'm not really going for anything in between). The most efficient solution to my dilemma seems like it would be to go to a haircut place, ask for them to cut it to the medium length I have in mind, and then if, after seeing it, I decide I like the short style better, to just ask them to cut it that way. This way I don't have to get two different haircuts.

The only hangup is that I don't want to annoy a stylist by essentially asking them to give two haircuts in the same session.

Do you guys think it would be inconsiderate to try to do this? Should I just bite the bullet and get a different haircut the next day if I don't like the medium length one?

I visited my school today because I had to return my textbooks. I bumped into that teacher and we had a short conversation asking each other how we've been doing since the final exam.

A bit of back story I(F18) and my partner(M23) and I dated for almost 2 years but we broke up for a few weeks and got back together about 3 months ago. I was forced into sexual relations with someone else and just told him I cheated, he told me in retaliation that he cheated on me which really damaged our relationship. After I told him that I didn't really cheat on me him because I was experiencing mental issues he told me it was a lie but then he told me he cheated again and lied in a cycle of things.

I'm not trying to say what I did wasn't wrong but this is where I'm coming from and why I think I am this way. I've been extremely controlling with needing to know where he was andoccasionally look at who he is texting I was pretty bad.

Recently when we get into fights now, which doesn't happen often, it would go with him asking something extremely personal about my parents and I'd tell him that I'm uncomfortable with telling him because we are on rocky terms. I also don't feel comfortable because when we broke up (because we were long distance for a while) he called me names, I explained this gently but he pushed and I simply kept saying ""it's not your business"" ""you're being invasive"" ""you're being annoying stop"" and I ended up getting in my car and left.

He's been blowing up my phone that I gaslit him and if I didn't have something to hide I would tell him and he said I was probably out cheating so I came back. I really didn't want him to feel that hurt again so I just showed him my phone so he would know I wasn't doing that and he said he forgave me but he wanted to leave for a few days.

I'm positive I've moved on and made peace with the rejection. However, I'm very uncomfortable at the thought of having to talk to her given she never replied she wanted to continue being friends and didn't contact me in 3 years. It makes me very anxious that I might bump into her one day and not know how to act or behave.

Any advice on how I should handle this situation? Thanks in advance!",08Dec2020,1

I've noticed over the past month that I spend hours on my phone without realising and then I feel as if I've just wasted my entire day being unproductive on my phone.

617,"hiii i’ve been going back and forth with this recently and haven’t really told anyone about this. this might be long but i need opinions. ( tw// attempted suicide )

this is about me and my brother. i’m 17, going to graduate and turn 18 in may 2021. my brother has just turned 21 years old. my brother and i are very close! we tell each other everything and have the same humor and interests. we get along very well and he is one of the closest people to me. despite this, i haven’t always had positive experiences with him. 

this one situation has haunted me. i can’t go a month without thinking about it, despite it happening two years ago. i cry quite frequently thinking about it before i sleep. like i said, it was two years ago and i was dealing with a lot of mental health problems and my mom and i were fighting every day and i tried to commit suicide. before i could my mom came in and stopped me. i was in my mom’s room because all the pills were in her room in a locked box. i went to my room afterwards and could hear my brother talking with my mother. he said i was ""crazy"" and was convincing my mom that i did it in her room just to hurt her. and was going on about how i was insane. my brother has attempted suicide before so it was shocking him describe me in such a way especially since we were close then. 

he has made me uncomfortable and upset many times before that moment. with little things.

when i was in elementary, opening the door while i was in the shower to check what i was doing. ( the shower was glass meaning you could see everything ) 

when i was in high school, i was in the bathroom and he walked in by mistake when i was just in my bra. instead of leaving he just kept standing there doing nothing. not closing the door and/or walking away??

when i was in elementary, he once was slowly walking towards me with a knife while i stood in shocked crying, not being able to move. i was screaming and crying in fear for my mom to come in and help me. i’ve brought this moment up like a year ago and he just laughed about it saying he thought it was funny.

he lies about little things like stuff that doesn’t even matter. examples:

he told me tina fey had breast cancer and later that week i mentioned it when we were in the car with our mom and he said ""who told u that? people make up anything these days"" like you told me??? why are you pretending you didn’t? 

we used to both work at the same place and he had the new uniform and i had the old one still since i was on a break for breaking my toe and not being able to walk. he changed our shirt uniforms cause i guessed he liked the old uniforms better?? idk tbh? but when i pointed it out that the shirt he was wearing was actually mine he said ""no, it’s mine."" and i was like ""it doesn’t matter i’m just saying that one is literally mine"" and he kept fighting and lied saying that this was the new uniform and so he was wearing the correct one. like bro that’s the old uniform and it doesn’t even matter like just ask me and i would’ve traded it’s not a big deal why are you lying about something so pointless?

he’s told one of my stories as his own right in front of me to a group of people. and there’s a lot more but this is so long already.

anyway, we’re planning on moving in together when we move out. but honestly i’m not sure if i want to. part of me thinks it’s fine and it will be fun but the other part of me is hurting and is dreading living with him. but i have no one else to live with. maybe i should just do it alone??? idk. i need advice and i can’t talk to him about this because he is dealing with a lot of mental health issues and i don’t want to cause him more pain because i still care about and love him. he doesn’t clean up after himself, fails his driver’s tests on purpose, and hasn’t graduated yet like we’re in school together and i’m a senior. but i don’t know if he’ll have a place to go or someone else to share a place with. he has more friends than me though so i don’t know :(( help please",08Dec2020,1

619,"Hello There,

Basically, Ive known this friend for about 5 years (Since I joined the school). We've had our up and downs and now it's just going down. I do 3 subjects at school and sit next to him in 2 as we do the same subjects, so I'm forced to see and talk to him everyday. I feel like the problem is me because he hasn't done anyhting specifically wrong, I just end up feeling really drained and grumpy after seeing him. We keep getting into small arguments and one thing I have noticed is that he is really bad with interpreting jokes. He gets offended easily and he doesn't get along with many people. I'm quite a quiet person and introvert and he's quite loud and over the top, which can be embarrasing and quit annoying.

Basically I don't know what to do, but I need to do something as I don'tthink I can stand him much longer. I feel like I need to move seats in lessons but there aren't many free and it would be really awkward if I suddenly move since we've known each other for so long. Do I say something to him? I hate confrontation and am awful at it, but I don't know how else to go about it. Basically I just don't want anything to do with him but I can't just cut it off as we are such big parts of each other's school life.

622,"I’m 22 and I really like the idea of having lots of savings to fall back onto if ever I need it. And so, I’ve been putting portions of all the money I get into savings so I’ll have a lot when I’m older. My mom knows I have money so she came to me a few months ago asking me to borrow like $3000-$4000 for the holidays. I REALLY don’t like lending money out to people even if it’s family so I was really reluctant and uncomfortable about it, but I ended up lending her $2500 which she’s still paying off now, $250 a month. Now she asked if we can pay half and half on a new fridge or repairs to the old fridge and said she would pay me back for that too.. I really don’t want to, especially since I already lent her so much.

The issue isn’t that I think I’ll get screwed over, because I know 100% that she will pay me back. It’s just I really don’t feel comfortable lending my money out but feel bad and awkward about saying no. Do I sound like an asshole for not wanting to let people borrow money?

I was just wondering how to handle eating in front of them daily. I get really anxious eating around them. I always thought it was because they have some obnoxious eating habits (eating with their mouths open, taking food from your plate, etc) but I’m realizing i get more anxious about it than I should considering I’ve always thought they were just pet peeves. I feel like I’m having an anxiety attack every day eating with them- all I can think about is the food in their mouths, sliding into their stomach, all the globs of it going down their throats. It makes me nauseous, and I can’t eat because all I can think about is that I don’t want that to happen to me- the concept of food disgusts me when I think about it too much. How can I fix this?

I'm playing a sport with some friends and I am not good as good as them. The friends I'm playing with they're younger than me and there's one friend who's as old as me and is my best mate. Even though he's my best friend and tells me everything about his life but I can't do the same..
I'm not really good at the game, I get teased a lot and under the pressure I do even worse. They're saying bunch of stuff like ""Now your depression begins"" and I'm absolutely pissed and feeling bad thinking how bad I'm at everything. I'm trying my best to take things positively, telling myself that these uncomfortable situations are going to make me stronger. But I'm failing and exploding with anger or depression at the end of the day.

These feelings are taking me back to my past relationship, my ex told me that I ""crack like thin ice under pressure."" That relationship wasn't good thing for me and  I was dragged to every bad corner of mind because of emotions. Never had a good or real relationship with anyone before. I can see it in my friends because I'm single and less confident, They don't treat me like I'm Don Quixote.

I'm dealing with low self esteem and some addiction. I've tried to take things very positively but sometimes it feels like the load is too much. Because of these things constantly whirling in my head, I can't concentrate, make good decisions, deal with situation without anger and take care of myself. I don't have a good opinion about myself and absolutely no one to talk about, because the people around me make me feel awful and weaker than I already am. I'm tired of their patronizing behaviour. Some bad thoughts like suicide have crossed my mind. Don't worry I'm not gonna do it.

636,"So basically, the last time I had a UTI I had it quite bad, I saw a doctor who prescribed me 2 weeks worth of antibiotics. Though the UTI got worse and so I saw another doctor who gave me a single dose of another antibiotic which completely got rid of the UTI. Because I was given this one dose, I had 9 of the previous antibiotics left.

On Sunday, I had the characteristic symptoms of a UTI, and I’ve had many recently so I know that it was definitely a UTI. I remembered I had some antibiotics left so I started taking them. On Monday (yesterday) my symptoms were basically non existent, bar the stinging when I pee and the uncomfortable sensation in my lower abdomen like I need to pee. Today all I have is that slight uncomfortable sensation. This is the fastest my UTI has ever gone away.

What I’m asking is if I should have spoken to a doctor instead of taking the antibiotics? I wanted to nip it in the bud, before it got so bad that I couldn’t do any of my daily tasks, like work. And because I’ve taken these antibiotics without seeking medical advice, will I be in trouble when I see the doctor tomorrow, who will know that I’ve been taking the antibiotics due to them discolouring the urine (she’s doing a pregnancy test as I’m changing my birth control).",08Dec2020,1

653,"I [22/F] live in Pennsylvania. Our summers are hot and sunny, while winters are cold, rainy and snowy. I have loved outdoor activities like hiking and swimming since I was a kid, and I love 80-90 degree weather. I don’t know how to ski or snowboard and honestly can’t afford it, so the holidays are all I really enjoy during the winter. As the temperature drops, the leaves fall, and the world turns gray, I begin experiencing the following symptoms— struggling to get out of bed, feeling exhausted even after 10+ hours of sleep, lack of motivation to do simple daily tasks like laundry and cleaning (which I keep up with all spring/summer long), feeling lonely when I’m not alone, irritability, less healthy diet, and feeling like I have nothing to look forward to. I’ve experienced this every year since I was a kid. I talk to my therapist of four years (now virtually) once a week, which helps a lot. I also take Lamictal for bipolar disorder, which has significantly improved my mental and emotional stability over the last two years. Still, I struggle to feel like my free spirited, happy-go-lucky self between the months of October and March. 

Can anyone with similar issues provide some advice on how to cope with this?

656,"So- before I get into anything I'm currently doing half online half in person school, I'm 16, living with my mum, and I've not really been doing any of my school work for my online classes.

I haven't been doing it bc- I just have an overwhelming lack of motivation to do it, whenever I try I suddenly feel like I'm really overwhelmed and I'm not gonna get it done before the end of the semester to pass anyways so- why try? So I just don't do it and submit blank papers so my mum won't instantly see that I've done nothing.

Today my Apush/Avid teacher sent out an email to my mum explaining how I haven't turned in any work, me and her are already going on a call later today to talk about it because- I just haven't been mentioning my lack of motivation to my teacher (I hate talking to my teachers they give me a shit tone of anxiety) or to my mum (she has a tendency to say it isn't that hard and to just do it while belittling however I might be feeling, getting school work done is more important to her than my mental health).

Well my mum called me, saying all types of shit abt how I'm moving to the downstairs room, she's gonna come upstairs and clean (which normally I normally do weekly but recently I just- haven't), staying home for the rest of the week, gonna make me do work downstairs so she can walk around and see me doing it instead of nothing, I'm losing all my tech- shit like that.

My question is- is it okay for her to threaten to force me to sleep in the same bed as her? I'm 17 in two months, I've made it clear that being touched makes me uncomfortable and that I prefer to be alone, and yet she's threatening me with sleeping in the same bed as her. Is this a toxic behavior or just- outright weird? I can't tell if it is or if I'm saying it is bc she's the one person who can make me feel like I am now (which is crying and waiting for someone ik to respond to me so I can rant) after five minutes of talking.",08Dec2020,1

I couldn't cope with covid uni as I was locked down in my halls almost immediately and had to defer. So now I'm on an impromptu gap year and my sense of purposelessness has gotten so bad. I really don't know what to do with my life.

I have a few friends from school but generally we drifted apart over the years so there's only a few people I'm close to. My ex had been my best friend for years but we had a bad breakup earlier this year. It's good to see my friends having a great time at uni but I just feel so alone and like I'm watching my life pass me by. I'm quite socially anxious so making new friends is already pretty hard, but covid has basically ruled that out. I'm not really sure how to make friends online.

669,"I’m new to Reddit and posting this because I feel like I have literally no clue what to do anymore. 

When covid hit in March I (23f) lost my job and had to move home with my parents (both in their early 50s) and younger siblings (21f and 18m). For most of my childhood my dad traveled for work, both in the US and overseas, so he was never home for more than a few weeks at a time. When everything shut down so did most of his work and traveling, so this summer was the longest in recent memory that he’s ever been around the whole family. I’ve always sort of known/suspected that he has some alcohol problems, addiction runs rampant in his family, but things got absolutely out of hand this summer. He started buying alcohol and hiding it, he was doing these manic workouts where he’d skate for like 4 hours at a time, he’d get into screaming fits with my family at any arbitrary thing that we’d do or say, and being around him felt like we were constantly walking on eggshells. 

Everything came to a head when I was out of town visiting my bf. We’d had a few weeks of explosive behavior from him when trying to confront him about what was going on prior to this. Then my dad went to visit his mom for a few days as she’s sick. While there he went on a drinking bender, drove the four hours home, probably still drunk, and then went for another manic workout. While out he fell off his bike and shattered his collarbone. However my mom thinks he may have done this intentionally, which wouldn’t surprise me. 

After this he did go to therapy and to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with ADHD, which seemed weird to me since it at least seemed like there are some symptoms of depression, narcissism, and maybe bipolar or bpd there. He has also stopped going to therapy after about 3 sessions and only calls the psych to get prescription refills. 

Then right before I finally moved out my parents announced he was also moving out. Their split is definitely a good thing, my siblings and I honestly were surprised it didn’t happen sooner. But now everything’s so complicated. 

When the split happened my mom was too ashamed to talk to anyone so I became the bearer of her emotional dumping. I now know so many details about their relationship from past addiction problems to infidelity to emotional abuse. And honestly it’s exhausting to hear. 

I love my mom and am very close to her but every time she calls it’s to disclose another horrible interaction with my dad. And I’m so angry at my dad but don’t feel like I can adequately express that or cut him off because he’s clearly mentally unstable and I’m also worried about losing him.

672,"I'm not sure if I should feel bad or not. Before questions are asked regarding said ex, he is now out of my home and I'm no longer working on things with him. 

So, I'm one of the many people who can sense when something is up or off. I also have this irritating ability to pin-point exactly where and who it is coming from (pertains to this case), regardless if I know them personally or not. 

My ex split up with me 2 months ago. It was over a fight regarding finances (he liked spending until we were broke, I save every single bit of extra cash I have). So, he was breaking the bank. I lost my shit. He broke up with me. I was broken. Still am, if I'm being honest. However, we decided to ""work on things"". Meaning he still lived in my home, slept in my bed and fucked me every night. 

I'm not sure what sparked it but I had this insane gut wrenching feeling one day that he was fucking someone else. I had no proof, aside from his slightly off behavior. It wasnt even major. He just spent a little extra time on his phone and was starting to go out every other night. But, hes always been extremely social and has a huge friend group so this (while it had been rare due to the virus) wasnt necessarily uncommon. As I said, I just had a sneaking suspicion. If that weren't enough, I had a suspicion that it was this girl named Katrina that I have never met or laid eyes on in person. He wasnt even friends with her, though he knew her in HS but somehow I just knew. 

So, weeks go by and the feeling is still there. Behavior gets worse. He starts locking the door when he is in the shower/bathroom which he never did before. One day I unlocked the door with a knife because I had to pee and he wasnt answering the door and I caught him jerking off to someone's nude/masturbation video on snapchat. A girlfriend came over that night and I tell her that I think Chris is fucking Katrina (her cousin) and she tries assuring me that Katrina wouldnt go there because Chris isnt her type (she prefers the ""I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up"" guys, whereas Chris is a hick). She then tells me that Katrina has Chlamydia and that she is fucking someone named Isaiah, whom she gave it to. But because of this she supposedly wasnt sleeping with anyone else. 

Needless to say I didnt believe for one second that this girl wasnt fucking Chris. So, that night when Chris came home, I nonchalantly said ""Yeah so Beth was here earlier and told me that her cousin Katrina has Chlamydia and has apparently given it to people."" Now, despite never discussing this girl, he knows exactly who I am talking about because him and Beth were best friends and he knows that Katrina is her cousin. That's how I sparked a friendship with Beth.

His face immediately went insanely pale and all he said was ""Oh"". He then took off and was gone for several hours. The kicker(and the reason I know he was fucking her)? He came back home with a hospital bracelet on and a bandaid on his inner left arm where he was obviously poked with a needle/had blood drawn. I asked what had happened and he said he had been feeling dizzy, had a fever and was nauseous so he went in to get tested for the virus (obvious lie). For 3 days he sulked around the house and didnt leave once. Didnt try sleeping with me either (not that I would have) which is not normal for him. But on that 3rd day he gets a phone call and his ""test results"" were negative. He was right back to his normal self and immediately tried going to bed with me; which I refused.

At that point it is when I told him I knew he had been fucking Katrina and that he was absolutely fucking repulsive. As I'm talking the blood is draining from his face and hes trying to ""explain himself"". Talking about how this girl played the ""woman in distress"" card and cornered him into the act, which she apparently started. I told him that it obviously didnt matter and just the fact that he was sleeping with someone while coming home to fuck me every night made me feel dirty. I got tested. It's all negative. But that's not the fucking point.

I allowed him to stay for 2 weeks while he found somewhere else to go. During this time Katrina blew his phone up every single day. He never responded to her and before he left my house, blocked her off of everything with no explaination. He kept telling me it was a moment of weakness. That he had a crush on her for years and that when the opportunity arose and she grabbed his dick randomly, obviously it made him think irrationally and supposedly he knew immediately that he made a mistake and didnt sleep with her again afterwards. Her continuous harassing messages asking him what she did wrong, why he wont speak to her and telling him she fucking hates him speak a different tune to me though and I didnt believe him.

So, hes gone. I'm crushed. BUT apparently my ex went around and told everyone that Katrina has Chlamydia. Obviously it came back on me, because I'm the one who told him in the first place; not the slut who is spreading it around (no, she did not get on antibiotics to treat it). 

I'm torn between trying to give a shit that I am potentially the reason why everyone is now staying away from her and the fact that I feel both of them deserve the embarrassment for being that malicious and sneaky. Katrina knew we were working on things and that he still lived at home. She even asked if she could crash at my place with him.

It takes about 6 hours of train for us to meet, so we only meet eachother about 2 days every 2 weeks. But everything was going great until just a couple of weeks ago.

680,"So basically I (17m) have to trust that for whatever reason my girlfriend (18) took the posts of us from her social media off for “privacy” reasons. That was her reason. Sure she is a private person, but I know, gut feeling that there is something more to it. I know it, since now the ex is following her page and she just so happens to remove the posts now? Of course since I already brought it up to her I can’t say it again...that’s weak, that’s acting unsure, which is feminine.

People say actions speak louder than words..well just looking at her actions says it all. I cut my ex off and she knows that, yet on our date the ex was still texting her. The name of his set to “Bestie”. I asked about that and she said that she just forgot to change it from last time. Sure. But of course, I remained calm, and sure of myself, like there was no way she was doing anything suspicious. I acted this way when someone was trying to video call her on the same night, she told me not to worry about him and I said I wasn’t and that I don’t feel like there’s any competition. She agreed. But internally I have massive fear. She replied to his attempt to call her with “I’m with (me) right now 😭”. That emoji confuses me. 

I have an urge to call her, and inquire more, but then she’ll think I don’t trust her. I’ll come off as insecure right? So I’m trapped essentially. I have no choice but to wait. Furthermore, she said on the date she would let me know her schedule to get together. So once again, I need to wait right?

684,"TLDR I get levels of anxiety and depression from seeing attractive/sexy women on instagram, yet I am a man.

Seeing attractive women online and in person has always bothered me. I think women look so aesthetically appealing and amazing, and generally feel jealous of women in every way. I feel like they are more wonderful and kind and exciting and fun and everything.

When I see women being bad asses and showing off their body, personality, or excellent fashion on instagram I get kinda sad. I feel like a dull unsexual man. I’m aware the oveesexualizing of women is an issue, but these women are willing doing it - and it seems like fun! Idk, I’ve always had a weird relationship to my gender, my aesthetic, and my body.

I have been on a diet, and I would normally be working out but I have a shoulder injury that prevents from really working on my body. At the same time, posting about it on IG would feel strange as a man, like trying to sexualize myself would feel bizarre, and I imagine others would have a similarly confused response.

A few minutes past, and she noticed I wasn’t going to let her copy, so she said “wow this hoe won’t let me copy her what a bitch” or “you a bitch fr” she said it loud enough for me to hear, and the people sitting around us. She didn’t say my name but I knew her comment was directed at me because she was the only person that asked me if she could copy me. I just remember not saying anything because I got scared, l felt weak , I wanted to say so much stuff to hear but I couldn’t I just stayed quite. I was in shock because this was the first time something like that had happen to me. At that moment I said to myself why me I never did anything to her. I just felt like she had won because I didn’t say anything back. I ended up telling my french teacher what happen and she put me far away from her, so that she wouldn’t do anything to me. I’m currently in 10th grade and sometimes I think if I was the bigger person.",08Dec2020,1
690,"I'm hoping someone has some info on the real world differences between the G7 and G8 phones. I have watched a few videos, but I'm really just wanting to talk to someone about what to do here. 

Although there is nothing other than cosmetically wrong with the phone I have now, other than the screen, I am leaning heavily toward replacing or upgrading. 

I'm having a hard time differentiating between all the different models. There's the G7 and G8 Power, and Plus, and a few more and I don't understand what makes them different.

I'm wondering if someone has experience with the battery life on the G8 vs the G7? My g7 could go 9-10 days on a charge, until the update a few months ago, and now I get 3-4 days. 

I'm going to have to spend money on this regardless, so is it worth it battery wise to go up to the G8? I like the size of the G7,  since I have small hands, and have had no issues with the camera. I did hear the G8 camera is better, though.

Really I just want what I had with the G7 prior to the last update. I was in love with my phone then, and I'm wondering if it's possible to find that again?",08Dec2020,1
691,"Hi All, 

I have been trying to help my uncle for the last few months, didn't talk to him too often before then since he always seemed to be in a rough spot with family or any relationships. He's been doing a lot better but when he was younger he did a lot of drugs, so he sort of has arrested development of an 18-year-old. I really want to help him sort of how to understand his finances better and how to plan, since he's now a 40-something year old driving my poor grandma mad. Just blowing his money or doesn't think things through that always tend to backfire on him.

What are some helpful tools or things he could use from anyone's similar experiences? I just graduated college, so I can help him with technology (something is very bad at), but I know I am still young, so I just want to help him the best I can. He's pretty stubborn too, so I just want to do this for him so he can live his life how he wants and not stress about the family getting mad at him.

Thank you very much for any help.",08Dec2020,1
692,"I'm (28/F) truly at a loss. I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I need to get it off my chest...

I took my car to the shop a few months ago for a routine oil change and they told me my cross member was rusted out to shit. They told me it wasn't safe to drive anymore because of it.

This is a huge problem because I still owe about $3000 on the car. So I guess that means I'll have to trade it in for whatever it's worth and roll my upside-down loan remainder into a new loan.

But instead I just kind of... froze with fear? I drove my car back to my building lot and just left it there for weeks. The battery is dead now, so it won't start anymore and now I'll need to call a mechanic to come help me with that. My fiance has been letting me use his car once a week, but now he's having car troubles too and I can't even help him.

I just don't know what to do. Whenever I try to think about it I become very stressed and overwhelmed. Other people have dads who help them with stuff like this, but my dad committed suicide in 2010 because of my abusive mom. And I love my fiance, but he knows even less about this type stuff than I do. 

It's making me very depressed. It reminds me that I have nobody with life-knowledge in my life to help me through situations like this and it makes me feel alone. It makes me feel weak for not being able to take care of this myself. And it reminds me of how poor I am. Like I don't have $3000. To some people $3000 isn't a big deal at all, but to me it's a terrifying amount. I just feel fucking worthless and I don't know what to do.",08Dec2020,1

694,"A little back story: So these people they are two women inside there town house without a care in the world. So they have given us problems with there dogs in the past. They have 4 Ankle biter's(Chiwa was) Pardon my spelling i hate those dogs. And they jsut tipped the ice berg with my mom. 

Now on to the story. 

So earlier yesterday on 12/7/20 when my mom was taking my dogs out for a walk, and keep in mind we have 3 dogs 1 Akita 100-120 pound dog Bentley, Akita husky mix 90-110 pounds Blue, and our little beagle-coockerspaniel mix Bella. So she had them on a leash, and there is a rule in our complex where you must have a dog on a leash. So yeah the Girls live right in front of the dog park so one of them opens the gate and one of them hols there housed door open i would assume. And so all the dogs (Technically a pack that thinks there the boss when their under 20 pounds lol) run to the park without a leash. Tell me whats wrong with this picture. 4 dogs, in technically what is considered a pack, aggressive toward dogs, and don't give a fuck about anything but other dogs. Alright So here comes my mom pulling 200 pounds of dogs around the corner as the dogs are returning to their house, GO past their house and attack my mom, Blue(Akita husky mix), Bently(Pure bread Akita massive boi), and My mom. She was in a bad car accident back in 2012 and has a screwed up back and it was now getting better until yesterday. SO now she has a screwed up back again from having to run backwards while pulling 2 dogs, We kinda break the rule too since bella has a leash on, but she isnt holding it. Bella is a dog that will follow you wherever you go. Thats how obedient she is. So back to the her running. The dogs still going after Bentley, while hes scared not knowing whats going on. The dogs finally back off, but the damage has already been done. We cant really take them to court casue well that would be stupid. But turns out today when this was posted, Bently Got bit in the leg by one of them. Bently is a mellow, but hostile dog when he dosent know you. He loves to play, but he couldnt do anything to these dogs cause he was confused. So now we have to take Bently to the vet to see the damage that was done. Its not bad or anything, but me and my parents dont know what to do with this. Cause we are renters while they Own their house. They have no selfless ness in them. They didnt even try to help my mom. They jsut stood and watched. 

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit what can my Family do to handle this civily? and or use the law if neccesary. My idea was to somehow get their dogs taken away from them since they area agressive toward other dogs, and they dont pick their dogs poop up, and dont have them on a leash. So what can i do? or tell my parents?",08Dec2020,1
695,"So basically one of my coworkers (I consider him a friend) always comments on what I’m wearing. It’s getting to the point that it’s like 🙄. Lately he has been doing it *almost* every shift we have together (maybe like 2-3 times a week).

I wear the same few items of clothing to work in the week (I rotate between like 4-5 shirts and 2 sweaters). 
 
If I’m wearing something that’s usually not what I wear he will comment- there’s more but these are just some off the top of my head: 

Yesterday he told me “nice new sweater” and it was my first time wearing it to work. If I’m not wearing my usual sweater he will be like “what happened to your old sweater?”

I wore a new cardigan once and the next shift he was like “what happened to your new sweater, I liked it”. It’s like super awkward cause it’s like how do you respond to that lol.

And one time it was way too hot to have a sweater on (I wear long sleeves 95% of the time). I had to go to work in a short sleeved shirt and he was like “wow, you’re actually not wearing a sweater today.” I told him I was insecure about my arms (I have many bug scars on them) and he was like don’t worry you look fine. 


One time I wore a mock turtle neck (for the first time) and he made a comment about that. And when I wore all black he told me something too. Last time I kept a safety pin on my sweater cuz my button fell off and he said something about it too. 

Sometimes I’ve noticed he looks at my sweater/shirt but doesn’t comment on it and looks away when I see him looking. I know some of you might say that maybe my cleavage is showing but no. I am fully covered, I only wear shirts/sweaters that fully cover my neck down.

He’s not doing it in a perverted way but the reason I feel awkward is because I have body issues and knowing he notices my outfits is like 🙄. I just don’t like drawing any attention to myself and in general I don’t like when people point out my appearance.

701,"So I have a friend. Let's say her name is Hannah. She's an RA at a university and with the pandemic, she had to take precautions to make sure COVID does not spread into her floor. She also takes regular COVID tests to make sure she's negative. So far, only one RA (let's say his name is Sean) in her building has COVID, but Sean was quarantined so that he is no longer contagious. He had to be quarantined for two weeks inside a small room, and he could not leave unless he was going to the bathroom. Food had to be handed to him. This made Hannah really really paranoid about getting COVID, because she didn't want to be quarantined or sent home. It would be really inconvenient for her and make her life harder. 

Come Thanksgiving, she stays at her parents' place for the week. Her twin brother, who was attending university in a big city, was also staying at home, but he came home ill. He told his parents that he could not smell or taste and had cold-like symptoms - basically symptoms for COVID. However, he never got tested before he came and his entire family did not care whether he got tested or not, so I'm not 100% sure that they have COVID, but I'm pretty sure. Thanksgiving break ends and Hannah goes back to university. She hears back from her family and all of them are sick, especially her mom and dad. She immediately gets tested and the test comes back negative. That was one week ago. From then, she gets insanely sick. Her fever is well above 100 degrees F and she's been like this for the past 5 days. I've known Hannah for a long time and she's never gotten this sick in a really long time.  I urged her to tell her supervisor about her symptoms and she does - but she only tells the supervisor that she has a fever, nothing about her brother and her entire family potentially having COVID. She did what she could to treat herself, but refused to back out of any scheduling commitments, so she ended up going on a 11+ mile ruck while suffering from a high fever. After the ruck, she told me she could no longer smell or taste. 

At this point, I was URGING for her to seek help and to get retested. I thought it was really problematic how she might have COVID and isn't doing anything about it, potentially spreading it to her residents, coworkers, and friends. She argues that she felt perfectly fine when she did the ruck. She said, ""I could breathe fine during my ruck, so I shouldn't have COVID."" She also argued that there is no treatment for COVID and that seeking help would be useless. I asked her ""how bad is it going to get before you do anything about it?"" and she reiterated that there's no point in doing anything if there is no treatment. She would also say that I'm ""acting like her mom"", I'm overreacting, and that I don't understand the full situation - so right now, I'm really doubting my judgment. However, it still sounds like excuses because she does not want to be inconvenienced by being quarantined or sent back home. 

I found the email address of her supervisor and I want to email them about the situation since Hannah is keeping quiet about it. Hannah threatened me and she said she will cut me off if she loses her job and her contract because of me.  Am I overreacting? Is there a better way I should approach this situation? Is it too soon to contact her supervisor?",08Dec2020,1

Now in one month of dating and 2 months of talking, she got really attached to me and was thinking too long term, and we recently had an argument where we realized we both wanted different things and i decided i need to break up because i can’t and won’t be able to give her what she deserves and wants, so we broke up today but i feel like an asshole, she wanted to try to make it work, but i don’t think i could or i would be able to.

Later when we were having a talk about sex I noticed how uncomfortable she was getting and I kinda saw where things were going. She admitted that she had anal sex at 15 (about 3 months away from 16) with an 18 year old. Apparently the reason she lied was fear of being judged. This, to say the least, shocked me. The first thing I wanted to know was why the hell anal at THAT age and BEFORE vaginal? She told me she was ""saving"" her virginity (yeah, stupid, anal is way bigger than vaginal and she didn't save absolutely anything, just made it 10 times worse, she's never had vaginal). When I asked for an explanation, she said it was only once, lasted about 2-3 minutes and she cut it out due to it being a painful experience. I am in shock. First of all, a 15 year old, dating an 18 year old, like, what? This is wrong on so many levels! And the guy was definitely a creep for even CONSIDERING dating a 15 year old, let alone having sex. I get it, they loved and cared about each other, but really? That's just so ugly from my perspective. Second, I always thought that ANY type of dating, let alone sexual intercourse, between  anyone under 16 years old and anyone over 18 years old (it's not the age difference, it's the different periods) was utterly morally wrong (not to mention illegal). I've also always been quite prejudiced against girls who date ""older guys"", specifically underage kids who don't know absolutely anything about life and live with their stupid idea that 'older guys treat girls better' (if only they knew how manipulative older guys can be on underage girls; why the hell would you SPECIFICALLY look for older? maybe check out the personality first?).

I love her a lot but knowing what she did in the past, the age, the age difference, the action itself, is making me feel incredibly frustrated and seriously makes me question her values and it makes me feel like her 'worth' is lower (I'm not saying it should make me feel like that, but it does).

I don’t say abuse as in “she made me work instead of playing on my phone I hate her” it’s more like she would call me &amp; my coworkers stupid, the r slur, insulted my appearance, and would straight up lie about things I would do (ex: accused me specifically of spilling tea all over the printers when I don’t even drink it). I admit I got really fed up with it all and told her I wanted to quit and just left that day. 

My last check from that job came in and it was half of rent (rent is $600 and my check was about $300) but I also need groceries, pay utilities, etc. I landed a new job that I enjoy but for the first two weeks I was only scheduled for a total of 3 shifts due to the schedule already being made and such. I don’t know what to do, I would sign up for Uber/Favor but I don’t own a car. I would be super down to just work at like McDonalds or something for a little while but I need a job super fast and I know most jobs require a background check and stuff.

723,So I'm a 16-year-old girl living with my mother. My mother is mentally unstable and therefore I can't ask her for advice as I'm taking care of her about the same as she is taking care of me. My father is also out of the picture as he was never fit for having children and would unintentionally physically hurt me while also keep on degrading me. Now I can't ask any of my siblings' eighter as they will report straight back to my mother. I'm on the autism spectrum. Most of the time I don't feel. I look back at when I was 3 and remember all the things I used to feel but now I just don't. I was at one point getting bullied for it. I hallucinate all the time and constantly feel like every think I do is being monitored and judged. I want to know is there something wrong with me and if there is how do I proceed?,08Dec2020,1
724,"Hi Reddit! So I am writing this because I am genuinely clueless. This is also my first post, still not sure how reddit works so I hope this goes through.  


 I\[21F\] have been living with my dad\[63M\] and my sister\[17F\]. I am a full-time student in university as well as managing three part-time jobs. As the oldest, a lot of the domestic and financial responsibilities fall on me. I am basically tasked with managing the house(cooking, cleaning, maintenance, paying bills) and I just don't know what to do. My dad, love him dearly, is not great at managing finances or at saving, so many of the big expenses fall on me.

728,"I’m honestly needed a place to vent for my stress for this exam I have in two days. Its finals week for most college students, however with this final I have I have never been so stressed and scared to take it. Im taking Financial Derivatives and it was split into two sections with two professors. In the first section I did really well, I got an 8-10 on my quiz and a 85-100 on my midterm. But this second section has been so brutal. I pretty much failed my second quiz, and now I have the exam on Thursday at 7:30am. The funny thing is in order to do the calculations you pretty much have to understand the concepts, but I’ve been doing the calculations with ease, but conceptually wise, I have no idea what the hell is going on. On my quiz, all of the calculation base problems I got correct, but the conceptual questions being T or F or pick the right answer, I got ever single one of them wrong. So honestly I’m here for some advice and test taking tips, specifically trying to understand concepts, because literally every time I try to studying for the concepts in this class, its like they enter on side of my head and go out the other way. I emailed my professor and he told me the exam would be half and half of calculations and conceptual stuff, so thats why I am freaking out some much. It’s 35 questions and we have a full 2 hours and 15 mins which gives me plenty of time, but I’m just completely freaking out about this. I also find it kinda funny how in my other class “Real Estate Finance &amp; Investments” there is a topic exactly what we learned in derivatives, and I completely understand it in the real estate class, but when it comes to derivatives, I have no idea, its like my mind goes completely blank. I really just need some advice on how to actually study because I really don’t have a great method in studying conceptual parts. I make flashcards on Quizlet which actually really help me for my other classes, but for derivatives I honestly feel like I just confuse myself even more.

730,"short version: my bff wanted me to choose between her and my crush. I told her I would choose her if she gave me some time to explain everything to the guy. at first she was okay with it but then she just ended the friendship. that happened in December 2019/January 2020, so should I apologise to her or not? I do still miss our friendship as we were extremely close and had somewhat of a soulmate connection...

okay so this might be a longer one...
2 years ago I met my literal soulmate in the form of my best friend. we used to spend everyday together and when we weren’t hanging out we would be texting constantly. we literally had the same thoughts, same humor and could talk about anything. 
we also were in a group of friends with 5 guys and 3 other girls.
a few months pass two guys in the friend group (I’ll call them Nick and Tony) had a huge fallout and the friend group kinda split. 
at first my bf and I were hanging out with both sides of the group, as we weren’t really involved in the drama but then tony started to say things about nick. tony told my bf that nick used to talk bad about her, when he didn’t really knew us. he supposedly used to say that my bf was really loud and sometimes a bit annoying (which tbh was kinda true, especially when she was drunk). so for a few weeks we only hung out with tony and the other guys in that group. but then nick hit us up and told us that tony was lying and on that night tony and my bf also had a fallout, where he called her a “whore” and hit her. so following that we obviously hung out with nick again. and as it happens we both started to develop feelings for nick, without each other knowing. everything seemed to be fine until my bf texted me one day, that she made up with tony and told me that she hated nick and I wasn’t allowed to hang out with him anymore. of course I was like “I’ll try” and that evening we told each other that we actually had a crush on nick but she said she wouldn’t act on it, as she doesn’t want anything to do with him anymore. i knew that nick had some mental problems and wasn’t really feeling good at that time, so I told my bf I couldn’t just throw the friendship with nick away. then she said the worst thing a friend could possibly say...”you will have to choose between me and nick”. I told her that I needed at least a few days to explain to nick why we couldn’t hang out anymore and make sure that he would be fine and at first my bf seemed to be fine with it, but only a few hours later she texted me and told me that I didn’t need to choose between them anymore because she didn’t want to be friends with me anymore, as I am a backstabbing bitch and didn’t choose her. 

On the one hand I can understand where she’s coming from, as she really thought that nick was talking shit about her and she was mad for me still hanging out with him, but on the other hand I think she shouldn’t have been mad as I did say I would end the friendship with him if she only gave me some more time. 

Just to let you know, this has all happened last year in December/January this year. So should I apologise for my behaviour? Is it too late? 
I do really miss her, as she was the closest friend I have ever had.

736,"Hello there r/Advice,

*I posted this on r/EngineeringStudents but figured I can expand the potential pool of sources.*

I don't know where to start, but I guess let me give you a bit of back story.

When I first moved to the US, I didn't have to confidence to go into engineering because of multiple factors - mainly I was afraid of the culture shock moving from my home country to here and the lack of support as my friends and family are half-way across the world; however, I've always wanted to get into engineering and wanted to be an Industrial/Systems Engineer. I went to a Science High School, got good grades, and have always been mathematically inclined.

Due to my lack of confidence and loss of support, I decided the closest I can get to Industrial Engineering albeit not as intense would be to study Operations Management. Dealing with the same topics of logistics, process improvement, and lean six sigma.

Fast forward to now, I obtained my UG in Operations Management and actually got into a MS program in Industrial/Systems Engineering; however, my fear is that when I finish this program, it will be meaningless when I try to find a career in the field as my program in Systems Engineering do not necessarily have any hardcore coursework related to the physical sciences and I found that all job requirements I've seen so far need me to have integral calculus level courses in statics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, strain/stress, etc.

I guess I would like to know your thoughts and suggestions... did I just waste my time?

Thank you in advance.",08Dec2020,1

I'm new to this sub, but I desperately need advice!

I should also mention I have never had a roommate for very long (1 semester in college was the longest).

741,"I’m 23 years old and I haven’t been to a doctor since I was probably in 7th grade. 

I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but since I was 13 my mind has been flooded with intrusive thoughts every second of the day and I’ve been experiencing bizarre scenarios involving hallucinations that I’m hoping is just hallucinations for the past 7 years. 

The reason I’m confident it’s only hallucinations is because I moved out of state 2 years ago and a man wearing a black hoodie would always walk around my old house at odd hours of the night. I would tell my mom and after frustrating police officers she told me to ignore it because it was my mind playing tricks on me. We installed security cameras and when I saw him again he wouldn’t appear over the feed so I felt relieved it wasn’t real. When I moved into my new place I noticed he was there again and there’s no way if he was real he could have literally followed me across the country and would continue to do it right?I’m not convinced. I try to fight it by watching him from every window. Once he completes his few laps and sometimes this goes on for a good hour, he’ll go behind the complex and disappear in the darkness and I won’t notice him anymore. I’ll wait for 5 minutes, then turn on the TV to distract myself and attempt to fall back asleep. 

I’m terrified because I really don’t know what’s genuinely “real” anymore, like I stated earlier I moved out and haven’t contacted my family or friends since then due to the fact that I feel like a burden to them and they believe I’m insane.

I currently work as a night stocker, there’s this really nice girl I worked with and I considered a friend even though we only could talk about an hour every other day. She quit I’m assuming a few weeks ago but nobody ever mentions her and I’m convinced she exists but I constantly debate whether she was real or not. She never told me her name nor did she ever wear a name tag though I’m assuming that because she’d usually be clocking out and wearing different clothes. Even then during lunch, I wouldn’t spot her anywhere and I wanted to ask a coworker but I was afraid I’d get fired for coming off as a freak. I question myself if anyone I’ve recently spoken with is actually there or is it my mind. 

The most bizarre and bothersome hallucination I deal with is distant frequencies and radio stations. It’s been happening for over a decade and has gotten worse in recent years. It only happens at night. I will hear a radio station that sounds like it’s on from literal miles away. Last year, I heard what sounded like a talk show on a radio station, I could hear the conversation but couldn’t make out what they were saying. I left to drive around 4 in the morning to find out where it was coming from, the further I drove the further away it got. Since that night I’ve made it a routine to find out where it’s coming from, I’ve noticed a pattern that it begins around 3:45-4:15 AM and ends around 5:00-5:15AM. I’ve driven who knows how many hours trying to find the source of the station and it’s honestly killing me because no matter how loud I blast music or focus on the TV or whatever I’m reading I hear it being played. This occurs about once or twice every few months. 

All of this is painfully exhausting and I luckily have never experienced suicidal ideation, the unknown and dream I have keep me going but every day gets worse. I deal with nonstop panic attacks and delusions that I battle every moment I take a breath. 

I’m afraid unloading all of this on a psychiatrist will force them to lock me in a mental institution and I that I will never be psychically free again.",08Dec2020,1

I tried going back again in January but I could barely walk around campus so I came home. I then tried to go back in August, but unfortunately my father passed away and I missed the deadline. :///

I want to go back again in January. I want to get a college education, and be able to have me and my mom live comfortably. I’ve been lonely, and want to go back and make friends—but there’s one problem. I don’t know if it’s a good idea?

Here’s some context.

Throughout high school I sealed with Bipolar Depression, and ended up dropping out and going back to school a few times. I gained weight throughout my college career and had racked my pounds into the hundreds. Due to this I became even more depressed and gave up on school.

I finally went back in 2018, and was able to graduate last year!! Unfortunately despite my accomplishments my family has little faith in me.

Despite me having fasfa, and scholarships from the Indian agency. My family (well mostly my uncle and aunt) don’t believe I’ll ever make it.

I admit I did miss my mom a lot and ended up coming home the first time, and the second time I was embarrassed because it was hard to get around campus ://

I did have a few mishaps while at college. One my aunt (who used to work there) tried to get my classes dropped without my permission, and it really made me upset, and the other was I was a little lonely because I didn’t really make any friends.

I want to try again! I want to go back in January, and study art—but idk because of my uncle telling me I’ll never make it I’m starting to believe him.

I was never studious and got in by the skin of my teeth after studying for the SATs for ever (at the time I found passion for biology and wanted to turn things around and get into a good school). But I have no passion and every career path through college I research just is boring to me.

At the same time I am super pumped about the prospects of becoming a Real Estate Agent. I am starting the licensure course right after I finish finals week and hope to begin that path soon. I also have interest in starting a small service business, as I have done so before but in a field I dislike. But interest for schooling that leads me nowhere I am excited about? Zilch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am maintaining decent grades but it is painful when I don't know what I want. I am certain I can get stellar grades if I were chasing a path I like, so I want to take a harmless gap year to explore my two options I discussed before. If I decide I do want to go to school instead, I could return with the same credits and fin aid package next year, no harm no foul, and I could actually go to school since COVID should be over by then, if thats what I choose to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think this gap year idea is great, the problem is my PARENTS. They are open to my brothers doing whatever they want, trade school, etc, but when it comes to their eldest son, they want me to simply go to college no questions asked without regard for what I think. I believe it is because they are so excited I did well on the SATs and got into a good school, and want to continue gloating about their high-achieving and miserable little star student. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse I am living in a goddam living room downstairs because I was ""supposed to leave for college"" as my brothers and even parents say to me. I saved 8k for them (they are paying for my college as of now which makes it even more complicated) by staying home since my college is tiny and has MASSIVE COVID restrictions which I want zero part of. My younger brother took over my room since I was going to leave for college and he routinely treats me like shit. In fact, everyone does sometimes. As much as I love them, I don't need a carpenter and a schoolteacher throwing shade at me for deciding to become an agent or entrepreneur...

&amp;#x200B;

I am certain that even if I go against their will and take a gap year I would be allowed to stay in this household for free, but even if I were booted I have a car, macbook worth 2k, bunch of other valuables, 4k in stocks, 2.5k cash, and I worst comes to worse I can live in my grandmother's free tiny house for free or rent cheap and work a part time job. Again I would seriously consider a return to the same school next year if things don't work out.

It's not like I'm holding it back either; If I try hard enough, I can make myself cry, but it rarely occurs naturally.

For example, I lost my dog a few days ago. In the days leading up, I cried a ton because of the fear of losing her, and I cried when she suddenly passed with no warning due to the shock of it all. It's been two days and the rest of my family is still a wreck, and I, despite probably having been the closest to her, appear to be fine from an outside view. I'm insanely sad, I'm thinking about her constantly and wishing she were still here, but for some reason, I'm not crying.

Does anyone else have this issue? Is there a way I can show people I really do care despite my lack of tears? Should I seek help for this?",08Dec2020,1

theres this guy i like, we don’t know each other very well but we talk some and have plans to hang out.

i was searching up his instagram today on my laptop and came across his reddit (which is under the same username). and i read a lot of stuff on it, and i really wish i hadn’t because he shared some personal things about his life on it and i feel so guilty for keeping on reading. i eventually stopped but the posts i saw were clearly personal and i feel so bad about finding them. i really do like him and he’s a great guy, but i would feel guilty talking to him and pretending i didn’t see any of that. but we also aren’t close enough to where i can honestly tell him that i found his reddit and read some posts. 

if we were to keep talking, i would definitely eventually tell him- i couldn’t not. i don’t know if i should just stop pursuing anything with him and slowly drift away or if i should continue talking to him. if the latter, i don’t know when i would tell him.

i’m not a dishonest person and i feel really bad about this. i don’t know what to do, any advice would be appreciated.",08Dec2020,1

760,"Guys, I need advice on how to treat the situation that I’m in

I’m F(20) and my bf is M(20). He’s going to write his side of his story, but heres my POV of what’s happening. Me and my bf have been together for 2 years. He’s done some shady stuff in the beginning of the relationship and middle by talking to other girls behind my back. I have no problems with him talking to other girls, but I didn’t know any of these girls that he was with and he constantly lies to me when he does. But I really do love him and thought it was beginning of the relationship that I should let it go. After that has happened, he has been showing love by being together with me, calling me, texting me. And now he stays with me in my house. He does have a job in Postmates but he’s always go at night. My trust is hella low for him, and I made sure to voice my concerns with him of whatever makes me uncomfortable. 
He would just shower me with words saying he’s not doing anything and that he’s with me 24/7 and that he loves me. But the problem was never fixed. He normally hid his phone and I never get the chance to know anything about what’s in there, nor does he tell me where’s he’s going. I felt as if if someone truly loved me and know how I felt with transparency and trust, they’d do anything. And I do understand he does need his privacy, but my trust with him is on the line. I’ve already been through the route of blindly trusting in his words but it would always backlash on me and I’m the one hurt. And now it’s gotten to the point where I found out he was with another girl from 1am to 6pm and he just told me he was “driving around.” I was hurt. It wasn’t the fact that he was with her, but the fact he lied again. So when I sat him down to have a serious talk with him about how much trust and transparency is for me again he just does the same thing, talking with words and there’s no action or effort for it. So I asked if I could have his location and if I wanted to I could use his phone whenever, he kept brushing it off telling me he can’t do it because it’s his privacy and he doesn’t want to show me of what’s inside his phone. It just hurts at this point and I decided to take a break from the relationship. He didn’t want to leave and go to his dads bc it was late at night. But I told him to go home, bc his dad is going to open the door and he just need to make up excuses. 
He doesn’t want to leave and I packed his stuff outside. He left. But Turns out, he went back to the same girls house that he hanged out with and he told me that he told them I kicked him out. He didn’t tell them the truth that he lied to me and I kicked him out bc of that. I’m just hurt at this point and eventually he came back to my house bc he doesn’t want to take a shower there and he doesn’t want to sleep there. So me being nice, I was like fine. We talked some more last night, and he understood what I wanted to gain my trust in him with sharing his location and knowing is passcode. But he still doesn’t want to do that. 
I felt like all this drama that’s happening shouldn’t even happen if he just actually tried to fix what I have concerns of. I’d literally would have trusted him more. But now, I don’t know what to do. He wants to stay for two days, and I don’t even know if I could trust him on the break. It’s just heartbreaking that the twos years I’ve spent loving him, defending him, and making sure that he’s happy is torn apart bc he doesn’t want to cooperate in gaining my trust back. Instead he just wants to tell me where’s he’s going and just being with me 24/7 to prove that I could trust him. But behind the phone he could be msging other girls behind my back and that’s what makes it hard for me. What should I do?",08Dec2020,1
761,"I f (14), my sister f (13)

Yesterday I felt that something was possibly going on with my sister. I saw a glimpse of her right hand, scratches on it. She usually wears a glove on it like a goof. Before she put the glove back on I asked her what happened to her hand. She told me it was markers and stuff. Though I was suspicious, I wondered if it was our cat who likes to scratch or if... it was self inflicted. Later in the day my mom asked about the bandaid on my sisters right hand, that sticks out from under her glove. She told her it was the cat. Odd she told me and my mom two different explanations of what was going on with her right hand. I can’t exactly prove this unless I saw her hand again.

Also a few days ago I noticed she was writing something that seemed odd in her sketch pad. It looked like she had written all over the page, crossed her writing out and kept writing over it. That seemed off. I did something I’m not necessarily proud of, I looked in her sketchbook and discovered the page that she had been writing on the other day and took a picture. To my horror I could make out: Pain, die, I am slowly killing myself, dead, at this point I’m better off dead, what did I do wrong?

764,"TL,DR: Not racist neighbor has an absolute obsession with the confederate flag, and I don’t want to be associated with that trashy shit. But they are decent neighbors and I want to do this peacefully. 

This has been an actual problem my whole life, and I’ve racked my brain trying to find a solution. We share a driveway with our neighbor, and their house is to the side of and a bit behind ours. Since before my parents even moved into this house he’s marked the end of the driveway with a confederate flag on a tree branch stuck into the ground like a pole. In front of our house, because that’s where the shared driveway is and it is technically his land. 

He’s anti government. That’s why he likes the “rebel flag”. That’s as far as it goes for him. But that’s not the symbology for most people that see it. It’s a reminder of painful, stupid times and of the people clinging to them. Or “yeehaw I don’t like brown people.”

As I’ve gotten older, and learned more of the world seeing that damn thing out our window makes me sicker and more embarrassed by the day. They are also some of our only good neighbors (the other ones are either drug addicts, or threatened to kill most of my pets on multiple occasions). I’ll take trashy over crazy and dangerous. We need to move. But that’s not happening any time soon. 

My plan right now is as follows: tell him that people have been assuming the flag is ours and that “nowadays” it’s dangerous. (Both are true). Stress I respect his right to express himself, but suggest that the flag be something that represents both households. Or, if he doesn’t want a single compromise flag, ask for us to have our own flag next to it, with house numbers on the poles. He’s very much “if someone has a problem with me, they can come tell me”. Since this is my scheme, I will offer to fund it. 

I don’t want to look at that ugly rag at all. Their property is an absolute utopia for wild birds and they are kind, gentle people. A big garden flag would fit the vibe all around. But. Ugh. What does reddit think?",08Dec2020,1

768,"Been with my BF for over 2 years. When we're good, so maybe 65% of the time, we're great. We haven't seen much of each other since March, I moved back in with my parents as my college went online then. We live an hour apart now. I've gone weeks at a time without seeing him. It hurt so much not seeing him everyday during the first lockdown in early April-early June but he got on my nerves way more after hanging out a few times after those 9 weeks apart. His untreated mental illness got so much worse and he was unloading on me everyday again whether it was over the phone or in person (I was seeing him 2/3 days a week after lockdown). By July/ August I was miserable. I had cried over some of the things he said. The illness made him doubt if I'm pretty/popular enough/if he was settling/ if its my fault he's ill, among intrusive thoughts/images that spooked me.I felt like life would've been so much easier if I'd just left 7/8 months in when his mental health first nosedived like this, even if we had a pretty great 8 months after that first episode. I wouldn't feel so committed. He kept saying he would get help and would stop using me like a therapist but it keeps coming back. I didn't think we'd be having the same problems 18 months later. 

 Since August I've kept worrying that this is as good as it gets, that I may as well settle as he loves me and is amazing when he feels normal, so 2/3 of the time. I feel so overwhelmed with almost daily worry that he is wrong for me. I'm just exhausted and barely want to talk to him. Even texting back feels boring and takes effort.  We meet for 2/3 hours a week for a walk (we're in another lockdown) and I enjoy myself then but little things bother me now. I was so sure he would get help especially after all my begging and crying and saying how much what it made him say hurt me. I really though that we would be married in 7 years and look back at this crappy year and laugh. I feel sad knowing I might never orgasm if he is the one for me. I really haven't wanted sex since July.  I feel like I love him still and would hate to walk away but I don't feel in love, not for months.

776,"Hi, so I might of fucked up at work. It involves a stupid crush so if you dont want to read on you don't have to. Because honestly, I think this whole situation is stupid but it's gone on for a whole year and honestly it's just getting worst. No one is really doing anything and I feel like its affecting my mental. I've asked friends for advice but they tend to not really give proper advice and it seems nothing is working so I'm here to kinda get a different perspective because why the fuck not.

BACKSTORY: 

So I've been working at at this retail store for a while, I was hoping to leave after uni ended but covid has made it difficult to find a job in my field so I'm forced to stay for a while (until the world goes back to normal). 

Anyway apparently during my first year working at this store a younger guy (let's call him tim) had developed a crush on me but I didnt take it seriously because he flirts with everyone (so I thought he was joking about it because I'm not really attractive and guys usually take the piss plus he involved other guys at work as well so I thought it was a joke). So I brushed it off, ignored it and moved on. 

However, I realised it hurt his feelings as he started acting malicious towards me and the guys involved with his stunt started clowning him. Once I realised he was serious I tried to talk things out but he just became distant and started to avoid me. So, I decided to leave it alone and just move on with my life. 

Then, new employees were hired and there was a new girl. Tim would constantly flirt with her  and I thought it was cute and i assumed he got over the situation between us. I knew he still was avoiding me so I just left it alone. 

Now, I thought one of the new guys at work was cute let's call him Mike.  unfortunately other coworkers found out as I wasnt discrete about the crush mike rejected me and it didnt feel great for a while but then i moved on and accepted the rejection. 

THE PROBLEM: 

I found out that after the initial rejection mike was telling everyone how unattractive I was because of a particular physical trait I have. 

If a guy doesnt like me because of this trait it is fine I wouldnt want to force someone to be with me if they didnt find me attractive. I personally don't have a problem with this trait so i was shocked people still think like this but I'm not surprised. 

 However, every chance mike got he would constantly bash me for this trait and told everyone else that they shouldn't talk to me because of it. Now tim and all the other guys at work are constantly mentioning my trait and using it as a way to take the piss and it's usually along the lines of, I think shes  pretty but (the trait) makes her untouchable. Or shes cute but she is (insert trait here)

I don't personally want to date anyone at work at all but they keep talking about me every single chance they get. Every single move I make is a discussion and they believe everything I do is about them. 

SOLUTIONS I'VE TRIED:

I've tried talking to management but because I dont have proof. They aren't taking it seriously. (But they know they just arent doing anything about it) 

I've ignored it for a whole year but it's difficult to ignore as it's getting worst.

honestly, I dont really care about them talking shit but this has gone on for a year and a couple of months now and it's starting to affect other coworkers with similar traits and I'm starting to feel bad as this unchecked behaviour is affecting them aswell. I kinda didn't mind when it was just me but the behaviour towards this trait is getting worst.",08Dec2020,1

My parents have usually told me that they get jealous or maybe they’re having issues at home because I really never do anything wrong. I've always been a generally chill, quiet person so I don't see what I'm doing wrong. In middle school, I’d always take my ”friends” out to the movies or somewhere to hang out. I wore expensive brands sometimes (but stopped pretty quickly after some bullying that was starting to occur), this is where my parents get the jealousy thing from.

Gabe: Blames the reason he never comes anymore on me, and says I ruin everything (I start most of the arguments with him.

But today, I was talking to them and they were saying “you’re small and your eyes are small”. They have done it before but I ignored it. Guess I got fed up with it and I told them I was offended. They apologized, but  this is someone I’ve told I want to have surgery to change my eyes because I feel insecure about them and because I get comments like that.

794,"Ill have to explain a few things first. 
So idk how it's going in other countries, but in France during your last 2 years of high school you have to pass exams and the average grades you get are important bc universities will decide if you can study there or not depending on your grade. You usually have to pass these final exams with other students in an exam room, but because of covid most of them have been canceled and only the average of grades you got through the school year with regular tests will matter (for some subjects). So you basically have to keep a good average all year instead of having to pass one exam (which seemed pretty cool at first bc if you fail once you can still save your average). But the problem is that i go to a private school, where the way they rate your tests are kinda strict, for example getting a 15/20 in that school is the equivalent of getting ~18/20 in regular schools. So bc of their fucked up grading system we loose almost 3 points in our grades, and god dammit 3 points is enormous. Plus idk what the fuck is wrong with this year, but most of my classmates (me included) are getting worse and worse grades bc it just keeps getting harder and harder no matter how hard we try. We asked the teachers to be a little more indulgent on our grades bc else we wont make it but they dgaf..
The only thing they said is that it didn't rlly matter bc since the school is very well rated (1st of the department and around ~80 in the country), universities will understand that they went hard on us and that our grades are actually good. That's true for french universities for sure but idk if that's true for overseas schools (and i obv want to leave so that sucks).
I was talking about this with my mom and she said that if this keeps going i might have to change schools in order to get better grades. That made me happy at first bc i get to be in the same school as my best friend, but when i think about it im scared ill be lost there.. I dont know anyone there except my best friend, i don't know the teachers at all and i kinda like the ones i have in my actual school (except my english teacher who's a dickhead theyre all super nice).
So im rlly confused about what i should do, but im just too tired of that school. Its become too stressful, can't even enjoy my free time there bc the only 2 friends i had made there grew very different interests than mine now and im starting to get bored with them, i don't feel attached to anyone now. And they ask for so much work i cant even relax. I stay in school for 9hours a day, get home and keep working till i go to sleep. It's just tiring..

795,"Throwaway account because I don't want to make the situation worse, he already feels like everyones dismissing his claims as just crazy delusions..

Some background, a few months ago I helped someone out n RBI who was experiencing something similar. They lived nearby me so I was able to notify police to do a welfare check and he was taken to hospital. As far as i'm aware, he is doing ok now.

There was a post thanking me, so I got a bit of a rep I guess... I'm not a professional or have any real experience in mental health besides my own difficulties with anxiety. I care about people, but that's all I have to offer. 

I got a message asking me to listen to some audio, which I did and I could somewhat hear what he thought he heard; I told him as such, that I wasn't sure but did hear something. 

He's apparently spent a lot of money on private detectives and lawyers and such to find evidence that his neighbours are hacking him; which confused me, a lot, and that's where I started to get concerned. He asked me to listen to another audio clip where I definitely did not hear what he thought was there. By this point, i'm pretty sure his neighbours are just noisy and not hacking him, and the first clip was just their loud unrelated conversation in the background.

He's scared to talk to mental health professionals as he thinks they'll try to dissuade him from talking with police and law enforcement, and that his neighbours really are out to get him and spying on him. 

I don't want to tell him I'm 100% sure it's a mental health issue, as i've tried to be as gentle as possible saying that a therapist would also be able to help convince his lawyer IF they are hacking him, and that in a court case they could prove psychological distress... to maybe convince him to go to a therapist anyway.

I don't want him to think i'm ignoring him or not believing him; I believe he is experiencing everything he says, just that he might be misinterpreting, reading into or hallucinating some of it.

He's clearly scared and stressed, and needs help whichever situation is reality (even though i'm sure it's the latter.)

I don't know who he is to contact anyone who knows him or any local authorities/healthcare... what can I possibly say or do to convince him to seek help and that a health professional isn't going to be a dick to him or do anything to him against his will (he mentioned feeling suicidal but not actually wanting to go through with it, so unless he is at risk of harming himself they wouldn't do anything he didn't want.)??

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? Please he's scared and probably mentally unwell and really needs SOMEONE who can actually help him

797,"Hi all! I apologise that this may be a bit long but please bear with me because I really need advice. I (21F) am the eldest sister of 3 total kids. To kind of explain the situation, my parents have been having a lot of trouble figuring out how to deal with my middle sister (17F) and her lack of willingness to do absolutely anything but sleep and play WOW. (They don't use reddit so I'm looking for tips in their stead).

So currently, my middle sister is in her last year of high school and at the moment she's failing just about every class. She's already been taking extra classes to make up for the classes she failed last year and last semester. She didn't used to be so awful at school, she made As and Bs all throughout elementary and middle school and only in high school have her grades plummeted so far. She attributes a lot of this to some really awful teachers she had that she says ruined learning for her, and the fact that she's quite severely depressed. She was also the kind of kid who was rearing to go to college after graduating but about two years ago decided against it (much to my parent's disappointment). 

She's always been an extremely emotional child, crying at the drop of a hat or the second someone even raised their voice an octave, and she seemed to grow out of it there for a while. But recently she's kind of gone in the opposite direction where she's extremely apathetic about pretty much everything. I know she loves our family and our dogs but she doesn't really have anything she enjoys besides sleeping and playing World of Warcraft. They are legitimately her only hobbies, but I'll talk more on this later.

So she was kind of tough to deal with before quarantine, but being stuck at home without being able to see friends has been extra hard on her and has kind of exaggerated all of her pre-existing issues. 

So, most of the issues with her revolve around school. She just doesn't care whatsoever about turning work in on time (or at all). She cheats on everything, doesn't listen to her teachers when they're teaching over zoom, she's on her phone constantly during classes. She tells our parents that she's working when really she's just playing video games, she lies and says she emailed her teachers when my parents asked her to, but then if anyone checks her sent folder there is nothing there. She just puts in 0% effort. And I know that effort is an incredibly hard thing to find the motivation for when you're depressed but my parents have tried so hard to be accommodating and understanding about her situation but I feel stressed and angry for them every time I see them interact because my sister is so frustrating to deal with.

A typical days starts off with my mom having to wake her up AT LEAST 5 different times. And then my mom recently made a rule where she can't go back to her room in between classes because then she'll just go to sleep and my mom will have to wake her up at least 5 more times, but she does it anyway. She'll say she's going to the bathroom or something and then her class will start and my mom will find her sleeping again. This happens every damn day and at this point she's pretty much 10-30 minutes late to every single one of her classes. And then when she's ""in class"" she's instead either sleeping some more or playing on her phone.

As the oldest child I kinda feel bad that I set the precedent of their kids to be hardworking and motivated. I always got straight As, had a 4.0 GPA, they never had to get on me about my work and I think after dealing with my sister for so long that they've realised that not all children are the same (obviously, but they thought since we were raised together and had very supportive upbringings that we'd at least all get through school fine). 

My parents acknowledge that they weren't the best at figuring out how to motivate my sister because they simply didn't understand why she was doing so terribly in school. But theyve remedied it as best they could and try to help her with all her assignments, starting emailing her teachers for her instead sometimes, and they've even taken a few of her tests for her just so she could get a passing grade in the class and graduate on time (something they never ever EVER thought they would willingly do). Recently my mom was writing a 3 page paper for her on ""Lord of the Flies"" and my sister was supposed to be working on other assignments she was behind on simultaneously. Instead, she was playing Among Us on her phone. And this just pissed me off so much. She's behind on her work, my mom is going waaaaay beyond what she should be to help my sister graduate high school and she's just fucking around with games on her phone. IMO it's so selfish.

Now the problem with trying to confront my sister or get onto her about anything is that it's kinda impossible to punish her and make it actually work

1. It's hard to take anything away from her. Again, all she does is sleep and play WOW. And WOW is kind of the only thing in her life that brings her real happiness. Since she can't see her irl friends, she's always doing raids and talking to her online friends. My parents do ban her from WOW on occasion but they try very hard not to because they know for her it's like a lifeline.
2. If you try to get onto her at all, her excuse is that she's simply depressed. And I suffer from depression myself, but I don't use it as a weapon or an excuse to get out of doing the bare minimum. I understand there are different forms of depression and it affects everyone differently (and so do my parents), but my sister says she's depressed and then does nothing to try and help herself with it. My parents have her on medication for her depression and have been trying to encourage her to see a therapist/psychiatrist but she refuses to. She only takes the medication if she's been reminded 5+ times. She doesn't even try to remember to take it herself. 
3. If you try to take her phone away or honestly just punish her in any form she just cries and slams doors and screams that she's depressed and you shouldn't take away the things she cares about but without taking away anything there are literally no repercussions to her actions. Even when my parents do go through with a punishment, they have a big soft spot for my sister and usually get rid of the punishment within a few days (like maybe she won't be allowed on the computer for a week after failing her 10th test in a row, but then 2 days into the punishment they'll give her back those privileges).

My dad doesn't really understand mental illness at all (but he tries to be quiet and be non-judgemental when the topic is brought up). And my mom has dealt with anxiety and depression after losing both her parents, but my sister is constantly yelling at them and saying they don't understand what it's like being depressed without a cause (my mom's was her parents' death, my sister doesn't have reasons for her depression she just is. Which is valid, mind you). 

But my parents are just at a complete loss as to what to do to deal with her. My dad wants to be stricter (queue constant crying and ""i hate yous""), and my mom is just upset all the time and unsure of how to proceed. My mom's been making her nice breakfasts sometimes and trying to wake her up softly in the mornings so that my sister has a good start to her day, but to no avail. My sister refuses to help herself, and if my parents didn't stay on her ass about schoolwork (or practically do all of it for her) she would fail out of high school. My parents really want her to get a diploma because it unlocks a lot of options for her in the future, especially since she's decided not to go college. IMO they're really looking out for her and going above and beyond to make sure she's as set as she can be for life after high school but she just seems to throw it back in their faces. And she never does anything but there are also never repercussions for the way she acts because she's so hard to deal with sometimes.

And I try to give advice and mostly stay of the whole mess but I'm so tired of seeing my parents feel so stressed over my sister. I love my sister but I think she's being incredibly selfish and should at the very least TRY and help out my parents a little. They don't have to help her like they have, especially since it doesn't make her try any harder or do any extra work. She's just instead become a little more complacent. 

TL;DR:

Sister never does any work for school, is always late, on her phone, failing everything. My parents have been going above and beyond to motivate her, and get her to graduate high school on time without failing anything but it's resulted in them doing most of her schoolwork for her and her just being complacent to let them. There are no repercussions for her putting in 0% effort in school and a lot of other things her in life because if they take anything away she complains their worsening her depression and that the things they take are the only things that make her happy.

I'm sorry this is so long but any tips or advice on how to deal with her are GREATLY appreciated. I'm tired of seeing my parents stressed out over her when she does nothing to help herself. She's depressed and unmotivated and I understand that but eventually there comes a times when depression is one of many reasons and is not an excuse for treating family badly and being selfish. 

Should they just let her fail? Are my parents in the wrong here by trying to help/force her to pass high school (and I'm talking passing with Cs) when she obviously doesn't care?",08Dec2020,1
798,"I (18M) fucking hate life. Everyday just feels like it’s part of an unending cycle of monotony and suffering and I don’t want to keep with it. It feels like everything just leads to pain. My entire life I’ve always been super awkward and never able to make real friends that seem to care about me. My family life is terrible as my father lost his job when I was 10 which led to him falling into a seriously deep depression. My mom was so overwhelmed with trying to keep the family afloat that she didn’t do anything about my older sister bullying me for almost my entire childhood (I don’t talk to her anymore as it terrifies me). Eventually, my father couldn’t take it anymore and so he killed himself when I was 13. I’ve been in so much pain since then and I dont have anyone to help. My mom dismisses everything I say involving my emotions as she still blames herself for my dads death and has admitted that she doesn’t help me because she’s too scared. I feel like life has failed me but that I’ve also failed it. I can’t keep friends because I’m too clingy and scare everyone away. I’ll never be able to find a relationship and I’m not even sure I want one because I know it’ll just destroy me when it eventually ends. I know life can get better and that it takes time but I don’t even feel anything anymore so I don’t see how it could be worth it. It’s like watching a movie that starts slow.

821,"So firstly, just recently I moved out of my mom's house. My parents are divorced, and while I still love my dad, my mom's house always felt more like home. That is, until thanksgiving week of last year.
For some backstory, my grandma died when I was in 5th grade. We had been living in the lower floor of her house for a year (it's a 3 floor duplex) and since there was now a vacancy we moved to the upstairs. The house was owned by my mom and her 3 sisters, who for the sake of this, we will name after their birth order. 1, 3, and 4. So my parents split and my dad leaves the house. I'm not entirely sure when, but about 2 years ago #4 decides to move into the house with us. Everything settles down and with only a few minor issues (to be expected when you're living with other humans)
A year ago, #4 was taking a shower and the piping upstairs leaked into my bedroom while I'm at dad's for the holiday and mom is our of town visiting some relative's. My sister goes to pick up something from mom's and #4 says not to tell me. Then goes batshit at us for something we didn't do and we move out of the top floor of the house and are just on the 2nd. My mom recognizes that this is no longer a good living space and tries to sell out of the house. Nothing until very recently when #4 decides to buy all aunts out. We get the house all packed, but I'm still really sad to leave the house. It's alwaysbeen a part of my life and I'm looking for advice on how to stop the pit in my stomachthat forms as I think of how it'll never be my home again.

Second thing is just advice about girls. I recently asked out a friend and debate partner. I tried hard to not out pressure on her to say yes if she didn't want to.

828,"Hello!

In my class we're doing a Kris Kringle exchange, and I got someone I completely have no idea about.

We all wrote what we wanted on a piece of paper and our teacher photocopied it and gave everyone it, the person I got said that they wanted clothes or anything in general.

Thing is, I don't know their clothing size, and was told that it will be held on the 11th (but everyone brought gifts now, on the 9th?)

I was preparing a li-si/red envelope card. As someone who's asian, giving money is normalized on special events, but my dad (also asian) said that apparently it's rude to give out money on christmas? (the person i'm also giving the gift to is asian?)

The classmate organizing this said that it's okay to give the gifts after, but it'll be a shame if that person didn't recieve anything now.

I wrote on the li-si/red card:  
*Merry Christmas!*

*Didn't know clothing size &amp; you said you were fine with anything?*

*Hopefully this small gift is alright, if you don't like it you can tell me, I'll happily swap it out with something else!*  


Inside is a $50 note?

Does it sound bad? I think it's bad?

What gift should I get if they don't like it??",08Dec2020,1
829,"I have trouble writing at the moment so forgive me. I am very depressed and I dont think I can handle it anymore. All my life my mother was verbally, emotionally, physically abusive...I always found excuses for her till I found some articles here on reddit and found things about narcissism. 
So for start she has been hitting me as kid over grades or minor things. She can sit calmly and in the next second she can blow with rage. Once i appeared at school with blue eye because a grade B i had on math. 
She always have been very controlling. When I was younger my hair was almost till the knees and she always called it ""my hair ""and refused me to get hair cut. It got so many split ends and I had great oily problems growing up but she refused to do anything and ignored me till 2017 when I finally had hair cut but then she put me down saying I look like poodle dog .
She has told me that I have ass that is fat and jokes about my figure. I also have acne scars not many but still and she keeps pointing this out in front of me. She never liked the way I talk, walk and she never let me decide what to wear or if I should wear make up( till this year but I have finally started to answer her attacks)

She never respected my choices. I wanted to be Historian she told me I am failure for this choise but now pretty much I don't want to join university since I don't want her to give any single penny from hers money. She always tells me she gave care for me as baby so I should do all she says. 

She calls me shizophrenic when I attempt to stand for myself and also she uses all kind of names for me like h.e, b..ch, wh..re, sh.t. this isn't single time it's for years. Even today I videotaped but in my country as far as I know such tapes arent much worthy and I dont know how to prove domestic abuse .

I have boyfriend and well I want to have sex life with him and well I do sext with him and do other things too. She once hacked into my phone after I ran away from home (this year) to know details and saw I have sent him some nudes and put me down for it. I just want to feel good and he makes my life better but she always put him down saying he is scammer , asshole, idiot, evil etc and bashing him.

I have ran away 2 times this year because abusive but always come back sadly. I dont want to come back. Even today there were scandal because she told me I am failure if I dont go to university and told me she didn't beat me enough as kid hence I answer her . On top of this she once wanted me to go to psychologist with her to attempt to fix our relationship but it later turned out that this psychologist was psychiatrist that is corrupt and gives fake diagnosis to people and since then my mother treats to lock me in ward for shizophrenia even tho I dont have it.

My mother also took my ID and sabotaged my plans for work etc.

I am worried about my boyfriend because I don't want him to be sad if I do die because suicide.  Myself I am not suicidal but I feel like this is the only exit.

I was just in the background looking up words like a typical fourteen-year-old. My dad sensed the gay vibes, also may have asked my sister what queer meant out of complete other use of trying to block out his racist tirade, because it was obviously annoying us both. Which, I do recognize was a dumb decision.

When my dad brought up the topic, I was ready and excited for the drama that would ensue. Lol, nothing obviously happened only my mum softly trying to say what he was doing was not his place to judge.

Honestly, just feel like the whole situation was hilarious, bit hurt, but I'll get over it.

And for the part of getting over it, I'd love to name his fish after queer historical figures. Only have Shakespeare and O.W. (Oscar Wild) (so please do help. They're oscar fish for those who are wondering and both male, maybe names of gay couples? Also, his fish can live till twenty.

840,"Right now I'm a 19M junior college student in a computer science field. I personally have trouble finding the motivation to keep going everyday and continuing my education. I want to better myself mentally and physically but I struggle to keep my self motivated to do that as well. Covid certainly has not helped with this and school is so difficult especially when the professor don't make it any easier. I see in college life that no matter what you do you're continuously put on crunch time and there is always a deadline to meet. The hope that after college that it gets better is gone because from my point of view school is just the beginning and even if you land a good job that's basically what your life looks like forever. I see my fellow students at this point going through the motions, some are struggling others are somehow thriving from my perspective. I think to myself how are they still able to move forward, knowing that practically not much really changes in the future. How does everyone have the motivation to keep going even when they fail. I understand that people grew up with different lifestyles and that would be a part of their main drive to move forward. For me I don't think I have that, growing up I'd say I lived a pretty privileged life style despite only having a single parent. I got everything I ever wanted or needed. So I was never really pushed to do anything except for getting good grades. I have goals sure and my family does expect a lot of me but I don't have any motivation to attain my goals or meet said expectations.

841,"Hello dear redditors!

Well the title is a bit of self explainatory.

I'm a 23(m) year old student from Croatia and I want to help people! So you may ask how and why? Basically I want to help people that struggle because of the current world situation and don't have anyone to talk to or need some sort of mentor/tutor in life! 

As you can see I'm young and don't have all the wisdom of the world but I like to think that I have a really positive and improving mindset and I want to share that with people and try to help them overcome this hard time and further beyond that. 

I study Information sciences, but I love any kind of knowledge really and I might be of help in teaching younger people(younger than myself at least) some stuff because I don't mind getting engaged in new/old topics again! That being said I don't like math at all so that's a no from the start haha but all other subjects should be fine! 

I would love to help people over voice chat because I really, REALLY love to talk and to talk a lot, that being said I love to listen even more!

I have no idea how to help people with all that I said because I'm not a qualified teacher yet and I can't engage into people that fell sad because I'm not a professional in that field. I just love people and helping them, I read a lot and try to figure life out and also I watch a lot of psychology related stuff as I have a burning passion for the human mind and behavior.

842,"I want to preface this by saying I understand the times are crazy and nothing is certain with regards to the virus.

We had to postpone my sisters bachelorette trip. We rescheduled for March tentatively. She then texts me and tells me she feels the area is too much of a hotspot and we need to do local. Asks me to poll everyone.

I poll everyone and there wasn’t a date that worked for all bridesmaids. Next day she tells me to text them and see if they have suggestions for places to go, to see if we can mutually agree on a date and see if they’re ok traveling in late April obviously depending on the virus. We’d rent a house and never leave.

I text the bridesmaids and they all tell me they actually can make most dates on the poll work. There’s one date that worked for everyone so I tell them we should do that date.

I then explained how my sister suggested we go away to a beach and asked if everyone was comfortable with that or if they had other suggestions. I also said we’d basically have until 2 weeks before to evaluate and cancel but that the bride wanted something narrowed down.

I got one response saying they’re ok with going. No one else responded.

How do I respond to everyone? It’s been 2 days and no one’s responded. I thought about suggesting a local place closer to summer if we could agree on a date as I’m guessing people don’t want to travel and are afraid to say it. But my sister seems set on the beach.",08Dec2020,1

Just for extra info their is a tunnel me n my friends go to, this tunnel is quite long and has multi coloured random tiles I will add a picture if I find out how I have had Reddit for a while but never really used it.  (Ps this is on my phone)

We went to the tunnel like any other time and everything was normal until when we got in the tunnel I noticed a mosaic of buildings in the tunnel and it was quite big. I mentioned it to my friends who said it has always been their and we have talked about it before. I mentioned that it has never been their and they called me stupid and laughed it off. At the time I laughed it off but with everything else I have noticed I can’t laugh no more. 

Just the other day I noticed that I have a deck of cards in my room from my grandad who has recently passed away and last Thursday was the funeral. I got the deck out that was randomly shuffled and from it I spread out the cards. I noticed that their was no 1 of diamonds or 1 of clubs this has always been in my mind and it freaked me out now it was a ace. But also I remember a ace and a 1 being seperate cards.

He will call about things that I have absolutely no hand in and almost demand answers.

He gives little to no background and just expects me to know and I don’t ! And 90% of the time he doesn’t either! 

Last Friday I told myself I was going to try to be more patient with him. But then every day this week so far it happens. I missed one call yesterday at 4 bc I was busy doing something else and he called again at 4:15 and was like “well it is the end of the day so we have to get this stuff done now.” I’m like I’ve been on since 7:30AM where have you been!?

856,"tldr: my dad came home sick with something we don't know yet, could be COVID, could be the flu, idk. I got sick because he refused to wear a mask bc ""he couldn't breathe"" because his nose was stuffy. I told him it's his fault and that he was selfish for not wearing a mask. He claims I could've given it to him somehow (despite me not going out for 2 weeks) and that I was asymptomatic. I am rightfully angry and he's making himself the victim like he always does and is acting like i'm a bitch. How do I deal with him? btw, I wasn't nice about it in the least.

in case you want more detail:

 (sorry about the attitude and edginess I'm about to unleash here- I wrote this like,, 2 minutes after I finished the test so  I was still heated.)

Backgound: My (16 f) dad is a Mexican (64 m if that matters) lyft driver and came home with symptoms of sickness. He told us, we told him to wear a mask, and he said no because he's at home and he can't breathe. He's sleeping on the living room couch with me on another couch relatively close by because my sister is quarantining herself in the room we share from us because she was exposed to covid a week ago. Where he's stationed himself at is right next to the dinner table. 

I was in the middle of a math test and my dad came home, my mom was mentioning to him that I was feeling sick and I added in ""and it's your fault because you didn't wear a mask."" Petty, I know, but it's true isn't it? It was his fault and I'm angry that I have to deal with the consequences of his actions. All I wanted was some accountability and  I don't know, a fucking apology? The decency to wear a mask so my mom won't get sick? I'd feel bad for him if he'd taken precautions for his so-called ""loved ones"" but he didn't. Keep in mind, we told him to wear a mask nicely before this. I mentioned that now that I was feeling sick, and how I'm wearing  a mask because unlike him, I care about my family.

we then started getting into this big fight and he started saying ""oh, yeah i'm selfish, yeah I got you sick, yeah  I'm everything you say. Yeah, I'm the worst. there, now what? you happy?"" The way he said it made me feel like he was mocking me, so I told him he wasn't remorseful and that he was only saying what I wanted to hear, because he was. it wasn't genuine at all. 

more background: My family fought a lot and I have anger issues (tbh all of us do) and trauma from this + sibling decade long abuse that I endured which my parents ignored ((resolved now kinda)), so yeah I went a little overboard because he was driving me furious to the point where I got headaches. Yeah, I do have temper problems but I feel like this was justified. yeah, I'm the stereotypical girl with mommy and daddy issues. I never throw around stuff, hit people, or scream at anybody's face,- I'm not that type of anger issues.

In my eyes, he was acting like a child so I started insulting him cuz, y'know, I was angry. I don't usually do that, but I just couldn't let it go. I told him he was acting like a little kid and that he never takes responsibility, how he didn't have any common sense, how I hope I die from it so he'll finally feel some fucking remorse. Dramatic, I know, but I wanted him to feel the least bit of remorse. How I'm not going to be nice about it when he wasn't nice enough to wear a mask. 

He started bringing up scenarios that aren't really relevant, talking about ""if I wear a mask how am I supposed to eat"" and other dumbass questions that have obvious answers. he then started going after me about how ""this behavior isn't normal"" and that I needed to ""control my anger"" but I feel like I was rightfully angry at him. Keep in mind, this was all during my math test so I was kinda multitasking and even easier to tick off.  he started yelling at me to shut the fuck up because he obviously didn't have any other points to back up his claims other than deflecting. I told him ""you know that isn't an argument, right? By saying that, you're basically admitting you lost because you. are. wrong.""

he basically just repeated ""shut up"" over and over again, I mocked him because he was annoying me by repeating what he said in a dumb voice (because that's what he sounded like to me), and he just did that until he got the last word in. even after I stopped responding to him, he was like ""crazy bitch"" ""spoiled brat"" (false.) ""anger issues"" (all in Spanish) and after a while of this I told him to shut up because again, I was taking a math test (80% surprisingly, I was in a rush). He just told me to not talk to him and that he didn't care anymore and went to the backyard. He still refuses to wear a mask.

I still love my dad, but I hate him when he doesn't take responsibility. How do I deal with him?

 I know I didn't handle this the right way, but I'm so sick of him pulling shit like this.",08Dec2020,1

861,"I am needing advice to see if I am overreacting. I am obviously very sick so I may be overly irritated. 

On Monday morning I woke up very nauseous and had diarrhea. I have been at my job for 5 months and let me just say now, it’s the most unorganized places I have worked and I worked many places. The thing that blows my mind is this company is a multi million dollar company and I have worked in a different department within the company and it was so strict. This department? Ha. You only find out you’re doing something wrong when you’re getting in trouble for doing that thing wrong. Needless to say I wasn’t even sure how I was supposed to call in. In my last department we would call an attendance line. Here? Never heard of one. So I texted my boss. She texted back ok and that she hoped I felt better. We are very close, she shares things with me that she shouldn’t obviously showing how much she trusts and being that I am pretty much her assistant, she values me. As she and I are the only ones who have access to an email, so when she or I am gone the other has to multitask that email. She then texted back 10 mins later (after I am assuming she told her boss that I wasn’t coming in) that moving forward I need to call her not text. Ok noted. Around 1pm my head started hurting and I checked my temp and noticed I had a fever so I started freaking out. I just switched insurances so I haven’t gotten my info in the mail yet. I tried to find a place that does free covid testing but you needed an appointment and they closed at 4pm. I then reached back out to my boss and told her I had 9/10 symptoms of covid and that I was trying to get a test but the way it was looking I wouldn’t be able to get a test today. I work in health care and closely with clinic. She called me right away and told me her boss told her to tell me to go to this clinic right away and to let her know once I got tested. I was very sick, weak, shaky, coming out both ends, but I felt if I didn’t go I would get in trouble (I am diagnosed with anxiety, which explains why I push myself for reasons I’ve made up in my head fearing of getting in trouble) so I forced myself to drive 30 minutes away to this clinic, wait 45 mins for the test, and then drive back home during rush hour. I really shouldn’t have been driving but I couldn’t risk possibly exposing someone to drive me. I get a text later that day saying that if I tested negative I had to return to work 2 hours after I am notified by the health a safety manager working my covid case (like I said, big company so I had to open a case). This sounded bizarre to me. She then told me that it would probably take a day or two to get my results. The next morning I get a text from my boss asking how I am feeling. I let her know the same, and she responded that she is required to ask me this daily and that she isn’t trying to pry into my personal life. I didn’t text back. I then got a call from the health and safety case manager and she asked me al of the symptoms and that if I’ve been around anyone who was positive the past blah blah blah. I asked my case worker if it was true, once I am informed of my results, if negative, if I have to be at work within 2 hours of being notified. She said “I’ve NEVER heard of that..” as I guessed this is just my department making up their own rules because 1. We are severely short staffed and 2. My boss has too much work to be watching the email we share. (I am not a lead so I am not provided a laptop to work from home) I end my call with the case manager and a little while later I get a call from my boss stating that I should have called her “even though i know your situation” and she told me again about the 2 hour window if my test is negative. I told my boss that I asked my case manager about that and she had never heard of that. She then responded “well I’m just telling you what they are telling me, I’m not trying to be difficult or insensitive but this is the process”. The funny thing is, is my boss had covid and she said she felt like she was literally dying. So she knows how it feels. I have only been out a day and a half and I’ve already had my boss reach out to me that many times.. I am feeling harassed at this point. I am sick. Very sick. My throat feels like it’s made of needles and I have a fever and body aches. I don’t want to be texting and answering unnecessary calls. I feel that anything I need to know should be communicated to me through my case worker (besides me needing to call in) why do you need to ask me everyday twice a day how I am feeling? I don’t feel good, and if I did, I still can’t return to work until I get my test results. I told my boss that if my results are negative and I still have a fever I am not returning to work until I see a doctor. Just because I don’t have covid doesn’t mean I’m not contagious. My symptoms also reflect the flu and strep throat. She then went on about how I will get a write up and everything else I know will happen if I miss work. But ended it with “you gotta do what you gotta do” she is obviously very upset with me like I asked to be sick. This is why we are so short staffed, because they are threatening people to come back and then in turn spread whatever is going around at our office. Am I reaching to say I am feeling harassed? I’m am contemplating calling HR about all of this because it’s really not helping me “get rest” as they are telling me to. I’m stressing out about having covid, I feel like I’m dying and my phone keeps going off and I feel like if I don’t answer or respond I’ll be in trouble. When I’m running to the bathroom to throw up I have to grab my phone because I’m scared to miss a call, but for what? I come first. This is all over the place so I apologize for that but I have a high fever so I can’t really think straight or have the energy to fix this. Please comment your opinion. Thank you in advance.",08Dec2020,1

864,"My partner and I have homes in separate places. He lives in Brooklyn, NY and I live in Massachusetts. When the lockdown started in March, he moved in with me. My home is in the country, there's a MUCH smaller population, it's generally safer, and there's lots of beautiful nature around us. 

When the covid-level in NYC dropped to green, he started going back to NY. He misses his life there, wanted to practice with his bands, and just be in his space. 

Now, the covid-level in both locations is high again &amp; people are being asked to isolate. He's still driving to NYC and practicing with both bands. 

I worry about him bringing covid back to my home. My partner has mild asthma. My immune system is not great. I struggle with my health a lot, particularly in the past 3 years. I have a teenage son who has a complicated medical history. He is doing really well with remote school and is following all the rules. His dad is also isolating completely, and would likely be high risk. We all go to the grocery store as necessary, and get take-out sometimes, but that's it.

My partner is taking two long drives every 2 weeks, which would inevitably require stopping at a rest stop somewhere. While in NYC, he takes the subway to &amp; from band practice. Other than that, he's grocery shopping &amp; hopeully, isolating, although I know he wants to see some of the outdoor performances that are happening. I don't know if he's eating at any of the ""outdoor but indoor"" shack restaurants that are popping up all over his neighborhood.

He tells me that the subway is not crowded when he takes it into Manhattan, after rush hour. But I know he's had practices in the middle of the day, too. He says that everyone wears masks &amp; there's plenty of space to distance. I asked if the homeless people are wearing masks &amp; he says he hasn't seen any, which doesn't even make sense to me. He's good about wearing his mask, but I often have to remind him to use hand sanitizer before tearing into some snack he just bought at the grocery store. 

He really doesn't want to stop travelling to NY &amp; says he needs it for his mental health. I'm not sure what kind of line in the sand I need to draw. I feel like there's a good chance he'll get us all sick.

LPT: advice my towels stink
I've lived at my residence for 2 years now and the washing machine was already provided by the landlord. I will wash the towels and immediately dry them and they smell fine. Then I shower and as I am drying off the towel starts smelling moldy. I'm so sick of buying new towels all of the time. This went on for a long time. Then all of a sudden every single time I would use my washing machine the whole house would smell like rotten eggs/fish! So we stopped using the washer all together. Then everytime it got super hot outside the washing machine area would stink like rotten/egg fish. I know its not the actual machine because ive really cleaned it. Ive told my landlord over and over again. So finally her maintenance man said its a part to the hot water heater and he changed it out. Well the smell and stuff kept happening so then he said its the machine so I got a whole new machine. A majority of the time it doesn't smell anymore. Seems like in cooler weather my house won't smell like rotten egg/fish when using the washing machine. Its done it a couple times since I changed it out. BUT my towels still have that smell. Ive tried so many tricks. And when I'm drying off I cant stand it cause it smells so moldy. Like once the towel gets wet again it starts smelling. I'm convinced its in the pipes behind the washer but my landlord refuses to call a plumber and every plumber I call say that since a rent that the landlord has to call and set it up. Also we have had sewage leak problems in the yard. A whole busted pipe and everything. Ended up having to call the state on her and they havent fixed that correctly.

So what do I do? How do I fix this? Is it my towels? Is it the water? Is it the pipes? Any advice is much appreciated.",08Dec2020,1

My husband and I picked her and our nephew(10yo) up to go out to eat Saturday night and before we even got our food my husband got a call from a friend who was having car trouble. He decided to go help and would come back to pick us up... 
that took a lot longer than expected though and we didn’t want to hold the table up so we started ordering drinks. I hardly drink though and didn’t realize the drinks I was ordering had so much alcohol in them. (Long Island iced tea are not what they seem)

But anyways she was dying laughing looking at her phone for like 5 minutes and she kept putting it under the table and wouldn’t let me or my nephew see what she was laughing at..

She finally showed it to my nephew and he got really embarrassed, he was laughing but started looking around like he was nervous.. (we were at a round table in the middle of the restaurant lol)
I was getting mad because I wanted to freaking see it at that point.. she eventually just sent it to me anddd it was my nephew completely naked(covering his penis with his hands) ...which was honestly hilarious to me at the time.
So when she asked if she could send me funny ones I was like uhmmm if you wanna send them I wanna see them lol. 

So she just sat that for like an hour until we got picked up going through her phone with him and would send me the ones he obviously wanted me to see the least.. weird game but okay  😅
Mostly just ones of him playing naked outside when he was 5 or 6 so it wasn’t anything weird lol but some of were of him in at the playground where they live(which is something he wanted to do)

But is it normal to embarrass your kid THAT bad, or to have so many pictures like that???
I know parents like to embarrass their kids but Jesus Christ that was wild lol  i don’t have kids so i don’t know.

The first semester I said something sarcastic in the group chat directed at a friend who thought it was funny. Perhaps tactless but not in any way racist, sexist, or cruel or anything like that.

Someone (I still don't know who) reported me and I got in a lot of trouble over it. We're all coming up on graduation now and we're allowed to make a small statement about our cohort. I would like mine to be a short ""fuck you"" to whoever turned me in... but I obviously can't say that publicly. Is there a way to achieve this goal? .

I know it's petty and I'm holding a grudge blah blah blah. But I'm just not over it and I don't want to let the person off the hook. If you think I'm being immature and should drop it, you're probably right but this is how I'm feeling about it.",08Dec2020,1

871,"Heya guys! Sorry for the long post. I’ll try to break things down as easy as possible so I can get some help! 😭

Basically, I’m love sick. A few months ago I hooked up with this guy (22) from my hometown. He’s pretty much worshipped the ground I’ve walked on since high school. When we hooked up he said “omg I can’t believe that just happened” I really enjoyed myself too. I feel like the intimacy &amp; chemistry we had off the bat takes YEARS to build. 

Well, a few days later, he left bc he’d moved over 2000 miles away. I was heartbroken, but he promised I could come visit the next month. The time rolls around &amp; I decide not to visit to see him (bc our communication had not been the best) but go for a job offer. He notices I’m in town and reaches out to see me. I’m busy that day &amp; I reach out to him the following day. We make plans but he flakes. Either way, I’ve landed my dream job. I go back home &amp; move within a week. About a week after I move, he notices I’m at a popular restaurant from social media. He reaches out &amp; asks if I’m still in town. But at this point I’m asleep. By the time I read the message, he’s blocked me. Since then, he’s hit me up a couple of times that weren’t in the best case scenario. Like a booty call &amp; a LAST MINUTE invitation to a party he was throwing.

Either way, it’s been months since we’ve connected and I still have an undying feeling like there’s supposed to be more there. (I SWEAR I have a radar for this.) I am unsure about how to proceed bc I’m not a simp. I told him how I felt a little after he left town. The issue there was building a relationship from over 2,000 miles away. Now we’re less than 15 minutes. And? I don’t understand.

872,"Around April I was looking to add another dog to my family. I have been following this instagram breeder for a while and was going to purchase from her. However, the more research I did on the breeder, I decided against buying from her. She wanted to sell the puppy I inquired for $2000 plus $1000 for shipping. Her breeding dogs aren't health tested, she let's puppies go as young as 5 weeks, breeds dogs under 2yrs of age, puppies aren't checked by a vet unless she's shipping them, doesn't do contracts, states they are only for family homes, and has no clear lineage on her dogs. I can keep going on more red flags I found. So I called her out on a different platform and a decent majority of people backed her up saying there's no proof, I was looking for attention, and I was mad because she refused selling me a puppy. She also acused me of wanting to breed her dog. When I gave them proof people were just denying it, so since then I've been collecting proof of her being a byb regardless of her following. So far this year she has produced 102 puppies, has been letting them all go at 4-6 weeks, bred 3 dogs under 2yrs old. Found out she's been breeding under 2yrs old for 4yrs now.. I also found 3 people who bought from her, that started breeding her dogs, they're also under 2yrs old. Yet she has the audacity to say I wanted to ""breed the shit out her dogs.""

My fiancé has always had this thing for her in the past and even though he would joke about it in the past I found out that he was still seeking for her attention recently. Looking at fake nudes pictures of her and commenting on her Twitter post. I understand people have celebrity crushes but at some point it should be a boundary so the other person doesn’t become insecure. He was a huge fan of her which I didn’t care but just don’t make it weird.

He never made it clear to me that he wasn’t in love with her. He was really into her before we were together but I know those feelings still are there cause he has told me he fantasize about her while he masterbates which was recently. I found some things on my phone with the search history that the google account shares. I never look in his phone because there’s no reason too. 

So we’ve talked about it but it’s always in the back of my mind like “am I enough” and “why he can’t stop thinking about her”. We’ve been working on our relationship but every time her song comes on on the radio it just gets a bit awkward for me. I enjoy her music so of course I like to listen but I don’t want to make it even worse. I just play it off like it doesn’t bother me. I don’t know if he’s secretly still into her so that’s why he’s still weird about it or maybe it’s all in my head. 

I don’t follow her on Instagram or anything but I recently saw she’s getting a Netflix special and we watch Netflix a lot and I don’t want to not watch our Netflix shows because I’m sure that Netflix is going to plaster her all over for everyone to see. Every time I see her or anything that relates to her just bring up a bunch of emotions. Not sure what to do about it.

My other roommate and I discussed this and we both agree that it’s like he basically lives here (has a toothbrush, showers, again, sleeping over all the time). One thing that stands out though is that my roommate and I can’t even walk around in a sports bra (or without a bra under a t shirt), or in our bath towel. And he’s over all the time, so it feels like we can’t do anything comfortable in our home and it isn’t fair.

I asked if her we could talk tonight because I want to see if there’s some sort of compromise we can come up with.

For eight months, my boss has not let me come back to work even though the rest of the staff has been begging her and telling her they need me back although the building is closed. She has refused, says there isn’t enough for me to do if the building is closed, and left me jobless. Then two weeks ago, she asked me to come back for a few hours a week to do a time-sensitive project that, essentially, she just didn’t want to do. I agreed and have been working four hours a week. So essentially, she didn’t care that I was unemployed for eight months and then only had me come back when it directly benefited her. 

I just accepted a position in a field that I am interested in. It’s not exactly where I want to be, but it’s better. It is part time, so I could probably do both jobs. 

My dilemma is - I’m afraid that this new job is going to turn out to not be what I expect, and if I quit my current job, I am screwed. If I stayed at the current job and tried to do both, I could fall back on that if new job sucks. 
The dilemma there, however, is that I have been very unhappy at current job for basically the whole three years. 

The flip side? I make a decent amount hourly, have my own office which I love, and I’m comfortable there. 
But I feel like leaving will be an act of taking care of myself, and refusing to stick around in a shitty work environment. I’ve been taken advantage of and not treated the way I deserve to be treated for three years, so part of me wants to leave out of protest. 

I’m so torn.",08Dec2020,1

883,"I was in a bad place recently and read a Reddit post explaining the phrase.

Your wants and needs permanently come first, and everything else second. You're not supposed to care beyond your needs. Everything we do puts ourselves first in some way, and relationships are transactional.

Is it really that basic? Everyone just says and does whatever benefits them personally? It's normal and completely okay to do? From small insults to even big surprise celebrations and everything in between... Nobody cares?

Then... I can just stop caring so much? Can I stop stressing about always doing the right thing?

890,"I’ve worked at my company for about a year and a half. This is my first corporate job out of college, and our entire department consists of about 12 people. Since I’ve worked there, I’ve taken on a lot of responsibilities from people who have left (I ended up taking on an entire position’s duties on top of my own this year because they didn’t want to hire for that position again). I’m effectively juggling duties that used to take 2-3 people to complete all by myself. 

I just got back my annual review and my manager left glowing comments on every aspect and area of the review. She noted multiple times that I’m succeeding and I’ve transformed my initial position into one that is vital and encompasses a large part of our essential duties for the whole team. She said she can’t recall a single mistake I’ve made all year. 

However, when I look at the history of the review process, she made these comments and gave me a score I can no longer see. Her boss, the VP then made a comment to my boss that said something along the lines of “please re-open this and rate her lower. Will expand on this with you privately”. My rating now shows as what would be a “C” if this were a grading scale like in school. 

I have absolutely no idea what I did wrong all year. I had been told by my manager that she spoke with the VP earlier this year and they agreed to give me a new title and new pay grade, since my current entry-level job title doesn’t really reflect the work I do now. I’m super confused and nervous as to what could have possibly made them re-open this.

891,"I’m in restaurant management, and I built a solid and often rewarding career over the last ten years in various roles. The pandemic caused me to lose my job in June, and thousands of restaurants in my metro area have closed indefinitely, making it extremely difficult to find work. 

A friend I met years ago on the job, I was his trainer, reached out for my resume because his restaurant company is hiring. There’s a possibility that with my connection, and my strong resume, I could get a job offer from them. That would be great, of course, but I have a concern. See, to be successful in your role as a restaurant manager, you really have to be 100 percent head in the game, and there are so many variables, so it’s best if you really connect with the brand/concept, and feel proud of where you work. When you feel proud of where you work, you give more of yourself, you’re more dedicated, and that dedication reflects in the quality of your work, and your employees notice as well, and they often respect a hardworking boss. 

My concern is that I wouldn’t feel proud of my role in this concept. It’s a fast casual kind of place; slinging beers, wings, burgers, and there are probably 100 TV’s around the building. It’s not my vibe. I like chef driven kitchens, crafted specials menu semi daily. I like to sit with vendors to discuss new products, and know where those products come from. I like a scratch kitchen. 

I want to be clear, I’m not saying one approach is better than another, I just really adore a restaurant focused on the dining experience, and kitchen staff that takes pride in their dishes, rather than shoveling food in customers mouths while numbing their minds with TV’s everywhere. However, if this opportunity does present itself, I have to take it. I’m also worried about what this brand might look like on my resume in the chance that I might be applying for a job in a more personally desirable restaurant company someday. 

So my question is, if I am to be presented with and opportunity that I accept, how do I inspire myself in this role, and work hard to perform well, if I don’t feel proud of myself and where I work? 

Has anyone else faced something similar, how did/do you make it work?",08Dec2020,1
892,"Me and my mom are known for our bad relationship. We have a lot of problems. She’s very manipulative, rude, and just wack. I don’t know how else to describe her but all my friends call her crazy and we have a bad relationship, I can’t even be near her without getting anxious or upset. 

After some recent events, my dad said I need to stop treating them differently (I’m very nice and close with my dad) so I’ve started to try and act nicer towards her, even if it’s fake. It’s exhausting. But now I found out some information that just solidified my dislike for her and I can’t stop feeling sad about it. I was speaking to my close friend about how my mother has been acting lately and how I am feeling in general and she said “Did I ever tell you your mom talked to me about you when we were alone once?”. This made me immediately upset as this isn’t the first time i’ve heard of an instance like this, however it’s usually not about me. For example, one time she told two of my best friends when I left the room that my boyfriend (who’s wonderful and an amazing guy) made me quit modeling (my moms idea) when in reality it was all my decision. 

Turns out, my mom told my friend that she thinks i am “self destructive and bad with people due to my difficulty keeping friends”. This isn’t something a parent should said about their child, especially to their child’s friend. It hurts more considering my mother knows i’ve been bullied, sexually abused, backstabbed, and treated overall shitty by my ex-friends. She knows it’s not me, yet I guess she thinks it is me. I can’t move past this and anytime i’m around her I just want to cry. 

I don’t know how to move past this. No one in my family knows how she treats me and they think i’m rude to her for no reason, what do I do to move past this and try to act normal around her until I graduate next year?",08Dec2020,1

now the problem:

so when i picked my brothers up from school i told my brother (10m) that he needs to take the dog out which he responded to ""you can do it cause you never do!"" (he takes them out TWICE a day during the week) we argued about a bit before he decided to go take our dog out during the argument other little brother (3m) asked for some milk in his cup i asked him to wait a little bit and i would that would get it for him very soon, my older sister then comes out of her room and yells at me asking why i wont get him some milk (at that point i was starting to walk to the kitchen and get him his cup of milk, well she makes it there first and gets him milk instead and then says something about me not doing the dishes (i didn't manage to do all my chores today as i have been doing homework most of the day except for small breaks to take my dog out) so i blew up and said she could the dishes herself is she had a problem (normally if i can't get everything done before my brothers get home i try to get it done before my parents get home from work so it still gets done) she begins to start telling me not to talk to her and i interrupt with ""i don't care i don't want to talk to you!"" i admit it wasn't very nice of me to say that but all she and my brother ever do are judge me wether it's about who i am dating, my sexuality, my chores, or what i like to do or my talent, ect. they make me feel like i'm not good enough and once they make me blow up and i'm yelling and just not listening my parents take their side and don't even give me a chance to explain my side of the story. i don't know what to do to fix this i'm in my room basically hiding so that they don't start this again.",08Dec2020,1

897,"(16F) I live abroad with my mom and it's just the two of us. It's pretty expensive to live where we are and the rent for a small studio is already quite a lot. I've been dealing with depression for 3 years now and it slowly got worse when quarantine began. I never had a problem with the lockdown, in fact I am an introvert that normally spent most of my time indoors before all of this. However, the sudden shift in school wrecked me. 

All my mom cares about is bringing home good grades and not cause trouble which I've kept up with all my life even when I started experiencing symptoms of being depressed. I lost interest in my hobbies first and school was a distraction since it was easy and an escape from my room where I spend most of my time. When this school year started completely online I guess I never took it seriously but I was also progressively falling into a deep spiral of self loathing and intrusive thoughts. Recently I've come into terms with most of my emotional concerns, I don't really mind the fact that I hate myself these days and I've accepted the fact that nobody really cares and that I should just keep going on with my life. I also went ahead and asked for a therapist or something which I'm very proud of since it was something I was too prideful to do before. The one problem I can't come to terms with though is my mother.

She's emotionally immature and I feel like I have to treat her like a toddler if I don't want to piss her off or cause problems but she gets stressed so easily that the smallest things can set her off. She's quite old too so I feel like if I fall deeper into my problems, she might suffer physical consequences through stress (which has happened before but I'm afraid that the next one might be more severe). She's very delusional and thinks of me as just going through a teenage rebellion phase instead of considering the possibility of mental illness (I don't even think she believes that I can have such a thing). I already suffer from a lot of guilt and shame daily and the guilt I feel for failing to recover or at least pretend to be okay just adds on.

I really want her to see that all I want to do is get help and perhaps get on medication so it can make our lives a little easier since the main factor here is my failure to function like a normal person but she's against that and doesn't take my problems seriously yet complains that I cause too many problems and begs me to just fix it myself. I don't know if I should just put up with her so she can relax at the price of me falling deeper into the spiral I've desperately tried to get out of or stand up for myself and get the help I need at the cost of her getting challenged by things she doesn't want to face.  I would prefer the latter but I'm afraid that she wont be up for that challenge and I'll just look like a bad guy in the end. It might also cause more problems that'll just make me more miserable. I know everything we'll end with me dying young anyway. I've been suicidal for a very long time but I still have some hope left. It's very little and I feel like if this keeps escalating, I might just have to die younger than I intended.",08Dec2020,1

899,"Looking for advice here on a particular situation unfolding at work currently. I’m not directly involved, but I could end up being at some point. 

My director has discussed with my supervisor that he plans to “crack down” on our COVID exposures outside of work. Mind you we have had 3 out of probably 50 employees with an issue and one was exposed in our office by a client so that was not in our control. 

My coworkers attended a political rally and also visited a friend she has not seen in a long time. Long story short the friend texted her while she was working to tell her she had to get tested got work and she tested positive after they had hung out. She was promptly sent home to quarantine. Now my director wants to basically have a meeting with her and “ask her when she thought it was okay to go to a rally and to visit her friend” during all of this. He has not expressed interest in discussing this with any other employees who have also taken vacations, met their friends, went to bars, etc. He doesn’t like my coworker in particular and there is a double standard in other instances as well. 

My overall question though: even during a pandemic, how much control should your employer have over your personal life? Is it overreaching for my director to demand everyone stay inside and not see their friends or family for the sake of employees having to quarantine in cases where they could have been exposed? How far is too far or vice verse? Are there legal implications to what my director is doing (Pennsylvania is an at will state, but I am wondering if there are any other legal issues if anyone is well versed in Human Resources).

900,"I (17m) will be getting my second tattoo soon, this post is not about the entire topic of teens getting tattoos and regretting it. 

So, my mom is an exclusion, meaning shes the only person that ever agrees, never judges me and actually cares, my maternal side of her family, so my grand parents, great grand parents, and all my aunts uncles etc, lets just say, they think their opinion outweighs my own.

Ill admit, my great grandparents aren’t that bad, because they rather voice their opinions behind my back, my grandparents are just straight up assholes.

My grandfather constantly judges me, I’m just an average guy who goes to school, but i always get criticized by him because i don’t live life the way he did, which is hate the lgbt, hate tattoos, worship parents like a servant and spend all my free time studying and telling everyone Covid doesnt exist.

August 2019 i got a really meaningful tattoo that represented my shitty childhood, you know i live with my mom in a different part of town than my grandparents, but despite the distance, my grandfather lost his shit, he got so mad at me i was genuinely scared.

He’s a nightmare, you say you have a headache, its because of the phone, you pick up the cat to cuddle, he shouts at you to put down your own cat, you speak about any topic he doesn’t like with someone else (without him being in conversation) he tells you to stop talking about it.

Anyways, I’m keeping my tattoo appointment a secret, its none of their business to tell me what to do because of their personal views. Ill reveal the tattoo when its done on social media, they all see, although I’m really scared of everyone verbally attacking me for it when they come over, or vise versa for the holidays. 

I just wanna be happy and not afraid of what my own family has to say, i turn 18 in a few months, and i just feel like everything that makes me happy makes them hate me even more.

its really easy to say stop caring about what they say and to ignore them, because they are really intense, when you do something they hate, and your in their presence, they don’t even need to say a single word to realize they are judging you and they dislike you for it, its a really intense uncomfortable feeling that just urges you to get out of there and start crying.

I cant talk to them about this topic, not tattoos, but their behavior, they will see it as disrespect and just snap at me. They have done this to me since i was a child, thats why im writing this, because i cant not care what they say, because they judge me, and succeed in making me feel absolutely shit.",08Dec2020,1
902,"Essentially, we just received photographic evidence of him being sexually manipulative to one of his exes. This ex was fairly recent, so it’s not something that just came out of the blue. And also, we’ve always knew that he was a horny bastard, so when sex-related things were mentioned, it wasn’t that surprising it had to do with sex. It’s more surprising that he was manipulative.

This quickly spread around the friend group while keeping it secret from our abusive friend.

Then we heard more from 2 people in our friend group who said they have been sexually harassed by him as well. (Just for info reasons, we have a fairly large, close friend group maybe consisting of 10/15 people, somewhere around that.) 

Anyways, we all talked today and we decided that we are dropping him from the friend group since we don’t condone manipulation.

But the issue is that, we did this while leaving him in the dark. I am stuck in the middle of this because I am considered the mediator in the friend group, I’m the person people go to for help, and he is blowing up my phone wondering why he was removed from the groupchat. We were fairly close and he’s someone that trusted me with his feelings, so he’s trying to get help from me. 

And I dont know what to do. As far as I know, he isnt aware that everybody found out about the manipulative things he did. I want to tell him, but that is such a weight to carry, I feel as if he is going to attack me, attack others, or do something as severe as suicide.

She has recently decided that's not fair and is refusing to pay more than 330 now. It is only me and her names on the lease. She owes us $180 for utilities she hasn't paid in months. My question is, is she able to get away with paying less than agreed upon for the rent? I know it will affect my credit if the total rent is not paid, but can she just say she wants to live here and pay only 330 now?

The second relationship I had we both had such similar sex drives and he treated me so kindly both before and after and not just at the beginning of our relationship. 
I want to know for men, within relationships what is your perspective on this. 
I’ve always been well able to talk about sex and discuss it in a healthy way and I know compromise is important I’m just concerned after my ex lied to me and continued to behave that way after I asked if we could come to a decision together on how to handle it.

I'm a 29 year old man. I have a wonderful 5 year old son, and a job caring for seniors around my town. 
But I feel like my life is nothing like how I wanted it to be. 

5 years ago my wife and I separated, which hurt a lot, but we move on. I had to move back in with my mum so I could have a home, and some help learning how to raise a baby. I took to marijuana to help ease the pain and self-loathing, though still managed to complete 1 diploma and am working on a 2nd. 
Now I'm still living at home, and my son is nearly starting school. 

I've been single for 5 years (not for lack of trying), can't afford to move out, as house prices are insane in my area (i.e. $300 a week for a 2 room flat), and my son recently has started acting quite defiant and angry which has his kinder teachers (and his mum and I) very worried. I'm terrified that my best parenting efforts are failing, and my son is paying the price. 
My friends are all in other places now, living lives that I wish I had. Independent, self-sufficient, and successful. Same goes for my brother. 

It's all just starting to feel like too much. I've tried my best so far and every step forward seems to blow up in my face. I can't see it getting any better.

932,"Okay so, I've long had suspicions of Adhd, but my mother refuses to acknowledge them and has said ""You don't have ADHD, if anything your brother has it, why do you always have to play the victim"" (I never specifically said I think I have ADHD but I was complaining about not being able to focus and trying to describe it. That is what her mind jumped to) for context shes also said no you don't have it the neurologist said you dont and it was just your teachers. I had a lot of bad teachers and I never paid attention and sucked at transitioning to do different things. 

However, its been 5 years and I've had really great teachers and I still don't transition well, I still have arguably worse (it feels that way) attention span, I've zoned out for hours, I hyperfocus on things, and I'm just so sick of it. I *want* to pay attention but no matter how hard I try I simply can't. Sometimes ill be so hyperfocused I *will not hear someone*. Even if I don't have it it's not normal to do these things, and something else might come up and we can get to the root of the problem. 

I recently (like a month or so ago) started therapy with this intern because I had recently lost all my friends, was/am failing all my classes, and generally depressed. Now my mother wants to talk to my therapist, see if there's anything she can do and stuff like that, generally wanting to know what's going on. My therapist told her she would talk with me about it. I personally don't want my mom to know anything and I want her to but out, but if I say this my mom is going to know it's me that doesn't want her to know and may force me to spill it anyways. If I give consent then that's something Im not comfortable with and this is supposed to be a safe space where i cant talk freely and ill feel like I cant do that. 

I was ranting about this and the fact my mom refuses to acknowledge any of my issues (its a long story but she refuses to acknowledge the anxiety ""diagnoses"" \[she told me that 3 years ago when I was 14 but I've never received treatment and it was by a neurologist. Neurologists cant diagnose people as I've come to find out.) before I had an epiphany. Why not change this situation for *my* benefit? My mom won't hear my concerns from me, however, she might hear them from a professional. My mom wants to know what she can do to help. This is something. Because if i do have it then I can get treatment because otherwise, you're treating the symptoms not the root of the problem, and how long will that really last? If I don't, I'll never bring it up again but at least it will rule something out and I can move on. If I don't and something else comes up, then we can work on that. It would be a win-win situation but I would need to get my therapist in on it. I'm just not sure if it's a good idea or ethical.

Emma had a lot of problems relating to self harm and drug abuse. I, with a group of friends, wanted to reach out to her and recommend help and give our support. Jake was one of the people I talked to, hoping that he would be there with me to approach her (everyone I talked to already knew about what was going on with her). 

Jake didn’t like the idea, and he told Emma everything that was going on, and how we wanted to reach out to her. She took this the wrong way, immediately thinking that we were just talking about her behind her back. She messaged me and my girlfriend, as well as the rest of the people in the group who were going to talk to her, cussing us out and saying very rude, terrible things to us. 

We tried to explain to her that we just wanted to reach out, but she refused to listen. Jake took Emma’s side and joined her in telling us that we were in the wrong. I personally feel like the only reason he took her side was because he was afraid she wouldn’t have anyone left If he didn’t.

The argument continued and things were very tense, until finally we started arguing about it in a group chat with all of us except Emma. Jake said that he doesn’t want to be anybody’s friend anymore, including Emma’s (However, he’s still friends with her today). He left the group chat, and I have only talked to him a few times since. 

I miss him and haven’t seen him or been around him in months. He was my best friend, and I don’t understand how sides can be taken so quickly and how lifelong friendships can just end so quickly.

941,"I am a 35M. I did not graduate from high school ( I did obtain a GED for what its worth), and I only attended a year of college. However I am very hard working, highly intelligent, and learn quickly.   


At 22 (2007), with help from family, I started a retail store, that remained open until 2017. During that time, I learned a ton through trial &amp; error. I enjoyed learning from my mistakes, and seeing the changes help scale me ventures. During the time my retail store was open, I began an E-commerce site (before it was popular in my industry), began manufacturing my own proprietary products both domestically &amp; overseas, and began a B2B wholesale venture to sell my products to peer retailers. Through this portfolio of ventures, I did pretty well for myself. Bought houses, cars, and generally had more than enough money to live my lifestyle.  


However in 2017, the writing was on the wall that B&amp;M retailers were hitting hard times, with less net potential,, while still remaining very capital intensive. Not to mention the exposure to liability through internal theft, frivolous competitors, etc.   


I decided to close up the retail portion in 2017. I leased industrial/office space, and continued manufacturing products domestically, while importing from overseas partners, to help supply retailers in the industry I had previously been a retailer in. My compounded knowledge helped me gain traction quickly, and in little time I was cash positive again, with lost of forecasted growth. After a year (2018) we were doing great. Lots of revenue, great ROI. I still continue this role, currently. Covid has luckily not hit my industry very hard, and retailers continue to purchase.  


However... I have recently been having the urge to put my skills to use in a more professional setting. I yearn to be part of an office or corporate environment, being able to put my skills to use in a greater goal. In a nutshell, Im sick of being a big fish in a small pond; I want to be a small fish in a big pond for a little bit. I am picky though: I would remain self employed, if the only available positions were entry level, retail, etc. - Ideally, I want to work for a startup.   


Owning my own companies, with no education, people would still always tell me ""Man, so many people are gonna want to hire you, if you ever go that route. You're driven, hard working, and intelligent. People with experience are far more valuable than fresh grads"" I held onto this, hoping it was true. I have always loved corporate law, finance, investment, etc and my dream would be to work in this environment. While I certainly am not expecting to start at the top, I believed what they said was inherently true, and I would be able to easily market my skills to a company looking to add to its staff.  


So I have been applying for jobs in industries that interest me. Granted, its a horrible time to apply for any job, but I still need to try. The problem is, my feedback is horrible.   


I have sent close to 200 resumes in the last 2 months, to everything from finance to general business administration roles. Even some retail management roles, hoping to get my foot in the door with a good company. The problem is I don't hear back. Ever...   


I have not received any responses, and to be frank, Im starting to think that Self-employed individuals are actually..... looked down upon by Hiring Managers &amp; HR. It seems my friends, family &amp; peer colleagues wanted to make me feel good about my situation, or were grossly ignorant to the real topography of the HR industry. In any case, Im in a weird place. People are telling me ""Im not trying hard enough"". I have a professionally written resume in many template variations, excellent recommendation letters, PROVEN work history...  


I have built a linkdin, but having been in my own operation the last 15 years... I have no one to connect to. My past industry was largely counter culture, and thus not many peers are on that social platform. Still, Ive done my best to build it, make a a great Ziprecruiter, and generally put my info anywhere I can. Id like to think Ive done a great job marketing myself thus far.  


Unfortunately though, I have read here on Reddit that hiring managers will immediately discard resumes that have no BA/BS degree, to protect their own ass in the case they don't work out. If true, they have no clue of my dense business administration experience. Even worse, I have realized a greater number of my peers getting jobs at good companies by outright lying about their Education/Work experience. Im an honest person, but an honest person that wants to be part of a successful, growing company. Am I being forced to lie on my resume, just so I can even get face time or a response?   


I apologize for the long post, Im just a bit lost. I really appreciate any help and insight, and please... don't sugar coat it. I need to have realistic expectations about this next chapter in my life.   


Tl:Dr - Self employed for 15 years, no college degree. Company is successful, however I have the urge to work in a corporate/office setting. Sent 200 resumes, zero responses. Do I lie about education, keep my head down and keep sending honest resumes, or succumb to the fact I am damaged in the eyes of HR, and will most likely have to remain self-employed for the rest of my professional existence?",08Dec2020,1
942,"Hi! 

So I’m extremely aware that this is not an urgent issue and that there are far bigger problems in the world to concern myself with, but I need some advice nonetheless. 

I had set a budget for getting my sister a christmas present because I genuinely want to get her something nice since shes been down on her luck unfortunately due to COVID-19. I haven’t got it yet, but I’m fully aware that she doesnt have the funds to do the same for me. I’m perfectly fine with this, I’m doing it for her not because I want something equal in return. 

Originally, I thought nothing of it. After speaking to my parents, they brought up that my sister might feel bad that I got her something nice and she couldn’t afford to do the same. I really don’t mind if I don’t get something extravagant from her, but I also don’t want her to feel bad about it. 

I offered to buy the gift and have my parents give it to her instead so it looked like it was from them because I feel like parents are generally exempt from the equal gifts rule (at least in my family) but my mom is against this idea. 

TLDR; I want to get my sister something expensive for christmas but i know she can’t afford to do the same and i don’t want her to feel bad about price differences. Should I lower my budget or go for it anyways and hope that she doesn’t feel bad about it?

I just want to be able to say no, and tell others that I need to focus on myself first, but I feel obligated to help. Nobody is forcing me to, but now that ive helped a few times, so many people come and dump a lot of stuff on me to help them with, and then it feels like thats what i SHOULD be doing. and then i start asking people to give me more things to help them with, and its this unhealthy cycle that i am having a lot of trouble breaking. I'm sure im not the only one who's gone through this, and I just am wondering, to those who managed to get out of this stupid cycle, how did you go about it, and what would you recommend? I’ll take any advice I can get, even if it’s a scripted way to tell someone no, I just need somewhere to start. Thank you so much, and sorry for any bother!

952,"This morning my professor sent me an email saying that I did not sign the student code about saying that I the student did not receive outside help on the exam (for which I did sign). But cheated anyways on a few questions. If I come clean and say I received help on the exam I have no idea what could happen. But if I deny receiving help on my exam could I possibly get away with it? I desperately need to pass the class, and with everything online I got distracted for a brief moment. I have never cheated on an exam before, I just don't want to get kicked out of my university. She is obviously suspicious if she is sending me an email about signing a code for which I did sign but is trying to get me to say something. But if I get away with this It could potentially save me for the semester.

953,"So this might be long. I've (20F) been following my local social distancing guidelines pretty stringently. I have a few close family members who have severe health problems and don't want them to get sick. I haven't seen my friends except a handful of times since March even though my area has been in the lowest tier. 

So, to the story: I have two life long friends ""Carra"" and ""Molly"". This story revolves around an argument I'm currently in with Molly (20F). Molly and her family don't really follow social distancing guidelines unless they are in public places. Other than this, they still socialize, go over to friends houses, and don't wear masks etc. Since the beginning, Molly hasn't really worn a mask when she is around me. It bothers me a little, but it's her choice and I'm gonna still wear mine. Well, at the end of October, our social distancing differences came to a head. It was Molly's birthday. Carra, her and I talked a little about what we should do to celebrate but didn't have anything set in place. The day before Molly's birthday Carra texted me asking when I would be over at her house. Apparently they had decided on the day and time and forgot to tell me. That's fine, it happens sometimes, and I was busy with classes so I didn't really notice that we hadn't figured out plans further. Anyway, I tell her that since their plans were to all meet up at 7-8pm and spend the night at Carra's that I probably wouldn't go unless we did something outside. Long story, short the whole thing ends up being cancelled because Carra also said that it would work for her better if we rescheduled it. 

I felt really bad about being part of the reason why this all was cancelled so I decided that since the area was only getting around 0-5 cases a day that I could relax a bit more. I would go out with friends more often as long as we wear masks, eat out at restaurants, go to others houses as long as we all wore masks and I sanitized myself well before and afterwards.  I texted my friends this and asked Molly when she wanted to get together to celebrate her birthday. And I get nothing. A week goes by and nothing. I ask her whats up. Nothing. I've had breakdowns over this and have talked to Carra about it and she had no idea what was going on.

 Eventually Molly responds and I find out that she has decided we need a break. Ummm... we haven't seen each other in person for over a month and by this time haven't really texted for a few weeks, how has that not been a break already? I tell her this and I ask her why she's mad at me. She eventually (it took her a another week to respond) told me it was because she doesn't want to wear a mask around me. She works full time at a grocery store so she wears one all the time and doesn't want to wear one on her off time. So what I get out of this is that she would rather not wear a mask than be around me. 

In response, I explained to her that in public she would have to wear a mask anyway, if we were eating outside at a restaurant she wouldn't be wearing a mask, if we were at the beach or taking a walk she didn't have to wear one, etc. I also explained that we usually get together once a week for only a few hours. So really, depending on what we are doing she might not even have to wear a mask, and even if she did, it probably would only be for a few hours. 

She hasn't responded and it's been over two weeks. She lives just down the road from me and we no longer wave at each other or have any contact. This is a close friendship of over 10 years that is going down the drain over a mask! I'm struggling. This whole thing has really bothered me and messed with my self esteem. I'm not sure how we will recover from this as friends. 

Am I in the wrong here? Should I try to fix this somehow or let her make the first move? I'm so confused.",08Dec2020,1

955,"Like the title says, my MIL got diagnosed with colon cancer yesterday. My fiancé is devastated. I try my best to support him, but he is just so afraid for his mom. The cancer was detected early and the doctors say it is treatable. At the moment I’m at our house a couple of hours away from his family home. He drove up there immediately to be near her, unfortunately I couldn’t go with him right now because of some engagements. I talked to his mom on the phone and because of Covid the family can’t even visit her and that makes me so sad. I know she will beat cancer, she’s a strong woman and the prognosis seems to be very good.

956,"To start I want to say this is my first time moving out and into an apartment. I live with my girlfriend, and a cat. One thing I thought about was noisy neighbors, but as it turns out I'm the noisy neighbor. Someone lives above and below me, and on the side of me is the same layout up and down. We are ""night owls"" and are up until 4 in the morning usual. I don't see that changing so I can't do anything about that. The person below us first had a complaint about noise in odd hours of the night, being a loud thud. My damn cat knocked the shampoo bottle into the bathtub, boo hoo. Awhile later I got a note on the door that I was playing music too loud, that may have been my bad. Finally today I got an email from the landlord about a generic noise complaint. Last night at about 3 in the morning my girlfriend and I did some bedroom activities for about an hour and the headboard hit the wall a bit. My question is how to I manage? Is there any soundproofing tips you can think of? Do I worry about eviction? Do I poop in a bag and set it ablaze on her doorstep? What do?",08Dec2020,1
957,"One of my best friends is going through a lot right now, her bf cheated on her, she's lost two of her oldest friends this year (they didn't die or anything, just turned into shitty people so much so that she had to stop talking to them) and her family is toxic to her. She can't even talk to her own dad because of her stepmother, he always takes the stepmothers side over his own daughter. She used to be such a bright, hopeful person but I can literally *hear* the weariness in her voice every time we talk. She's a genuinely amazing person and I hate seeing her like this.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that she pushes herself too hard and never slows down or takes a break either. Today she told me, ""My whole life I've just always made someone mad at me. There's not a day that goes by where there isn't stress in my life and I'm getting exhausted and can't keep up."" Another thing she said was, ""My life is legit falling apart, I'm always just stressed and isolate myself and don't like talking to anyone. I can't even build up the energy to text anyone back because I'm a ball of stress that needs meds."" Jesus, even just reading that again and typing it is hurting me cause I've known her almost half my life and even if I hadn't, no one deserves to feel like that.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've never thought she'd be the type to hurt herself or anything but just seeing what she said worries me that she is going to and I honestly don't know what to do. She's had bad times in the past, and she's made it through those, but even the strongest among us will break down eventually. I've told her countless times that I'll do whatever I can to cheer her up and that I'll listen and be here for her whatever she needs. She's literally like family to me and I don't wanna lose her. None of the adults in my family are people I can talk to about this kind of thing because they basically just discount everyone's problems or would say ""well it doesn't involve you so stop worrying about it."" So here I am asking for advice about what to do.",08Dec2020,1
958,"I am currently a high school junior and trying to decide which college I want to go to. I live in Utah so there are not very many options for great colleges in the state. To further complicate things I am an in the closet atheist in one of the most religious states in America. I am currently deciding between three colleges. 

The first is BYU which is an ultra religious Mormon school. The pros are they have a really good finance and accounting program (they are 3rd or 4th in the nation). I want to be a venture capitalist so this is really important to me. They are also really cheap ($5700 a year). So I would get a high quality education at an affordable cost. The cons are that I don’t believe in Mormonism. When you are a Mormon guy at 18 you are required (or Strongly encouraged”) to go on a 2 year mission to spread the gospel. I cannot do this because I don’t believe in the religion but almost every guy at BYU has served a mission(it is not required for admission but 98% of men do) . It is really big culturally and one of the first questions asked new people is where did you serve? I fell like I would be socially isolated if I was the one person who did not serve a mission. You also need to follow a strict Mormon honor code and do annual worthiness interviews (where my lack of a mission would surely pop up). 

The second option is the University of Utah. Which has the advantage of being closed to home. It’s biggest advantage for me is cost because it’s tuition is only 8,600 a year which is more than BYU’s but still reasonable. The cons are that they are not a very good school for finance or accounting majors like me. There programs are mediocre and I want to get a good job out of college. 


The third option is going out of state. I would probably go to the university of Austin because it is ranked high in finance and is more affordable then other schools. The pros to going here is that I could get out of the Utah bubble I was raised in. It also a really good school in Finance. The biggest thing holding me back from this option is the cost: $38000 a year! 

Right now I don’t know which option to choose and I need to pick soon. I was leaning toward BYU but I wanted to consult someone who would be unbiased. So Reddit should I go to the religious college or choose option 2 or 3?",08Dec2020,1

My roommates had brought an item that reminds me of day that I wasnt feeling very good. I know I need to accept it but I dont know how to look at it without remembering the event that happened?",08Dec2020,1
960,"I (23F) have lived with my parents my whole life. I'm still quite young, I'm aware, but I've been ready to move out and live independently since I was 19. I graduated in 2019 and lived on my own for two of my university years, then moved to the 'city' and again lived independently/with friends until the end of 2019. I quit my job because I absolutely hated it, and I was convinced by my parents to move back home. I was told that if I went home I could figure things out, but that I could visit my friends whenever I wanted (I have to travel to do so - my parents live abroad). 

For a bit of context, I come from a semi-conservative family. What that means is, I have to ask every time I want to do something - any time I want to go out and see friends, I have to essentially ask for permission. Last year's NYE I had to spend alone with them because I wasn't allowed to spend it with friends because they 'don't know them'. My older siblings who are also in their mid-twenties were free as birds and allowed to do what they like. I have tried before to speak to my parents about it, but they both have little patience and blow up every time it is brought up, no matter how polite or calm I try to seem in the moment. I was planning on returning to university this year for my postgrad, which they initially were incredibly on board with. Cue a few months later and they're screaming at me not to go. I thought it would be effective if I calmly said 'this is my decision, I have made a decision to go', and they were furious that I thought it was okay for me to state my decision rather than ask for permission. 

It's not just things like this. I love my parents dearly, but it's driving me up the wall. I've essentially been in my own personal lockdown since moving home. I try to call my friends as much as I can so I can stay virtually social, but on several occasions they have complained that I'm on the phone too much - which is untrue. I work from home so I can't constantly be on the phone, and on average I'll call a friend once every two/three days, for maybe an hour tops. A few months ago, I was FaceTiming my friend who lives in Far East Asia and we were having a long catch up. During the call, my mother walked past and said 'you've been on the phone for too long, what is this?!' and the shock on both my friend and my faces was unforgettable. I was mortified. I felt like a child. I will consistently be told what to do and when to do it. If I want to have drinks on Zoom with friends on the weekend, I'm embarrassed to do so. 

The list could go on. A couple years ago I took on a short summer internship, and for weeks they tried to convince me not to go - that it was 'silly' etc. I feel incredibly suffocated and I have felt this way for a long time. A lot of people will say I should appreciate family more and I can see why you would say this, but I feel like every move I make is scrutinised and judged. If I go to bed late I'm told off. If I'm on the phone for too long they complain and ask who I'm talking to. 

I mentioned that I wanted to move out by the end of January, and the first time it was brought up they got angry and they immediately made it clear that I would have to pay for everything myself. This wouldn't be an issue (as I previously told them I'd like to support myself, but they insisted they'd help at the start) if they weren't paying for both of my siblings' rents. It just seems odd to me. I'm afraid to approach the subject further and I also feel racked with guilt that I even want to move out. But I'm truly miserable and I feel like everyone around me is moving forwards and I'm the only one at a standstill. I've lost friends, my freedom, and essentially a large portion of my early twenties. They're incredibly loving parents but there's so much tension in the house and I feel so stuck and sad all the time. I guess I'm just asking for understanding really.",08Dec2020,1
961,"so because of wrong life choices i guess and this pandemic situation, i lost my job and just started to work as a personal assistant for disabled people. i have to help people in wheelchair, shower them, clean their asses, feed them. i knew that it would be challenging but today i had my first sudden emergency shift and i didn’t realize how physically hard (and i’m very fit), stressful and kind of terrible this is. terrible because my client had just black skin where he hasn’t moved for years now and he talked so much and i didn’t even have time to go to the toilet myself, by the end of the shift i stopped understanding what he wants (this language he speaks is my fourth language). and it’s very silly to complain now and to act like this is something surprising, but i wanted to have an advice how to ease first experiences, so it becomes easier faster. my mental stability had already been shaken by really sad and unfortunate events this year, and i really don’t want to mess it up with my clients who are already very helpless",08Dec2020,1
962," Hello, I met a guy, I found out he's an atheist and doesn't want to wait until marriage to have sex. The thing is my heart connects so deeply with his heart. Even when we are walking together, I feel we are only two people in the room. I feel emotions so strongly towards him. I grew up Catholic and then became Christian. Also, to add, I see god as a guidance in my life, but I don't read the bible, Pre covid, I would attend church sometimes, and during the holidays, like Christmas, Easter etc. I would think of myself as a liberal Christian, I'm not really conservative. I truly have feelings for this guy. What should I do? I don't want to lose him, I don't mind he's Atheist, but the sex before marriage, is an issue for me. I feel torn about this. my souls connects so deeply with his. idk what to do. He said he's open minded and respects religion, but waiting until marriage for sex is a joke to him. 🤷 I want to stay with him, what can we do? any options for us? any way to compromise?

Edit: I was thinking, the compromise we can do, is we can slowly work our way towards sex in the relationship until marriage. Im would be okay with handjobs, or even oral sex. But I would like to keep PIV until marriage. That would be my compromise. I don't mind getting somewhat sexual to make him happy.

963,"So a few years ago I moved in with a person who had 4 cats. At first I thought this was a little weird because before I moved in, Kathy (fake name) lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I soon realized the apartment complex only allowed for two cats and that she intentionally lied to them. Usually I wouldn't care about breaking the rules, but the apartment smelled so bad and the cats were constantly fighting due to the lack of space.
She would only clean the apartment every other week and the lilter one a week. All of her cats were/are clinically obese (because she ""didn't have time to put them on a feeding schedule"" so she left 10 food bowls filled at all times), threw up at least twice a week, and tried to escape the apt multiple times a day. 
After about 6 months I started looking for a new apartment and tried to stay out of the Apartment as much as possible. She then started to go on week long trips without telling me, meaning they went without food or water for at least 2-3 days. She also refused to use the apartments heating or air-conditioning, so they were left with no water when it was 102 F outside and about 83F inside. Kathy did say after that her sister checked on them every two days. 
I do want to say that durring this time she was going through alot of mental health problems. I'm guessing this may be why she neglected them? In her words ""the cats keep me from having to go to the pshy ward"". 
When I moved out she got 2 more cats but she stayed in the 2 bedroom (I never let the cats in my room). I don't know how she is with the cats now. She currently has 6 cats.

I wear a mask and gloves at work everyday but the recent wave of cases has got me concerned.

However, I have expenses to pay for, so I am also considering staying. Car insurance is about $30 a month, and my parents have me pay for Netflix. I also have Xbox Game Pass as another expense. Gas money and food are also expenses I have, not to mention Christmas gifts I have to get for my family. While thankfully I have saved up a decent sized amount, if I quit I will be out of money by March earliest to May latest for sure. That money was supposed to be contributed towards me buying a car as well.

I'm not sure what to do, and I would appreciate some advice",08Dec2020,1
981,"In January I started getting calls from unknown numbers at late hours at night, I never picked up because I always had my phone in do not distub mode and usually had a lot of notifications. But one day I forgot to do it and when the call woke me up I picked up and no one answered. I blocked the number but they kept calling me from different numbers abput every 2 weeks so, I kept blocking them all. 

Fast forward to last night, I'm sick of it. I answered the call and said very pissed ""who is this?"" and it was my ex. I asked, what do you want? and he repeated his name and hung up. I blocked the number from calls but he texted me through whatsapp and I asked if he could talk like an adult about what matter did he need to solve, and he said he wanted to videochat, I told him no and I'm sick of his harassment and if he doesn't stop I'd take things legally. Also he owes me about one thousand dollars and asked if he could pay back and he told me he doesn't rememember. He insisted on videocalling and I told him no, he said ""I want you to look at it one last time"" and that's when I thought, fucking creep, and blocked him. 

I'm honestly scared and don't know what to do, by reporting and blocking him the conversation got deleted, I didn't really keep track of all the calls he had made as I have a lot of calls from non-registered numbers, since sometimes my clients call me, but I do block all numbers from banks offering me promotions and whatnot. Authorities don't really act on these kind of matters, unless I got hurt in some way, but sometimes not even then. I live in a relatively small town so I'm likely to stumble upon him at least once a month, but now I'm totally scared in case this happened. I don't really know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Last night I just found out my ex is the person who's been harassing me through phone calls late at night, I tried to face him trough text and he behaved poorly. I'm not sure what to do since I don't think I have enough evidence to report him and I'm scared I could get hurt if I ever stumble upon him.",08Dec2020,1
