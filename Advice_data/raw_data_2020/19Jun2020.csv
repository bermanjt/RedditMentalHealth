0,"So, I’m an introvert, I will gladly stay in my room all day because it’s quiet and I get to do what I want, play a video game, watch a movie and speak to my friends on my console 

My two sisters and my mother are all extroverts, they always go to parties and bars to talk and drink and they’re always with each other in the living room watching the TV together talking about people and things. I find it incredibly boring and would rather stay in my room for most of the day, coming out to see them every so often or vice-Versa. It’s also been my main source of happiness because of something that caused my depression recently and I just sort of use it for everything. I still go out and about to meet up my friends whenever I can and go walk to the shops and back. 

Recently I got into an altercation with my sisters and I got my console took off of me, no entertainment, no communication with my friends and now I’m staying in my room with less enjoyment. it’s an attempt to get me out, thinking that I’ll change, when I know I won’t deep down. They think I’m gonna grow into a 27 year old man in his mother’s basement or something because I’m a 17 year old introvert who just wants to spend the last summer before college easy.",19Jun2020,1

2,"So I’m a 17 f, recently my blood pressure has been really high. I discovered this when I went to my doctor to refill my birth control pills. I hadn’t been to the doctor in 3 months or so because thats how long my pills lasted until, so she had to check my blood pressure. To both of our surprises, it was over 140/90. At first she thought it may have just been my birth control, so she said she wanted to see me back in a month to see if my blood pressure changed at all. Fast forward to Monday, I go for my check up and of course, it’s still high. So they asked if they could take some blood to run a few tests, to which i said sure. They said it would take a few days for the results to come back. Today I get a call from them (but I didn’t answer cause it was an unknown number) so they called my mom, and she texted me saying “the results for your blood tests came in and she said she thinks its highly possible that you could have diabetes. Your insulin levels were extremely high”. I then proceeded to ask her how high they were, and she told me they were over 9000, to which the normal is around 200. I thought she was joking and or maybe she made an error and actually meant 900, but when I asked her she said she didn’t make any mistake.

I’m not sure what to do or think about this situation, I don’t eat sweets often or drink sodas. I know that’s not what causes diabetes but I know that can effect it. I’m not sure if any of my family members have it but i think someone on my father’s side does. I know next to nothing about diabetes and I’m honestly scared to figure out if it is or not. The doctor said that there is a possibility that it isn’t but if so I’m not sure how my insulin levels could possibly be that high. I would love any advice on this at all considering that me nor my mother know much about it, and my father lives in a different state so communication isn’t too easy.

3,"I’m a 20 year old college student and I have a really hard time making friends with girls. I can socialize easily, but it’s almost impossible for me to form intimate and strong bonds with women. 

The relationship between me and my own mother is horrible and I wonder if that’s why, but I desire so deeply to have that sisterhood bond that so many girls have with each other. I just find myself not “clicking” with many. My best friend is a woman but she’s one of the only girls I get along with great.

4,"Stay with me here. I'm pointing out the autism as I think it ""may"" be a factor. So, I was talking to this guy around 15 years younger than me... super nice guy. We talked every night for some time and I told him I simply thought the age difference was too much, but that we could be friends. Ghost. Straight up ghost. I am trying to text him to get answers. He said he was ""confused,"" and that was the only answer I got. Is this a socially awkward thing or a man-thing, or a person thing? I think this is highly rude and very hurtful. Yes, many of my posts relate to men on the spectrum as these are the people to whom I most relate. This is one that I did not understand. Can anyone help me here? I'd never do this to anyone. I'll remove this when I get some advice as to what to do... just stop texting or continue to try to get an answer.",19Jun2020,1

7,"So the backstory behind this is a bit long to get into, but I will do my best to do so. I will provide links to former posts I made to try and get this larger thing to better assist anyone reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the beginning of the month I was close friends with someone before they ended up ending the friendship ([Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gyrcsf/i_22m_had_a_really_good_friend_21f_just_end_the/)). It was hard for me to not do any self destructive things, but I was working to get past it after posting to some pages ([Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gzpi2b/having_a_hard_time_not_thinking_about_self/)). A few days after the friendship ended, I started to get some hateful messages. I let them pass, but I wanted to confront them on who was sending them. The messages started to get worse, saying things like how I am faking my Autism to gain from the system and that I should have gone trough with my suicide attempt I had a while ago. This really sent me down into self harm and another suicide attempt ([Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h9ksde/had_a_friend_end_our_relationship_and_the_pain/)). I was able to do a bit better, but the messages were still really getting to me and had some renewed interest in confronting that person ([Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/haa776/should_i_confront_a_former_friend_who_is_sending/)). Thankfully, the messages have stopped, but I am still hurt by them and felt like I could not keep some of these things only to myself and anonymous posts online.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, it has been eating me up and I have talked to a few people I know irl about some of this after they happened. I have received some vastly different responses on what I should do. Some people have said to continue ignoring those messages; others wanting me to hurt them as much as they hurt me, which I know is not the right thing to do; and more saying to confront them.

&amp;#x200B;

We both use to work together and currently live in the same housing complex. Given what has happened so far, I spoke with the property manager about the concerns I have regarding my own safety in this matter and what actions I can take given the current circumstances. They said to confront them about it given some uncertainty about who is doing it, but to be extremely careful of what step I take regardless of what happens, as it may involve the university we both go to and set us in a long investigatory process over my concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm more lost on what to do now than ever. I am trying to get as much help as possible without getting into a formal investigation about it, but I don't know where to go. Especially now with the pandemic and the concerns about removing people from homes. I don't want to do anything that puts someone innocent into a process that makes everything worse. However, if the person in question is indeed doing it, I want them to know how I feel about these messages and what I will do if they continue. Any advice on how to go from here?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading, regardless if you leave a comment or not. It does help to get some of these thoughts out to figure out what to do, even if it does bring up some things that I would rather not think about or do.",19Jun2020,1
9,"I have a medical condition that requires annual, biannual blood tests. I also coincidentally am a hard poke apparently, so each blood draw is really psychologically strenuous. I never walk in confident they'll get me on the first poke, and the worst case scenario (where every phlebotomist available tries and fails and then sends me away to come again for another try) has happened to me before.

The actual blood draw is over in half an hour, but I feel like every time I do one I lose an entire day of productivity. The first half of the day is spent chugging water and trying all types of home exercises to get my veins pumping, and the second half is just spend lying around waiting for my arm to stop feeling sore. 

I think much of it is psychological and I wish I could just bounce back faster from a blood draw",19Jun2020,1

11,"Hey Reddit, this is my first ever post on here so I have no idea how to format! That being said though, I'll do my best- sorry if this is too long! :)) Trigger warning for d.mestic abuse though? I'm not sure how to warn others, but I really hope nobody gets too upset by this!!

I'm a girl in her late teens. My first memory of my father, when I was around 3 years old, is of him shoving my grandfather into a drying rack and screaming at him. My mom was crying, so I was crying too. 

I grew up in a household where my father was consistently violent and aggressive- he would scream at me when I didn't understand maths questions when I was around 4-6 because he believed I wasn't trying. He would scream at and shove my mom around- I don't know if I remember this or if I'm just associating with what my mother told me, but he hit her head against the wall once. He would also constantly curse her out, calling her a pig, a cow, a prostitute, tell her to burn her God- this might not sound too bad for English speakers, but when it's in Arabic it's a much bigger deal to call someone 'sharmouta' (prostitute). He does this to this day, actually. 

 After my sister was born, things got better- maybe because of the whole newborn baby glow thing, but when she was around two or three he broke my mother's arm. Mama insists that it was both of their faults that it happened- he had a grip on her arm and she kept trying to pull away, and the result was that her arm broke. I remember having to hold my mother while she was sobbing on the stairs before I could even count to 10. I used to put on Canon in D because she said she liked the song and I thought it could calm her down since I didn't know how.

It's worth noting that my father isn't physically violent any more, but to this day he uses his body to intimidate people and points his fingers in our faces and screams at us still. He's said multiple times that he'll change his ways, but he never does. I truly believe that he can't change.

It needs to be said that he has a lot of mental health issues. I don't know the full story, but he has PTSD and went on antidepressants when I was about 12. He was also completely cut off by his family. His siblings won't have anything to do with him, and his mother won't give him any of their contact details- he feels rejected by the world. We're seriously the only family he has, and trust me when I say he'd give the world for me and my sister. He adores us and he's incredibly generous, where our means can allow it. We never had a stable home, but we knew more than well that we were loved.

But. He's paranoid. He's aggressive. He refuses to go to counselling for his aggression or violent tendencies. Even though my mother is no saint, he refuses to help around the house and screams at her when she asks - he does minimal chores, like doing the dishes and the laundry- everything falls to my mother. He believes that everyone is conspiring against him and that everything that he doesn't agree with is done with sinister motives, such as me asking to go out with some male friends. The slightest thing offends him. Since I'm not an adult in his eyes, he thinks that my mother has brainwashed me into hating him and that my opinion isn't valid. 

We have to walk on eggshells around him- my mother has told me on multiple occasions that I can't provoke him otherwise I put both of our lives in danger. I don't know how much of this is hyperbole, but I would do anything for my mama and so I try my damn best not to explode at him. I put up with everything. 

Recently, it's been so hard for me to stay calm around him. I genuinely hate the man for everything he did to me and my mother. But I feel so guilty for it, because even though being around him physically repulses me, he adores me and would do anything he could for me. He told me recently that he wanted to hang himself. It keeps me up at night worrying that if he does do something to himself, it'll be my fault for hating him, but at the same time I worry about my mother having a heart attack due to the stress that's come out of their relationship. 

There are more extenuating circumstances, but I desperately need to give you all a break. 

So - is it wrong for me to hate him and not want a relationship with him any more? Should I give him a second chance?",19Jun2020,1

14,"I went downstairs to ask my mom something, and she was in tears. I stare at her, confused, ""what's wrong?""

She explained that my dad's test results came back, and he has two options. 1) to wait 6 months and monitor, or 2) to cut out his right thyroid (he already had surgery on his left thyroid.) 

I am more than scared, and I am just extremely fearful. I don't know much about cancer, and don't know much about this whole situation. She told me that it shouldn't be anything dangerous, but the thyroid is close to the brain, and i think he should take it out before it spreads. 

I may be overreacting but I am extremely overwhelmed. I'm scared if my father doesn't survive, or cancer begins spreading until his body can't take it. 

I have never had too many people die, close to me, thankfully... but i am extremely scared and have had several breakdowns in one day. I don't want to tell anyone, but I don't know what to do.

Bit of context : I'm currently studying in a CS engineering school. (non-US country, so the scholar system isn't the same as many people here). I'm really miserable here, and I dread it will be like this for the time remaining (3 years). What I really want to study is maths and physics. It's hard, but this is something I'm really passionate about, and I want to build my career in these domains. Unfortunately, the career paths are less safe than the one I'm currently building.

The dilemma is: do I stay where I am, even if I hate the current state of my life. At least I will be safe in the future, but I might have a lot of regrets. Or, do I dive into the maths/physics career path, start to enjoy getting up in the morning.There is a risk it doesn't pay off, but if it does, it would be great!

25,"My sister has recently come home from studying abroad, and she's gained a lot of weight while she was away. She's visibly depressed and embarrassed about it, and I feel so bad for her. I love her dearly and i want to make her feel better.

I used to be overweight, but I'm not anymore. I'm quite fit now. We have a third sister who's also quite overweight, but she's lost a bit of weight lately. 

My two sisters have been talking a lot over video chat the past semester. The one who has been away has been acting as a receptacle for all of my other sister's complaints. She's very negative and needs a lot of attention, also she hates me. I've been hearing them talk about me behind my back all semester, and I've felt really alone and disliked because of it. So i blocked them both on social media, and prepared myself for a life without them. 

But now that i see her IRL, I just want to make her feel better. They are both so uncomfortable in their bodies. I was too when i was overweight. I want to help them get their minds off it and help them feel better, but i don't know how. There's nothing about weight loss that i can tell them, that they can't research themselves.

I used to get so hurt about it because we were both single at the time and he was trying to talk to another girl too and I never said anything. He demonized me for it. This guy has been irrelevant to me and I never spoke to him since. Honestly the sex was bad also so I really never thought of him after.

Yesterday he brought it up to throw in my face again, but this time the other guy stuck in my mind. Now I think about him excessively, like how is he doing now? I imagine his life is good and I'm curious just to see what he looks like now and compare how our lives have changed since that encounter. I've had no way to contact him. 

My partner has brought him up so much that my thoughts of him linger long after the conversation is over. Not in a sexual way but he is on my mind. Am I wrong for thinking like this? 

My partner broke up with me again, and I dont know how to feel anymore. I'm all over the place, I want to socialize, get out, but this person has been brought up consistently with the intent to make me feel bad. And I dont. It just makes me think about him more.

Every night I now go through all my social apps checking to see if I've accidentally sent anything to anyone, or accidentally posted anything by accident on social media.

I don't know what's suddenly triggered this, as I said, it's fairly recent and nothing has ever happened to make me anxious like this, I've just suddenly become super afraid that I've accidentally sent something to somebody. I've made a camera cover that I can slide over my phone but it doesn't satisfy the fear.

31,"I'm sitting here at 26 living in my parents house and sharing a room. I've got medical and dental issues cropping up. At the jumping off point from one job to another. After a traumatic childhood and teenage years. I came out with a whole bunch of unhealthy coping mechanisms. Primarily food and porn being the go to. Food makes the feelings go away. And porn makes the horny go away. And gives me that dopamine hit that washes away the disgust and contempt I feel for myself.

Im well aware of the fact that I need to wait. And give myself time. Love myself. And become a better person for myself. Before I can even wish to have someone in my life. Yet I'm always getting wrapped up in fantasy and daydreams. About being in a relationship. And becoming the man I want to be (A family man. A good husband. And above all. A good father.). Yet I've got this expectation that with a relationship comes sex. I've had it all of twice. And it's the second thing that comes to mind. ""Can I bang that person?"". There are few people I've actually had some sort of interest in that wasn't what's between their legs.

I'm a stoner. Smoking at least two to four times a day. I know it's bad. It's a good way for me to keep the negative at Bay. Only time I feel alright. Like all of my worries, cares, and concerns are tucked away for the night. Before flaring right back up when the effects wear off. It's affecting my professional life. Not in the late for work and fucking up all the time category. But the ""Hey. Can you pee in this cup?"" Category. Partially the reason I'm in between jobs.

Finally. When it comes to weight. As the title states. I'm 500 plus at 26. I am fully aware it isn't healthy. I have been trying.  But I always seem to end up in the same place. Bottom of the pit trying to claw my way to the edge again. I am on a 12 step for compulsive overeating. And bottomed out a few months ago. Suddenly I started gaining weight back after shedding 50 in like three months. And like a howitzer she'll hitting a dinghy I was back to the old habits. Eating whatever the fuck I want. I know I'm out of control. And while I say I fear death from this hell. I feel like I actually don't. Wouldn't fear motivate the average person? Then again. I'm not fucking average.

32,"So I met this girl through tinder and we’ve been flirting back and forth, it’s clear she’s interested and we have each other on snapchat and text now. But the other day, I tried to find her on twitter and luckily her name isn’t very common. I found her and saw her with another guy as her header picture, so I think okay, that’s her best guy friend. I stumble upon his account and he has a picture with her as well, &amp; he’s grabbing her in a certain way that says more than friends in the photo. He’s also tweeted at her saying romantic things so I’m sure they’re dating. What do I do? Should I confront her? Ask her what’s up? Does anyone have any insight on why women cheat on men lol; I’m just so confused and a little hurt, she seemed to want to get to know me in a genuine way and told me she’s not looking for some random hookup but I’m not someone that can take being lied to.",19Jun2020,1
33,"My bf(23) and I(19) have been together for about 2 years, we were best friends for around 7 years before we started dating and have always had a very strong connection, I was there to comfort him through an abusive relationship he was previously in and we have always been there for each other. 

The relationship started off really great, but as time passed, I started to see his true colors, he often makes me feel dumb and he is condescending to me, and when I call him out for it and tell him that it hurts my feelings, he makes me feel bad for it, and acts sorry, but it never stops. He makes me feel insecure and I often feel ignored by him, which is kinda odd to me because he’s always the more affectionate one.

I also feel so stressed and pressured by his standards, he doesn’t want a cookie cutter partner, so anything I have an interest in that is even relatively popular gets criticized by him. He doesn’t want a partner who drinks or does drugs which I’m okay with, but he often brings up the fact that I got drunk once and he makes me feel extremely bad for it.

He also yells at me sometimes which frightens me a lot, so I try and keep quiet so I can’t say anything that will make him yell, but In result of my silence he’ll ask if I’m scared of him and he’ll apologize, but continue to yell at me again. It’s really confusing and I feel like I’m just being sensitive, and sometimes I question if I’m just causing problems in my head. Please help.",19Jun2020,1
34,"So right now i’m a 17 year old male and i live with my mother. I’m a Senior in High School and in a hard place in my life on what i wanna do for my career. Ever since i kid i’ve always wanted to play soccer my whole life and i’ve always dedicated to it, and still am. I want to play in college and have a few rides to play in pretty good teams, but the one thing that’s always screwed me over was my grades in High School. At the moment i have about a 2.0-2.2 gpa. My whole family always talks down about how “i’m the oldest out of all my cousins, so you shouldn’t be getting less then 3.7 gpa to be a good influence on the younger kids” But my whole family knows i’ve never been a studies person, yeah i do work hard and even stay 1-2 hours after school getting help. I’ve always been told “why can’t you be like the rest of the family and get really good grades”. It’s always hurt me when they said that.

But now i’m at the point of where i wanna quit everything and join the Military. My grandpa was in the Navy and my Dad (Who is no longer part of my family) was in the military for a long time. My dad, uncle and a few of my friends and their family have notice my interest and high knowledge of guns, war strategies and stuff like that. Especially when i’m out at the range firing i always feel so relaxed and stress free. But what doesn’t help that i’ve always been the “stay to myself” kid, which everyone thought i was a school shooter looking person. And part of me says i’m not, but another says “maybe you are”. I’ve had a talk with my old soccer coach (Who i go hunting and schooling with) and he jokingly but in a serious way has told me i do have a “Killing Instinct”. He says he has noticed this ever since i was young and first started hunting, i would never hesitate to shoot whatever i’m after. Even my own friends and family says that i seem to have a “Killer Instinct”.

Parts of me feels like crap and scared, because that’s what people see in me.
So now i come here and ask, should i stay with the sport that i’m really good at and really dedicated too, or leave to go join the military (or army, navy, other branch like them) to pursue what always seemed like my “Natural Job” ?",19Jun2020,1
35,"Both of my parents are in there mid 60s and my dad is undergoing cancer treatments so they are both quite vulnerable to be affected by COVID. Since the start of the lock downs I've had a few facetime happy hours with them but they are getting increasingly demanding about visiting in person.

Especially my dad, if he gets his chances of surviving don't seem very high. I'm going to be visiting them this weekend but I'm really nervous that they're not going to want to maintain any distance. As it is both of my parents are going about their lives as usual but now just with a cloth facemask. 

Am I being foolish? My parents already are going to eat with friends, getting haircuts, and doing other things like that so what's the difference? Am I being selfish in some way?

37,"My girlfriend who is 19 years old recently opened up to me about her stepdad sexually harassing her since she was 11.

I’ll try to get into specifics but I’m truly sorry if something seems to vague, I’m already furious typing this.

To begin with, I fully believe my girlfriend not only because I love her and want the best for her, but because I have also seen evidence.

She has told me of multiple instances where her stepdad has been disgusting with her.

She was 11 years old when he told her that he was in love with her and wanted to run away with her.

She was 16 years old when she found a tiny hole drilled in her wall. 

She was 12 years old when she found a video camera hidden under a pile of clothes in the bathroom.

She was 12 years old when she woke up in the middle of the night and saw him watching her outside her window.

These are only a few of the events she has told me about. I’m already crying and shaking as I type this.

She has told her mom, her mom has “talked” to him but her mom is useless and only replies with “at least he didn’t rape you”.

Basically, her mom is now obsolete helping my girlfriend now. Since it begin, even at 11, her mom really didn’t help her. Sure, she might have talked to
him, but she never took it further to help my girlfriend and get him away from her.

Her mom’s reasoning for not going to police or forcing him to leave is he has two kids with her now, who are both males aged 10 and 4. I fully believe and know that her mom could support them on her own, because my girlfriend and her brother both work and give her money from time to time to help with them.

I know that he does not abuse the mom. He has nothing against her. He is a snake who wears a fantastic mask. She helped him get papers into the US, before she knew who he really was. Her mom would even be better off without him.

Her brother who is 21 years old also knows about this but he does not know what to do. I know he supports her and is on her side, but he is also at a loss like I am.

Regarding my earlier comments, I know this is still ongoing because my girlfriend and I found one of her bras in their room, that was dirty. It was dirty from something else rather than stepping on it, because it was recently washed.

We have no hard evidence.

I don’t know what to do. I was going to confront him about it but I know myself and I know that I will lose control and do something rash.

I want to handle this as best as possible.

I appreciate any and all advice.

Also, forgot to add in, I hope this isn’t against the rules but we live in Arizona. I was going to post to the subreddit of legal advice, but I wasn’t really sure as we have no evidence.

Again, appreciate any and all advice. If something needs to be clarified, I will clarify to the best of my ability.",19Jun2020,1
38,"Hello friends. I am a 20 year old trans male.  


I think way too much about everything which makes me unable to do anything.  
And I absolutely hate this.  
Before this, I was typing up a five page essay about my future.  
But I realized that's exactly what I hate about myself so I decided to sum it up. Sorry that it's still pretty long.  


I am depressed with severe anxiety which made me cut off contact with everyone from high school. I even ignored an invitation to a wedding which I feel terrible about. I loved the two who invited me, I just didn't want to see anyone else at the wedding. I was afraid of being asked what I'm doing now just to answer, ""I don't know."" On top of this, I finally accepted my gender dysphoria and since I've always been openly a female I'm scared people won't believe me now.   
I didn't go to college and ended up working after high school, but I'm still broke as I waste my money somehow. I currently have a potentially stable job as I work at the airport and can try switching to a better position. But I really don't know if that's what I want to do as I don't want to start working a full time job that I don't even like this early in my life. I'm sorry if this sounds selfish or spoiled. I know and am very glad that I even have a job.   


This quarantine really made me question my life. I've always been suicidal up to this point that I feel like my time has stopped for the past five years wasting every day repeating that I want to die. Although I am still depressed, I no longer want to die and am pretty aware that I want to live. I just don't know how. I have interest in too many things which makes me unable to choose a path I want to walk.  


I've tried to apply for college three times. I've always bailed out as I'm just extremely afraid that I'm just going to end up failing due to the work load. I've never been able to study in my life and I barely graduated high school as I'm not really bad with academics, I just don't do any work (basically, I've always relied on my test scores for my overall grade). I really don't think college would work for me. I can't imagine myself going to school properly. I can never get myself to do anything. I had a drivers permit once but I've actually let the year pass and missed the deadline to take the driver's test. I feel very pathetic and miserable thinking about how little control I feel like I have over my own body.  


Another option I guess I have is to move to Japan. I am Japanese who was born in America. Japan is a pretty affordable country as long as you're not living in cities like Tokyo. Also, since I'm fluent in English and Japanese I believe I can get a job as a translator. Japan is a beautiful place and sometimes I do want to get in touch with my native side. I also do think it would be a good way to change my environment and maybe be happy with my life.  


Overall, I have many many options and possibilities for my life still, but I love to overthink and I feel like it's too late. I know I'm YOUNG and I'm STILL 20, but to myself it sounds like I've wasted 20 years so far and I'm just gonna repeat it and waste another 20 years. I'm scared, absolutely terrified to do anything ever which makes me hate myself more. But I am aware I do want to live and fix it.   
I just feel like I have all of these ideas that I can possibly achieve but I never actually try. I don't know what stops me. If someone can just help me clear my mind or just give me some guidance on what I can do I would sincerely appreciate it. I'm sorry if I sound spoiled, but I sincerely do struggle with my inner thoughts.  


I'm sorry if this post was messy. I would answer any questions if it will help better understand anything. I just didn't want to be too detailed since its one of the things I really want to fix.   
Lastly, once again, thank you.",19Jun2020,1
39,"Title has to be short, but covid fucked with my attention span, and i couldnt do much about it. My dad has always been an asshole, and he even said it himself during our screaming match.

I was looking at my report card, and i noticed that one of my classes wasnt a pass, that i thought was. I mentioned it and said my teacher said i passed the quarter, my dad accused me of saying that i said she was lying. 

Back in middle school i was bad about getting my work done, but this year i made a 180 and had As and Bs, my dad refused to say anything about how excited or proud he was, nothing. Only said i would probably fall back to how i was.

Today was the breaking point though, after i said i was confused we got into an argument about me not doing good enough, dispite working my ass off for the last week of the year getting almost everything i needed to pass the semester  (No retakes on classes)

I got pissed off and decided the best way to deal with it is to not deal with it, so i went to my room and texted my mom. She said to leave the house and call her. On my way out i had to walk through the kitchen where my dad was. I got a ways down the road and he drove mach fucking 50 down a busy road and onto a gravel road. I told him i needed time to think and he yelled at me to get in, i told him i wanted to stay and i was still on the phone with my mother. 

Over the course of the next 5 minutes was the largest screaming match ive ever had with him, and i finally stood up to him. It was a big moment but i still lost. With my mom still on the phone i went inside and went upstairs, where i currently am.

I let her back into my life. I always wish the best for her because I think she’s a good person however deep down I sense some negative energy from her, she doesn’t seem genuine in her thoughts or actions, it’s like she thinks she’s living in a reality tv show.
I don’t like being around her. I don’t feel like I can be my true authentic self. 
She’s really judgmental and calls me weird or odd for not having many friends or social media, she has blatantly told me I have no self confidence. 
I feel like I have to act different around her. It’s like she thinks everyone who doesn’t act the way she does is weird. I called her out on this and she denied it. Saying “sorry you feel that way” It’s really annoying. I’m so over it. It’s so draining being around people like that. 
She treats me differently than she treats her other friends, it’s like she thinks lesser of me in a way. I get no ones perfect but I also don’t get why she acts like this. She cares a lot for other people’s social status. It’s like she’s fake nice and just keeps me around for whatever reason. I am deeply introverted and perfectly okay with that. The whole thing is really weird to me because she makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me for being the way I am.

44,"1. Never ask people for help.
2. Never tell a lie.

You never know what the other person may be like when you ask them for help. They may be extra kind and be willing to go above and beyond to fulfill your ask. They may be willing to sacrifice themselves to help you, and you would never know this until you are already in an indebted bond. A price that may be too steep for you.

Never lie because you do not know how big of a damage your ""little"" lie may cause. Think of The Butterfly Effect. Things you said unknowingly may come to haunt you after enough time has passed. They may not necessarily always haunt you via another person, something your conscious may just eat you alive.

So try to live by these 2 principles:

1. Do as much as you can and only ask for help if you are truly in a ditch.
2. Always be honest because getting out of things by lying is too easy and no fun at all.",19Jun2020,1
45,"i don’t understand what’s wrong with me. for ad long as i can remember, i’ve been obsessed with how i look. i take hours to get ready before i go anywhere, and though my parents don’t say it, i know they think i’m vain and shallow. they tell me to not focus so much on how i look, that others don’t focus on your every flaw, but no matter how much i tell myself this, i still find myself looking in the mirror every chance i get. 

i’ve always felt like something was wrong with me. when i was ten i started wearing concealer because i had started getting acne, and i felt like i couldn’t go out anywhere without it being covered. this went on for five years until my acne finally died down. for five years, whenever i went for a sleepover, i’d wait until everyone was asleep to take my makeup off, and wake up extra early to apply it on again. i never went swimming with my friends in fear my makeup would come off, and had to endure people telling me everyday that i was wearing too much, or worse, whispering it behind my back. even when i went to germany to visit my grandparents, i always had to have layers of makeup on, or i’d freak out. i was so convinced everyone would notice and care if one pimple wasn’t covered, and i drove me to the point where i just didn’t want to go outside anymore.

this obsession has focused on numerous parts of my body. my acne had always been my main focus, but over the last couple of years its shifted back and forth between a handful of things. at the beginning of eighth grade it was my eyebrows. i was stupid and plucked them for the first time, resulting in my eyebrows being shorten by at least half of what they used to be. to try and fix them, my mother gave me one of those gel eyebrow brushers. i’d spend an hour if not more in the morning, brushing my eyebrows, trying not to get a hair out of place. it made me constantly late to school because i couldn’t leave my house without them being ‘perfect’, or at least what i thought was perfect. if i had to leave before they were, i’d have either a major panic attack that ended with me curled up in a ball on my bed, or a rage fit that resulted in my room being torn apart. even when i left to go to school, every hour i had to go to the bathroom and fix them again. it got to the point where i missed a whole class just trying to fix my eyebrows. 

by january, my eyebrows had grown back well enough, and i no longer needed the gel brusher. it wasn’t even two weeks before another thing caught my eye. i started noticing there was a small shadow on my nose, and no matter how many times i piled on makeup, it wouldn’t go away. soon the panic attacks and rage fits started again, and no matter how much i wanted to just walk away, i was always pulled back to the mirror. i started missing classes again, and even during them, all i could think about was how i looked and if anyone noticed the shadow on my nose. i started hiding my face behind my hair and hands, and though i know no one noticed nor cared about the shadow, i couldn’t stop myself from obsessing over it.

ninth grade was better, or at the beginning at least. my eyebrows grew back to normal, my acne was well under control, and i switches makeup brands and could no longer see the shadow. i was finally happy to go to school and for people to look at me, and i wasn’t spending that much time in front of the mirror anymore. that is, until my brain decided to tell me my nose was awful. throughout the years of my obsession, whenever something was finally going right and i was no longer focusing on a flaw, something inside of me would find something new to lose sleep over. 

to this day i still can’t look at myself without noticing how ugly my nose is. it didn’t bother me before, but now it’s all i can think about. it’s gotten to the point where i can’t watch tv without comparing myself to a character/actor and crying my eyes out. i’ve been considering a nose job for quite some time now, but i have no idea how to go about it.

do you think i should speak to someone? my mother suggested i go talk to someone about my problems a while back, but my dad thinks all teenagers go through this and i’m just being dramatic. he thinks i can just walk away if i really wanted to, but i don’t think i can. for a while i blamed my behaviour on my perfectionism, but now i don’t think this behaviour is normal. does anyone have any suggestions on what this is or if other people go through it? is this something i should be concerned with and talk to a professional about? i’ve never considered seeing someone before, mostly because i feel people have much worse problems than i do, so why should my silly problems matter, but everyday i feel like i’m slowing sinking and i don’t know what to do.",19Jun2020,1

b) When freed from having to physically prepare for and go to work I barely have anything else to do

Further, I started having anxiety issues after realizing how empty my life was, which I've fortunately got somewhat under control now, but I still haven't actually solved the issue. I've tried a few new activities but none of them have really clicked with me yet.  I feel like the kind of person teenagers would point at and mock for being a soulless adult, and they'd probably be justified in doing so. How do I break out of this and start living properly?

48,"My boyfriend (21 M) of five years sucks at giving advice. Any time I have any issue or anything he just cannot give me one useful advice. I know that sounds really awful like I am being insensitive. It's just like if I ever need any form of help like what I should do about a fight with some friends or if I get in an argument with my parents, I just want to turn to him and vent and actually get some good feedback. His responses are usually just ""yeah for sure I don't know what I would do in that situation either"". It isn't that he is uninterested. He pays attention and will be fully focused and up to date with what I am saying. He just lacks the ability to actually give me good advice.

I personally think being able to lean and support your partner is a very important factor, and everything about him is so perfect, yet he just is unable to help out when I have an issue. I have confronted him about it nicely and I have said ""sometimes i just really want to know what you think, I need someone's advice"" he says that ""he totally gets it and that he will try harder"" but he has been like this for five years. I know he is still pretty young and he will mature, but I have so many guy friends of the same age or even younger who I know I can count on if I need someone's opinion on something.

He is my partner and I love him, but I just need an input from him sometimes. I feel really alone when something happens and now I just don't even bother telling him things that I normally would have because I know I will just get frustrated when he does the same thing again. I am scared for when I grow up and we get married, if I really need his help or input on something with my life or our kids, he won't have an input.

I feel like the responses will tell me to talk to him about it but whenever I do, he usually starts crying and says he feels like he isn't good enough for me. He tends to get really anxious and takes stuff inward and I don't want to make him sad or hate himself. I have talked to him about this calmly and nicely so many times but they usually end with him crying and saying he isn't good enough for me and then saying he will try, but he literally puts 0 effort in giving me any advice, even if he is fully attentive.

Thing is, take your eyes off him a bit and he completely slacks off. Really, he has the mentality: lets get this quickly done and over with so i have more time to do whatever i want. Its a problem we struggle to solve and this can really impact his work in the future. 2) He doesnt have the ambition or drive to pursue or be concerned about his future. Other kids his age are trying all their best to get into a school orchestra, math club, competitions, winning awards etc while he just wants to stay home and play. He doesnt like anything that takes up a lot of his time and is draining or to put simply, he doesnt like the pain and sacrifice for it. One that my sister is also concerned with is that he doesnt want to become a leader. He gives away main and lead roles easily to others and tries to settle on a trivial one or one that works behind the scenes. As such i find the kids are always taking advantage of him and he doesnt seem to mind or care.

Basically, she’s really high energy. But she’s always asking things about me, like my hobbies / interests, shell ask about my tattoos, she’ll joke around and I’m pretty good at BSing with her and making her laugh. I’ll tease her in a friendly way and shit. Things like that. 

I’ll also catch her talking about me to her sister, and when they notice me they’ll stop and change the subject. Today when I got to work she jokingly goes “hey anon I missed you!!” And then later  she didn’t realize I was right around the corner working on something and she’s all “oh I learned more about anon today, he likes to cook and he loves motorcycles” and they’re all “omg he likes motorcycles” 

The other time they were all talking about me outside the truck. Idk what they were saying but I was coming up from the side of the yard and they didn’t notice me and when they did notice she says, “shhhh shut up he’s coming he’s coming” and then her sister said something i couldn’t hear and she replies “I mean it’d be worse for me than you if he heard me..”

I dunno if she’s showing interest or not or if she’s just being friendly. I start a new job soon which I imagine will be a career for awhile and she’s pretty cool / also cute

54,"Hi, using an account that im gonna throwaway later.

Some people online, lets call them X, have been harassing me for years now. It started in 2018 when they switched sides and started harassing us. Me and my friends finally blocked them in October 2018. A day later, they went around, striking every one of our YouTube videos and got one of my friends accounts taken down for ""Showcasing Windows 10."" which was a very, odd reason. YouTube luckily gave it back to him. This back and forth action, they do something to us stuff got serious recently. Friend A got Doxxed and all her information was listed out on a document, and proceeded to have pizza sent to her house daily. It pissed off her and her parents. They then DoSed her (Where they take down your internet) for a few days. That was in January. February, they doxxed some other people that I talk to occasionally but not most of the time. Even someone underage on Discord, an 11 year old, was doxxed. I just can't believe why they would do that to a kid. Like what are they trying to gain? Then, yesterday, my Twitter account got hacked into. My password was never changed from a password leak, which was my fault. So I contacted Twitter support. They then said ""Dox in progress."" That really didn't scare me because I expected Twitter to give me the account back before it got posted. But, this morning when I woke up, I had a ton of messages on my phone from my friends. They all said that I got doxxed. I looked at the dox, and it was insane. My name, phone number, address, birthday, parents info, parents phone numbers, all of it was on this thing on a doxxing site called Doxbin. I didn't know what to expect. Later, around 6 hours, Dominos Pizza shows up at my door. They ring the doorbell then walk away and drive off. We got a pizza. I called Dominos saying I never ordered this and I wanted to know if it was paid. **It wasn't.** I told them that the person ordering it never paid for it and I never paid for it, and they said they had no idea, and I should contact non-emergency hotline (which i can't do because USA doesn't have Right to be Forgotten) or contact cooperate. I didn't contact cooperate. The number on the pizza box was a random number from a guy in New York. I called it with \*67 and I got some old guy asking who is this, I asked who they were and they hung up. I was at a loss. After that I sat down and then Googled a bunch, and I figured out how they got all my information. The website ""[Whitepages.org](https://whitepages.org/)"" has information about everything if you know the last name and what town they live in. They could match up the info and bam, find your parents and dox you. Because I never wanted this information here, I took down my parents whitepages entries, filed a report on Google to get the search off of google search, then we found out a new thing. The guy who did it has a website. He hosts it on one of his computers. We reported to the abuse department of the domain, they took down the domain, but the site is still up. We didn't get into contacting the hosting provider. I have no idea what to do, because they have my info and they do weird things, like leak information, send pizzas (one of my friends who got doxxed got sent $5000 worth of pizzas and was almost forced to pay for it), and even they threatened to SWAT a friend of mine. They are basically blackmailing us. If I don't do what they ask or do something they don't like, they are going to do something to me. After this happened, I changed all my social media accounts over to new ones to try to forget about them. Any ideas on what I should do?",19Jun2020,1
55,"Every time she’s nice to me i like to think, “great, glad she’s nice, surely the past is in the past and now we can all just get along”. I question if maybe i’m overreacting, maybe i’m just soft. but she’s done so much, and i’m so tired of just letting it slide. 

i remember when i first moved in with her and my dad at 14, away from my abusive mom. i remember being told that my dad didn’t “choose” me, implying he chose her and thus valued her more. i remember my privacy being constantly violated, being shamed for how i dressed in my own home (tank tops). she’s been transphobic to be so so much, i can’t even begin to list all those problems. she even compared me to my abusive mother, *recently*. she’ll say such wrong and hurtful things to me with a smug attitude, and then walk off without listening or even letting me respond. i fucking hate it. after she’s been bad we’ll just not talk for a bit, and she comes back seeming nice and so i just “leave the past in the past”, but it feels like a cycle. it’s not that i don’t want to forgive her, but i don’t want to let her keep making me feel so awful. 

and she’ll have her good times, she can be nice, and i know she thinks she cares about me. but so did my mom, and that didn’t make how she treated me ok.. 

but i’m only 19. i am financially dependent on my dad and her. and i love my dad, we’re FINALLY getting closer after so many years, i’ve never had a parent relationship like this before and i’m scared if i say something he’ll very likely see me as trying to start trouble or overreacting, and even though i know he wouldn’t kick me out, i don’t want to ruin what we have. and i don’t want to ruin the illusion of peace where i’m living. i’m hoping to move out soon, as my dads planning to help pay for an apartment, and i don’t want to mess up my chance to get back out of this house... 

please help me",19Jun2020,1
56,"So this turned out longer than I expected it to, title is the tl;Dr

Some context: Basically every time I try to get a girlfriend at least one of 3 things happens
1. I mess up, usually really badly
2. I get rejected, in varying degrees of severity
3. I get messed with
Despite having 2 pets, and a myriad of hobbies I still feel lonely. I have fairly bad social anxiety, at least when it comes to women, especially ones I find attractive. The type of girl I like (more traditional/family oriented) being less common, coupled with all the horror stories I've heard/read of the ""modern"" relationship, the prevalence of hook up culture and just casual/short lived flings. And me not being the best catch (some things I can improve like weight and job, but others I can't like height and size) have all lead me to consider getting a sex doll since I've heard that they can help with loneliness, anxiety, and depression (in terms of relationships at least) as they can act as a sort of surrogate companion. I'm fully aware that a real woman would be better, and if I could get one I would. I just don't know what I should do.",19Jun2020,1
57,"Hey guys, so this is my first time posting but I’m sort of desperate to find people with actual real life experiences that can maybe help me out.

So the context of the situation is that I’m a 24M and my lil bro is 17. My family owns a business and we’re well off because of it. Over the course of a year i have seen my brothers mental health degenerate slowly and its 100% because of his GF. His GF is depressive, obsessive and super controlling to the point that he cant do absolutely anything without her knowing. She sends him constant messages whenever he’s doing something with me not allowing him to fully enjoy our moment together. 

It’s so bad because she has him trained to text her back the second she messages him. There are a million little things that indicate a very unhealthy and obsessive relationship. One thing that needs to be mentioned is how she uses her depression to control him with statements like “ if you do that then I’m going to be lonely” and “you cant do that or Idk what I’m going to do to myself”. 

My bro has always been the most carefree person always quick to flash a smile. He was considered by all my friends as the “coolest and nicest” family member. His entire demeanor has changed and i cant help but feel helpless at the fact that he might be going down the wrong path. He stays in his room all day. Doesn’t socialize with anybody. Won’t work towards any goal for longer than a couple of day. He’s even having outbursts of anger which are the rarest thing for him.

Has anybody ever experienced something like this? If so, any advice is greatly appreciated. I truly love him and it breaks my heart to see him in so much pain but its also confusing because he hasn’t spoken about it to anyone including me. We used to be so close and he’s just drifted away from family, friends, interests, hobbies, everything and anything that doesn’t have his gf involved.....",19Jun2020,1

He has been hanging out with different group and when i tagged along with him (the group didnt know me) my friend old me to say i tagged along with someone else. I questiones in my head is he embarrassed of me or something. We'd always facetime and stuff but now we hardly do and if we do it's so dead nothing to talk about or anything. I feel like when we have conversations they aren't funny anymore, but when he has conversations with other people he always seems happy. I'm really not sure. Thing is we both have been bestfriends since 8 years old and I dont know why it has change all of a sudden since the past 4 months.

60,"I (25F)  work at a small company, in a department with 3 other women (33F, 35F, 36F). I am dating a guy from another department. We met at work a few years ago, and about a year and a half ago we started dating.  
My coworkers have always been invested in this process. It was fun and all when I was just trying to get his attention and starting the beginning stages of talking to him, but as things got steady &amp; serious, I began to keep our relationship to myself because their attempts at involvement made me uncomfortable. The more that this relationship became an important part of my life, the more it really bothered me that they wanted to know details about it for their own amusement.

Well, he got another job. It's a great opportunity for him, and he deserves this. but it truly devastates me. he's going to a much stricter job where he will wont have phone access, etc. So it will be a major adjustment for me to learn how to live without checking in on each other during the day, either via text or with in-person visits at work. His presence at my workplace has been one of the best things about going to work. So, this adjustment fills me with so much fear and sadness. I know that it will be ok and we will be ok. But transitions and change are hard for me, and I cannot think about the topic for more than a few moments without bursting into tears.

So, because of this happening, my coworkers are very nosey about my feelings on this, and constantly have been bombarding me about it. It started with them bringing it up minimally, to which i'd give short response in the hopes they'd drop it. Now, they're getting more invasive. They now will ask things about if I'm sad about him leaving, if I'm worried about this affect on our relationship. This is all deeply personal and raw for me, and I don't want to let them in on this. So eventually I snapped and just said very bluntly ""I dont want to talk about it!!!"" and then they were silent the rest of the day.

I probably should have addressed it sooner, but am I in the wrong for not wanting to let them in on this as I try to cope with it myself? I think it's just bothered me because they don't ask out of concern for my well-being, but rather as an attempt to get some workplace gossip.",19Jun2020,1
61,"Basic context. She's 21 and I'm 24. We broke up due to COVID stuff. So it wasn't like we had a bad breakup or any problems. We've always been close during the relationship, hence the reason why we're staying close friends. We haven't seen each other for few months and I don't think we'll see each other for another few weeks (at minimum).

At the moment, we're talking fine. Nothing's awkward or anything like that. I think we'll always have that intimacy that most friends don't have, but we're both fine with that. I guess like a smaller personal bubble between us. I'm planning on addressing stuff as they come up.

After that , for about 2 weeks after i come back home one day i noticed he was not the same as he was until the previous day so i asked him what was going on, he texted me a HUGE message telling me that he just relazide that his love is not romantic and that he relised he loves me as his little sister and that he is really sorry to say that and that i deserve the best and he realised he is not ready for a relationship and that he is ok to stay friends. Of course I cried as soon as I read the message and i got really broken hearted and i started accusing him that he is a huge liar and that he played the role perfectly and that i couldn't understand why cause until a day before everything was perfect and it took me 4 months to forget it, (even my mom liked him , my mom almost never liked any of my boyfriends and most of the times she was right).After that i really wanted to see if he does the same thing other girls too and i made a fake account with fake photos of a random model, so i started flirting with him, so we started talking and i asked him if he has a gf and where was the last time he had relationship, he started lying that he broke up with his ex gf(me) because my father didnt approve him( my dad actually liked him) and because i was a bitch in general and he kept victimised himsel like he was the victim one in every relationship he had.

71,"Sorry about the long post in advance. 

My mom just lost all her dogs 2 weeks ago because she never got a kennel license and she had over the amount of dogs you can have in my state. I reminded her for 3 years that she needs to do something about it, but she ended up just collecting more dogs to fill her broken heart after losing 4 family members and 2 very close friends in only 2 years. I tried to be there for her and took care of the dogs when she was at work, even though I'm not a dog person. I repeatedly told her for years that this amount of dogs without a kennel license is illegal, but she just ignored it. When animal control took them, she did ask if she could keep one (her oldest) but they said no.

Now they are gone because of a fishy call from a neighbor saying that she hadn't left the house in days (even though she works daily and obviously had left the house), animal control showed up the next day to take them all away. They were not abused, had everything they needed, they just weren't registered. My mom is COMPLETELY devastated. For two weeks now she's been talking about wanting to die, and how life is no longer worth living because they were her whole world. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I dont know how to help. I clean and cook daily, I spend time with her when shes up for it, I even started planting her favorite flowers to try to get her spirits up even a bit... but she just says nothing helps and nothing will ever make things better again. She says her heart was ripped out of her chest and she doesn't want to go on anymore. Not even for her future grandchild (who is due in less than 5 months). 

What can I do to help at this point? I told her she should try therapy, but her insurance doesn't kick in for another 2 weeks. Until then I have no idea what to do. She even went as far as asking if I wanted to die with her, and of course I said no, that neither of us are going anywhere. I remind her that she has a grandchild on the way and she doesn't seem to care anymore even though she was the one who convinced me to keep the baby (my abusive ex is the father and I'm not telling him). 

Long story short: My mom is devastated that her dogs were taken by animal control and nothing I do seems to help the situation. I need suggestions until she's able to go to therapy.",19Jun2020,1

74,"Hello, I’m 19 almost 20. A little background info before we start: 

Throughout my life I’ve always struggled with school. However I did not struggle academically (I understand and can get good grades if I applied myself), it was always mainly my attendance and not wanting to go and not wanting to do the work. I once missed over 40 days in one school year. I also almost dropped out during my junior year as well due to increasing depression.

I am now graduated from high school as of 2018. I went straight to work because I wanted to take a gap year. When 2019 came along, I started looking into what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I realized with my academic and school records, not having any extra curriculars whatsoever, not having taken the SATs, it was going to be hard to find a college I would have a chance of getting into. 

I decided to apply to my local community college, however I really did not want to go as I had heard it sucks. I ended up applying and being accepted, however I never ended up going. Fast forward to 2020, I know what I want to do, and I found a college that I really want to go to, I even got accepted.

The issue is, I can’t afford it. My financial aid only covers 99% of my tuition, it wasn’t able to cover the other 17k for the dorms. I’m not able to get a loan. My credit is fucked, and no one on my family is able to co-sign or even trusts me enough to co-sign (which I understand). I fucked up my credit when I got a store credit card and wouldn’t keep up with the monthly payments (it is now cut up). 

My other plan was to get an apartment, however the only way I’d be able to afford it is with a roommate, which I mentally cannot handle. I’m a very closed off private and introverted person. I have a hard time trusting others and I can hardly stand living with my own family. I also don’t have a license or a car so I would have to get a lyft or take a bus to work/college everyday. I’m also unable to commute because the college is an hour away from my house.

I’m getting so discouraged and feel like I’m going nowhere in life. I’m trying to find an online course, but I’m struggling because I have no guidance and my family doesn’t really know either.

(I want to do graphic/web design, coding)

Please if anyone has any advice of what I can or should do let me know.

We spent almost an year without talking, and recently we got in touch again, and I've been noticing how radicalized his opinions are. He used to have strong opinions, but he was somehow diplomatic and nuanced... now he is straight up saying some very racist and misogynist stuff, and it's visible he is comfortable to tell this to me because somehow he is projecting that I embody his ideal of a perfect white woman, and I feel absolutely scared for how he reached this point and how I give this image of someone who will be tolerant of this kind of discourse...

78," I posted this exactly on [r/dating\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/) and received no help whatsoever, but I could use the help, boys...

I am a 19 year-old male and she is, I would assume, a similar age (18-19). A girl that I met in high school came across my tinder feed the other day and I was like, whoa, I remember her from high school (I have been out of school for almost three years now with the military, but am no longer enlisted, long story, honorable conditions.) She was in a foreign language class with me and we had very few interactions, but I assure you they were all very pleasant, and though I was kind of crushing on her, I did not act on it because I had just moved to this small town from the city and a lot of people were intimidated by me, and I was also chasing a girl from my city who would later go on to break my heart twice, of course that is my fault.

Anyway... I am a very old-fashioned type of person, being low-income most of my life meant no cellphone which meant I played outside in the dirt and don't really understand social norms of my generation. I hate to be that guy, but I do have an old soul. My gut is telling me that I should see if she has a Facebook, the only social media I know how to use, and send her a message like, hey, I remember you from high school and saw you on tinder and... I don't know, I'm not really sure where to go from there. I've found dating online extremely difficult because I don't have social circles and I was tied up with that other girl from my city so I don't have the experience necessary to know if this is a bad idea or not?

79," I am married to a bipolar man who has ""episodes"" where he gets drunk/takes drugs and passes out in bed for a week at a time. These episodes seem random as they can occur at anytime with/without a trigger. It has been 8 long years since he was diagnosed. We have 4 children and have been through a lot.

Last year near Mother's Day, my husband's mother died. She was an awful person who sexually abused her children. She never liked me and told my husband he should leave me and the kids to find a better wife. He always said he hated her but he took her death hard. So, when the anniversary came up this year, I tried to be sensitive and suspected it would throw him into an episode. It did. Mother's Day came and went with him passed out. The kids didn't remember until I had them call their Grandma to say, ""Happy Mother's Day,"" then they said it to me and went back to their online gaming. I was hurt but I understood that right now is hard on all of us. When my husband got up the next day he simply said ""sorry about missing Mother's Day."" That it was it, nothing else.

I recently returned back to work but was a stay-at-home mom for 15 years. Mother's Day was a big thing in my family growing up, and it felt even more important when raising my kids became my sole focus. I am by no means the perfect mother. I have been in crisis mode for years just trying to keep our family going and it really changed me as a person. I used to be positive and optimistic, but now the beat-down of life has me fighting depression. I feel like the kids don't want me around as they seem annoyed by everything I say and do, but they love talking to and spending time with their dad.

Now, the kids are talking about Father's Day and what they should do for him. I know it sounds selfish but I was so hurt by this. I didn't say anything to them, though. I am stressed because I don't think I'll be able to hold it together if on Sunday they come down with gifts and praise for their dad. I want to encourage them to show affection and gratitude...I just wish I was one of the recipients.

So, I am not sure what to do on Sunday. Should I say something to my family beforehand? I don't know what to say without seeming selfish. Should I just put on a smile and then cry silently in the bathroom? Should I leave for the day to be alone and reflect? I don't want any drama. I just want to handle this in the best way I can.",19Jun2020,1

81,"So to make a long story short, my mom and stepdad were supposed to go to Mexico this month for his birthday and it was cancelled because of covid. Now they’re throwing a Mexico-themed get together and I invited my friend to come. Friend is hispanic so I ask her what might be offensive- she says stereotypical things like mustaches, sombreros, and maracas. Of course my mom has sombreros and maracas ready to lay out everywhere. When I ask my mom if she’s willing to compromise and remove them for my friend she flat out doesn’t understand and says no. How do I get her to see how this could be offensive? She says it’s a part of showing the culture of Mexico and are authentic. Any informational resources would help too, I’m just having trouble finding info on why specifically sombreros and maracas would be inappropriate.",19Jun2020,1
82,"So my friend, we will call her Eden, has family that owns a lake-house. We all just graduated from HS in the US so we are all 18F. Edens family is allowing her to bring up 6-8 friends to the lake-house next weekend. In order to get there we’d need 2 of us to step up to drive, and so far no one has come forth. Most of us literally cannot, we we have parents that need their cars for work or just simply aren’t allowed to. Eden doesn’t have her license which annoys the entire friend group because we serve as her personal ubers for everywhere we go, and I just feel like it’s her responsibility to find the drivers or ask her parents to drive us, since it’s her trip. We only have one possible candidate right now, and her car only seats five and she’s not even for sure driving. Another thing that may deter people from driving is the fact they will be driving up alcohol as well, so they might not want to risk it. Eden just has made no effort to get her license in the past 2 years, and now is planning a trip she isn’t even driving to, and is expecting other people to come forth and offer to, when there are risks involved. I don’t think she understands the risks or just overall annoyances that come with driving 3+ hours to a lake house for overnight stays, meaning you’d be the driver to restaurants, stores, etc. Not fun. 

So reddit, how do we ask people to drive for us? Or ask Eden to figure out the driving?",19Jun2020,1
83,"More of an ask than an advice, sorry.

So my Dad(51M) and I (17F), were sitting in the car one night, maybe late 2019/early 2020. I was wearing a short skirt and had bare legs. He compliments my legs and then he runs his fingers down my bare thigh. It didn’t last long and I didn’t really say anything after it happened and neither did he. It was really awkward. 

I thought it was weird at the time but recently I keep thinking about how uncomfortable that memory makes me. I usually go to my mum for advice but I don’t know how she’d react to this. My parents are divorced btw and I live with my Dad. 

It wasn’t really a playful thing, especially so because of the comment he made about my legs before it. I felt sexualised by him and it really grosses me out to write that but I know it’s how I feel.

Doesn’t help that we were in a dark car park at night with nobody around. 

It was only one time. He’s never done anything like it before/since. 

I just feel so weird about his, because he’s my Dad. It’s a bit upsetting honestly.

Was it wrong of him to do that? I just feel like it was wrong but I can’t convince myself if that makes sense. I really hate thinking about this but I also hate pretending it didn’t happen. 

I feel like I am playing the victim, honestly it’s all really confusing and I feel like I’m overreacting over one incident. I’m just spiralling a bit honestly.",19Jun2020,1
84,"So I have an Xperia XA2 (bought 2018) and got the screen repaired last summer as I dropped and smashed it but over the past few months I've noticed the back has been lifting away more and more. Originally put it down to the glue they used when fixing it but on inspection I've found its because the battery has started expanding. Getting the battery replaced would cost me at least £100 or I could get a new phone for £170.

Usually I would go with the repair but I don't know how much longer the phone will last replacing the battery as the phone is 2 years old already and the last Xperia I had repaired (before the screen on this one) only lasted a few months past the repair and I had to replace it.",19Jun2020,1
85,"I would first like to thank anyone who decides to pass on advice. The reason for this post is simple I'm about to walk out of my parents care into the world on a pretty shitty note. All my life with a father in the navy i was forced to move states therefore every time i moved schools i was immediately outcast-ed due to being an outsider. my dad left the navy when i was in 4th grade and we so happened to move to the small crappy state (in my opinion) of Delaware. Starting school here i knew would suck mind you I was always a straight A or B student from elementary to high school although that seemed to make that gap of being treated like crap way worse. 

I had to deal with bullies all my life and ""friends"" who just wanted to use me and hurt me. My childhood also wasn't anything to be slightly happy with. i never went to my parents with any issues i had because my dad wasn't a saint. Although i understand he didn't have programs or therapists to help reintegrate him into civilian life when he was out of the military. He beat me is the only simple way to put it and it wasn't anything simple like a single slap or something like that. It was full strength punches slamming me into things and choking me till i passed out. I didn't feel like it was his fault for a long time till i got older. Now he has a therapist and is separated from my family but i worry that one thing that he doesn't like would set him off i want to believe he has changed but i still can see traces of that evil inside of him when i talk to him or see him.  


College life wasn't anything different between the problems i kept seeming to be adding to the list of everything hard i have gone through. I was promised by my dad when i was getting ready to go to college that he was gonna give me his G.I bill so i wouldn't have to pay for 4 years of school but he lied of course and used it on himself and dropped it on me right before the deadlines of applying to a college. so i struggled but i managed to get a crappy scholarship and get started my first semester of college in a crappy community college. After I had gotten in things were moving along well for me in school i had a small group of ""friends"" and was getting good grades then someone noticed i missed my first class because i had overslept and reported to campus security i might have planned to commit suicide. i got to school then had to deal with being escorted to a back office by cops and with a ton of people taking pictures and rumors being created. 

After i dealt with the misunderstanding and left i noticed that everywhere i went knew me as the suicide kid. All those friends i made vanished which isn't that shocking. i stayed in school tho but that screwed me first semester i failed 2 classes out of 4 so the only way to keep on track is to play catch up so i forked up the money to retake 2 classes and went to my second semester and unfortunately my mom had received a bacterial infection known as cellulitis and things weren't looking well for her. so my second semester was consumed by me taking care of my mother but my college didn't care so now i'm without a scholarship and i have to drop out.

When i was 15 my mother had stage 3 breast cancer luckily she is in remission and i didn't lose her. Although 1 year later my brother on the 4th of July had a brain aneurysm  and i was the only one who could get into the bathroom with the small gap of the door and seeing him lay there cold clammy and not being able to move really fucked me up even though we hated each other. He was lost on the table but the brought him back. he is paralyzed on his right arm but he can walk with a leg brace. Seeing him lay around watch T.v all day just depresses me because i know he isn't happy with his life and he can never work again. He had just graduated when he had his aneurysm. some other things i have to deal with is scoliosis which causes me chronic back pain. Then i also have to worry about my eyesight when i was 16 i noticed weird circumstances of me seeing 2 of everything with my glasses on and off. Turns out i have double vision so my glasses have to have prisms. where i have to pay even more now for glasses.  


My work has decided to fuck me over multiple times too now there are weeks i do overtime i don't get it for 2 weeks. Then i get told there have been changes on my schedule i get shorted hours and i have to be at the ready to head to work anytime they call. Most recently there was a false report about me and they removed me from my sight location and is avoiding giving me a new one. Therefore i can't get unemployment because i technically still work for the company doing contract security work but i can't make money so I decided i would leave everything behind and move in with my uncle in Florida for a few months while i get a job and save for an apartment my hope is i can start saving money and get on my feet and then have a better time walking down the road of life.

I don't know if this is the best decision but i have to tell my dad since he holds the title of my car and he is coming over tomorrow to work on stuff for my mother but i'm worried about telling him because all though he has been more supportive i have to tell him about my school situation and work then that i'm leaving at the same time. i'm 20 years of age but i still worry about that evil that's inside him and if he will take the car i had payed my grandparents for. so i'm looking for any advice on dropping a bombshell that big or walking away and getting a fresh start somewhere you've never been

88,"So, I am trying to choose between two job offers: for the first, I would work indoors in a fast paced retail environment and start with a $14.50/hourly part-time salary. After 2-4 weeks, I would qualify for a lead position with this company, which Ziply and other career websites say would bump me up to $17-20/hour, but whether it came with a pay raise, it would get me to full time. By the most conservative estimate, the hiring director informed me that within three years I will be at $21.50/hour with the company, without accounting for any potential promotions (and I have a good track record of working hard and impressing bosses to rise quickly). I don't need it because I already have it covered by a different company, but this job has paid time off, paid sick days, hazard pay for Covid, paid paternity leave (my wife is pregnant), medical, dental, and a 401(k). The hours are irregular and long, and the managers do their utmost not to pay you overtime, having a clause in the contract that they can keep you up to 2 hours after your shift without pay. I expect to work some weekends and holidays.

&amp;#x200B;

The second job is entirely different. It would be for a landscaping company on a golf course where I would get trained, full time, at $15.50/hour. In 3 months, if I did an amazing job and impressed them enough, they would hire me on which would bump me up to $17-20/hour. Around October, if I was, again, amazing (and they did say that most of their employees are seasonal college kids so competition is low), I could stay throughout the Winter months and expect to always get my minimum 40 hours. I am guaranteed at least 8 hours a month of overtime at time and a half rates, and the year-round positions are listed online as started at $23.50/hour. I could bike to this job saving me gas, and I would be outdoors. No discussion of medical, dental, paid time off, or 401(k) yet, however the golf course is the premier golf course for my state and it regularly appears on PGA tours, so I would surmise all of that would come (note again, I do not need it, having it covered already). Only 360 members pay a minimum of $125,000 every year to play there, and they just blew $80,000 on annuals. It is the cream of the crop for landscaping jobs, quite easy to get time off from, and I would be home every day before my kids get off from school. On Fridays, they pay you to go home 3-4 hours early if everyone finishes... I have to work some weekends and holidays, but usually not for the whole thing. The one big WHAT-IF for this job is that performance and long term success is entirely incumbent on my ability to mow grass with zero lines or divots. I have mowed plenty, but never on their mowers, and never with such care: if I can't master mowing with no lines or flaws whatsoever in their 3 months of training, I won't be hired to continue to work for them to fall, let alone year round like I want.

I am a green thumb and I love being outdoors, and I also am great with selling myself to people and convincing people to buy from me.

We've also tried everything in our power to help her too whether its rehabilitation or therapy or even certain medications. Nothing has worked. What I wanted to tell my parents is to try and give her more trust and freedom as my parents have countless times have had to pick her up when she was drunk or high and clean up after her messes. It feels like she is sometimes threatening us with suicide and as my parents grow older I don't want them to waste the rest of their lives on  her when she is careless and constantly running back to them for money or whatever it is. My parents  are scared she will get in bad trouble or even get hurt if they aren't strict on her.

96,"I need help dealing with my insanely rude neighbors. I tried the friendly route at first. It got us nowhere. We were excited when we moved in to the thought that my son would be able to hang with the neighbors kid who is close in age. That quickly failed due to the neighbors kid making very inappropriate remarks infront of my child, about my child, and just in gerenal. However, we always remained candid because we wanted to avoid drama. We were warned about the noise prior to moving in, and were told its cause they have a kid. Well, we have a kid too, abd I'd be damned if i let my kid act the that child does. They have a 5 year old who runs around on the floor above us constantly yelling. Screaming, slamming things until 12am or later some nights on school nights. The boyfriend is heavy footed and slams around the house and the teenager who isn't even supposed to be living here and is not on the lease walks around with his boots clanking on the floor (idk why he doesn't work). They have company in and out all day everyday, and have people sleep over all the time. Cars coming and going in the masses while the teens go out and party they park their cars here. They have a dog on the property when it's on the lease that they aren't allowed and they dog ran up on my small child unannounced and never was introduced to the bug dog. Good thing we are used tk bug dogs. What we do know about them is they have done this in the past to other tenants and the landlord has not been able to exict them despite trying before. Now, we have complained to the landlord countless times. Called the cops many times too because when mom USED to go to work the teen and his friends would come over and party. The landlord claimed he was going to evict again until coivd happened and now we are legit stuck with them. We pay more than them in rent yet they feel entitled to the entire backyard and to having parties during the weekdays, during qurantine, etc. We can't even hang out in the yard... The list goes on.

An example would be that I'm out with friends or something and I walk past a mirror and see myself and my heart drops by how ugly and fat I look.  I immediately feel immense sadness and my chest hurts from the pressure. I feel like hiding in a closet and not moving forever. The feeling just spirals out of control and I start thinking about every bad thing about myself. Everything feels like it's sinking and sometimes I'll just cry non-stop. Sometimes I'll have suicidal thoughts but never contemplate actually doing it.

Usually the triggers come from seeing my physical appearance but it's not always about my looks. I hate how I look, talk and honestly just who I am as a person. I feel it right now after posting a selfie of myself on Snapchat for the first time in years and I'm about to take it down now. I just want to hide and be alone. It's affecting my social life.

TL;DR My sister has been really aimless since graduating and seems to have developed a drinking problem. Any time anyone would tell her she’s selling herself short, she’d cut them off. I got fed up and told her to stop telling me her problems if she doesn’t want advice. She got physical, and now she’s giving the whole family the silent treatment.

I don’t know if it’s me being stubborn, but I don’t want to apologize to her for telling her the truth that everyone’s been telling her; but because she isn’t handling any of it well at all, I’ve started worrying about her mental health because she doesn’t use any type of therapy or medication, and she needs to.

My husbands father has always said very questionable things but since all the protesting he has said very hateful things about black people and the LGBTQ+ communities, and anytime someone tells him hes being shitty he just digs his heels in and gets more shitty. 

It's come to the point where we have just distanced ourselves from all of them, but his mom called yesterday saying my husband is ripping the family apart even though he's tried several times to talk to his dad about how his words hurt people. But instead of having an adult conversation about it FIL throws even more hurtful words at my husband, like he loves his son-in-law more than his own son.

Basically been working for the past 16 yrs, finally have my own place and it's nice. Was only unemployed once between 13 and now (just turned 30). It was the most miserab6time in my life. Although I got unemployment, I like working for what I have and working extra to get what I cant afford. So it was depressing to me at that time.

Got laid off again about 6 months after moving in. Would normally freak, but covid unemployment with the extra 600 has made the gap in my wage shrink. Especially as I havent had to pay for gas to commute, extra food for lunches, etc. Also no money is going toward 401k or other benefits so while im not contributing, I am really not missing much out of my bring home pay budget. 

Anyway, as a result (my job doesn't drug test) I've been buying fancier weed and having it delivered (my normal cheaper shit isnt available right now). Paying others to do my lawn. Spending $150+ per week to add to my mini bar because all I have to do is suntan and garden. Also smoke weed and drink. So been trying to make the best of it.

I dont know how to go back now. I have gotten so used to gardening and relaxing all day with my cats. I knew it wasnt forever. But they called me today and want me back tomorrow.

I've told my parents that I want to be an anesthesiologist, not even because I want to be a doctor and like chemistry.

110,"Hello, I'm Belle and I'm a new content creator on YouTube. I started creating content a month ago and I decided on making funny videos as well as covers. I'm also a fashionista so I like wearing revealing clothes and I think that it would catch people's attention especially with my funny videos. I made two cover videos and people enjoyed it but I also edited a funny video with me wearing a tube and worked on it for long. 

Here's where my problem starts. My parents are aged 60 and 55 years old. When I started uploading my covers, they were amazed and wanted me to do more. When I told them my next content which was also one of my passions which was making comedy and I was wearing a tube in the video, they started saying that they didn't like it and suggested for me not to upload it. They wanted me to post cover videos instead because old people were going to watch my videos and some subscribers were old. What worries me is that they actually have a point but I don't want my channel to be driven by the opinions of other people to the point that I'm not being me anymore.

I'm not going to lie, I want to be big and I researched on how to grow your YouTube channel and saw advice channels that said that you have to have your niche but what if I want to do comedy and covers both at the same time? I'm honestly so anxious and out of my mind right now. I wish this wasn't a problem of mine. 

What do you think I should do? Should I continue experimenting and doing me? or just give in to their opinion and stop my comedy ideas and just do covers altogether?",19Jun2020,1

I drove up the driveway kind of fast and the cat was in the way and I thought I was going to drive past him but he either moved in the way or I just had really bad judgement. Either way it was without a doubt my fault and I feel so awful right now. When I hit him he made the most haunting noise and it’s just playing in the back of my mind right now in a loop. I jumped out of the car and looked at him and he was gushing blood and looked like he was having a seizure. Within about 10 seconds he was dead and there was a pile of blood. I ran to the front door and my mom asked what happened and I said I just killed the cat. I was/ am still extremely traumatized by it. He was getting old and beat up but he still had life left in him.

Ever since I’ve been there the tech who works next to me seems to have it out for me.

Also I’m more liberal then everyone there and they are well, trumpers. I am half Mexican.

So this guy runs to the personnel manager of the transportation department anytime I do so something slightly wrong. Today I was doing training on a computer for five hours (were running 4-10s and we start at 6:30am) and he spent a hour of his time just watching me while talking to the other guys in the shop.

Because of a new system for highschool my country made they basically let everybody pass because we are new to it and need to get used to it (it's a big change in the system) and I'm one of the first people to get into that system. And my second year: the mid-year exams were fine it was in the new system but they didn't let it easy like my first year. But the final exams were a skip because of the virus we stayed home and took the exam (the new system involves tablets so we took the exams on tablets) at home so basically everybody made groups and passed the exam together. They were watching us through the tablet you say? No, because before the exams started THEY said themselves they won't watch us. And we already got our grades everybody passed yet again (except who didn't participate in the exam obviously) and because of this I got used to playing alot I barely study anymore and I can't stop it how do I get back on track?

I miss going out and being around people, especially people my age. I haven't had a friend or have even talked to someone my age in person for 3 years.

119,"After a year of enduring this nonsense, I finally decided to report my boss to HR for her unbelievably abusive tactics. I have a meeting scheduled next week to talk about it and I’m not sure what I should do to prepare. 

I know the role of HR is to protect the business, but at my boss has been verbally abusing me, my team, and entire departments for a year, and at this point I feel she is a bigger threat to the company than my reporting her. While we all work from home, her unprofessional tendencies have been even worse. She is a terrible, manipulative, downright mean person. People leave meetings in tears because of her. She chastises us in front of others, and invites others to join in. It oftentimes feels like she sets us up to fail. Her lack of communication skills and leadership skills are just astounding, and she doesn’t have any respect for anyone else’s time or workflow. She clearly doesn’t care about anyone but herself. People have literally quit because of her. 

I’ve never had a meeting of this sort with and HR person at any job and I’m very nervous. Apart from my boss, my job is really good; I enjoy what I do and my teammates. But my boss has made me consider following suit and quitting like my previous coworkers. The added stress of coronavirus and the protests against racism and everything going on in the world has been compounding and stressing me out, and I decided I need to do something about it. I emailed HR, and was met with a compassionate email that made me feel like they will take action. Luckily the meeting is not until next week, but I have no idea what to expect.    

What kInds of questions will HR ask? How do these sort of things usually go? Will I need to bring any evidence? I keep a document on my desktop detailing the more egregious incidents with my boss that I’ve had since May 2019, and just added a new one 2 days ago; should I bring that up? It feels petty, or like I’ve been plotting against her, but keeping that doc has just helped me feel like I can see the pattern in her behavior.

127,"I'll keep try to keep this short.

My university has an option to take a short 6 week long semester which is about to start next Monday. I have 2 classes lined up for it because I need be a full time student to keep my scholarship, and I already feel ready to give up. I know it sounds like satire but I just don't have any drive left in me at this point. I was reading the syllabus for one class which is trigonometry and I just don't think I can make it through this. 

My primary motivator the entire time I've been in college has just been to see this thing through to the end, (the thing being my education). I don't want to give up, I don't want all the work I did in school to go to waste. And I especially don't want all the hard work my parent went through to give me that education to go wasted. 

I'm just not looking forward to the rest of my degree or the career that will hopefully come after it. I'm in computer science but I just chose that because it seemed like a good degree, that could get me a good job, that could get me a good paycheck.

129,"For the past few nights my ex boyfriend, says he wants to commit suicide. Im the only one he talks to like this, he says I’m the only one who is able to help. 

He was so nice to me while in a relationship, and I tried my hardest to give him the world. When we started talking less though, I was honest with my feelings, and told him I didn’t think we would work. I broke up with him because of distance (we met online) and because I had other things going on in my life (dog might die, had to give another one of my friends the suicide hotline, etc)

We were in a relationship for less then 3 weeks, but according to him I hurt him and played with his feelings. I tried my hardest to make things up, talking to him and consitiently making sure he was okay. I wanted to be friends. Then I noticed his mental health started to decline. He became desperate and clingy. He started crying, posting it to his story every night, with captions like “I’m worthless.” I started to get really worried, and I contacted him a lot more just to make sure he was okay. This made our connection weird. Instead of being friends, I began acting like his therapist, only talking to him when he needed someone, and we never had a normal conversation that didn’t involve topics like suicide. 

If he feels like he might commit, it goes into my hands wether he lives. I guide him through proper steps, I have researched depression because I want to become a therapist and I remember what people on the hotline say through documentaries I watch. I still am no professional though, but whenever I give him the hotline he refuses to call. I can’t call the police because I don’t know his location since he lives so far away. I tried to convince him to tell his parents, but he has never done it and I don’t know his parents or his schools information so I can’t talk to them. 

I feel like everything is my fault, since everything is my fault. Once he posted on his story “sometimes people with depression and anxiety are clingy because they have been numb from emotions and you were the only thing that made them feel anything again. I felt this way and now he’s gone.” He was talking about me. I didn’t know I hurt him, I’m trying to understand how I can fix it, I’m really trying. I don’t know what I did wrong, I thought I was kind, but I feel like a monster and it’s making me so incredibly stressed because I was the one who made him sucidial in the first place. Because I left him. I never hurt anyone like this before, and I was never mean to him, or at least I didn’t think I was. 

He only talks to me about this, nobody else, and I feel so stressed because it’s all my fault. I need advice and I don’t know what to do, I feel scared and I’m constantly thinking about him. I’m only 14 and I don’t know how much more I can handle. I haven’t slept in 3 days, I’ve been doing nothing but worry, so this is my last hope. Please anybody give me advice. I need to save him, I was in the wrong and I hurt him, and the only thing I can do now is make sure he doesn’t kill himself.",19Jun2020,1
130,"So when I first moved in I had noted that the [panel](https://imgur.com/a/ljESTyA) on the ceiling in my bathroom was missing a screw and is not flush with the ceiling. It has a whole gap and is missing a screw. 

Well after a year of living here that gap/hole is becoming a growing issue. For starters, all the water that is \*supposed\* to be leaking from this panel to the tub is actually dripping from the hole that was left by a missing screw. So since March this hole has every now and then dripped water onto the wood floors. I have made 3 requests to have that hole patched or fixed properly. Well long story short it hasn't. 

First they vacuumed all the water out from the panel, and it stopped dripping for a few days. Then when it came back I made another request to have this fixed. They simply said to leave the AC on Auto because otherwise the unit will be overworked and cause the drip. I have always left this on Auto unless I wanted it cold in that moment then I would turn the ""Fans"" switch to ON and then back to Auto once I got the temp I wanted. 

So after some calls with the Apartment Management and suggesting that they either find a damn screw or replace the whole panel, nothing has yet to be done. 

It has gotten to the point to where last week the Unit actually ran out of Freon and subsequently made the apartment go as high as **84**. It was like that for 4 days. So they had a guy, keep in mind NOT someone from an AC repair company but a different employee from another apartment complex, to come fix it and refresh the freon that was missing. 

Thankfully the place went back to being nice and cool. Until today where it seems like we are back to square one. The apartment is getting as high as **82** so far. I have had this set to stay at **69-70**. 

What in the world do I do? 

TLDR; Panel has had a hole due to a missing screw for months causing leaks and dripping water on the floor. This main issue has not been fixed, just vacuumed. This has been going on since **March**.",19Jun2020,1

133,"I recently started a business project on my own and included two of my close friends. We are all professionals but hadn't worked together before. This started as a side project but prospects are looking good and we are now dedicating a lot of time to it. We'll probably get funds to dedicate ourselves full-time to it. 

The problem is, one of them is causing a lot of problems at work. He can't keep up with the level  that the project needs and there's a massive difference of experience between him and the other friend and myself. We weren't aware of that before as we thought he was much more professional than he actually is. He makes a lot of effort but unfortunately he hinders the project a lot, so we are all under a lot of stress.

We already had two serious talks meant to be a wake-up call for him, where we agreed to change his tasks and try to find the way of working together. We are convinced now that we can't work with him anymore.

The issue is that he can't accept any criticism and thinks we are just way too picky and we don't understand that he needs to learn. He refuses to decide to leave, even if he feels insecure and is obviously not comfortable at all working with us. 

I need advice on what to do to keep him as a friend. I know if we decide to kick him out it will probably be the end of our friendship. But if we keep going like this we'll also end up in very bad terms for sure. We are super stressed with the situation and we can't continue like this.

135,"I want to keep this brief, but also with context. To give some context, I'm 18. I have to decide my career path. My parents want me to be a doctor, but I'm not 100% on board. I always thought of myself more of a social sciences or a humanities kind of guy (major would be econ and minor would be philosophy or literature or english), and they completely think that it would he stupid for me to pursue that field. They say that becoming a doctor is the only respectable, profitable field, and also, they want to brag about me being a doctor to their friends and family. I love them, and respect them, so, for the longest period of time, I listened to them. In order to help make becoming a doctor more appealing for me personally, I always thought becoming a psychiatrist would be for me (it involves the least amount of touching patients, and I still get to study hoe the brain works and people. Basically, I told myself that Nietzche and jung were psychiatrists, so I could become an academic psychiatrist as well), or, I would work to help people within an industry thats already classically biased against people like me (poc). Idk, kinda cheesy, but I guess the thought of helping the mentally ill while still being able to enjoy the nuances of psychology and philosophy within medicine appealed a lot to me. Really cheesy and cringe, but thats how I rationalized it.


There are some issues, and have been some issues for a while, but here is the gist. A couple months ago, I was accepted into 2 schools. Both well regarded. One is in the US. Here, I would be able to explore, and at first I thought I would be able to find my passion, but then corona really hit my family hard, and the cost of the school now seems pretty high. Although still within our reach, it's gonna cost a pretty penny. Because of this, i feel like i'd be locked into becoming a doctor, as the pressure of my parents would get to me. They are paying for my education, and I think it would he dishonest to lie to them about what I'm doing (with their money nevertheless).


I was accepted to the second school a while back. Its in the United Kingdom, and I'd be majoring in international relations. The school is very well known for the subject, and I'd have the option of switching into economics (a field that I would pick after medicine) while minoring in philosophy. I know the school has connections to the bank santander, so worst comes to worst, I would work there, but, the pay wouldn't exactly be as high as that of a doctor. My dream with this school would be to go to grad school. The best part about this is that the cost is less, much less. Although im an international (live in the us) the option in the uk is my cheapest bet, and I feel like I wouldn't be under pressure of wasting my parents money or stretching their wallets thin, but, the only issue is that I wouldn't be doing medicine here. This is an issue for my parents, who again, don't think very highly of what I'd be doing (econ and then aiming for grad school, hopefully a top school here). 





I'm not sure what to do, and there are 2 paths, but I'm not sure where I'd be happier. I feel confused, panicky, and I'm more anxious now than I've ever been. One thing that is scaring me about my uk choice is what i'll do after school, since becoming a doctor seems like a clearer goal, I'm not entirely sure what to do with an econ degree or even what to do after grad school.

137,"So... backstory. My(F24) best friend, let's call her Deidra (F24), had her daughter, Cali, almost three years ago. The man she had Cali with was manipulative, verbally abusive (on the verge of physically), and just an overall bad person. They had only been together roughly six months when she found out she was pregnant- an issue with antibiotics cancelling out her birth control. The summer before Cali turned 2, I suggested she move to where I was- we had grown up in the same state for our entire lives until I moved away for college -and she agreed, because it would be a better place for Cali to live, and she'd be away from her abusive father (he didn't abuse *her* as far as I've been told, but was neglectful to her as a baby- basically Deidra did all the work post-birth) who didn't pay child support and needed supervision for any time with Cali.

So. They do the drive and we're renting a house together. I essentially become a live in, unpaid nanny to Cali. I don't mind helping. Deidra's working two jobs to pay rent and send Cali to daycare. She's not getting any money or help from Cali's father. I'll be more of a parent to Cali than he ever was, and I'm okay with that. Except now I'm starting to become Cali's full time parent.

Deidra got a new boyfriend (M28manchild). When they matched on the dating app, he was only living about 40 minutes away. However, he moved closer to his son through his ex-wife (about 2 1/2 hours away). But they decide to continue the long-distance relationship. They'll take turns visiting each other. But when Deidra is in a relationship, she can't think of anything else. Everything in her world revolves around who she's in a relationship with and nothing else matters. Especially her daughter and other peoples' lives. For example, one of my part time jobs is working with preschool aged children. Anyone who works in childcare knows that taking calls or texts is not easy, nor really allowed when watching children, especially when you're the only one there. I'm getting text messages from Deidra during this job about how she's planning on going to her boyfriends, but doesn't want to take Cali with her because she wants a ""child free weekend"". We had had previous plans in place, but now she's changing them. She's texting the group chat between the two of us, our third roommate and my boyfriend about who can pick up Cali and watch her tonight. 

I'm trying to talk Deidra into not changing the plans **TWO HOURS** before Cali needs to be picked up and I can only message so much because I'm working (which she knows). She's decided that, since none of the three of us are falling for her bullshit and are busy, she's going to ask her co-worker (who I don't know, who Cali doesn't know, who no one in our house hold knows) to go pick up and watch Cali until I'm done with work. 

I'm very bad at putting my foot down and saying no to things. I like helping people more than anything. That's why I usually bite my tongue and take over helping with Cali even if that means missing out on working over time or getting free time with my boyfriend. But this was one of the times I said no, and instead of thinking to herself, ""Wow, you know what, SafetyAndSeCRYity is telling me this isn't a good idea, changing set in stone plans so soon to a pick up time... I think I'll listen"", she breezes me over and is planning on leaving in thirty minutes.

(That example turned out longer than needed, sorry). Both our other roommate and my boyfriend have called her out on this, and then she pulls the waterworks, yelling about how we're all ganging up on her and calling her a bad mom, etc. But up until this point, I just want to be a good Godmother to Cali and best friend to Deidra who's struggling as a single mother because of an accident, right?

***RIGHT?***

About five or six months ago, I had stopped in Deidra's room (she doesn't hang up her clothing so I use the closet in her room since my room doesn't have one) to read over one of her journals. She had been doing them for the last four or five years since starting therapy, and she writes about you know... typical girl things. School. Boys. Everything. Whatever. I had first discovered them when she was renting my grandmothers house many years ago. And every once in a while I'll stop and read a snippet. Basically everything read, I knew (she told me everything- we are, after all, best friends). Her ex cornering her with Cali as an infant in her arms, threatening to take Cali away forever, breaking the window of his brothers car when he was angry at her, etc. And then I found it. The one paragraph that made my whole fucking world come to a stop.

Cali wasn't an accident. Cali was not a failed birth control pill. She and her ex had tried over and over to have a baby. And she was worried it would never happen. She and her piece of shit ex, who had been together maybe three months when they started TRYING to have a baby, had planned this.

And I know there were other circumstances that probably led to it. Depression, loss of self worth, a shitty father, a sister who had just died... but she brought this child, my Goddaughter, into this world because, what, she felt like that's what she needed? And now she pawns her off on me whenever she wants a ""child free"" night (which let's be honest, Cali is nearly three and sleeps through the night, every night is child free, *especially* since her boyfriend stays up until four AM) and... and I have not been able to look at her the same way ever since. I haven't said anything to her about my discovery.

Deidra and Cali are moving again. That 2 1/2 hours away to be closer to her boyfriend. You know... the one she hasn't known a whole year? The one that, when she was asking for help and support from him, stated ""That's your problem, she's not my kid""? And that one that saw a video of a young, male family friend playing with Cali and decided he couldn't trust her because he didn't know who he was and he was in our house? And you know, away from the five people- me, my boyfriend, our other roommate and my parents (who are basically Cali's grandparents) -who watch Cali more than she does?

I guess what I'm asking is, what would you do in my shoes? Would you confront her about it? And what about Cali? I know there's only so much I can do, and I asked my mother about it (because let's be honest, my mother usually has great advice), and she basically said Deidra moving here was a mistake, and that back home, even if it's not a great place to grow up and she'd be near her father, Deidra would pawn off Cali onto family members instead of maybe coworkers or people who barely know her.

And now I feel bad. Because I've basically taken Cali away from even more of her extended family. I'm really lost

139,"I think it's safe to say most people face depression at some point in their lives. 

There are times where it's not that bad, I can kinda daydream about wizards who smoke pipes and dancing frogs and just do my best to fight it, but lately I've been getting really bad, to the point where I've started having pretty scary thoughts. 

I can't really find the mental strength to fight it as easily as before. I know it'll pass, but it still really sucks when it rolls around. 

My question is, those who know what I'm going through, how the hell do you guys deal with this shit? Espescially at work, where I can't exactly lie down under a hot shower and feel sorry for myself (and I'm not allowed to listen to music either, so that's out of the question before anyone suggests it).",19Jun2020,1
140,"I just graduated high school, and my mother surprised me with a quilt that she had somebody make that was a collage of a bunch of my t shirts from different events. The idea is thoughtful and lovely, but the issue lies in the fact that she didn't ask before she raised my drawers. There are three shirts in there that I would have never in a million years wanted cut up and sewn into the blanket. Two are from a summer camp I attended for 8 years (I wore the shirts all the time and they had great memories attached to them) and one is from my freshman year jazz vocal festival. That was the first year I won an individual award for my solos and I was so so proud. It was the first time I felt like everybody saw me and recognized that I was good. I loved that shirt and the memories it carried. And now it's cut up and I can never take it to college or wear it again. Every time I look at the blanket I start crying. It's been a week and I still just tear up on sight. I know it's really dumb that I'm getting so upset but it's like the memories and the pride were destroyed too. She tried so hard to be thoughtful and I played off the initial tears as being overwhelmed by graduating and stuff (it was at my party) but I can't get it out of my head. I love her and I love that she put the effort into giving me something so personal but I'm so incredibly upset at the same time. I don't know if I should talk to her about it because there's nothing they can be done. I can't buy the shirts online because they were for the specific events. I'm just kind of stuck deciding between internalizing it and sucking it up or talking to her. What should I do?",19Jun2020,1

I have had recurring nightmares for the past 5 years about this, because I have a... complicated relationship with my parents.

I do not know how to bring this up to the surgeon tomorrow. I am worried they will try to report something if I let them know how bad the danger really is, or I will undersell the danger and be very at risk.

144,"He uses the n word a lot (we are both white) when he sings along to songs and when he’s telling a story in place of “really?” Like that kind of context. Never calling anyone the n-word, and to my knowledge he hasn’t expressed racist tendencies other than this. 

However it really bothers me and when I asked him to stop, he said “it’s just a word, words are all arbitrary and meaningless” which to me, just seems like a completely useless deflection of blame. Makes me wonder what else is going on in his head that he knows I’d be even less happy with. 

Not only might his casual use of the word be a dealbreaker, but his attitude when I tried to address it. I know I’m not “too PC” like he said for asking a white man to stop using probably the most inappropriate word he could possibly use. 

This is generally the only issue in our relationship outside of regular dishes and laundry issues that you can’t avoid no matter who you live with, or are in a relationship with. It doesn’t even come up that often, but today it rubbed me the wrong way and I’m not happy with him.",19Jun2020,1
145,"I met my ex—we’ll call her Millie—when I was 21. At the time, I was a virgin and hadn’t even had my first kiss, or even held hands with anyone. I have autism and have always been very sensitive to touch, which has been a barrier for me when it comes to intimacy. I’ve also always been super awkward and shy, as well as a bit of a hopeless romantic with a lot of hopeful ideas about love. After years of therapy and a lot of self improvement, I met a girl on my college campus who seemed perfect for me.

When we met, she told me she had kissed a few other people. I was fine with this and I disclosed to her that I had never been kissed before, and we spoke about how important it was for me to save that until I felt safe. About a month into knowing each other, we kissed for the first time. Things progressed from there and I believed the things we did together were firsts for her, too. We were in an exclusive relationship for 2.5 years and lived together for most of it (we still live together now).

I would never have been willing to be intimate with someone who had already been intimate with others (Millie was a virgin when we met, but had done quite a bit more than I could ever have imagined). I don’t mean to sound prudish here or judgmental—I absolutely believe that others should have sexual freedom and autonomy, but I also believe I deserved to have everything disclosed before I consented. I have always been deeply ashamed of my body and have had a hard time since childhood doing things like walking, looking people in the eyes, being touched, etc. So, I always intended to lose my virginity to someone in the same boat who could help me feel safe and loved.

For two years, I believed we had a very strong and trusting relationship. I put up with a lot—I was stalked by one of Millie’s friends, and never found out the truth about why until Millie told me about her actual history with this person over a year after the stalking began. This person would show up at my workplace and GOT A JOB THERE to intimidate me. And then, last September, Millie told me the truth. We were in the car and I nearly wrecked it I was so shocked and distraught. And it didn’t stop there...over a period of months, Millie disclosed crumbs of details to me until I came to see that ALL of the people she’d had me around (about 10 friends of hers) she had a history with. I’m still in shock and I feel so violated that she put me through all of that. I feel like Millie took something from me I would not have consented to if I knew the full story. It feels like all the hard work I did in therapy and on my own was for nothing, because it only led to pain.

I really tried to make things work with Millie because we are really dependent on each other. However, a few weeks ago, Millie gave me one final bit of information that caused me to break up with her, because it involved someone I’d considered a best friend and had even lived with. I’m so sick that I was around these people who knew the truth about Millie while I was left in the dark. Now the way they taunted me for my lack of experience (and what a “freak” I am) makes a lot more sense. I feel broken and used. My issue is not that Millie did these things—it’s that she didn’t tell me and give me a chance to break off my consent in the very beginning.

Is this a normal thing to be upset about? I feel childish and stupid that I’m so distraught over not having the “fairy tale ending” I always dreamed about. Is it a violation for someone not to disclose their sexual history if that disclosure would cause you to revoke consent? Millie has a lot of excuses for why she did what she did but, honestly, none of them have put my shame and confusion to rest.

148,"Before I start, I must mention that this has been happening to me for YEARS and I have done therapies but all have gone in vain.

I am the sort of person who takes things very seriously and I tend to overthink a lot. A lot of times it backfires. I look a lot into how people are talking among themselves or even talking to me, I always think people who are close to me are stressed because of me for some reason. I also think well in advance on how I am going to say to my friends even in a non serious conversations. Recently, this sort of overthinking has started taking a toll on my body. I have suddenly started feeling extremely nauseous and have thrown up almost every day due to it which has caused my head to continuously throb to the point I want to throw away everything I possess out of the window every time I wake up. 

A lot of my friends try and talk to me about it because they see a lot of red flags flashing due to the changes in my behaviour. But I don't reveal anything at all due to the fear of how they are going to judge me. The reason I'm asking people of the internet is because asking people you don't know for advice can help you, I've been told. Has anyone else felt the same and is it normal?",19Jun2020,1

She’s starting to understand her depression/ anxiety now and I don’t have it myself, however I feel like these teenage years have changed me because of this. I’m far less energised, positive or self appreciative than I once was and I can’t help but feel that my personality is now just a manifestation of my mum’s depression

150,"I don't even know where to begin while typing this out. I've been,for lack of a better word, addicted to self-help for a while now. Constantly reading new books but never implementing them. I've gained lots of good habits along the way like reading, meditating, journaling, and exercising. Yet I can't stop this feeling of needing to do more. I've tried so many things and quit that I feel like I can't start anything new.

I don't enjoy video games anymore because they feel like a waste of time. I can never get myself to start a new hobby because I tell myself I don't actually like it and I'm just pursuing this new hobby to try to make money. Note: I have done this waaaaayy too much in the past. From programming to graphic design, I always learn skills with some grand idea of making millions in the background.

I think this mindset has absolutely murdered my motivation to try anything new. I've considered blogging but I just feel like I will quit and I'm not even sure I enjoy writing, I've never been good at it. I looked at some programming projects to do for fun and none of them seem enticing enough to do.

Through meditation and journaling I've realized I have no idea what my values are and what I truly want out of life. I don't even know the right questions to start asking. I always try to self-diagnose a single problem that causes me to be unable to move forward but never really find any solutions.

I feel great when working, working out, journaling, and reading. But after that, once I have some true free time to do anything I want, I can't seem to enjoy anything. I don't find pleasure in Netflix or video games because they feel like a waste of time and I get anxious doing them. And I can't get myself to do anything productive because it never seems like something I actually want to do. All my ideas are just something to fill the void of doing nothing.

In the end I just watch Jordan Peterson or School of life videos for hours on YouTube trying to find some way forward in my life. I've never felt so without an identity. It is frightening and saddening.

156,"Kinda long, sorry. 

My mom isn’t the nicest. She puts on a good face in public but when she’s stressed out (which is pretty much all the time) at home, she can act pretty horribly towards me. Me and my therapist both think that she may have an unchecked borderline personality disorder and she is unwilling to listen to me and my sisters attempts to see how her behavior towards us has been abhorrent and abusive. But I understand how things could definitely be way worse as I have many resources at my disposal (medications, therapy) in order to learn how to cope, process, and even navigate my parents behaviors. I say parents because my dad is very passive and doesn’t do anything to stand up for me or my sister. But I didn’t come here to give a sob story, but I hope it will give some context. 

I have just turned 22 and am currently living at home with my mom and dad. I am working part time at a discount department store in my small town to save up money so that I can move out to begin my college career again after dropping out in 2017. I am also very introverted and have diagnosed bipolar ii disorder (which my parents deny to be real). I spend almost all of my free time alone in my room. I do have some hobbies I like to do but for the most part I just spend my free time relaxing/resting. You’d think the idea of a introverted person having to interact with people 9ish hours in a day and said person also already working at a higher frequency with a mental illness that this would be validation enough for me to spend my free time “hiding away in my room”. 

Well, if you were thinking like my mother, you’d be wrong. She is constantly nagging me and shaming me for being “cooped up” in my room and blamed my depression and lack of energy on the fact that I don’t “go outside enough” and that “maybe if I got out of bed more” I would have more energy. My job isn’t exactly hard and I don’t work every single day or even for the entire day but I cannot help to feel absolutely exhausted. I’ve tried to explain myself to her but she just sees it as me arguing with/disrespecting her and brushes off my “excuses” as “just my opinion”. I really cannot take much more of this, I just want to recharge in peace. My dad seems to be much more understanding but he doesn’t vouch for me in the slightest.

I immediately feel immense sadness and my chest hurts from the pressure. I feel like hiding in a closet and not moving forever. The feeling just spirals out of control and I start thinking about every bad thing about myself. Everything feels like it's sinking and sometimes I'll just cry non-stop. Sometimes I'll have suicidal thoughts but never contemplate actually doing it.

Usually the triggers come from seeing my physical appearance but it's not always about my looks. I hate how I look, talk and honestly just who I am as a person. I feel it right now after posting a selfie of myself on Snapchat for the first time in years and I'm about to take it down now. I just want to hide and be alone. It's affecting my social life.

I've been friends with this person since middle school, and we are both now in our early 20s. I consider him my best friend, we've been through so much together and I care about him more than anyone else ( other than family of course ).

 One day when we were 19 he suddenly dissapeared, and he had been living in a different state at the time so I had no way to physically check on him. I kept texting with no response and I was distraught worrying the worst had happened. Fast forward a few days and he contacts me on facebook messenger using his smart watch. His phone and laptop had been taken from him and his lawyer said he wasn't supposed to contact anyone but he had to talk to me. He then basically said he understands if I want nothing to do with him and that he is the stupidest person alive. I was just relieved he was alive and eventually everything got sorted out and we had a talk about it, things are back to normal now. 

He goes to therapy and feels terrible about it, he hates himself. A few months ago he confessed that the whole incident crosses his mind every once in awhile and gets him super depressed/beating himself up. He never touched a kid but he had a ton of CP on his computer. I've come to terms with it but recently I've seen people saying pedophiles don't deserve to live and how they shouldn't be talked to at all. Of course I agree that pedophilia is terrible and one of the worst possible things someone could do, but I honestly care about this person so much and I genuinely believe he is a good person.

163,"Hello. I am in high school and this sucks. Not the school in general, it's a pretty lovely building actually, but the social situation. 

I have had 3 friends since elementary school, lets call them Ricky Ticky and Tavy. Anyways, we have done everything together. We walked around after school, went to each others houses, birthday parties, we would play fortnite every Friday, all the jazz. We were even in a band. Well, me and Ricky and Ticky are in a band. Tavy doesn't play an instrument, but he went to practice which was cool because we could all hang out. 

So, last year things started getting wonky. When summer began, Ricky decided to transfer to another school, which I was fine with because he still lived close by in the same house, but unfortunately I saw him less. Thankfully however, the band did not break up and we still met every week. 

This year, we all moved up to high school. We were ready to dominate, and I even had Ticky in an advisory with me. Things were going great.....until I found out Ticky had a second band.

I know it seems stupid to be as jealous as a wife who finds her husband has a second family, but it hurt me, man. We still had our band and such, but to know that someone that you had committed so much time to play music with, had the same exact relationship with a couple of other kids that he had only known a couple months prior. The worst part for me was how out there his other band was. They had an instagram page, played some open mic nights, they even had CDs with original songs. 

Our band had none of that.

Ticky didn't really see the problem with that. I kept most of this to myself anyways, and we put it behind us, but slowly Ticky started spending a little more time with his band.

After a while, Ticky started walking around with his other friends after school instead of me and Tavy. We were cool with it, but it still felt like we, I at least, had been replaced so quickly. 

So me and Tavy would walk around after school, no big deal. We went to pizza places still, hung out at our houses. It was cool. 

Then something happened, but I don't know what.

Tavy was always kind of a weird guy. Hes like a brother to me, but he was a little hard to keep up with emotionally. He kind of acts without reason.

Anyways, one day after school, he told me he had plans with some other people. Don't get me wrong, its great he has other friends, so with Ticky, but he cancelled at the last minute. Because of this, I missed the bus and had to walk home (its like a 3 mile walk) which gave me time to think about what had gone down.

I wasn't really upset, but it was the first time I had really walked around without those guys in a while. I kind of began to think who else could I walk with, and I realized how much I depended on them.

As the months went on we slowly talked less and less with one another. Tavy stopped coming to practice, then sure enough Ricky, then we just called it off.

Sure enough eventually we stopped playing video games.

Even me and Ticky stopped talking in advisory.

Then quarantine began and it was like that walk home x1000. I needed to try to keep us together. I texted a group chat, last used months earlier, seeing if any of them wanted to play fortnite, Netflix party, anything.

None of them took notice.

Then, days later, Tavy responded a simple one word answer: ""pass.""

I went on instagram the other day. 

Ricky just had his birthday. 

Ticky has a girlfriend now and is working on an album.

Tavy is training with his friends for swim team next year.

I didn't know any of that.

I know you are a fool if you think you can change people. I know that if I could I would let them go, but I can't bring myself to do it. A year ago I would have followed these people to the ends of the earth. Now, I am lucky if I get a snapchat streak from one of them. 

I need them. I only realize now how much I needed them, when they are gone.

I can't loose them.",19Jun2020,1
164,"

I have tried everything imaginable to make myself good enough to date. I’ve lost 80 pounds, I’ve bought a car, I consistently hold down a job, I’m in college, I always have tried to better myself but nothing has ever made a dent. That leaves personality right? I don’t consider myself a saint but I think I’m a good person and I typically always keep people laughing. I have friends and I find that I’m good in social environments. The only thing left that I can think of is that I’m just not good enough.

My friends and even my therapist have tried to reassure me that I’m not ugly and that I’ll find someone eventually, but it’s just bullshit. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore because I can’t stand who I am. I have been on tinder since October and I have been on exactly 0 dates. I’ve had people review my profile, help me make my bio, I’ve had my friends take my pictures, and yet nothing happens. I haven’t even had a like in 2 months, I pay for tinder gold so it tells me when that happens. How am I supposed to believe I’m not disgusting? I can’t think of anything I like about myself and I don’t blame any woman who would want better.

Like I said; I can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore, It ruins my day. I have nothing positive to say about myself and honestly prefer to never look or talk about me. I feel worthless and everyone around me has always reinforced that, and now trying to date really has just driven the point home. I have completely surrendered to apathy and I don’t fight it anymore. I’ll never have anyone to come home to, nobody who cares if I’m around, nobody who I can be best friends with and share my life with. I have nothing to look forward to and nothing to work towards.

I have a session with my therapist tomorrow and I’m thinking about telling her that it should be our last. She’s great and seems to know what she’s talking about, but at this point I’m just a lost cause and I’m tired of wasting peoples time. I’m not going to be able to be convinced that my life is worth living anymore and I don’t want her to institutionalize me. I’m just exhausted with trying to deal with this when I’ve never had anyone else who cared. Not even romantically, I’ve just never had anyone care about how I feel or act like they appreciated me. 

I don’t know how to get out of this but I don’t feel like any amount of work or medication will fix it. Girls are never going to be in to me and I’m sick of trying to hold out hope for life to get better. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks",19Jun2020,1

Also, I have been informed that someone rough looking has been asking where I live. So now I have to worry about a gang related home invasion. It could be by NS because he left the gang life or the bloods for the beating.

Either way I want to know way to prepare for a home invasion, I am a 6 foot dude who is pretty lean in shape. I also know how to fight well. 

My current game plan is to have police on my energy phone contacts and have that always ready. I also have metal bats and tomahawks and an assortment of blunt weapons but no firearms. 

I live in the literal middle of nowhere, I’ve been thinking if I should buy a large siren or that electric horn thing. I have a lot of sensor lights for bears and the such on all the time so that may scare them a little. 

Yeah, that’s the current situation, if you have any tips or suggestions please leave them for me to read!

What should I do next? (18M)
I'm 18, worked at a restaurant since 14 night shifts after school and saved up just over 12k of which I've purchased a second hand car and invested around 7k in a broad index fund.

I started University this year for a media/film degree and im VERY skeptical that I will actually get a job out of the degree. I also have developed the view that University isn't a very good idea for these kind of degrees as half of the stuff I've learnt so far I could've easily learnt with a google search free of charge.

Here is a little about what I'm doing:

I just launched the Kickstarter for a **Radically Diverse and Inclusive Children's Book**! This idea was created when I searched online for a personalized children's book for our godson and realized every website makes you select ""boy"" or ""girl"" right away and it limits the rest of the customization options depending on that choice. I've been in LGBTQ+ social services and advocacy work for the last 10 years and wrote the stories with personal growth and social justice framework.

I would love your feedback and any ideas for future books! If you can watch the video (its only 2 mins)! I could also really use any help sharing with parents who are passionate about affirming and empowering books!

176,"I know that the title isn’t great but I don’t know how else to word this. Sorry. I also don’t know if this is the right community, sorry again. 

Anyway, I’m 17 turning 18 but still look relatively young. Without giving away to many intimate details, I’ll just say that I’m not as “mature” as the girls in my year or half on the girls in the years below me. People regularly get confused about my age and don’t believe me when I say that I’m 17. People usually think I’m around 14-15, not too bad most of the time but it’s where the pedo thing starts.

My friends are genuinely nice people and I’m not to fussed when they poke fun at my height/chest size/body type, it’s all in good fun and they don’t mean anything by it. However, more recently they’ve sort of latched onto the the pedophile joke after one of my friends said anyone who finds me attractive would have to “be placed on a watch list”. I’m not going to lie and say that it didn’t sting a little since it was much harsher than anything before it. But I forgot about by the end of the day.
Then I made everything worse when me and a guy I like went on a friendly date. My friends kept insinuating about how hes a closet pedo or but blatantly calling him a or pedophile (in a joking fashion but still calling him a pedo nonetheless)

I know they think their being funny and I’ve told them to stop because it’s making me feel kind of shitty, mainly about my appearance and the guy doesn’t think it’s as funny as my friends do. I can tell it’s really starting to annoy him, which sucks because we have been getting along pretty great so far.

I’m at a loss on what to do here, they won’t stop and it’s not like I can go and my new friends. Is this something other people have gone through? Will this just go away on its own?

He pushed himself away from friends and family which almost drove him to suicide. I sympathize with my ex because of this and I don’t want him to do what my brother did.

Throwaway first obvious reasons. 

I’m a senior now, and I’m not sure what to do for college. Over the past years I’ve been running businesses online and I have saved over $100,000 for myself. I am ok in school, but I really like focusing on my businesses. I want to continue running my businesses in college which is why I want college to be as easy as possible for me. I definitely want to go to college so my major can be something I can fall back on if my businesses fail. 

Should I go to community college? Or should I attend a 4 year? I want to have some fun in college while maintaining a good gpa and running my businesses, but I’m afraid that I will have to shut down my businesses in order to focus on college because everyone tells me college is hard.

183,"I had a ""Your best isn't good enough"" conversation with my supervisor yesterday and I'm feeling pretty down. Being outgoing is a big part of my job, but I need a little time to warm up to people. I work at a private tutoring company, BTW. I have a great relationship with some of my clients who really like what I bring to the table for them. But my habit of being serious and professional at first seems to put new clients or ones who don't know me well off.

This is something I've struggled with for a long time. I try to be pleasant to everyone, but the whole thing of making myself seem like a friend off the bat isn't easy for me. As I said, it takes time for me to get that comfortable with people. 

Kids are an exception. I'm told I'm very good with kids and I enjoy goofing around with them. I don't feel the need to put on my ""professional"" hat with them.

Nothing is written in stone and my contract is good for several more months. But I'm feeling down and wandering if it might not be best to move on to somewhere else. I'm updating my resume, going to sharpen up some skills, and look around for what out there.

But mostly I'm just not sure how to get over how disappointed in myself I am. Being good at my job is really important to me. My supervisor said she thought despite my training and experience, I hadn't learned to connect like a professional should. That hurt a lot.

192,"So I am a 22F dating a 20M. We have Ben dating about a year but have known each other longer.

So, a few weeks back, my boyfriend was taking a shower. He had been in there a while, so I went to check on him as he has fallen asleep in there before and almost flooded the bathroom. Sometimes I also sneak in to surprise him in the shower and shower with him. However, this time I went in and I could hear something, so I paused at the shower to listen. When I opened the curtain, I found him sitting down, masturbating. I was devastated. I left the room in tears. I felt so unwanted. It felt like I wasn’t enough for him or he doesn’t find me attractive and here is why. Her is the thing though: I don’t think masturbation is bad or wrong. It’s normal and I understand that. However, I feel like if you are in a relationship and the person is there, there isn’t really a need for it. It’s different if they are on a trip, or at work, etc. I would say I have a higher sex drive than my man. I would have sex with him anytime, anywhere. I always want him. I also am very vocal about it, I let it be known. I don’t expect him to read my mind or anything. He does not initiate sex very often, despite saying he’s horny all the time. He tells me that he doesn’t really know how to initiate sex sometimes and that sometimes I still make him nervous but that sounds like a lie honestly. This specific day, when I caught him masturbating in the shower, I had tried to have sex with him multiple time. He didn’t want to. That’s what hurts even more..because it’s not like I’m not fulfilling him. When I caught him, he told me it was simply just an urge he had that he did. He said he was thinking about me. Then, later he said he was doing it to come and have sex with me so he can last longer. The thing is, when he cums he gets very sensitive and can’t be touched for a while so that still seems suspicious...I’m always up for sex with him 100% and I always try to keep things interesting. I’ll give him surprise blowjobs, sometimes even while he’s playing video games. I try to be the best girlfriend I can be and try to keep him satisfied. Now, even a few weeks later, I still find myself hurt by him doing that while I was in the next room, especially since I was wanting to have sex. When he showers, I find myself wondering about what he’s doing. If he’s masturbating, if he’s thinking about other people. The thoughts consume me. I find myself listening at the bathroom door to see if he’s doing it again. I know; I feel so bad for doing this I know should have privacy. But this isn’t just any guy. I am in love with him. I am almost 100% positive this man is my soulmate. I don’t want to break up but this has caused me to sort of distance myself a little bit. I’ve noticed I’m distancing myself but it’s like I can’t stop, because I’m afraid of being hurt. Am I wrong to feel this way? Any advice on what to do? I feel like now he doesn’t like my body/ doesn’t want me and he’s the only guy I was ever super comfortable enough with to be comfortable in my own skin. Now all of that is gone 😞.

I caught my boyfriend masturbating in the shower after I tried to have sex with him all day; he didn’t want to. I was just in the other room.

My bosses didn't respond and everyone I spoke with said that it was very personal and was very unnecessary and some people even said it makes me look insecure as if I don't think I can do my job.**

So now, I am extremely stressed because I feel that my bosses are having second thoughts about promoting me and now **I feel like I have to be walking on eggshells to prove myself at work because I made myself sound so insecure and immature in the text message.** Am I overthinking and worrying too much, or should I be worrying this much?",19Jun2020,1

206,"I’ll try to give all the details that are relevant to the situation.

My boyfriend is 21. For the last few years, he’s worked as a salesman. Not the most prestigious career of course, but he made good money.
He has never went to college or anything. He recently quit his job for multiple reasons that i totally understand. He has enough savings to go along for a while.

But, i hate him doing nothing all the time. It’s just not attractive to me. Right now, he has some physical issues that stop him from working, and i really try to be understanding, but it’s hard! Personally im ambitious and hard working. 

I expressed these feelings to him, and he said he is ambitious too, but he doesn’t know where to direct it towards. What he really wants is to go to college, but he doesn’t know for what. I’ve tried making suggestions or whatever but he’s never enthousiastic about anything. I know he’s “old” but he had a rough start in life and i do believe he’s serious about this. His parents dont and never have supported him and he’s also scared of getting a huge loan and ending up not liking his major. How can i help him and be supportive, but also express the importance of the matter?

For the record, i dont think he’s a good for nothing, and i dont intend on breaking up with him. I trust he’ll end up okay. Dont bother suggesting me that. But i have to admit, im a little ashamed to tell people my boyfriend is doing nothing at the moment...",19Jun2020,1
207,"Hey y’all, I’m just looking for some advice on the situation with my mom that I’m dealing with right now. I’m 18 years old, just coming out of a one-year diploma program in college, and I took the time off to be a full-time student. Since I am graduating in one month, I have begun to look for a job within the past two weeks and have had a few successful interviews. Today I just received a job offer that would require me to move out of state in a week. I will be relocated with accommodations And I’m really looking forward to this opportunity, it was so thrilling to receive it. Today I attempted to open up the conversation with my mom and tell her that I will be leaving which I was very nervous to do. I told my mom that I received an offer, and I told her the place that I would be going to, however she would not even let me describe the details of the job or the contract. She simply stated that I need to focus on my studies and I would be making a foolish mistake by going out of state and that I should just enjoy my summer here, and I can get a job later but not now. So basically she did not want to speak to me anymore and said she would contact me at some point later on this week. I have to leave in 5 to 6 days to get to my new place of accommodation and I’m worried if I do not restore this relationship with my mom and allow her to agree with me moving, it will damage our relationship and I do truly love my mom, but I do need a job and look forward to it. 
I would truly appreciate advice on the situation, particularly if anyone has gone through a similar situation. 
Thanks!!",19Jun2020,1
208,Hi I (17M) have decided after months of research that I want a motorcycle. They are better than a car in almost every way but my parents don’t see it that way. And I know that there is a chance that they won’t ever support the idea because they are parents. But they act like me buying a motorcycle is the equivalent to tying a weight to my ankle and jumping in the lake. The idea has been mentioned before but we haven’t really had a long talk about it. The times that it has been mentioned the conversation only lasted a few minutes and ended with my Dad saying that I wouldn’t be on his insurance. Which I’m fine with. I am confident that I can purchase a motorcycle without their assistance. But I would still like their support which I totally do not have right now. Any advice is appreciated!,19Jun2020,1

Because of a new system for highschool my country made they basically let everybody pass because we were new to it and need to get used to it (it's a big change in the system) and I'm one of the first people to get into that system. And my second year: the mid-year exams were fine it was in the new system but they didn't let it easy like my first year. But the final exams were a skip because of the virus we stayed home and took the exam (the new system involves tablets so we took the exams on tablets) at home so basically everybody made groups and passed the exam together. They were watching us through the tablet you say? No, because before the exams started THEY said themselves they won't watch us. And we already got our grades everybody passed yet again (except who didn't participate in the exam obviously) and because of this I got used to playing alot I barely study anymore and I can't stop it how do I get back on track?

Most of my friends have gotten cars from their parents and get jobs from them while I still walk and take the bus everywhere. I’ve been struggling to find a job while everyone around me is stacking money and preparing for their future. I feel pressured by my parents to excel and find a career I can be passionate about. I’m going into my last year of high school and I have very little idea of what I want to do in my life. I find it hard for me to stick to one thing and create a plan and I get overwhelmed when I try to think about what to do. I feel like a bum but I don’t want to just feel sorry for myself for the rest of my life. The only passion I’ve found myself sticking to is exercise because it’s the one thing I can always do to clear my mind. I guess I need advice on how to find my “spark” and start being successful. I get rejected by every job I apply to and it just lowers my self esteem. My girlfriend has a car from her parents and always tells me about the jobs her wealthy family gives her while I can’t relate. Like I said I just have no idea what I can do to become successful.

I dont want to vote for anyone this year and I dont think my political party should stand in between my friends and me. But they tell me party does matter. I ask my best friend if I should just lie to keep them but she told me if I cared about them more I would change, as being conservative makes me racist and homophoic. I never believe it did, I just believe in gun laws and I really hate taxes. I never even consider it being a big deal until now. I have decided that if they were really my friends they wouldnt care about what party I am in as I still love them and we pretty much believe in the same stuff.

i had this boyfriend that i was really into and we broke up about two months ago. normally, i wouldn’t go too crazy over breakups or anything but he essentially said that i forced him into the relationship/that he felt forced into it because he didn’t wanna seem like a bad guy for rejecting me and also i had already told him some more personal stuff so that made him feel more obligated. he said that he never felt anything for me and that the whole relationship was bullshit because i didn’t do anything in it. i don’t think a good amount of what he said is accurate or at least it doesn’t line up with my experience but the thing he did say is that he was constantly having to deal with my anxiety and shit especially when he mentioned other girls and it was what made him not like/love me like he said he did. i know i have a lot of anxiety and insecurity and i relies on him too much but he said that i was toxic and unchangeable and i guess i’m just worried that i’m draining to everyone. i felt safe with him so i told him a lot of stuff but i did it too much and now he hates me. i also made the really bad mistake of telling newer friends that i had made about the breakup and my experience and stuff and it definitely seems like i was trying to spread things. i wanted to talk things through with someone but one person that i’m not super close to isn’t going to be willing to sit through the same thing more than once and ig that’s what i needed. but because i told people, it ended up spreading  and i feel absolutely awful. it sucks that he lied about how he felt the whole time and how he liked another girl but dated me anyway but at the same time i’m worried that i was a terrible girlfriend like he said i was and that i’m toxic and a bad person. during the relationship he never gave any indication that anything was wrong so i feel like complete shit for not noticing and now i’m worried it’s because i was too caught up in my own problems.",19Jun2020,1

217,"Hello, I'm in a bit of a situation. For the past 2 summers I've been participating in a summer camp as a staff. My experience there hasn't been great, I never got to participate in the field trips the kids went on because favoritism among the staff; and my second year I was the only staff assigned with a special needs kid (they said I could handle it, based on my past performances) and they later told me they had to give me a  harsh end of the year review because I was working with a special needs kid. 

Due to this harsher treatment, I got a medium review; during the rehiring process I was told they don't take into account special needs kids or anything so I got a medium review for nothing. As a result, I didn't get to move up and be a camp counselor for the older kids.

I rejoined this year because I figured I could use more money but the circumstances have changed for me significantly. I now have 2 jobs that pay the bills well enough; and I noticed more unfair treatment as staff that have been their for one year have been promoted to work with older kids and I haven't. 

Additionally the job isn't what it used to be anymore. I live down south and due to Covid-19 they're making us stay outside the whole time (12:30pm-6pm) as well as wearing a facemask (I have trouble breathing in them asthema) and playing with kids. Additionally their are a lot of new rules and restrictions; everyone has to keep 6 feet apart and we can't play with toys like cards, balls, or really much else. We also have more responsibilities such as cleaning/disinfecting a crazy amount (we we're told we're expected to use at least a bottle of hand sanitizer/wipes a week). 

Due to all of these reasons I'm highly considering quitting. The only issue is I did all the paperwork an, today we had training from 7am-3pm and the job starts the 29th they also gave us 3 staff training shirts. I don't want to hurt the camp or my partner (we work with 10 kids 2 staff) and  I know it'll be hard for them to find a replacement staff for me in such a short notice, also the lady who runs the camp is a genuinely great person I wouldn't want to inconvenience that I've been working with for the last 2 years. They're also pretty big on my resume since I've been with them for 2 years and I'm 19 so I don't want them talking trash. 

I know if I tell them I'm not interested in doing camp anymore they'll try to keep me in by saying to try it for a week (which I can't imagine being too enjoyable). What do you guys recommend doing? (Also worth mentioning this would be my last year with them since I'm moving this October permanently.)

\[Ideally, I don't have to go in the 29th and I can put this all behind me. I was thinking probably writing an apology letter saying this isn't what I was expecting out of the job wishing them the best as well as returning the 3 camp staff shirts and just eating the loss of training\]

\------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** I'm working as a day camp counselor for the third year in a row. I'm highly considering quitting before the job begins as they haven't treated me fairly and this year is supposed to be way more challenging than our paygrade. Only problem is I don't want to hurt the camp as I imagine this would significantly inconvenience them; and I've already done the paid training/paperwork. We start the 29th, and I was wondering what the best thing to do in this situation would be. Thanks!",19Jun2020,1
218,"I (19M) met a girl on tinder, and she was amazing. She really seemed to be my type, super sweet, witty, funny, etc. About 12 days ago, I asked her if she’d like to meet up for the first time. I knew that she had family members (new born baby) to watch out for during this pandemic, so I offered to wear masks, distance, all that good stuff. She said that she would let me know later in the week because she just got a new pet, and was worried that the older one was going to fight the much smaller one. So I let it be. 

Flash forward to last weekend, I’m still not updated if she can hang out. 

Whatever, I understand, life is wack, so I drop it. 

I was planning on asking again this week, but then I realized I have all this school work and yard work to do, so I probably couldn’t meet up with her. But that also got me thinking about how she hadn’t offered to hang out after my initial offer. So, for some reason, I decided to stop texting her. 

Now here I am, haven’t texted her since Monday, and I’m honestly regretting it. I have this issue where if I don’t text somebody, but they also don’t text me, especially after I’ve made efforts to talk to them, I become really stubborn and will not text them.

221,"I have been writing and releasing music on various platforms for about two years now. When it comes to the current climate around racism, I have felt that my silence is enabling more brutality. For this reason, I believe it may be helpful to use my song writing ability to collaborate on a single with another artist friend who is in the black community. We both started having conversations about a month ago and agreed on the best way to go about it. He was/is very happy to work on the project with me.

He agreed that the best way to execute the song was to have him take the lead on it and have my verses only support or amplify what he had to say. Obviously I agreed with this. My verses mainly discuss how i'm trying to learn more about the issue and grow as I expose my past ignorance. An example of some of the lyrics are: ""this movement is not about me"", ""truth be told I'm really sorry for my ignorance"".

The reason I am making this post is because one of my friends (also white) recently reached out to me and said that he didn't think I should go forward with the single. To summarize his reasonings, he said that the title of the song was problematic, I was using my privilege to speak on the issue instead of letting POC take the spotlight on it, and that I was using the fact that my ""black friend"" was on the track to give me a pass on saying what I wanted.

The title of the song is called, ""I can't breathe"". His argument was claiming that the title implies that this phrase is about me when realistically, I as a white person can breathe just fine with no worry of being killed. My response was that the title is actually meant to spread awareness of how awful it is that these words are so often the final ones of those killed by police brutality because of their skin. The title is very similar to how people of all races chant ""I can't breathe"" at protests.

Another response I gave him was that it was 100% a collaborative song that would release on both mine and my friend's platforms.

I continued by assuring him that my friend read over my lyrics and approved of them and thought they were very helpful and tasteful. He replied by saying that just because I have one black friend that supports us collaborating on the song together doesn't mean the rest of the black community does.

I'm sure that in doing this song I am being ignorant to some extent but I believe that I can't let my imperfectness stop me from talking about this issue. As of now we are still planning to release the single since it has been recorded and is in the process of being mixed already.  Should I go through with it?

222,"I’ll keep this short but my entire life I’ve had this complex(?) kind of feel like I don’t “belong” anywhere. 

I don’t think anyone here really would care why or what caused this cause it’s a long story but how do you live like this. 

I have no friends, no real family, no one. I’m in my third out of the five years I’ll be in college so this is really starting to affect my studies.

223,"Going to be long so TL;DR at the end!

Okay, I know how dramatic the title sounds, but I really need advice, so hear me out.

I (19F ) was best friends with this girl (20F) for years. I was closer to her than I was to anyone else- she and I had this crazy cosmic connection that I can't even begin to explain. When I was going through a hard time where I had no connection to my family, was made to feel like an outcast at school, etc., I had her. We were inseparable- she was like my twin sister. Because of this, I have SO many memories with her. Amazing, feel-good, touching memories that make me smile with fondness. Whenever I watch certain shows, listen to certain songs, or go to certain places, I think of her. 

Unfortunately, we had a falling out. I wish I knew what exactly caused it. Teenage jealousy, angst, whatever. She spread rumors about me, isolated me from what few friends I had gathered at the time of our falling out (including the one other friend I'd had since I was 3 years old), did everything she could to get them to believe what she said about me. Flirted with a guy I really liked until he dumped me, etc. And, as a teenager with no guidance, I freaked out and let it destroy me. I know that doesn't seem very bad reading it now, but as someone who had a pretty big chunk of my heart, I felt so hurt and betrayed when this happened. My already low self-esteem crumbled, and so many people turned their backs on me. I felt so alone. I was also 15-16, which explains a lot, lol.

It's been a few years since she and I stopped talking- I basically managed to weed her out of my life. I'm doing much better self-esteem wise, although that's more related to me sort of discovering who I am than detaching from her. I saw her recently at a restaurant that she works at (not an intentional encounter) while I was there with my boyfriend, and later that night after I left, she requested to follow me on Instagram. 

Ever since then, I've been seeing these things, hearing songs, going places that remind me of her. I've still got an incredibly small group of friends, and I don't spend time with them frequently. I've found that I miss the friendship, and catch myself wondering if I should extend the olive branch. Part of me thinks that maybe, since we're older, there will be no more of that petty drama, and we could connect on the level that we did before. Another part of me, however, knows I'm probably just lonely and reminiscing too much on the good memories, instead of reminding myself of how it felt to be so hurt during the bad. What if she is still the kind of person who would hurt me?

So reddit - should I do it?

(P.S. She and I have no romantic connection- I've been asked that before.)

TL;DR: Best friend that I had a cosmic connection with hurt and betrayed me as teenagers. Now that we're in our 20's and she's been out of my life, I'm realizing I miss the friendship and am considering extending the olive branch.",19Jun2020,1

I’ve never had that satisfaction of going out with a group of friends and just letting loose and having a blast. I always get bored because no ones there, feel out of place bc I’m there with one person and everyone else has a group, or get to the place too late (which is my fault) and it’s closing before I can have fun. Bars close at 2 which is early in my eyes and by the time we find a fun spot it’s time for them to close most of the time. 

But I have no idea how to find girls that I can do that with.. I have friends that are girls, but they’re not the going out type. Every time I ask my best friend to go out she finds an excuse not to go or just ignores me.

227,"I need to tell someone with some sort of anonymity. I apologize because this will probably be a long post I wanna start this off by saying I'm a 22M and that I have never hurt a child, and I have absolutely no intention of it. I have no compulsions towards it either, I am able to have a relationship with a person my own age no problem.

I don't know if this helps at all for context but I was very sexually active at a young age; around 12 or so. I also got involved with pretty shitty people and started smoking weed and drinking around this age. I became very addicted to porn at a young age as well. The last thing here I want to add is that I dropped out of high school on my second day of sophomore year. Please don't think that I am using this to excuse my actions, just context.

So, I've masturbated to Lolicon (hentai depicting young children), Rule34 with the same thing, and some jailbait. This is when I was younger probably around 14/15? I don't remember specifically. I would go on obscure point websites, nothing CP related but sometimes you would click a video and a random link would pop up as another tab and bring you to some random website. That's when I found photos of young girls in like swimsuits I guess. Very limited clothing, and in various poses that make me sick looking back on it. There was also one time when I was very young I think around 14, and where the Deepweb creepypastas were a really big thing, and I was interested in reading them. I downloaded the program I needed and tried to look at stuff. I click on some random forums and drug selling websites. Thing is, I remember seeing like one of those fucking pedo websites and I clicked on it. Nothing loaded and deleted everything used to access it and never went back there. I would masturbate to all these things, as well as regular porn on and off for a few years. I would never download any of these photos, nor did I seek out the website directly, but I created this thing in my mind that if I found it by accident it would be okay. It isn't, it wasn't, and it's not. Also to clarify, I'm speaking specifically about the websites that involved real people. Not the hentai websites, I still visited those for a long time.That is the problem though, that I indulged in it at all, all of it. The hentai, those weird websites, the rule34, and made excuses for myself and disgusting behavior. I stopped all of it dead in its tracks a couple of months ago and would have a major panic attack for the last few years if I even looked at any of it. I was doing fine for a minute, but I read something about pedophiles and can't help but think that I'm the worst type of person, and I'm right back in the cycle of panic attacks, even though I still stopped masturbating to everything except ""regular porn"". I say regular because it's still weird shit, it just doesn't involve any roleplay or anything of children.

Also adding to all this is that I'm pretty sure I have OCD, I know self-diagnosis is not to be trusted, but I have terrible anxiety and panic attacks about a wide range of things. I have a fear of going schizophrenic, thoughts that I might hurt someone, and now that I'm a pedophile. Aside from the first two, this one is the worst and I believe the root of all my anxiety for the most part.Here's the thing. I want to be better, truly. I want to not even think about any of this stuff ever again and for the love of God to be normal. I feel terrible about what I masturbated to, and want to be a better person, but I feel so lost now. I sit there in my mind and I don't want to hurt anyone and have no intention to, but I get these intrusive thoughts that I'm a monster, psychopath, pedophile, and schizophrenic person. I don't know what to do, I can't talk to my parents about this, I'm afraid that they'll kick me out, and i'll be shunned from my family forever. My dad was talking about how he thought that we should kill all pedophiles. Doesn't matter who.I feel so lost, and I know a lot of people will probably think I'm already a terrible person, and I agree with it.

I just want help, and have no clue how to get it or where to go.Thank you to anyone that reads this.",19Jun2020,1
228,"Recently I've been really nervous about a lot of things. Like for example I  would hear our dogs bark non stop at night, our roof making weird sounds, what I'm going to do tomorrow, contemplating on my life choices or if I have worth in my life and many more. To me , waking up for another day is hard.

There are times that I really want to just end it all. I'm so tired of everything and my mom thinks I'm just flat out immature (I'm 22). I have so much suppressed anger that I want to vent out on her but at the same time she'd just blame me for being slow. 

I view myself as stupid, due to being socially awkward and unable to express myself do to other people being so judgemental. (Mom told me I had terrible social graces) I'm always nervous and scared of many things. Like trying something new because I fear failure and I fear what other people thinks of me.

This one of the few reasons I left my previous work. ( My mom basically forced me to work in a place with a lot of people) because one of my advisors decided that I was unfit to work in that certain place because of my fear of people ( I dont blame them), I lasted about 4 or 3 days before they let me go.

Now I dont know what to think anymore. So many things scare me and I don't know the reason. I dont know who to turn to because were quarantined in our house. My mom wont be any help because she doesn't care about these kind of troubles and would just constantly blame many things for a reason

Please someone help me. I'm scared of so many things. Can someone at least advice me how to lessen my fears so I won't have to live like this anymore. It's so hard...",19Jun2020,1
229,"Hey everyone! I was wondering if people could give me some input.

I'm a very punctual person. I'm always on time, if it's an event, going to a friends house to hang, or meeting a specific spot I'm there. My ""friends"" on the other hand aren't punctual. Now I totally understand if there was an emergency or something came up last LAST minute but... there's one thing that frustrates me.

I feel like my friends don't respect my time even though I respect theirs (by showing up on time). I feel like I always get strung along the whole day just to hear ""Hey I can't hang anymore"". Instead of the person realizing they're making me wait the whole ass day just for them to say ""I can't"". My friends just think they can ""IM sorry I was late"". And me to continuously say ""It's okay haha"" or ""It's okay, another day we can hang"". Now I don't expect every single one of my friends to be the way I am. I can't control them but I would love if they realized more what they're doing. And how they're hurting me and making me feel frustrated. 

Cause sometimes I waste my whole ass day for these people just for them to flake.... or show up later (to my house) than we said.

So.... I'm not sure what to do. Cause this recently happened to me yesterday. People not showing up on time. Slacking bs.

Should I just not care that they're gonna be late. Should I just keep letting them do this to me and my time, should I care and speak up more, should I stop hanging with them? Any other ideas of what I should do. Cause I honestly struggle on who I think is my friend and who I think just hangs with me cause they're bored and they feel bad cause they haven't seen me. OR just because I brought up ""How you been. We should hang sometime"". I feel like I'm just getting pushed over. I guess since I have always been brought up in a punctual family, when I encounter people who aren't I become upset cause it's both of our times wasted in the end when one person shows up an hour late.

I also don't wanna come off bitchy or anytime.... I'm just honest with how I feel about all this and I'm upset at them.",19Jun2020,1
230,"Years back when I was a lot younger (I'm in my early teens) my grandma died. I loved her a lot and I miss her. But there's one thing that messes with me. The day she died, my mom asked me if I wanted to come with her. I didn't always like going so I said no. She came back hours later and told me my grandma died. I was given a choice and turned it down because I was being a little baby about it. I feel a lot of guilt and I saw pictures of my grandma and it all came back. I suppress the guilt but honestly I want to cry rn. How do I get over my guilt I've been carrying?",19Jun2020,1
231,"See title. My Dad's puppy is showing signs of separation anxiety. 

He starts whining and howling as soon as somebody leaves him by himself. 

Ex. if I step out of the room for 30 seconds to use the bathroom he starts crying. 

I've been trying to leave him alone with a stuffed kong to entertain himself with, and I try not to ""reward"" his crying by coming to him. 

I feel like part of the issue is the fact that my Dad and his roommate have been home the past 3 mos. due to COVID, and his roommate brings the puppy with her all the time in the house. 

Like, it's to the point where the dog is either with my Dad or the roommate for 90% of the day. He's barely left alone.

The bathroom is always humid, water all over the countertop, soap &amp; c*m residue everywhere inside the tub. The dishes are never cleaned and put away. Dog fur everywhere &amp; I’m severely allergic to them. They often cook and leave food out to literally rot. I’ve brought these things to their attention a lot already but they won’t do anything so I always always end up cleaning, mopping, wiping &amp; organizing everything by myself. I don’t want to live in filth but they also don’t want to help... they walk over their spills. The house condition is absolutely ridiculous. I’m trying to get tf out of here. I’m so upset and angry that these men are pigs. I’m very concerned about the virus too and they go out everyday and never clean. They complain when I vacuum or mop because it’s too noisy.

233,"I am a medical doctor and recently received a patient from a far flung area who showed me a prescription from a local clinic. When i read the name of the doctor who haf made it, and the address of the medical facility, it was one of my relatives. WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR. He hasnt even graduated high school. 

Now the place he's working at is a rural area where this sort of thing is possible because the population is dense and the people are gullible and mostly very poor and illiterate. I live in a developing country. Quack doctors are everywhere. 
He was able to open a private clinic and is literally treating patients using google and quack medicine. Writimg prescriptions! 

Now i know the natural answer to this is to report it to the authorities and i have picked up the phone a million times. Here is why i have put it back down and have turned to strangers for advice and am losing my mind:

The man has three children. The eldest child is am undiagnosed psychiatric patient and has had no proper care so is prone to violence amd suicidal ideation. I have tried to get him help through proper medical channels at my own hospital but the parents have been neglecting it. 

The younger two kids are very young and this man has no support from anyone. If he goes to jail i know for a fact that they will lose their house, the eldest kid will do something drastic, the younger kids will become dependent on my father since he has supported them in the past. My father is not a well off man and i have younger siblings. since i have just started my residency i am far from being able to help anyone financially as much as i might want to. 

I have to admit another much more selfish reason has been my own personal fear of ruining my name and reputation. I am a girl in a male dominant department. If his name is circulated which it might be, people will know he is from my family. This is a minor reason and i will out it aside if i can figure out the kids situation. 


So i decided to confront the man himself instead of reporting him. I asked him what he was doing etc thinking he would lie but imagine my disgust when he straight up said he was practicing as a doctor. To my face. Knowing that i am a licenced physician. I asked him how that was possible, and he said it was a god given gift. He had absolutely no guilt.he believes he is helping humanity. 


Guys i am dying here. This man is treating children. And vulnerable trusting people. Prescribing drugs. 

Should i confront him again or report him straight to authoritoes knowing very well that i am condemning his kids to something horrible and irreversible.

235,"I feel like this is that moment in Avengers: Endgame where Thanos looks to the big three and says “Look where it brought you. Back to me.” Well.. I’m back. 

2011, I had a huge crush on this girl and by the next year we were together. I was in 8th grade and she was a sophomore in high school. My parents did not want me to even consider dating until I was 16 and because of that we had to keep our relationship secret. And throw in growing male hormones, I thought I was the cheese. It caused much drama and heartache and we were on and off for five years till I called it. That was in 2016-ish. 

We tried to make it work a couple times but to no avail. 

She dated several people as I did. I even got engaged but that broke off, thank the Lord God Almighty. But I always ended up thinking about her. 

Fast forward to last week, her mother calls me and we talk about why she can’t stay in a relationship for more than 3 months. I haven’t spoken to her daughter in years so I don’t know her at all. That same night, her daughter, we will call her Amy, messaged me. We started talking, just friendly chat and conversation. Dropping the occasional message and meme. It was nice. 

And there’s good ol’ Thanos. Back to him. I am 22M and she is 24F. I’m still in school and she’s about to. My parents disapprove of her, her mother doesn’t think it will last. The emotions I feel as of this moment is regret, sadness, irritation, all things pertaining to the dark side of the force. As I am typing this, she is messaging me about how this is meant to be even if she has doubts. 

I can’t see this objectively and I feel like an a** because I feel like this is all I’m capable of. The hurt and the.. all the bad things I can’t even put into words. 

Please, help me.",19Jun2020,1
236,"I have a really confusing relationship with my brother and I don’t understand him at all. It’s been heavily suggested to me by many people that my dad is on the autism spectrum, and I’m starting to suspect that my brother might be too, I’m just not sure if it’s that or if he’s just an asshole. 

Sometimes when I talk to him he doesn’t respond to me, at all. He looks at me, and then looks off into space. Sometimes he will straight up leave (like when we are eating dinner) to go get something and then I’ll be sitting at the table with him while he’s googling something on his laptop and he won’t even think to tell me what it is or to wait until we are done eating. 

He doesn’t respect that I’m an alcoholic, he’s made it pretty clear that he doesn’t think I have a problem with drinking though I’ve been institutionalized, gotten in drunk driving car accidents, and gotten a DUI. To be fair, he might not know about all of that. He drinks, heavily, and gets lost and crashes his bike and has many life or death experiences, which he talks about around me, even though I’m an alcoholic and he knows I’m in AA. He will tell me stories about people he thinks are alcoholics, sideways hinting that I’m not like them. I never actually defend myself, because that’s not really my style, but it gets under my skin. 

He hardly ever asks me any questions about myself, when he does our conversation will just be rapid fire questions and me answering them and then he will lose interest. If I try to ask him questions about his life, he won’t respond or he will change the subject. He only wants to talk about what he initiates, otherwise, he won’t respond or will be difficult to talk to. 

He doesn’t agree with the fact that I don’t speak to our mom because she and I had a really abusive relationship and it just isn’t good for me. He brings her up a lot, and I talk to him about it because it’s fine by me, but he makes it clear that he sees no problem in how she raised us and he looks down on me for seeing issue in the kind of person she was. The underpinning thing is that I’m being emotional or irrational. He’s never said this, but it’s how he and my dad both treat it. 

He gets really upset about things and seems to be really tightly wound all the time, and if things he wants to be a certain way aren’t that way he gets extremely frustrated. The only time he isn’t like this is when he’s drunk. When he’s drunk he’s much nicer, easier to talk to, and laughs about things (like my messy eating) that bother him when he’s sober. 

He is deeply critical of himself, and really struggles socially... especially with social anxiety. He wants me to come with him when he sees family members because he gets really nervous. I only go when I want to: I’m not his mommy. He is really critical of himself for the social faux passes he commits, and will bring them up later to discuss with me. 

He is openly critical of me and the things that I do that bother him, in spite of that fact that I’m never critical of him. I’m an extremely messy eater, and he would comment on it every time we ate together, because if really bothered him. 

He also expects me to bear the brunt of dealing with his emotional issues even though he never talks to me about mine. He will go on long tangents about his feelings, or stories, or things that happened to him, like monologues... sometimes for up to 20 minutes. with no encouragement from me and sometimes no response. 

He’s also really overly logical. He remembers facts about things and likes to share the facts he knows, and he’s interested in hearing facts back. It is one of the few things I can say I know he will respond. When I’m really excited, sometimes he will deflate me with facts instead of letting me enjoy the moment. 

He’s very unhappy now, and doesn’t know what to do which is how I ended up living with him. He’s traveled the world teaching, and now he’s here because he doesn’t know what to do. I think he expects me to take care of him or help him figure that out, but I have my own stuff going on rn and I can’t take that on. 

He and I are VERY opposite. I’m a very sensitive and warm extrovert, and he’s much more logical, intense, and quiet. 

I want to have a relationship with him but the way he acts is so frustrating that I can’t be around him. What do you guys think?",19Jun2020,1
237,"Hello Reddit, 

So, I'm in a bit of a weird situation. I'll try to keep it simple, so here it goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just received a text from my Aunt asking if I'm going to attend my brother's wedding this Saturday. My brother and I aren't particularly close, but we don't necessarily 'hate' each other.

A few months ago, he texted me (after about 4 or 5 years of no communication (on either part)) and wanted to meet to catch up. He mentioned that he wanted to do some shopping for his wedding, but we didn't really talk much about it at all. Anyway, it didn't work out for me the day he wanted, so I said something like ""Sure thing, next week?"". Well, that next week my Grandfather passed away and I had to make a 500 mile trip to attend the funeral. I let him know that we would have to reschedule and he seemed to understand, and we would work it out after. 

By this point, the pandemic had begun and everything was on hold. I've been pretty cautious throughout the entirety of the whole thing; staying home as much as possible, only leaving when absolutely necessary, foregoing social interaction - trying to do my part. With this in mind, my brother and I had not had any interaction at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to tonight, where my Aunt sends me a text asking if I'm attending the wedding this Saturday. I let her know I had no idea the wedding was Saturday, since I didn't receive an invitation. She replied that the invites were all sent via Facebook. I let her know I don't have Facebook anymore (something I figured my brother would have realized), and had no clue it was so soon. 

Without going into more conversational details, I told her that I probably wouldn't attend due to a combination of it being incredibly short notice, as well as (more importantly) the fact that there is still a Pandemic currently going on and I'm trying to continue to be cautious about attending any type of gathering of more than a couple people. 

I guess the point of the post is just to get some insight from other people on whether or not I'm being stupid or overly cautious, or maybe just petty? Part of me is super upset that I wasn't told about this wedding by anyone. I feel like if I was having my wedding and the invites were sent via any social media platform and I knew some family member didn't use that platform, I'd reach out saying ""Hey so my wedding is X day"".  While at the same time I really am super timid about attending any type of social gathering. 

Advice, please.",19Jun2020,1
238," 

Ok so I 18 m work at a popular restaurant chain as a host/server. Monday morning I found out from another coworker that it is confirmed that a fellow hostess has caught covid19 however even though our managers are required to say something they did not.

The only reason we found out was because the girl in question told the coworkers son who works there to get tested cause they hang out regularly. When the manager realized we knew they refused to talk to anyone and gave all of the employees the silent treatment.

I didn't work Tuesday, but when I came in Wednesday morning we had an employee called in and confirm they had it again employees only found out through the grapevine because the sick employee told people and then later on while serving our cities district manager I overheard his companion saying we now have 4 cases and what was our manager planning to do.

Our restaurant serves mostly older folks and families so I don't feel comfortable just doing nothing and saying nothing. I wanna say something to someone and I wanted to go to our district manager but if they already know and aren't doing anything about it who do I go to? Can I go to anyone?

239,"Despite the pandemic, social justice wars, and overall ignorance of the world. The biggest kick in the nuts for me this year was finally getting started in my career field and absolutely hating it. I’ve been in the IT field for 5 years now, and just last October I finally got my shot as contractor for a small company. I was happy and excited. It payed well and had great hours, but as the daily workflow went by I started to realize. I fucking hate IT. I hate fixing computers and I hate troubleshooting technology. 90% of my work load consisted of people getting viruses from watching porn at work or crying because the internet’s slow (spoiler its cause you have 15 tabs open Samantha). I didn’t care about their problems or fixing them. As soon as corona hit I was laid off, and I was relieved because I knew I never had to set foot in that place again.

244,"So, I have good parents. I definitely wouldn't call them anything even bordering on abusive or anything like that, but we have a very, very distant relationship and I don't have a problem with that. The idea of being close with them makes me uncomfortable, which probably has to do with the fact I am a 16-year-old kid, but y'know.

I was a really open and affectionate kid up until around age 10/11 when I went through some trauma I'm not gonna get into here. The trauma didn't have anything to do with my parents, but it did happen directly under their noses and in our house, and i don't think they ever knew (even though my mom as mentioned to me now that she kind of knows about it that she knew there was something up, just not what) but they never did anything and I have c-PTSD to this day. I cannot **stand** my parents or anyone aside from my best friends touching me in any way shape or form. My parents have a problem with that.

For example, a while ago my mom came into my room, clearly somewhat drunk, around 10pm. My mom drinks a lot and it makes me really uncomfy but i know i'd get in trouble for bringing it up. Anyway, she sat on my bed and we talked for like five minutes and then I said goodnight. She put her hand out in front of me and **forced** me to hold her hand. She kept saying *""am I really that terrible?*"" and getting really sad when I said no. She wouldn't leave until I held her hand and it made me feel sick. When I pulled away after like 5 seconds, she got all upset and left my room sounding like she was crying. Stuff like this happens a lot.

I got to therapy. After every session I have my mom tries to get me to tell her what the session was about (I usually end up snapping at her about this cause she doesn't take any variation ""i don't want to tell you that makes me feel bad"" as an answer). Every time I go to book a session she asks if I think I really need it, and does not outright say it but she heavily implies that she's upset I want to talk to a therapist and not to her.

I used to talk to my mom back in middle school. She would end up crying and I would need to comfort her.

She also really awkward about the fact i am a trans man. She is supportive, which I know is more than many guys like me could ask for, so I feel bad complaining, but every now and then she makes these weird comments about how uncomfortable i must be in my body and stuff and it makes me squirm. I have never spoken to her about my dysphoria. She told me she was completely fine with paying for my transtape (a chest-binding product) because she felt it was an essential product (and the deal we have is she pays for most essential things and if i want anything extra i pay for it. I would honestly be paying for my trans stuff but I'm currently unemployed, but i am looking for a job)

Anyway, when i went to buy it she went on and on about how she does so much for me and i do nothing for her. That I'm entitled and don't contribute anything. She started complaining about how my room was messy and how if didn't keep my room clean she would have my dad turn off my wifi at 10:30pm instead of 1AM (i tidy once a week and have been putting a lot of effort into not ending up with another Depression Dish Pile).  
I asked her how my room being messy affected her and she responded ""it just does. It affects me a lot""  


My dad is another story. He is more distant and doesn't try to make me hug him ever, thank god. But he often borderline-insults me and used to turn off my internet and data for 4 hours during the day whenever I had no school, have it go on a 6AM, and off at 9:45-10:30pm. He calls me lazy and a pig a lot. It makes me not want to be around him, which is why i spend all the time I'm at home in my room unless i need to leave. He's the one that sets the list of chores and stuff I have to do, and I do them. But he still goes on about how I don't contribute anything once in a while. He tells me he wants me to come hang out in the kitchen at random points in the day and ask if there are any chores I can do. I feel like that's kinda weird? But idk maybe I'm the problem.

We are all professionals but hadn't worked together before. The project started on the side, but prospects are looking good and we are dedicating a lot of time to it. It looks like we'll get funds to dedicate ourselves full-time to it.

My wife and I are working really well together but we are having loads of problems with our friend. We overestimated his skills and we can see now that there is a massive gap between his knowledge and ours. He makes a lot of effort but he hinders the project and our work more than helping it. We can't rely on him and we keep having to double check what he does.

We've already had two serious talks with him, they meant to be a wake-up call and we decided to switch his tasks to more simple ones to see if we could keep working together. Right now we know we can't keep working with him. We are all under a lot of stress and it's clearly not solvable.

The issue is that he can't take any criticism and keeps saying that he needs to learn and needs time and we are too picky. He says that he doesn't want to be in a team who doesn't want him but hasn't mentioned leaving even once. This is a big project with only 3 persons and we can't make it work like this.

The problem is, I have a bunch of final exams coming up next week, and in my country there's now a law which says that right before you get to enter the exam hall, you'll have to have your body temperature checked.

252,"Long post but I'm at a loss as to what to do. Nothing I try seems to make a difference and its driving me insane and making me miserable. I cannot be happy.

My brother and my mom have been drug addicts for years. They frequently steal from my grandparents and my aunt (who is disabled). Prescription medicine that they need, clothes, tools, literally anything they can get their hands on and sneak out the door if they have the chance. Its abuse.

What was the last straw for me however is that a few days ago my mother stole my grandma's cellphone. My grandma let her borrow it, and immediately ""lost it"" the next day.

There is no talking to them about it, they do not care and will deny everything and scream and threaten you if you confront them about it. 

I cannot talk my grandmother into cutting them off. She just gets upset if I mention anything about it, defends them and prefers to pretend like everything is fine. As such she continues to let them visit, steal and borrow money and things that they'll give back. It is making every one of us miserable. My grandfather feels the same as I do, but we cannot convince my grandmother into putting a stop to it.

253,"So here’s the scenario. I’ve always been a floater friend. Drifting between groups, or only having situational friends like coworkers, youth group buddies, sports, etc. I have a few close friends but many of them are busy or it’s hard to hang out. We all like to when it actually happens but it’s rarely which is hard for me. This has been going on a couple years now and as a graduating senior from high school it’s even harder with friends moving and lives getting busier and busier. I have one friend group who are very nice to me when I’m around but never invite me to anything. I understand that people either have certain people they clique with more, or prefer different group dynamics. And who am I to “demand” attention from people who dont want me around? And maybe that’s just me being selfish... but it still hurts. Maybe this particular friend group issue wouldn’t bother me if I could hang out with my closer friends more often, or had more friends in general. But I don’t. To clarify I’m never pushy with them, I text occasionally, I ask if they want to do stuff sometimes (they’re busy). I think it really just bothers me that I am no ones first pick. And that sounds very entitled. I constantly straddle the line between “everyone’s important, deserves to be loved” and “why am I important, no one owes you anything so don’t expect it.” I try to be a good friend to everyone and also try reaching out to people who I think could use a friend. Kinda like the the “have a friend be a friend” idk. I try to not let it bother me... and maybe I just need to move on but I’m around them enough and we are apart of many of the same things that it would not be beneficial to “cut them out of my life” but that only leaves me to work through my one sided  emotions, and try to deal. Any advice would be appreciated, sorry for the rant.",19Jun2020,1
254,"I’m being kicked out. I have an apartment my dad owns but he abused me and my mom for 11 years and that’s going to trip me tf out. I won’t be financially supported by anybody. I don’t know how to pay taxes. I don’t know how to pay bills. I’m 16 for fuck sakes. My mom chose her bf over me, hence why I’m being thrown out (he abuses her and I said things to him but he decided my mom shouldn’t raise me anymore so she is either sending me to my abusive fathers or I’m being taken by the state. She will lie and claim I’m abusive or whatever the hell she needs to say to get rid of me. She has said that to my face.) I can’t even pay for my dogs food. I have had a job for 8? Months before, I actually made around $7,000 but I have no clue where that money went... it was just gone one day.. anyways I just need help on how to.. live. I don’t know how to do it.

257,"Hey Reddit,
I'm (34F) reaching out because my upstairs neighbor (~50F) came downstairs this afternoon, knocked on my door, and started bawling. I brought her to the backyard that the building units share, and she told me her bf (~50ishM) is abusing her. Among the many things she explained, he calls her names and physically hurts her by grabbing or pushing objects around her (like hitting her with a shower curtain and rod he yanked down on her in the shower), and telling her if she does not have sex with a homeless woman he knows that he will kick her out. She does not have a job and has lived here only about 3 months. She said she cannot afford to move out or fly back home (we live on an isolated island and she is from mainland US). She was very intoxicated and could barely form a sentence. I think that is the only reason she felt she could talk to me since we don't normally talk beyond simple pleasantries. I gave her my number and told her to call me if she needed anything and suggested she keep a secret record online somewhere he couldn't access (like a Google doc) of all the incidents of him abusing her, with dates. I told her also to call 911 if she feels in imminent danger from him but to reach out to the domestic abuse hotline and have them help her make plans to leave, etc. ASAP. She told me that he won't let her have any friends and would likely be upset if he knew she talked to me about anything at all. She said that he tells her ""his friends are the only friends they can have"".  The most concerning thing she said was that she was pretty sure he was going to kill her and she wanted someone to know what she was going through in case she goes missing or dies. 

This man is super religious and has always presented as a super nice person, but I was always concerned about him and his intentions. He has always lingered too long, looked too hard, came around my car too often, gave me gifts (like a car stereo!), washed his car right outside my bedroom window at 6am, etc. I was always wary of him, but my partner convinced me it was in my head and that the dude was awkward but trying to be nice. I was never at ease around him, and this confirms my bias. The man moved into the building about a year ago and says he has lived on the island his entire life, and his adult son is on island as well (I've met him).  I've heard him get drunk and argue with friends and use the N-word to talk about people of color. When this happens, he sounds aggressive and violent- the language alone sickens me, let alone the context and tone he uses. This is finally what convinced my partner this dude is not the nice guy he seems to be.

After the neighbor left and went back to her unit, I called a local domestic abuse hotline and they gave me great information, but they also suggested that he was unsafe to be around and I should strongly consider moving away from him. We can't really afford that. This place is a great deal, and we only got the unit at this price because I knew a friend of the landlord.  My landlord is friendly with this man as well, and the landlords also live on property. We have lived here for about 5 years and have a great relationship with them. I'm sure they would side with reason if the chips were down. The hotline worker also told me to try to connect with my neighbor again and give her specific information (the hotline number) and further information about local shelters. The hotline operator also wanted me to talk with her about setting up a code phrase for her to use with me if she feels unsafe so he won't be suspicious if he hears her talking to me or sees any texts she might send. 

I'm looking for advice regarding this situation because I'm just not sure if I feel safe seeking another engagement and getting even further involved. I'm stuck between feeling selfish but preserving my own personal safety and the safety of my family OR feeling paranoid about my interactions while risking my own health and safety (not to mention the anxiety and stress this is causing me no matter what I choose). I can encourage her to call 911, call domestic abuse hotlines, to leave and to cut ties, which I have, but what happens if she tells him what I say, or what if she does leave and press charges and he finds out I was involved in any way? She's apparently been on and off with him for 15 years prior to her moving out here (which is interesting since he has told me he is from here and never mentioned living in the mainland US), so even if she does leave, what would prevent her from returning and going through the same cycle and seeking me out as her only friend again?  I already don't feel safe around this man and I'm just not sure where to go from here. I don't want to be the confidante, but here I am. If anyone has been in similar situations, it would help for me to hear your side. Honesty is welcome. I want to do the right thing, and I won't be offended if you tell me I'm selfish for considering not seeking another conversation with her. I just want some unbiased, experienced opinions. 

TLDR: upstairs neighbor who I don't talk to came and knocked on my door and told me she is being abused by her live-in bf. She is new to the area, no job or car or friends. Gave her advice to call domestic abuse hotline ASAP and to call 911 if in immediate danger. I called the domestic abuse hotline after our conversation ended. The hotline operator wants me to talk to her again and give her specific info about their shelters and set up code phrases for us to use. I don't feel safe doing this considering I already don't feel safe around this guy.

I got furloughed at the beginning of April, and towards the beginning of May I realized I probably wasn’t getting my job back. I have to pay for internet, car, and tuition.

260,"Long post but I'm at a loss as to what to do. Nothing I try seems to make a difference and its driving me insane and making me miserable. I cannot be happy.

My brother and my mom have been drug addicts for years. They frequently steal from my grandparents and my aunt (who is disabled). Prescription medicine that they need, clothes, tools, literally anything they can get their hands on and sneak out the door if they have the chance. Its abuse.

What was the last straw for me however is that a few days ago my mother stole my grandma's cellphone. My grandma let her borrow it, and immediately ""lost it"" the next day and refuses to give it back.

There is no talking to them about it, they do not care and will deny everything and scream and threaten you if you confront them about it.

I cannot talk my grandmother into cutting them off. She just gets upset if I mention anything about it, defends them and prefers to pretend like everything is fine. As such she continues to let them visit, steal and borrow money and things that they'll not give back. It is making every one of us miserable. My grandfather feels the same as I do, but we cannot convince my grandmother into putting a stop to it.

The only thing I can think of left is to get the authorities involved for elderly and disabled abuse. I don't know if that will work because my grandmother will just say there is no issue because she wants to pretend nothing is happening.

And it’s super sucky because it’s a full cast like above the knee - a toes to thigh cast. And I chose bright pink which in retrospect was a really bad idea. 

Anyway, our local mall recently reopened after the Coronavirus lockdown and my friends convinced me to go. It was really embarrassing. It felt like everybody was staring at me. Random people asked what happened and some wanted to sign my cast. Some older lady looked at me and said, “you poor thing.” Literally, I’m not making this stuff up. Somebody else told me they didn’t even know they made casts that go above the knee. Great, but I don’t care.

It’s just kinda embarrassing. Like haven’t you ever seen anybody with a cast before? And they’re all supposed to be social distancing.

266,"30, estranged from family, no friends, kicked off my dream project at work (I think my career / 6-figure salary is over - still employed but devastated) 

I met a girl I fell in love with in December.  She ghosted me in May.  

I had been emotionally abused by my parents my whole life; threatened to get killed at age 5 and many other scary things 

I don’t think I’ve seen a healthy relationship in my entire life.  I crave intimacy and fell in love with this girl when she broke through my trust barriers.  Her ghosting me made things much much worse - I’m disposable.

I already had my dream career and I am getting ousted.  It’s all I ever wanted to do, so I know nothing else.

I’m already in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist which have so far only made things worse.  I really want to leave my job as it’s deeply unhealthy, but I need the pay and benefits.  

I have basically no friends and I don’t know how to meet anyone in quarantine.  There were other girls that liked me but I can’t bear to see them since I can’t get over the girl I loved.  I can’t believe it happened 

I had a really bad family and I don’t know how to resolve the lack of compassion and nurturing in my life.

267,"Hey everyone! Okay so right now I'm pretty desperate for some type of relationship or connection right now haha. So, I've been on Tinder. I matched with this guy who is, by the opinions of my friends, much less attractive than me. However, we had a really interesting conversation about music and I love his vibe and I know he's just a Tinder guy, but I can't stop thinking about him. 

I gave him my instagram and asked him to send me some of his music that he wrote, but he didn't send it. So, I DMed him first and he sent it. He has bad response time but when he does respond, he's really friendly and connects with me, so I don't get the feeling he's not reciprocating. But once he did leave me on read, so the next night I decided to send a ""how was your day"" text. And we had a nice conversation (over the course of a day, because both of us took a while to respond to each message.) 

(Side note, he's not really very flirty and didn't ask many questions about me, but it seems that he just doesn't enjoy texting, and it's not representative of him but idk. He just seems like a bad-texter type.) 

Anyway, to end the convo, I told him that if he ever wants to drive 45 mins to see me or smoke over FaceTime he could DM me anytime. He responded saying that he'd *love* to, and that if I ever wanted to talk he's always around. 

He hasn't messaged me and I guess I'm concerned he won't message me first because he never has. I tried to hand him the ""baton"" by saying ""DM me any time"" but it seems like he handed it back by saying, ""same goes for you!"" What should I do? I want to hang out with him or FaceTime him, and it seems like he wants to as well, genuinely-- but idk if he'll ever message me first, and I feel like I'd be weird or pushy or clingy to set up a time/date, being that he has never messaged me first. 

(P.S. It sounds so DUMB because he's just a stupid internet Tinder guy. The only reason I'm overreacting is because im desperate as FUCK and he's the first  guy ive connected with in a while. )

268,"Hi all. Obligatory this is a throwaway account disclaimer.  


I'm writing this post on a Thursday evening, and there is less than 24 hours until my school ends. I have done virtually zero work during the online portion of this semester (for about 3-4 months) and I am here instead of working on all the work I need to complete. I also have three incompletes (aka classes that I did not finish last semester but am able to do the work and turn it into the teacher to receive a grade) that I have not worked on at all from last semester. I have incompletes because I have a strange illness that seems to be brought on by stress and makes me bedridden for 1-2 weeks at a time (the illness would come on 1-2 times a month when I was attending school in person) so I get special exemptions. This post isn't really asking about how to do my work- this is just background information.   


I love to learn. I like my teachers. I want to do my work. But I don't- I think about it and it makes me want to throw up and I simply don't do it- I can't seem to even force myself to do it. This even happens at the very beginning of the school year when I have zero work built up. 

Then, I think I can do my work. So I lie to my parents because I think I can catch up on the work before they realize there's all this shit I have to do. But I can't catch up, because I don't do my work. I understand this fully, but I can't seem to change it. 

I lie more. I have so much work built up that I am paranoid about disappointing my parents so I lie. I lie even when I want help, even when I don't want to lie- I don't think I fit the characteristics of a pathological liar, but it feels like I am one at times. 

I can't stop procrastinating, I can't stop lying, and I'm depressed as hell. I lie in bed at night and think about all the shit I need to do and god why can't I stop lying and my parents will be so disappointed and my teachers will be disappointed too and I'm a failure and why can't I be a good student anymore. I used to be a straight A's, super smart, super good student. Now I'm just depressed and it doesn't feel like I can do anything to set things straight. 

I've tried to fix things. But I simply cannot seem to do it. I even tried to get my parents to help at the beginning of the school year but then I just kept lying and lying and I couldn't stop and they thought I was on track but I really just wasn't.   


So, I guess- am I just a really stupid procrastinator? I don't want to think that because I don't think I could live with the knowledge that I have become so lazy and such a terrible procrastinator. Could there be something else that's wrong with me? I don't know.

Attending his funeral terrified me. To this day I can’t get the image of how he looked out of my head and it’s scary. But I lost my grandma to cancer maybe around February. She died in her house and she was using all these machines all the time and being unresponsive. And to me they raised me and they’ve always been strong. I would’ve never thought I had to see them like that. But when I went to her funeral that scared me too. I only saw her once but it was too much. Their images are engraved in my brain and I’m terrified. I close my eyes and it’s all I see or think of sometimes. I go to sleep and I’ll sleep talk about it. I want it to stop. I want to pull the images out of my brain and get rid of them forever. I hate myself for remembering them for how they were when they died.

I fell like my hole life has been like this quarantine to me, always at home with nothing to do, felling like I´m wasting my time. So I´ve had a pretty good life so far, I have a preety good family and even when we aren´t wealthy we are all supportive with one another, also have kinda good freinds I guess, and a lovely girlfriend with who I´ve been for 5 years. Everthing seems to be good, so why do I fell so void, and empty, I feel like my hole life has been a lie, My family is realy supportive wiht me and my dreams, but that just makes me feel guilty cuz I really dont have any dreams, lets be real, becoming a mangaka is not easy, and it starts to seem imposible when you are from a small city on a small third world country in latinoamerica, even though I´ve been practicing art my hole life i just dont feel like I´m improving, I feel like I´ve wasted all that time (I´m 21). I could say I have kind of a lot of friends but in reality I dont really feel conected to a lot of them, My girlfriend is one of the most loving and supportive persons I´ve ever meet, but I never wanted to have a relationship in first place, we use to be good friends, but everybody around us use to say that we would make the perfect couple and I ended up succumbing to the social presure, and since then we´ve been together, its been a long time since we started dating in highschool and now even my college friends say that we make the perfect couple. I haven´t broke with her beacuse since the start she´ve really been a good loving supportive girlfriend and she trully seems to be happy with me and I dont wanna hurt her, but this is not the life I want, I´ve been liying to everyone about who I am, what I want to achive or how I´ve feel that I really feel like my hole life has been a lie. me liying to everyone cuz I consider myself a pretty dull and boring person and I just wanted to be liked. the worst part is that it kinda worked and now my life is a lie, I´ve always hated myself for being like this and I got to the point where by every day that goes by I feel my will to live slowly fading away, and I no longer know what to do.

274,"First I would like to apologize if this seems foolish and rant like,perhaps it is but regardless it is bothering me and I need advice. This situation is overall more nuanced than it may seem at first,before I get to the core of the issue I must first explain some crucial information about some of the people involved. To start this issue concerns my main friend group,there is five of us and we are all guys in our junior year of high school. To be more specific the group consists of the following:

myself,in general I tend to be in higher classes and I am involved in a sport and multiple clubs and activists,I don't want to blow my own horn but I tend to be more academically advance than most of the group and I am trying to focus more on school than activity's like gaming with friends.

Tyler,he is in mostly general classes and barely involved in extra activists aside from a job at a local restaurant,he is also really into gaming and is where my problem resides.

Fred,in slightly higher level classes than Tyler but not quite at my level,in general a chill guy,involved in one sport and enjoys gaming but is not nearly as obsessed as Tyler.

Landon,about as academically involved as I am if not slightly above,however only does ,overall he tends to like games more than myself and has known Tyler longer than I have or anyone else in the group,overall very chill like Fred.

John,slightly less academically involved than myself and involved in a few activity's,in general a nice guy,granted very flamboyant to the point where some people take issue and makes a lot of risque jokes,not edgy but very very flamboyant to the point where Tyler has developed a disdain for them.

Overall we coordinate well and are pretty good friends with minimal exceptions such as Tyler and Fred arguing a lot and disagreeing about a large assortment of subjects. Recently however I have developed an issue with Tyler,you see while we play now he streams it all on twitch or records it for you tube,this honestly makes me very uncomfortable for a plethora of reasons. Beyond my own discomfort with the practice Tyler is the only one who is planning on doing such things for a main occupation,while  Fred and Landon also have twitch and you tube channels they rarely upload and do it for fun in their free time. Honestly the idea of making a career off you tube seems like a pipe dream,while I want to support my friend I don't want him to throw away countless hours dedicating himself to a career that will never work and honestly I don't really want those recordings available,just for clarification my main issue with the recordings is that while I never say anything horrible or racist or anything like that I simply don't want my life literally broadcasted out for anyone to see.",19Jun2020,1

The past week I have been told that I am too selfish, disrespectful, emotional, and otherwise insufficient. I found out that my mother has been lying to me. I have ended up crying in the bathroom or randomly during work hours (thankfully not in a meeting) every day this week. 

For context, I should say this. My father believes that a father deserves respect from his children. His definition of respect is instant agreement and obedience and taking the blame for anything that goes wrong. He also says that family is most important and you can’t insult nor let anyone else insult your elders. For the past month, he has been insulting my maternal grandmother. I tried to say something. That’s when I got the you are disrespectful speech and how can you say something so rude to family. I asked why he could say something cruel to my grand mother and he said it was because my maternal grandmother is not his mother. My mother is not very happy with this but that is a different story. Later on in this conversation it came out that I was bisexual. I grew up listening to homophobic comments from my father. Every time I try to say some thing, he would say that, “ I have the freedom of speech in my own house. I can’t say anything outside because I would be arrested but if I can’t say whatever I want in my own house is this really my home.” I then found out he only has a problem with gay people, not lesbians. But I still think there is something intrinsically wrong with me. Later, He said that he would move out next month because he could not live in a house where he was so disrespected. He said that if, sometime in the future his daughters learn to respect him, they could visit. I asked him to wait another month, after which I would go back to school and that I will try my best to respect him while I lived under his roof. I told him that if he was willing to wait for this month he would never have a disrespectful daughter under his roof again. I don’t think I can learn to respect anyone the way my dad defines respect, much less him. I think never seeing him again (and by default the rest of the house) is a loss I have to take - I don’t think I’m coming back. Later he said that he really does want a relationship with me but every time we talk I get too emotional or angry and I just don’t listen and he can’t talk to me. I know I usually end up crying but I’ve listened and everything I ever say is disregarded because who listens to a crying girl?

My mother has made offhand and disparaging comments to me all my life. I know she has no faith in me and I have always had little faith in myself. Sometimes the comments come up in conversation other times they Are made when I am talking to someone else.

Neither of my parents understand the word no. I know this might be because I am considered too young and immature. But I don’t know how to change their views. If my father asked me if I want to eat something and I say no, he will make it anyways and be displeased when I say I don’t want to eat it. The same thing can be said for my mother and buying things. Also, my mother has a habit of touching my arms and legs. And she stares at my chest. Whenever I asked her to stop she would laugh and keep doing it. On top of that she will put her hand in the general vicinity of my body and if I ask her to move it she also just laughs. I have tried calmly saying no or whining it or yelling it. My father listens but becomes irate. My mother will stop but she laughs and does it again momentarily. 

The thing with the lying. I go to school three hours away from the house and almost every time my mom has driven me, she has asked me to because she “needed a break from dad.” Every other time I ask if I should get a ride share or call a friend and she says no. My sister told me today that this is not the case she does not want to drive that I am essentially just a burden. I don’t know why I feel so betrayed. I know I should learn how to drive. Yet, I am terrified of sitting behind the wheel. Both of my parents want to teach me but they laugh when I make a mistake and when I look scared and laugh some more when I make another mistake because I am so scared or they yell at me. my sister, today, asked me why did I learn to drive. She says “I can never get anywhere in my adult life if I don’t know how to drive unless I live in the city “. this has always been my plan. I don’t know why I thought my sister would understand. I don’t know how to say (again) driving scares me. And the parents make it harder. 

This past week, I have determined that my dad‘s home cannot be mine. I have found out that the one thing I had in solidarity with my mother was a lie. I learned that even my sister thinks I am a burden. I know I am selfish for wanting to leave and not have anything to do with this family anymore. I know I am selfish for wanting autonomy over my body and wanting To learn to like myself and to be happy I don’t think I can do it here. I’m not supposed to want to leave my family. I should be able to respect them and I should feel safe. At the moment my plan is to leave for school and not come back. I didn’t realize this but it turns out once a week I end up texting my friends about my parents or my family and I worry I am becoming a burden to them too. I have been told I seem much unhappier and I should do what’s best for myself but I know Im not supposed to cut ties. I just don’t know what to do.",19Jun2020,1
277,"The tile pretty much sums it up, my story has a lot of details so ill try to keep it short, this is about the 10th time I've tried writing this and I can't find a good way to write this so im going to just go in. I graduated highschooll in 2019. I attended a d1 college 6 hours away and out of state on a sports scholorship. earlier that year my dad was diagnosed with cancer and died October 2019. When I went off to college he was obviously sick but I thought I had more time with him then I got. I would visit home every few weeks and every time he was sicker. I became depressed and stopped going to class.  I was already on medication for depression before he died, I started it at college. My mom made me go back to college 2 or 3 days after the funeral and I became extremely depressed at college I didn't eat for days at a time and did not attend a single class I was just sleeping in my dorm room. I was unable to function so I dropped out and went back home.

 since November 2019 until now I have attempted suicide and been in a mental hospital 4 times. I have been on countless medications none help. I've seen counselor therapist etc.  I got a chance at playing college sports again though because a coach in my hometown at a small college heard about my situation and reached out to me. I started at that school January 2020. I lasted 1 fucking week before my anxiety and depression  took over and I couldn't  leave my dorm room.  right when that was happening I got A DUI I blew a .204  and the coach basically said come back when your healthy (mentally) so I messed that up MAJORLY. I started smoking weed my junior year of highschool but maybe 1 once or  twice a week. I started smoking all day everyday when My dad got diagnosed and I lost control of my usage completely I know this has had a very strong affect on my metal health as well. I have a family history of drug and alcohol abuse on both sides. My mom did drugs when she was pregnant with me and my dad was a alcoholic.  I am lucky nothing serious is wrong with me expect a minor learning disorder. ( im just slightly dumb) My highschool gpa was a 1.9.  I only got into college because of my athletic ability.  Now I realize I was pretty much used for sports and set up to fail. 

march 2020 I got a job at mcdonalds got fired 2 weeks after starting now im at home nothing going for me and don't know what to do. I went from a promising college sports career to jobless mentally ill loser in a few months this is more of a rant then asking for advice because I know I pretty much fucked myself I know this is all my fault. there is so much more that I can't really say on reddit but I think I conveyed the important points. Im going to list some major points to help make more senses

1. when I went to college I had to make all new friends because I knew no one I ended up making bad friends that only wanted to party and drink with me because I was a ""cool jock"" and it raised there social status. So while I was at college and my dad was back home dying I had no real friends or support. that played a big role in me leaving 
2. Most of my ""best friend"" from highschool are away at college or don't talk to me anymore because Im not that cool super tall athlete guy anymore im just a depressed drug addict loser so I can't really blame them I guess. even though they do the same shit. So I no longer have any type of support from anyone except my mom 
3. My license is suspend until October because of the DUI so I can only get a job that I can walk to which is pretty much none existence. I have no money to pay the court fines either.

WHAT SHOULD I DO???? I CANNOT ADVANCE IN LIFE UNTIL MY METAL STATE IS STABLE I FEEL LIKE I FUCKED UP ALL MY OPPORTUNITITES IF MY DAD WAS ALIVE HE WOULD THINK IM A LOSER AND WASTE OF SPACE HE WAS REALLY EXCITED FOR ME TO GO TO COLLEGE AND PLAY SPORTS HE LOVED GONG TO MY GAMES AND WAS REALLY PROUD OF ME. NOW IM NOTHING. LITERALLY.

Please ask if you have any questions or need clarification. I could not include every little detail but there is more.

286,"I’m 19. Finished my first year of college. For another of my life I always thought I was just shy but coming forward and doing some light therapy has made me realize the place I am in.

I don’t feel like I deserved to be depressed or anxious. I loved a safe life in Arizona. My dad was only emotionally abusive and I watched attack my sister once but never me so why am I depressed, anxious, and a mess.

I went through school with little to no friends, had weird tendencies, only in highschool was it shoved away by friends for awhile and a gf or inevitably left me as she uplifted old and unhealthy habits I carried.

Now here I am with no support, my mother thinking a wall will cure the immense dull and emptiness I feel everyday. A constant battle of bullying myself into feeling ungrateful and spoiled, having no motivation to get a job and a huge fear of driving, along with no clues what to do in life and no friends.

I feel trapped. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m too scared to kill my self but I am feeling so hopeless in my life changing as nothing has changed even with some rare sessions of therapy.

What do I do please someone help me. I genuinely hate everything about myself and just wish I was normal.",19Jun2020,1
287,"TW: sexual assault of minors 

I apologize if this isn’t the right subreddit to put this in. 

Currently I’m (26F) and my cousin is (20M). We talk on and off and today we were texting and reminiscing about a time when our families where a lot closer. He remembered A LOT during the time period where this incident happened so I just know he remembers it too. I think about it ever so often because I feel like I perpetuated generational sexual abuse, incest, and even though I was a child, I feel so horrible and want to apologize to him. 

For some context, I was molested by an older cousin of mine (13ish) on multiple occasions from the ages 3ish to 5. My dad was a little clued in cause he would sometimes find me alone with him and he would take me out of the room (but too late as it would have happened already). I never hated this cousin but when I was older, I would keep my distance and tell my younger sister to not be alone with him. I also learned that he was sexually abused as a child from an older female cousin and it was huge family secret, so I had sympathy for him and had forgiven him since he went through it too. When he died from COVID two months ago, it broke my heart cause he was only 37 and I wanted him to have a more fulfilled life. There was other occasions where I had different older male cousins who would just give me weird sexual vibes or try to get me alone but I was old enough (8ish) to try to diffuse the situation, and three occasions in elementary school where I had boys touch me inappropriately. 

Onto the incident, my younger cousin was between the ages of 4-5, and I was between 9-10, we were wrestling and I made it somehow lead to me dry humping him for a few seconds. I don’t remember how I got us to be positioned that way, but I do know I purposely did it and my cousin I guess was sexually awakened or something and was like “that felt good!” I tried to recreate it again, but then I was mortified and felt deep guilt. My child mind thought: “If I could remember the time my mom played horsey with me at like 4 and I turned around to tell my mom to keep going cause it felt good and then seeing how disgusted she got at me, then he’s going to remember this happening to him too”. The guilt weighed so heavy on me as an adolescent and I never inappropriately touched anyone else in that way, thank God. 

Idk if anything would change if my older cousin who molested me had apologized, since I already absolved him from guilt. I just did find it weird how we would have regular interactions even though I KNOW he remembered as he was a teen and it was multiple times. So I don’t know if approaching my younger cousin, that I molested, would be beneficial to him or not? I feel like I want to own up to it and not just have regular interactions as if it never happened. I want to put an end to the generational abuse that apparently happens so often in my family. But I don’t want it to seem like I’m absolving myself, cause even with forgiveness or not, I still HATE myself for doing that and passing that experience onto someone else in my family that I love and care for. So I’m not sure Reddit, should I approach him about this and apologize or just let it rock until he broaches the topic?

P.S. I guess related but since I’m the oldest sister, my youngest sisters that are close in age and when I noticed that as they were exploring their body parts and sexual organs, I would tell them “hey I know that feels good but you do that in private and by yourself, not with each other”. Cause honestly I don’t want them to experiment on each other and awkwardly remember that as they grow older, and have that guilt. Like I know it’s “natural” for children to do this as they develop but ya know, incest.",19Jun2020,1

290,"The first incident happened by chance when I was 12. I recently started puberty and my hormones were starting to act up; when on a random night after saying goodnight to my mother and turning from her door, I happened to glance at the small crack in the bathroom door between it and the frame and saw my older sister fully nude. I couldn’t have looked for more than a second but seeing her body (this was before I even knew what porn was and had never seen a grown woman’s body) I had a strange feeling. I masturbated for the first time that night and from there I tried many things to try to see her again. I succeed many a times but was also caught many times. Whether it was because my mom couldn’t believe I would do such a thing or I just have a silver tongue, I have gotten off without consequences. My sister moved away a year ago but before she did my other sister started growing into a women as well. Now that she’s gone my other sister was who I started looking at. I am 14 now and I haven’t been caught. I can go awhile without trying to see her baked but I get urges mostly when she is dressing skimpy.

I’ve (F21) always struggled with my mental health, but things have been getting increasingly bad lately. I’ve had suicidal thoughts before, but tonight is different. I’m doing my best to calm down, but for the first time ever, I think I may need to go to the hospital. 

Before anyone really panics, or reports me or anything, I’m thinking clearly. I don’t have a plan, I’m not actively looking for a weapon, I just am having a night where going on living seems very very difficult. I think that I’d be doing the correct and safest thing by going to the hospital. 

My issue is that I have a little 1 1/2 year old dog. I love him so much. He keeps me going, and I would never abandon him. But I don’t have roommates, very few friends (especially ones awake in the middle of the night), and my family all live 1,000+ miles away. I’ve been trying to Google if there are any programs out here (Colorado) that temporarily foster dogs in situations like mine, but it’s difficult to read or think clearly, and I can’t seem to find much information anyone.

Now my problem lies here. 
Schools have been training us to work hard every single day, where many of us slough through practice papers up till 2am,and I question myself, what is the point of all this? In the end we only get a flimsy piece of certificate and maybe some useful knowledge. The thing is, when I thought the grind will finally end, I now realise that ultimately i will experience the same thing yet again--hustling in work, taking OT to complete what's supposed to be done. Trying to juggle a work life balance once again, what's the point of all this? It's a never ending cycle, a vicious one. We are all pawns of the world, in schools, we are trained to get the required skill sets to work for our economies. In the working world, I'm eventually going to be another pawn of a large corporation, aren't I? Working my ass off, like the cash cow all workers are. My purpose in life is now reduced to work hard, get good grades/good pay, and nothing else. It's such a meaningless life. Help me gain interest in the world, help me get motivated. 

Perhaps this might be painting a bleak picture of what work or what life is for me, thus I'm feeling this way.

298,"I stopped talking and interacting with a friend from high school for the last 5 years or so. He burnt bridges back in college with us when he wanted more interesting and mature friends. The dude would always say that his friends were better and smarter than me and that he wanted more meaningful conversations. I really stopped hanging out with him when he would fail to make plans or reply to anything I'd recommend. For example, I'd ask for people to go to Comic Con for years but he never said yes. Suddenly he met a new group and Comic Con was the next best thing.

We had a falling out and went our separate ways. In that time I met a great girl and recently got engaged to her last year. Our friend is in our main Facebook group chat with 4 other people but he never interacted with us even though we saw him read the messages. Around this time we'd make plans and he said he'd show up but always flake again. There were numerous times when we'd have events planned and told the group to show up. He'd respond with that he forgot or never even respond. 

My friends and I saw him in 2019 I think when we were all getting food at a bar. He said he was an alcoholic but didn't want to stop drinking. We met his new ""friends"" at another bar and the whole time he was trying to show off the successful people. I was referred to as the rich engineer of which I am not. 

Recently, I think due to Covid loneliness, he kept asking the group to hang out but not by making plans with us. He said that his door was opened and that it was up to us to initiate and be ready for him. I was tired of it and exploded on him. I got aggressive and asked him where he was the last 5 years and why if he wanted to reconnect, not ask about us instead of making it about him. He dodged all my questions about why he'd never congratulated me or even ask about the fiancee.

So of course the guy told me that I'm weak and toxic and that I have not changed over the last 5 years and said that I'll always be a creeper. So I sent him a few messages saying that he's never changed and that his current friends have all left him and that most of the people in our group are tired of him. I think I would have been less dramatic if it wasn't for him wanting to disregard Covid for his own benefit.

One thing to note before this was that when we were back in college his ex had to get campus security to tell him to back off when they broke up. I was there for him when he threatened to kill himself and when she told me to bring all of his stuff back to him. 

Sorry for the long post. I've shown the fiancee the conversations but I'd like to see what a fresh perspective would say. It just makes me sad that I had hoped that he'd change from the last 5 years we talked but I really felt like the reconnecting wasn't genuine. He didn't hit any of us up separately. One of our friends went to visit him before all this and he made a snide comment about how that friend was the only one who cared. I don't have many friends left from high school so I like to keep them if I can but I think with this guy I had to just cut all contact.",19Jun2020,1

300,"***Long story but I really need your help, please bear with me friends &lt;3*** 

I need your advice on what I should do about my mental health in my workplace. 

I really like the job, and my co-workers, it's the management and above, finger-pointing, and lack of support that I struggle with.

So currently I am on leave for the 3rd time from my job, I have been working there less than a year.

My dad passed away in 2016 suddenly and unexpectedly. I was 21 at the time and I battled my own grandmother to become the administrator of his estate because he and my mom had divorced when I was only 3 as he liked to drink, so he had not updated his will since she made him in 1995, the year I was born. 

My mom drilled into my head, that my older brother (26), who is considered a dependant needs to be cared for, and he wouldn’t be if I were not in charge of the estate. 

Long story short the will named my grandmother executor of his estate but she was 85 at the time and very delusional about his death so she didn’t do anything with the estate for at least a year until I got the news that my family home was being foreclosed on, I then took action.

Cut to this year 2020, I am now 24, I have gotten more of a handle on my avoidant strategies and many of the issues have come boiling to the surface that I have been keeping at bay by distracting myself for so long. 

And I am still dealing with battling family and settling the estate this many years later.

So it has been very hard for me to truly live my life, be an administrator, fight all these battles with people I love, and try to get a grasp on my emotions and the loss of my dad all at the once while still remaining strong and being able to support myself financially.

Working has been a very big challenge for me because of my mental state as some people are unaware of just how much certain people have been through, and how they might get triggered by certain things very easily. It is just very hard to deal with as I am on very high alert all the time and very defensive. This is something I'm trying to learn to understand and cope with, as I am a very people-loving person, I never want to hurt anyone, no matter what they’ve done to me. 

So when I got a new government job I was really excited, I thought I would find a place that I could be supported that I would be doing something I love and that I was passionate about, it involved cannabis and the public and teaching people about cannabis and how to use it safely.

I butt head with the manager right away she seemed very ego-centric, and only seemed to have liked and got along with all of the guys and few of the girls. At one point she even said to me “we need more men in here to balance out the women,” but I don't like to blame or point fingers, so I can only expect she had a lot going on under the surface as well. 

What I did know was I was not in the best state of mind all the time, sometimes I take things very personally, sometimes I feel everyone is out to get me, but I learned I needed to voice my concerns with the people in question so I could move past them, which I did with her and she informed me everything between us was good, it was not.

I was not the only person who did not like her and vice versa.

She would pick favourites and they would get to hang out in the office with her. You would hear them giggling and talking about things not work related, this really upset me as I was hurting and wanted my manager to like me and I wanted to like her, I was willing to talk and work it out. 

I even told her at the very beginning of the job, (we were all starting together because we were opening a new store) I had been dealing with a lot in my life currently and had just lost my dad a few years prior and was still dealing with the aftermath of his estate. 

She completely forgot about this until I had to inform her again when I was upset on my dad's birthday, after she had said “is he having a party!?”

I even went as far as providing a note from my doctor about my anxiety even though they didn't ask me for this specifically, as it had not been affecting my work. I just wanted them to know, as they would want to know, for anybody with a disability.

I instantly regretted this decision, giving them that note because the following day I received a phone call from the HR department lady V, bombarding me with questions about my mental health, and how they can “help me,” and “support me.” She then proceeded to ask too much, things such as; what kind of things caused my PTSD to be triggered, what medication I was taking, what happened to my dad, etc. 

I told her I wanted to look into using CBD for my anxiety, and she told me I should look into other alternatives. (We are literally a cannabis store that SELLS CBD TO PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY, although listed as recreational, why are we being biased?) I informed V my doctor was the one who would decide the best course of action for myself and my health and that I was following his advice.  

I ended up sharing way more than I thought I should have and became very distraught and upset, as makes sense when I talk about the things that trigger my PTSD and flashbacks from the night my dad died. I told her all I wanted was support from my manager with my mental health and I felt she didn’t know how to do that. 

I felt I was being singled out because I was overly emotional sometimes, but I was still great at my job, our customers and co-workers love me, and I didn’t let it start affecting that until later when I started to feel like no one cared.

I didn’t understand how they thought a complete stranger could have made me feel better, when my own manager didn’t have training or know how to handle someone with anxiety and depression. 

After I became very distressed on the phone call, she informed me of some free government counselling programs and gave me some phone numbers and sent me on my way. Back to work I went. 

Yet obviously I didn't last very long that day as I was very very upset. I ended up going home early.

Me and the manager, L, would constantly have little disagreements but ours were always worse than hers or the other staffs. I felt she had a hate out for me and would even ask the other staff if they felt this too. Some did, some didn’t. 

When I found out that she was leaving I was thrilled just two more weeks with her I could definitely do it I told myself. 

I must have offended her though when they told me, as I told her I was happy for her rather than lie and say I was sad to see her go. I felt this way because she did not hold back during her last two weeks, I am still having nightmares trying to process what truly happened. 

The first week was very difficult; she had not been censoring her comments towards me anymore. She would be very rude and make me do things that other people wouldn't have to do. She would come out to flounce her power and laugh and make jokes with her favourites and ignore the others. 

Incident # 1:

One day I was opening the store and was supposed to be opening with a co-worker Z. He was known for going into her office and talking every morning every shift for at least 15 to 20 minutes, showing up late all the time, missing shifts, and just in general being a terrible worker that no staff wanted to work with.

So this day he showed up late, then proceeded to head to her office. I started to get frustrated because I was going through a bout of depression and had no grasp or control over my emotions, I could hear them laughing and giggling in her office and I had already finished all the cleaning duties out front while they talked. 

When I was stocking the back pantry, trying to keep my cool, he came looking for me and asked me what was left to do,  I told him to look at the checklist because that's what it's there for and maybe he might know this if he showed up on time and didn’t spend the rest of the opening cleaning time in the office, of course he instantly got very angry and told me not to speak to him like that, I realized It was not my place and apologized, said I was having a rough morning, and went back to the pantry. He ran into her office and told her his side of the story.

I continued to do my job while he went out to the front and she came barrelling through the door, finger pointed straight in my face, visibly furious, telling me that I don't get to act like that not here. I got very distressed as I have never been in a verbal or physical fight before and climbed up the ladder I was near to get above her so I could feel some sense of comfort and get away from her.

I told her L you did not get to hear my side of the story yet, you didn't even know what happened so why are you accusing me? 

But she had me cornered and she had already made her mind up so there was not anywhere else I could go except for to fight back, or cry and cower. I fought, told her she was a terrible manager and that nobody liked her which then I instantly apologized for and corrected myself by saying I meant everybody liked me and liked working with me, and that Z was a bad worker that only she liked.

So even when we were fighting I was still afraid of hurting her feelings yet she told me I was a terrible worker who didn’t know how to listen to directions, the rest of the staff would say otherwise.

I honestly don’t remember much of the conversation after that, but she finally left and I was having a full on panic attack and wasn’t sure what to do with myself. I called the union rep and he told me I didn't have to stick around for that (while we were on the phone she yelled at me that we were open and we needed a *cashier* in the front), and that I should just go home, so I did. I was not in the proper state to be working anyways.

I told the manager that I was feeling sick, which I was, and that I was going home and she nodded her head in agreement and said good. 

I informed the substitute manager, K, who would be replacing her until they found a real replacement, and who doesn’t live in our town, what had happened and she informed me that she was definitely in the wrong.

K told me this shouldn't have happened and that I shouldn't have to work with L alone again, as that is what had provoked the attack. She told me I could choose to go on leave until L was gone March 12, or I could continue to work and she would make sure we didn’t have to work alone together again so that wouldn’t happen.

I like working and I like my job, so I chose to continue working. Which I now regret. 

Incident #2

It was another morning shift. The assistant manager, I, had just stepped out for a break leaving L, my co-worker, Ke, and myself in the corner of the store at the I.D station. I was sitting on a chair at the I.D because I struggle with chronic pelvic pain and the only thing that helps is to sit down as the pain shoots into my thighs and makes it hard to stand.  

I am also now discovering I might have a bladder related issue that is called interstitial cystitis which makes me have to urinate at least 30+ times a day urgently, and could be a cause of my pelvic pain. But I am still under testing for this.

Anyways, we have to be at the I.D station for 1 hour intervals but I usually can’t hold it for a whole hour so I ran up to the front to ask L if I could run to the bathroom quickly. She rudely remarked back to me “I think we can handle it” so I went to the bathroom.

Upon my return to the I.D station I was becoming more upset, she really had it out for me that day and normally didn’t spend much time out on the floor, but because it was just me and another one of her favourites, Ke, it probably made her feel good to be out there. 

As I was sitting at I.D for the rest of my shift, Ke comes over with a stack of tags and sticks them out towards me saying “these need to be cut.” I remark, can’t you cut them, as it doesn’t sound like you are very busy over there, (did I mention her and L were just giggling and talking about a paint night I happened to also be at, not actually doing work, and we also had no customers?)? 

She got a little upset which is understandable, I was also upset and it reflected in my voice with my comment, she said she was already doing stuff and I said fine and took them and said I would do them in a bit as I had already cut a whole bunch that morning. 

This was my next mistake. I should have just said sure and cut them but I was hurt. I was sure L had sent her over to me with stack in hand just to spite me and make me feel weaker than I already was. She was a bully, and I can’t stand bullies. 

Ke informs L I refused to cut tags, L knows she can not come at me so she tells assistant manager, I, who comes to confront me.

“I” doesn’t know “L” is right behind him so when he asks me why I refuse to cut the tags it was too late to send her away. 

I didn’t realize they weren’t together and I thought they were trying to gang up on me, I also again found myself in a corner and instantly became aware of this and uneasy. 

I tell “I” I definitely will cut the tags I was just taking a break from first as I had already been cutting tags all morning, L jumps in and says that I **have** to cut the tags. 

I tell L she does not get to talk to me, especially after what has happened.

L says she DOES get to talk to me and I HAVE to listen to what she says. 

I look at “I” for help and start to lose control saying are you serious? This is not right and I shouldn’t be treated this way. L refuses to step back and give me space, I ask her to leave me alone and she say NO, I grab my water bottle and book it out of there crying and screaming “YOU ARE A B\*\*\* L,” “YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON,” and other things I can’t remember saying as I’ve never said things like that before all the while she is yelling at me to “MAKE SURE YOU GET AN ST02,” (a form needed to go on medical leave). 

“I” stands there with no words, no help. 

I call substitute-manager, K, in a full on panic attack not sure what to do, she says to get the form and go home. I also call the union rep J and he also says to go home. I went to the office after to ask for the form, brought it to my doctor and then went on leave until L was actually gone for good. 

My doctor gave me a month off, I came back a week early. 

The only times I have had to see her since was when she came in as a customer with co-worker, Ke. Which put me into full blown panic and I had to go to the back to take an anti-anxiety pill. 

There were no consequences that I have heard of on her part. 

The only follow-up to all that undue hardship caused was for me to receive a Letter of Expectations from my employer and substitute manager, K, which was read to me as if I were a child and made sure I understood I couldn’t swear at my coworkers. I was sent home with said letter to learn about my mistake, but they kept informing me I was not being punished. I felt punished.

After returning to work, I was happy to see things were good again, I was happy to be back at work and everyone was smiling again.

Fast forward to the beginning of the Pandemic. 

My mental health, as well as everyone else's was suffering. I have asthma, so this was a cause for concern for me as I wanted to avoid the virus, but I wanted to continue to work. I voiced this issue to assistant manager, I, and supervisor, H, that I felt our protocols were lacking.

We were supposed to be changing to a self-serve model, social distancing, and if we couldn’t do that there should have been barriers in place.

The plexiglass barriers were 1.5 feet wide.

Customers still leaned around them.

If we stood with our backs to the pantry I would still be only 3 feet from the customer, not 6. And that was only if they weren’t leaning over the counter or around the barrier. 

And that was only if I wasn’t on the I.D station being cornered by the customers. 

And that was only if I wasn’t being asked by customers to come out on the floor and help them, and being glared at by superiors for not doing so.

Then I got sick.

I had all the symptoms of covid; a sore throat, fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc. I was terribly worried and didn’t want to infect the rest of my workplace or the town so I called the nurses hotline and they informed me to self isolate and that I should get tested due to my asthma.

Flash forward to nearly a foot long cotton swab getting shoved into my brain, I became very upset with the entire situation. I was only grocery shopping every 3 weeks to a month, a pet store which didn’t even allow me inside, and I was going to work, that’s it. Where else would I get sick?

When I returned to work with a negative covid test less than 4 days later, not even the full 10 day waiting period because I chose to push to get tested,  I was happy but angry and upset.

Why am I trying so hard to be here, being treated like i’ve done something wrong and not being heard in my workplace, especially a government one at that? I brought up my feelings with supervisor, H, as I now didn’t feel confident in assistant manager, “I”. 

H informed substitute manager, K, my concerns and I was able to finally speak with K on the phone about some of the issues related to their handling of covid, as they finally started to give staff the option to talk to her during staff hours every Friday. 

A few of my concerns was their handling of coronavirus, and the fact that I was also supposed to be getting trained to be M.O.D (Manager on Duty) which assistant manager, I, had informed me about continuously and in front of other staff members, which embarrassed me and I asked him not to talk about it until it was official, because they had a history of telling me things and then doing others. (I don’t even want to talk about the Employee of the month debacle) 

K informed me she had no idea of said M.O.D training, that she would call me the next week to talk about it, which she didn’t, and then it became the silent thing that no one really talked about. 

The corona virus situation got handled a little better, we added a barrier to the I.D station so people couldn’t get within 2 feet of you, but you would still be cornered, which I still think is an issue. 

I flipped the 1.5 foot wide plexi-glass on its side so at least it did what it was supposed to do a little better.

I really tried to remain positive but my mental health started to waver again. The fact that no one was talking about my M.O.D training, and that people were saying it was for the best, that I didn’t need the extra stress nor did they think I could handle it, did not help.

I started getting upset and depressed at work. I was literally trained for leadership, It’s something I was passionate about as I care and love people. I dreaded going to work because of the huge lack of support, it was unorganized, and complete chaos without a manager.

I felt I had so much training and skill and potential to give to them yet they were treating me like I’ve done something wrong by having a mental illness and chronic pain, or that I am fragile and can’t do certain tasks. 

I have my business diploma, I have started online businesses, I have thousands of hours of training in leadership, mentorship, and so much more and I am always interested in learning. I am open and open to improvement but if someone tells me I am incapable of a task because I show my emotions, that I am incapable of being a leader because I care about things and won't stand for injustice? 

If anything this makes me a good leader because I can understand the ups and downs of life, and I understand people. None of them seem to.

At the beginning of our training we were asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how we felt that day. Each day of that week we were asked that question and I remarked how much that meant to me, to all the staff. 

If you were a 10 you were ready to absorb information, if you were 5 or lower you were closed off and not ready to absorb, you were upset and confrontational, this was called above or below the line. L refused to implement this after the training was over.

I was a 10 nearly every day of those training sessions. I have been a 5 or lower ever since. 

They wouldn’t have known this, they didn’t ask.

I went on leave again May 22 after struggling with chronic pelvic pain. I could not walk around without shooting pain into my thighs, I was upset and depressed, and I felt like no one was taking me seriously and felt like I was lying or exaggerating it.

When I told them I had cramps and needed to sit on the chair at I.D they said again? Yes that is what chronic is. 

They “brought back” above and below the line the day after I left.

Thankfully my doctor gave me until June 22 off, which since then things have been getting pretty good. My cramps lasted an entire month, and I have been getting better ever since I’ve been off of work. But recently, the thought of having to go back to all of that has me so nervous and anxious. I feel like they have been talking about me or discrediting me, the only reason or proof for this being it feels weird when I go in there now.

**Today is June 18, 2020, I go back to work in 4 days.**

I had this very kind email conversation with the HR rep V.

**V**: Hi Brooklyn,

I’ve spoken with you a couple of times before regarding your medical leaves.

I understand that you are off work again but may be returning to work June 22, 2020. In the event that you need to remain off work, please ensure that you provide clear medical limitations and restrictions on an updated STO2 form, cognitive or physical. In the absence of sufficient information, your STIIP benefits may be withheld until satisfactory evidence has been provided.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly next week.

Regards,

Hello Vicky,

  
Yes I remember you well.   


Was there a problems with my previous documents?

  
I will be returning on that date yes, but I am now feeling anxious about and dreading my return as this email is very off-putting. 

  
I feel our workplace greatly lacks support for both chronic physical and mental problems, which I am dealing with. It is why I have gone on leave as my problems all get worse at the workplace.   
We do not have a manager. This is a huge cause of duress for me. Do you know when this position will be filled? 

  
Our horrible handling of the corona virus issue in my workplace has also been a cause of that. I also have athsma and have presented that concern many times to our assistant manager and supervisors without any concern.

  
I understand your role as HR is supposed to be for the employees and employers to have better communication but I feel that so far this has greatly been lacking in our workplace and by your side of the issue. Are you not supposed to be here to help? Not hinder?

  
I should not feel attacked or that my pay may be in jeopardy because I am struggling in my life right now both mentally and physically and my workplace lacks the support to help me with that, I don't need counselling from you guys I have that already, I need a workplace that supports me and doesn't treat me differently because of my mental illness. 

  
This is a human rights violation.

  
If I don't have this support in my workplace it causes it to become worse, of course it would.   
Please let me know how you can support me in this. Rather than make me feel as if I have done wrong by trying to better myself both mentally and physically by my doctor's request?   
I have asked him to fill out the forms thoroughly as you guys are very adamant about that. There is not much else I can do in this case. I can not watch him write and tell him what to say.

  
Regards,

Brooklyn

  
V: **Subject:** Absence and Medical Info

Hi Brooklyn

I apologize if my email had come across off-putting; that was not my intention. I had actually wanted to speak with you on the phone rather than emailing you, but I couldn’t connect with you earlier on phone. You may have noticed there was a missed call on your phone.

I am also sorry to hear that you are feeling lack of support from your workplace/HR for both your physical and mental health. Part of the process of the Employer trying to obtain clear limitations and restrictions is to facilitate the support and identify any accommodation needs that the Employer may require to fulfill, if such a duty exists. Without this information, we would be unclear as to how we can support you.  

If you recall, I had reached out back in the Fall of last year and reached out to provide support, trying to obtain additional information. Unfortunately, you didn’t feel comfortable with further dialogue with me so I had to conclude my involvement at that time.

My role here in HR is also to ensure that satisfactory medical evidence meets the requirement for STIIP benefits prior to being issued. Therefore, my other intention of reaching out today was to provide a gentle reminder so that you can communicate with your doctor as to what is required by the Employer and so that there are no surprises, or you would have to go back to your doctor if not needed to. This process is outlined on the Instruction page of the STO2 form as well as in your Collective Agreement under Appendix 4. We cannot tell your doctor what to write so the Employer relies on you to have that dialogue with your doctor so that he/she can clearly communicate to us what you need medically in the workplace.

I am available next week anytime to connect over the phone. Please let me know what would work best.

Thanks.

**V**

### My Reply:

I have done all you guys have required of me and communicated this to my doctor as well as wrote a note to go along with your instruction page.

I don't see how I haven't met the requirements of the STIIP.

I am not sure what more I can do about this. Other than re-emphasize to my doctor the importance to you guys to have my prognosis to give me my pay.

I don't feel comfortable talking to you over the phone. I don't feel comfortable sharing my personal issues with someone who can not help or support me.

I feel comfortable enough to share them with my direct manager and supervisor, as I understand it will help them in their duty. But I don't understand how it will help you, other than to make me feel anxious and like I am doing something wrong or lying.

I have done all you guys have asked of me and I will continue to do so, but I will not put my health In jeopardy continuously anymore.

I will return to work as my doctor sees fit, fill out all the necessary paperwork, and I will get it filled out again if it doesn't meet your expectations. But that is the extent of my ability.

I would prefer to do emails if you need more information from me or if you have any further questions, but I do not want to speak to you on the phone. It makes me uncomfortable, it gives me anxiety, and it is not good for me.

Just typing this email I am physically sweating, shaking, and distressed. I hope you understand the duress you are causing me.

I appreciate your support and understanding.

Back to asking you guys for help, if you read this far, I so greatly appreciate you and your time. I am now I am unsure what to do with myself. 

I wasn’t planning on going on leave again, I was hoping I would feel better about going back to work and things would be okay again. This really threw that off and I feel almost violated.

These emails almost feels like they want me to go on leave again or expect me to. Where is the support in that? Or does that not matter?

Does my employer not have to care about my disabilities? Is that not a human rights violation to discriminate based on mental health? 

I am unsure what I should do at this point. I feel like people have much bigger problems than me in this world but I am hurting and I don't know what to do.

Am I taking this out of context? 

Any advice is appreciated internet friends.

Just looking for some support.

302,"So i didn't grow up with my dad... long story short my mum took off and moved back home (ireland) from the big city of new york. My dad constantly wanted to stay in contact to watch me his only child grow up but my mum being the way she is said no. She then when I was 6 years old was able to change my surname to her name, which is a very irish surname that I love very much. A year ago we moved to america to further my education only for her to kick me out. Not knowing what to do i stayed with a friend and contemplated contacting my dad whom I have never met... eventually I found my grandmother and then I eventually spoke to my dad. I moved up to NJ and have been living with my dad since late February... i haven't spoken to mum since she kicked me out.

To make a long story short he wants me to change my surname back but I dont want to because I know it will make the possible future relationship with my mum difficult. I also feel uncomfortable doing it because my current surname is all i've known... We had a disagreement about it and he keeps saying that I am his daughter and I was born (insert his surname)

Should I give in and change my name ????",19Jun2020,1
303,"I just recently realized, whenever i feel mad or frustrated or just something extreme but along those same kind of feelings, i always have the urge to destroy or break something. For example, I'd throw my phone off where I know it's going to break. Now for real, it got broken. RIP to my previous phones who had the same fate. my glasses as well, i broke it in half.

or sometimes, I'd have the urge to cut myself off from my friends. i start with deleting conversations i have with them. but when i don't i would just deactivate my social media accounts, or delete all social media apps that will make me in-contact with my friends. or anyone. though, i end up reinstalling the same apps. 

i also like to write, sometimes literary. but when i feel frustrated about what i wrote, i usually have them saved on my phone or typed in my computer, i would delete all stuff i have written just to get away from that kind of feeling. then i end up regretting it later on. am i making sense? 

a friend told me to change the way i cope whenever i encountered these kind of feelings/state, like try throwing pillows instead of something valuable to me. i told her it won't be as effective, since i got used to destroying things that really have value to me. the bigger the value of a thing i destroyed, the more i forget about the frustration even if only for a while. i end up, again, regretting it later. i thought maybe this is a projection of self-destruction. or maybe an anger management issue (i really dont know everything about it so im sorry if i got it wrong or seem like im self diagnosing, no.)

i view this kind of behavior/attitude as a punishment on myself, but it helps me stop the frustration for a while and make it seem that the cause of my frustration didn't happen. i just want the source of my frustration to disappear by breaking stuff or doing something i know i'll regret later. because if i don't, it will make me hate myself more. ironic. am i making sense? no.

I pay rent at the house so legally she can’t touch my stuff (this is in Texas). That being said she is making it incredibly difficult to come to the house even though she isn’t there. I am absolutely terrified of going back to the house and I keep having awful thoughts of her attacking me again.

308,"    So about three years ago I was seeing this guy and we were happy and enjoying our time together... or so I thought. Come to find out near the end he had been seeing two other girls and the same time. This absolutely devastated me and just simply fucked me up. 
    Flash forward to the next guy I was with for about a year (recently ended). Our relationship was fine and he was/is a great guy and I still love him. Yet, I found throughout the course of the relationship I struggled a lot with trusting him and constantly felt like he would cheat on me like the other guy did even though he was super open, trustworthy, as well as patient with me. Yet I couldn’t get my head out of my ass and not feel like there was another girl on the other side of it. I wouldn’t ever scream at him and accuse him of cheating on me but sometimes I would have these vivid dreams of him cheating on me and just wake up crying and need reassurance from him (not a fun experience don’t recommend it). I would also notice him get super close to certain girls at a given time and just idly sat by and spiraled as he tried to get through to me that they’re just friends. I just want to feel like I can trust someone again without having all of these intrusive thoughts like no matter who I meet they’ll ultimately get bored of me and cheat on me because I feel that this is what ultimately ended my last relationship 

TL;DR: got cheated on in one of my past relationships and can’t feel like I can trust someone again. Don’t know what to do.",19Jun2020,1
309,"I was at my friends wedding. I was standing talking to a mutual friend at the wedding, he’s a musician and a videographer who I had worked with before. He’s quite friendly, charismatic and funny sometimes. He’s a heavily devout baptist Christian and identifies heavily with it as a performer and has appeared pretty “stuck up” in my opinion with some things he says and the way he carries himself. I was introducing another friend to him as we were talking, and as I said “Gus, meet Evans, Evans meet Gus” I also said “Gus is a bit mental”, to break the ice and keep things light hearted, it was also in reference to the fact that he had his top off in the bar on the stag doo (not really that crazy, hence why calling him “mental” was light hearted”), and also Evans- the friend I was introducing him to, is really mental, a rugby player, and quite eccentric and intelligent. 

Gus took offence to being called “mental” and in the middle of being introduced he abruptly announces to me in a very threatened and serious tone “no!! I’m not mental”. It was very awkward and it confirmed my already existing suspicion that he is indeed stuck up, or, how I put it to my friend, has a stick up his arse. 

Was I a dick by calling him “mental”? Or was he indeed, stuck up? 

It’s been bothering me for months. There’s really no point in confronting him about it. I already know he will respond with something like “oh, I totally do not remember that”. I’ve decided that I’ll only ever confront him about it if I ever have to work with him in the future. Otherwise, we’re not going to be friends so there’s no need.",19Jun2020,1
310,"Hello all, 

I’m really lost with what to do. A group of losers online started degrading me so I responded and they decided to create an entire ig page to harass me. At first I thought they were just bored kids but they have been stalking me for the past 3 months!! These are some of the things they’ve done that stood out: 
- they contacted my little sister and called her derogatory names 
- they contact my friends and harass them 
- they sent my tweets to my school (which failed because I didn’t say anything wrong) 
- they created several accounts to harass me. they edit my photos and photoshop slaves into the background of my pictures because my boyfriend is white and I’m black 
- they told  me that they will follow me for the next 20 years
- they won’t stop sending me messages through new fake accounts 

Here is what I’ve done 
- ignored the messages, I don’t even open them 
- block them (they always create new accounts though) 
- went private on social media 

Even with doing all of this, I’m annoyed. I want to be able to share my gardening with others but it’s hard when there are anonymous twitter and ig accounts commenting negative things on all of my photos. They don’t even rest! 

I have filed a police report but from what I’ve heard, the process is longer because they are harassing me through anonymous accounts. 

I should’ve blocked them right away but now it’s to the point where I’m just frustrated. I see things in the internet all the time that I don’t like but I’m not harassing anyone about it, for 3+ months??? 

What am I even supposed to do to get these losers away? Is it even possible to go public on my accounts if I know they’re waiting to save my photos and harass me eventually?",19Jun2020,1

I do have depression and I do feel emotionally empty sometimes, so I think it might have something to do with it. I'm also kind of happy he is in a better spot right now because my grandmother is a bitch and treated him like literal garbage. He's also been suffering for the past few years, in and out of the hospital constantly. I already kind of knew he was going to die anyways. Still, I don't have an explanation of why I don't feel sad or how I also didn't cry throughout any of this. Someone please explain!",19Jun2020,1
313,"Yeah, yeah I’m 14 I have time to think about it but wow my last name is just terrible. 

It’s hard to spell, hard to pronounce, and it’s a pain in the ass to type out.

So that’s why I would love to take my future wife’s last name. 

But the problem is, me and my cousin are the only ones left with the last name and our families are expecting us to pass it on.

My dad gets really mad whenever I mention the inconveniences that having our last name has.

If I don’t end up passing it on my entire family will be really pissed but idk who’s happiness is more important",19Jun2020,1
314," A few weeks ago I come to find out the CEO of Wonsulting, **Jonathan Javier** ***sexually assaulted*** a woman a year ago (during one of his college parties). The woman anonymously spoke on the topic through a Twitter thread. She and 70+ other women stated their stories on that thread and most of them were allegations towards the UC Riverside fraternity Phi Kappa Psi.

**Tweet reference:**

*""Jonathan Javier got me really drunk at a Phi Psi party, forced himself to finger me. I went with it because I was scared. He then called an Uber to take me home but we ended up infront of a house I didn't know. He insisted that I go inside with him for just a little bit, I repeatedly said no and was glad that the Uber driver didn't leave me alone and took me home safely.*""

I used to be affiliated with his company up until I found out about this news. He built a reputable LinkedIn platform, even having men and women looking up to him. I tried emailing his coworkers about this statement and they said they were dealing with it ""internally"". Which is a bunch of bullshit. There's no accountability. You know what pains me the most is that he gets to be successful and never for a second thinks about the time he did that to the woman.

**His personal email is** : [jonathan@wonsulting.com](mailto:jonathan@wonsulting.com)

**His coworker's email** : [jerry@wonsulting.com](mailto:jerry@wonsulting.com)

This incident has been keeping me up at night. It pains me to see that situations like these gets unnoticed and the stories of these men and women never get justice. Please help me and email them to step down.",19Jun2020,1
315,"I’ve been married to the same Man for 18 years. We have a good life. He’s nice to me never touched me in a mean way. We haven’t had sex in 7 years. We haven’t kissed on the lips in 5 years. He says he has trouble getting an erection. But if i grab him there he’s hard to 2.2 seconds. Yes, I’m overweight, but so is he. I feel as if we’re more best friends then spouses. 

I’m a stay at home mom with 4 kids. Two older daughters, from a previous marriage, whom he treats as his own and twin boys now 17. In my world, everyone comes first. I’m the last one to eat, the last one in line, the last one to to my laundry. Everything comes before me. And that’s ok. I started a fundraiser for my daughter who is an icu nurse to make homemade meals for the icu staff. That went over really well. Make me feel good that I was able to help out in the covid time we live in. 

My kids have more clothes than I do. Even the twins have more clothes than me. So, I maxed out one of my credit cards to the tune of 10,000 on stuff I needed. (Over time) New clothes, makeup etc. my husband doesn’t know about it. It’s secret. He will freak cause we just consolidated our debt into one monthly payment. And i ran up the bill again. I feel so stupid. But I needed stuff. 

Recently, an ex co-worker of mine (we dated before i got remarried) has been texting me for a while wanting to hook up. I thinking about it. I feel like an outsider in my own home.

318,"For about the past 6 years I've (24M) been with a non profit in the US, volunteering full time in a variety of different areas, from A/V tech, to clothing line development, to media, and the main one, young adult mentorship and leading international missions trips. I have never been paid, and lived off fundraising and donations. There has been a lot of great experiences, but a lot of ups and downs over the years.

I found myself at a crossroads last year, after I left my organization and returned home (I'm not a US citizen). I left because I felt I could no longer pretend to be someone other than myself. The organization I worked for is religious, and I'm gay. I had enough of it and left, and decided to return home and find a job and work. Pretty quickly I realized that I don't enjoy living in my home country, and my passion for freediving and spearfishing was all I wanted to do, and that pursuing my passion wasn't possible at home. So, at the beginning of the year, I went back to my organization. It being a religious organization, I was in a unique position given my years of volunteering there, to be able to apply for a Religious visa, a visa that down the road in a few years time, would lead to being able to apply for a green card. My dream ultimately is to be able to live and work in the US in the dive industry. The 2 months I spent there before I had to leave due to Covid, were pretty difficult. I was working again but it was difficult to return to a religious space when I knew being true to myself was being out of the closet, something not possible in the organization. Again, while I am volunteering for this org, I don't get paid and live off fundraising and donations, but I decided it was a means to an end. Put my head down and go the next 4 years with this organization, and at the end, I come out with a green card, I can leave the organization, and live my life and follow my passion in the dive industry. 

Since I had to leave the US due to covid, I've had time to think and weigh the options. **Option one**, is to go back to the US and to that religious organization, and take a shot at my dreams of being a dive instructor. It's a gamble. I don't know if ill be able to scrounge up the donations to be able to financially afford it, and even if I can, idk if I'll make it through 4 years having to hide my sexuality. Mentally and emotionally its very tiring and painful to do this. Or even at the end of the 4 years, if I'll be granted a green card. The average income of a dive instructor is about $30-$40k. It isn't much, and there isn't much job security, but I haven't found anything else in my life that is as life giving and makes me as happy. 

**Option two**, is to stay at home, where I'm able to be out of the closet and true to myself. My plan would be to get a job in the local film industry where the average yearly take home is about $50k-$70k. I have a family member my age who has worked in the industry for the past 5 years and makes this amount. It would be relatively easy to get my foot in the door in this industry. This is a pretty significant amount of money for someone our age to be making here. I don't feel like film is my passion, even though I have a background in photography and videography. Overall, this option offers me a lot higher salary, and more job stability and security. The downside, is that I'm unable to work in the dive industry. Also the seasonal depression here is pretty real. I genuinely don't enjoy living here. 

If I choose option 2, and stay home, I'm basically giving up on my dream of being a dive instructor. If I'm away from my org for too long and haven't been working with them, I lose the eligibility to apply for the visa I would need to be able to eventually live and work there. I feel like going back presents a more immediate heartache and financial hardship. I'll have to hide myself and just be getting by financially. But theres a chance that at the end I'll be able to do what I love, even if I wouldn't make very much doing it and if there wasnt very much job security in it. On the other hand, staying at home, I wouldn't really have anything to do that I would consider a passion or something that I love. Not to say that I wouldn't find something else..but yea.

I feel like at my age, 24, I need to make a decision. Going back will mean giving up another 4 years of my life, and at the age of 28, I'll just be starting my career, or trying to get my foot into the door of my desired career. Staying home, I'll have much more financial stability and job security, but at the sacrifice of my passion. This isn't to say that I wouldn't be able to live and work at home, and travel every year on a vacation and dive and do what I love. But most of the time here at home I would just be working and making money, not doing what I love. I feel like my 6 years at my organization taught me a lot of life skills and leadership ability, but didn't give me any credentials for life or a career outside of non profit work. 

**TLDR**. **Option 1**, Go back to a religious organization for 4 years and have to hide my sexuality as a gay man in an attempt to get a green card so I can **pursue my dream of being a dive instructor** in the US. **Option 2**, Stay home, **be true to myself as a gay man**, and make more money and have more job security. Also arguably have a higher chance at finding a significant other as I live close to a big city, vs the small town my org is based in. If all goes according to plan, **Option 1 will result in an average salary of $30k-$40k, Option two will result in an avg salary of $50k-$70k.**",19Jun2020,1

320,"I am on a phone, and also dyslexia so can’t spell to save my life, so don’t hold that against me. 
Longish time lurker, First time poster.

I am looking for a bit of advice about stuff happening at work. 
So for work I do a lot of driving, easy 1000km a week. 
The company I work for has put a gps tracker in my car which tracks where I am if I was to have a crash or something. I have ZERO issue with this, but it also sends reports to my boss each week about speeding and stuff like that. I do have 2 issues with parts of this gps tracker. Let me know if it is something I should but worried about or not.
First, and the main issue, is that I feel like I am being treated like a Trainnee at the company as no one but the Trainnees in my part of the company have the gps trackers (maybe a few others that have been caught speeding). My boss and others that I have talked to say that this is not the case and I am not a trainee, and a lot of people have them, and they use another part of the business as an example, but it is not that relevant to me, and the part of the business that I am in. I also feel that the people that I work with will look down on it and think that I am a trainee which will make my job in Agricultural sales harder. 
My 2nd issue is about the speed tracking, I know that it is a illegal, but it also feels like I have a cop sitting in the car with me, even when I overtake someone or just change speed zones and down slow down in time. they say that it is nothing to do with tracking my speed, and that’s not the intention, but I don’t think that it is ever that easy.
This is a issue for me as it is on my thoughts most of the time and then keeps me up at night and also has cause a bit of a panic attack before. 
I think that they are going to come back with another option for me which will do all the same things but just not the top model, so really won’t change anything.
They say everyone is going to get them which I believe but they will not give me a date and I don’t believe that it will be anytime soon, as I believe there will A LOT of push back. 

So is this something that I should keep pushing or should I give it up?",19Jun2020,1
321,"A few days ago, my boyfriend asked me to go to the beach with him. He asked if i had a swimsuit, but he seemed disappointed when i showed him a regular one piece. He said i needed a bikini. My boyfriend also got me a birthday present, it was a crop top. I thought it was nice, he insisted i try it on.

I put it on and he started kissing me. While we were kissing, he put his hand on my stomach. Just started kinda rubbing it in a circle. I thought he was gonna move upwards, but he just stayed on my stomach. Then he actually put his finger in my belly button. Just in and out. It really killed the mood and i asked him to knock it off.

He did and i just asked what was that supposed to be, he said he doesn't know. That he just likes belly buttons and finds them attractive. I was pretty confused, so i asked him to elaborate. He said ""You know how some guys really like women's feet? I'm like that too, except i like belly buttons instead."" I said ""So it's a fetish.""

He just nodded his head. He started talking in detail about how he's liked them since he was a kid and then the different types of belly buttons. Pictures of the kind of one he liked or something. I kinda tuned him out. But he had a lot of pictures on his phone, which were of, like, models or something. Only cropped to where the belly is in full frame.

Then he breathed a sigh of relief, said he was glad to get that off his chest.

So...That's something i've never heard before. A belly button fetish. I've never really dealt with someone with a fetish before. I know that there's some guys who like feet, but Belly Buttons? That's completely foreign to me. What can you even do to a belly button?",19Jun2020,1
323,"My niece confessed that her step father did something very creepy to her. I don’t know if this is the place to go but I’m just lost and confused and need help. She swore me to secrecy not to tell her family but everything is hitting the fan all at once. 

Grandmother just died, nieces parents are divorcing (and it’s very ugly) family is arguing about deceased grandmothers money, aunt stole the deed to the house of said grandmother, niece’s biological father decided after 8 years of not being around that now was a great time to sue for custody of said niece. Needless to say my sister is very very stressed out!

On top of all this my niece just dropped a bomb on me! She told me... that her step dad walked into her bedroom after she got out of the shower. She was naked. She did nothing to get into trouble but something just snapped in his head and he started spanking her (while still naked) and it went on for an hour. She was ten when this happened. She said she was very embarrassed and humiliated and told no one.

324,"Hi, I work in a restaurant at a resort. 

Per the governor of my state, restaurants are only allowed to be at 50% occupancy and tables are supposed to be 6 feet apart. 

They are not. 

I just got called back recently and we are absolutely over run. The restaurant is full constantly, definitely not at 50%. we are at max capacity, hell sometimes even more.  and some tables may be 6 ft apart but 70% are not. 

also, ""waiting"" areas arent allowed, people are supposed to be 6 ft apart while they wait in line and they arent. they crowd together down the hallway and no one stops them. 

As an immuno-compromised person, I absolutely do not feel safe there especially when they arent following guide lines (They are for some things, like the amount of people allowed in the pool, sanitization, etc). but the restaurant is the biggest part of the resort and biggest problem. 

it's like the rules don't exist there. the supervisors and managers are not enforcing it.

333,"I’m a 23 year old female and I guess you can say I’ve always been a lot different than most people. I live in my own head at all times and am always concerned with what other think about me, sometimes believing that everyone is out to fuck me over or plotting against me. I often experience an intense feeling of emptiness, or extreme sadness for no specific reason. I’ve experienced anxiousness in social environments, or every day activities. I’ve recently noticed a pattern in my 8 year relationship and it’s worrying me. I hope nobody judges me for any of this, as this is my first time acknowledging this issue and speaking about it. 

I’ve been with my bf for almost 10 years and somewhere along the line I became extremely clingy and possessive. I get upset when he’s hanging out with his friends, I manipulate him into feeling bad for hanging out with his friends to the point where he’ll cut them off for a while. I wake up thinking about him and immediately check my phone to see if he’s texted me and if he hasn’t I spend my whole day constantly checking my phone to see if he’ll text, and if he doesn’t I give him shit about it. I can spend 5 straight days with him but if he goes to see one of his friends the next day and doesn’t pick up his phone when I call I get upset and give him shit about it. I even had his location on my phone and checked it constantly to see where he was. I noticed that he’s my main source of happiness, and a beautiful distraction to everything going on in my life ( sick mom, sick father, grades, my own shitty health). I have this intense fear that he’ll leave me one day and I believe this is where this crazy behavior comes from.

The last straw was the other night when we had a conversation about how he would communicate better with me and stop treating me differently once he was around his friends. That same night we had a conversation he was at his friends house until 2am and when I called he ignored it. I called another few times and he kept sending me to voicemail. Eventually he turned his phone completely off and this pissed me off to no end. It was scary because I had never felt that amount of rage, a feeling a anger that I couldn’t control. I then called his friend’s phone back to back and finally her brother answered the phone and threatened to slap me if I didn’t stop calling, this enraged me further because I didn’t hear my bf defending me in the background (he later told me he defended me once they guy hung up). After the phone call ended, I got dressed and ran outside and started jogging up a few blocks to his house to fight the guy who answered the phone, keep in mind this is a grown man I was running up the street to fight and I’m a slim 5’7 female. Now that I was jogging to his house, I call his phone again and this time it’s turned back on and he’s telling me he’ll come downstairs and for me to stay downstairs. For the first time he cried to me and told me he loved me but couldn’t be in a toxic relationship like this anymore and that if I didn’t change he had to leave me. 

That whole situation scared me as well and I don’t know what came over me. I hated that he always treated me differently when his friends were around because he assumed when I called I would be upset about something, like I usually am. According to him, he felt he had to cut off his friends for me to prevent me from being upset and when he was with me he ignored his friends, which caused them to be upset with him in return. So it became a never ending cycle somewhere. Him treating me weird when he was with them, and I would react off of that and associate him being with friends with him treating me differently and he addressed this and agreed to work on it. I would like to work on my possessive behavior. I notice I put him and his issues before myself and that my self esteem is REALLY low. I often believe I can’t do better than him. This behavior is ugly and isn’t normal and I want to get help. But I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone this and get a psychologist. Any advice? Please don’t judge. I’m aware this isn’t normal behavior and have nobody else to talk to. Any advice is helpful.",19Jun2020,1

No company wants to listen as to why I came to that decision.

338,"While I [19M] was at college I decided to buy a box of condoms ""just in case"" and was also curious how they felt like. I brought them back home for the summer and stashed them away well and completely forgot about them. Two months later, one day at work I realized that my parents may discover my stash, as they were renovating their house. I came home that night and found that my box of condoms were not there. I am pretty sure that my parents discovered my stash and are upset with me, thinking that I am sexually active, which I am not. 

Should I just let it all blow over if they don't bring this up or should I come clean and talk to them about this? I am afraid that they will think that I am lying. My parents are extremely strict and I just feel that they will be disgusted with my behaviour.

TL;DR Parents think I am sexually active as they found the condoms I hid, but I just bought them just in case.

339,"So at one point there was this girl in my class, we sat next to eachother and talked both in and out of class. To me i got mixed signals from it but im just here to ask this, for some reason I am telling myselff to ask her whether i had a chance with her or not. Note that it has been a couple months since we talked. This happened in college not high school. Should I just ask her out the blues?",19Jun2020,1
340,"I play a lot of video games, being young, unemployed, and off of school at the moment. Some of these video games are online, most are not. The issue with all of these games is that if I don't do well according to my minds gargantuan standards, I feel worthless. 

This has been particularly evident with Dead by Daylight's new chapter, Silent Hill. The new character I purchased, The Executioner, has been quite difficult to learn. For around 3 days, I've been trying to learn the new character, but each consecutive loss makes me feel like I don't deserve to own him.

I want to hurt myself for losing. I want to get better but I make no progress. This is how I feel with most things, now I think about it. I haven't noticed an improvement at anything in years, even if there might have been.

Is there a way to change my overly pessimistic mindset so my money won't go to waste? I find it super easy to give up at things when I don't do well, especially after sinking hours into a skill that just never improves.

341,"i was thinking maybe people here could help me understand something like this, because i will keep obsessing over this. I recently returned from a country where i lived about 6 years. I met up with a couple of friends here and there was a person i didn't know before, we talked a lot and it seemed like he enjoyed it, making eye contact and giving me attention.(He was well aware that i didn't live in my home country for a long time) Then we all went for a walk and he was walking beside me, everything was nice and all. Then he suddenly asked: ""So how many friends do you have here? A friend and a half?"" At the time, i didn't think much of it, but right now i am confused whether it was a joke or an insult? What does this ""a friend and a half"" mean? In my language such question can be seen as quite arrogant. Since i am bad at social things and interpreting guys' behaviour, i was curious how people here would interpret that? Would you be offended or think that someone has an interest in you?

342,"There's been a huge issue at my university of online vs offline exams in response to covid. My uni is ridiculous because they've released a statement that they recommend offline exams. Wtf? So my professor is refusing to have the finals online. I'm sending emails to her, demanding that she see the severity of the pandemic but she's adamant. I can't risk failing the course. What do I do?

I’ve expressed my concerns to her via email and she’s answered that she understands the extreme situation of covid but believes it best to follow university guidelines (of taking offline exams when people are getting sick and dying). I told her they’re just guidelines and won’t do anything for students if they get covid. She seems irritated that I’m the only one complaining about having the offline exam but I just can’t stay quiet when I live with a family member with a weak immune system.

I know I’m doing the right thing, but I’m scared she won’t let me take the online exam. It takes two hours to go to school and I’m terrified being on a packed bus the whole time so that means I probably won’t take the finals and get an F. Other professors have been great about this issue since the student union emailed everyone about the students' concerns. I don't know what's wrong with this professor.",19Jun2020,1

347,"Ok silly question I know, but its really bothering me.
So last night while trying to fall asleep I got this bad gut feeling that the shelf over my bed was going to fall ontop of me. 

Theres no reason to have thought this, the shelf has been up in the exact spot for years without issue. Held up by sturdy reinforced nails in studs, I hung it myself and know it's strong. I dont live in an area that gets earthquakes and have no actual reason to belive it will fall. 

The shelf itself is a little heavy. It would definatly leave some bruses if it fell but likely wouldn't warrent a trip to the hospital (though I would worry about my dog who sleeps with me). Its been hanging above me every night without a 2nd thought for years but tonight something just felt wrong. And i cant explain why. 

I couldnt sleep so i ended up taking everything down and leaving it on my floor for the night.

Its morning now and I dont know what to do with the shelf now or the large blank spot on my wall. Should I hang it back up? Am I just being parinoid? Or should I chuck the shelf and just find a big canvas or something to out in its place? 
Thanks",19Jun2020,1
348,"This has happened my entire life with men and women. 

I’m not the most attractive person in the world; I’m not sure why it happens. But it does. Often. And I’m incredibly lonely because of it. 

As soon as I start getting really close to someone, they confess. Then, through one way or another, I fuck it up to where they hate me and leave forever. Ive tried communicating, forcing reciprocation (this doesn’t last long), and acting aloof (failed miserably). Inevitably they blow up at me and I’m the worst person ever and they break my heart. Nothing works. 


My current best friend is in the same boat. After I explained that I’m really not looking for a relationship, they’ve been really cool about it; they haven’t forced or pushed anything more but I can tell they still like me and it makes me really nervous. I don’t want to lose another close friend.

350,"I'm gonna rant a little but and put a TL:DR for those who don't feel like reading into the specifics.

For as long as I remember my mother all my life has made me feel less like a person but a 'something'. I've been pretty much a shut in to the point where I barely got out of my home. My parents are the overprotective type and don't really let myself, or my others siblings, get out much. My mother also has a tight grip on things we are allowed to do in general even in the home. Until recently, a few years back, we weren't even allowed on a majority of social media or websites. 

She's always looking down on those around her and makes herself out to be the victim. My dad always tries his best to please her and does everything she wants without question. He's the husband version of a simp. This is why when she makes him do stuff he doesn't complain to her, but often tells me and my siblings that he doesn't want to hear her complain so that we should follow whatever she says. Either that or punishment will accord which is normally physical (belt beating, getting slapped, etc). 

My straws for how much I can take have been thinning for years. Even more so whenever my money that I make online is found and taken. In fact, I was saving up for a few years since I was able to do work online for random people and all of it was taken away from me by my mom last year. I had over $1000 saved and it was stripped away. 

I've done my fair share of stress eating due to all of this, which has put another target on my back in her eyes. She constantly brings up my weight to put me down. Honestly, my looks in general are commented on negatively so no surprise there. 

The reason I'm even writing this post now is due to what happened a few hours ago. I recently ""was allowed"" to go out and get a summer job and I have been working at the place for 2 - 3 weeks. I have already been saving up again and my mother told me earlier that she's going to be taking 90% of my check each week from now on. I tried to stand up for myself and say it was my money but she snapped back going on about how I am under her roof and that kind of stuff. 

I could go on and on but I feel like I said enough for now. All my ways out are non-existent. I don't have anyone irl to turn to either. I don't see myself going anywhere in life, now or ever. If anyone has any last suggestions, I'm all ears.

TL:DR My abusive mother has basically ruined my life from the beginning. Now she's forcing me to give her my only source of income.",19Jun2020,1

352,"I used to get on very well with my brother in law and when it's only the two of us, there's zero issue, but lately, I've noticed that he always tries to put me down, make me feel dumb, and play mind games. For example I'll say I didn't know a music group (I'm not from their country, I moved there recently with my partner, I'm  also not a native english speaker) and he'll overreact that he can't believe I didn't know them. Or he'll make fun of how I pronounce something or if I laugh or gasp or whatever loudly he'll make sure to make to point it out, making me feel very conscious about myself. I feel like I can't speak or react; everything I say is stupid or ridiculous and the butt of a joke. He also is a master gaslighter.  If I share something funny to our group chat he'll reply ''humm ok, no.'' or stuff along those lines, making me feel unfunny and annoying.

I don't know what to do, pointing out that it's not very nice of him only makes it worse; I'm oversensitive and need to calm down (I never raise my voice or freak out so idk?) and need to learn to take a joke, and to stop creating drama. Yeah, sometimes we have banter and it's cool but all the time is a bit much. It's hard enough to be away from my country and have no friends here, it's pretty lonely and I'm starting to not feel very welcome. I don't have problems with anyone else but no one defends me and they laugh at his jokes at my expense or don't say anything. My partner is starting to see it too.

355,"This is about my toxic friendship.

I’m starting high school soon. We’re neighbors, take the same bus, sometimes our parents drive each other home. Her and I are just not a good match. i’m constantly frustrated by what she does. even after communicating it doesn’t work - people are different and you can’t change them.

I’m dreading going back to school knowing i’m going to have to put up with 9+ hours with her at school, on transportation, etc. I’m already so introverted. the last 2years in school were horrific and i don’t remember a day where i didn’t want to collapse to the floor and lay there forever. 

the problem is she has mental health issues and she is also very clingy. which keeps this cycle continuing. but i’m getting tired of having to suppress my pissed off ness. i feel like she expects me to give and never take and just be happy with it because its human decency apparently. the passive aggressiveness is too much to handle. the sensitivity. the lack of tiny appreciation for little things i do to help her. i’m done with feeling so pissed off all the damn time and having to suppress it to the very bottom of my stomach for 12 hours straight, and every time i get pissed off i feel guilty. 

To be honest I do not want a close relationship with her, or anyone for that matter. I get into friendships to hang out and have fun. I like it when people do that and then deal with their own shit by themselves. That’s how all my old friendships went. But now i feel this obligation to be close. To me i just can not handle it because i hav my own weight to carry. when she puts it on me, i end up putting it on my mom by being irritated 24/7. the most we do to each other is apologize but no actual progress is made. 

I’ll usually say something like “I’ll try to be less angry next time and learn to communicate better.” She’ll just say “I’m so sorry, I feel so bad and guilty, it’s just that my parents are *insert long rant that i don’t want to listen to*”. It’s just so emotionally tiring and i have never met any other person in my entire life who relies so much on me.

and i can’t just break it off because i’ll end up alone for all 3ysars of high school. There’s really just 2 versions of hell - no friends, or in a toxic friendship. it is too much to deal with on top of school, family, and my own stuff. but i can’t just leave her. in the least offensive way possible she’s mentally and emotionally dependant on me and a few of her other friends, she will literally break down if i ever considered cutting it off. I can just imagine it: her head on the desk, ranting to all of our friends about it, saying she needs therapy and that she wants to die, that she feels worthless, indirect blame, all my friends think i’m a shitty person. i’m mentally exhausted just thinking about it.

What i worry about the most is that i’m in the wrong. like her previous friendship worked out amazing meanwhile i have a super long track record of friends that i’ve failed to stay friends with (literally, 1year is the longest best friend i’ve had my entire life besides her). i’ve had like 10 best friends while she’s had 1 best friend besides me. i kind of just expected she would come and go like everyone else in my life but no she’s staying and the worst thing is we’re not even compatible. wth do i do?",19Jun2020,1

357,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons.

So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director.

Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else (i only stayed at community college before doing mortuary school online ) because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety/Depression so i didn't get to join a frat/ meet girls at parties/ etc on campus . The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day( my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist). I have had some big and small anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this.I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse.

I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS,everyone and my twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS/MS due to my Anxiety/depression over the last 6-8 years. I feel like i can talk to guys easier then girls, i don't talk/text to a lot of girls which is fucking 0 girls.

Also i use tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday/ puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety/depression. i don't know that why girls on tinder don't reply to me or stop talking to me after 2 messages but most likely my speech impediments. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off for my speech and anxiety. i told everything to My mom/my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds ( i signed up for a gym before covid came), i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too, (slept 2-3 hours last night). i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too. I just want a normal life since i am at my fucking wits end right now too.

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. My speech is only affected too. What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ?

359,"Hello, I’m a 15 year old male, I live in Texas and I have no idea what to do in my situation. This is a pretty long post so thank you if you read this. I have 3 siblings one older and two younger that are also being abused. I live in a nice home with my mom and dad and I have basic necessities without question plus my parents give me nice stuff like a phone and I have my own room. But I have a problem with my dad. He has anger issues and gets extremely angry sometimes and yells a lot. The one thing I hate the most is when he calls me names. He calls me donkey, trash, dog and other insults in private and public in Arabic so others can’t understand. But it makes me feel terrible and hate him. He does the same thing to my other siblings. 

He also physically abuses us sometimes when he’s rlly angry. Since I’m older I usually can avoid it but he does slap me hit me if I’m close or cornered. My 2 younger sisters do get hit though. My 16 older brother had enough of his shit this year and locks himself in his room when my dad gets angry but sometimes my dad corners him and beats him. When I was younger though he beat me and my siblings with a belt. I remember some bad times but I don’t remember a lot of it. But at that time I thought it was normal and my dad said he does it bc he wants what’s better for me.

The thing is is that he usually does it for a reason. If I don’t do something the way he wants it or I do something wrong or I break something he will get pissed. And If I try to show my side of the story or if I believe something he says is wrong, he will get extremely pissed. He basically believes everything he does is correct and for the better of me and I will thank him when I grow up. He also lies sometimes and will call you a liar and screams at you if you suggest otherwise. He often says I should be fixing stuff around the house like “other kids” but I honestly just don’t see stuff. I don’t see cheese that’s left out and think “Hey I should probably put this in the fridge”. I thought “There’s still a plate of food left out so I probably should leave this for them”. I don’t screw up on purpose. One thing I should add is that I hate doing stuff with him like fixing something or telling him stuff in my life bc almost every time it ends up with him screaming. And then he screams at me and wonders “Why didn’t he just tell me”

Let me give you an example of something that happened today. My dad told me to fix a door handles. One of the screws were jammed and knowing my dad I knew he would blame me and scream at me. I hate when he does that so I started freaking out. I kept trying to screw it out harder and harder until the screw head was deformed. My dad came downstairs saw it and started screaming at me and calling me names and tried to fix it. After lots of screaming and me standing 6 ft away from him afraid he finally fixed it. And started screaming again. He tricked me into going in the garage and slapped me twice in the face while I was crying. I felt terrible emotionally after and hated him.

My mom sometimes gets into huge screaming fights with him every once in a while. We once ran away from him after they argued and he was throwing stuff after he told us to leave. My mom told me on the bus ride that my dad abused her when they younger by calling her names and beating her up painfully. We thought that was the end of him but he found us and went back to live with him. 

The thing that is tearing me the most is that soon after he is angry with everyone he is happy and acts like it never happens. My mom sometimes argues with him but a day later they are talking normally and making jokes. She also sides with him on a lot of things and also screams, curses and hits us sometimes. So I can’t confide and expect her to keep me safe from him. I am scared bc I know my parents really well and if I get CPS involved and I am allowed to go back into home they will always hate me and abuse me even more.

I get really good grades and I want to go to a good university so I am afraid of getting CPS involved because I’ve read some bad things about the foster care system.

But I am longing to have a family that loves me and I’m not scared of and I don’t want to jump family’s for the next 3 yrs. But the statistics say teenagers are not usually adopted.

So I’ve got two choices.

Suck it up and just push through until I am 18 but go to a good universe and never see them again. 

Or go into the foster care system and cross my fingers and hope for a good family that will love me to adopt me so I can go to a goo university and feel loved and supported.

Thanks for reading this, sorry it was long but I just needed to get everything out.

And please, please, please give me some advice. Anything will help.",19Jun2020,1
360,"Like seriously, everytime I've been to doctors they string me along for months on the same couple of medications, completely ignore my complaints on major negative side effects and dont listen to what I'm telling them. I feel like a guinea pig for new pills. No one actually listens and I thought it would just be a few bad doctors but NOPE there's at least a dozen of them within my state.

When going to a new doctor, first things I tell them is my diagnosis, my symptoms, previous medications, what worked and what didnt work. That would seem like pretty helpful information to a doctor but I guess not because what every new doctor does is tries to put me back on the same track of medications that DO NOT WORK. So I follow the same pattern of ""see doctor, get medication that foes not work, report it doesn't work, get ignored, see new doctor""

I feel like when I'm at the doctors they dont actually listen they just write prescriptions and send me out the door. I've seen 4 doctors, 6 therapists, 2 psychologists and 1 psychiatrist and all of them seem incessant on putting me on the same track of these 5 different medication's which I've reported to not work. Like rather then taking my word for it it's like every new ""professional"" wants to see me personally unravel rather than believe me. I'm not lying, why would I? I just want to get better but nobody listens.

Disheartening.

I don't want to keep going like this. It's draining. I'd like to just find a route which will lead to bettering myself, not just retake the same medications which have been proven time and time again to not work on me. They themselves say every medication has different effects on different people, yet when I have adverse side effects, they choose to ignore me because I'm mentally ill.

I don't want life to be like this. I just keep falling into deeper and darker depressions then bouncing back out into joyous bliss then fall deeper then bounce higher. It's exhausting. And everytime when I think I've hit the lowest point, the floor beneath me falls out. I dont want to talk, I dont want you to tell me it will be ok, just for the love of god will somebody offer me some real help rather than this  useless talk and these useless pills?",19Jun2020,1

362,"So I (27M) met this girl (37F) a few weeks ago. She lives out of state but came here to help a friend who we mutually know. Her and my buddy ended up hooking up all weekend. Her and I instantly connected though due to our personalities matching perfectly. So her and my buddy have been talking and texting since then (not dating just talking). In the mean time. My buddy is hooking up with other girls and she is hooking up with guys back in her state. 

She comes back here for a week and the same thing. This girl and I became instant friends  and one day after she flew back, her and I were texting and my buddy saw that and got mad at her. It wasn’t flirting or anything just checking up on each other’s lives. So she said let’s not tell him we’re still friends, I don’t want him to get mad at us. 

Meanwhile, they’re both still not dating and still hooking up with other people. 

So yesterday she texts me asking how my weekend was. I told her what had happened and when I told her I did shrooms, she said she’s never done it but wanted to. So we keep talking and she said “I’ll fly down next weekend and we can escape and do them”. She booked her flight. And then we start talking about how much fun it’ll be and she said that we shouldn’t tell anyone. It’ll be our secret. 

Then after we talk about all the guys she’s been hooking  up with and I tell her my stories.

365,"Triggers: pregnancy, miscarriages

Alright reddit, I hope you're sitting down for this because this is a long one.

So in this midst of this pandemic, my birth control decided to fail and now I'm about 12 weeks along. But to talk about what brought me here for some advice, you're going to need some of the backstory.

 I (21f) and he (21m) have been essentially fwbs on and off since November of last year. About 3 months in, I told him I had feelings for him and I wanted us to be more. He shut that down pretty quick and told me that he's not ready to be with someone until he figures out his issues, fairly understanding. He wanted to remain friends and I was initially not wanting to (should have stuck with it), but I ended up agreeing because I don't have many friends and I honestly enjoyed his company. I quickly realized that I can't push away those feelings and deep down I think I was waiting for him to come around and want me.

At this point, I essentially told him that I can't be friends with him anymore because I still have feelings for him and it hurts me knowing that he doesn't feel the same and it honestly just felt like he only spent time with him when it's convenient for him (he never came over to my house, I always went over) and I felt used. He took that as an ultimatum ""date me or lose me"" so this is what he said word for word ""Fine, we're dating. Just know I'm not happy about this and you forced my hand."" I stopped talking to him after that until pandemic hit when I got lonely (fucking stupid I know...)

A few more problematic things...

\- Every time I came over, he basically snuck me in. Refused to let me come over when he and his roommates were having gatherings. (his excuse was, I'm just not ready for you to be in my life.) I took it as not being good enough even as a ""friend"" to meet his other friends.

\- I called him out on using the term 'friend' because really what it was was friends- for his benefits, him just wanting to get his dick wet without the labels/ commitment. I said that friends are there for each other and do things for each other because they care and I didn't feel like he was there for me or cared for me. His response ""well I never asked you to do anything for me, you did it because you wanted to."" 

\- During heated debates about everything to nothing, he has this matter-of-fact attitude when it comes to everything. Once he even tried to tell me I was wrong regarding something related to my culture, ok white boy whatever. 

\- I have shared several traumatic things that have happened to me including a past miscarriage when I was 18 (another birth control fail bc my luck is just that good) and how I once was accused of rape in high school then was harassed by gross guys for months bc I got coined as ""easy"". He brushed all those things aside and said ""why does that bother you, you didn't want a baby so why are you upset you lost it?"" and ""obviously you didn't rape anyone so why are you still so bothered by it?"" 

There are many more of these ""greatest hits' from this insensitive POS, but I think we all get how much of a fucktard he is. Anyways he has always shit on me for never confronting him in person because I don't do well with confrontation especially with someone who doesn't ever think he's wrong. So when I found out I was pregnant, I messaging him asking to see him. As usual he was too busy partying with friends that I'm not allowed to meet and said he'll hit me up another day; I waited two weeks and nothing. 

I lived away from home for college at the time and was struggling a lot with what to do and how my life was going to go now. So I moved home to my family a few weeks ago and decided if he can't take to time to reach out then I'm doing this myself and he doesn't need to know anything or have anything to do with this. 

He finally texted me tonight, after me posting my growing bump on snapchat to my friends for weeks. I haven't even opened it. What the hell do I say to him???  Does he get a say it this, should he be involved, etc? I know I said I decided to hell with him but I have a lot of self-doubt and am now debating if I made the right choice. 

Oh I almost forgot this, one time we were debating about pregnancy, months ago before all this happened and he confidently said he would married her if he knocked her up. Told him don't be so sure of himself because situations differ and you can't know what to do until it hit you right in the face.  (I also strongly disagree with his statement overall, he shouldn't marry someone just because they're carrying his child. To me, marriage is a symbol of love and compassion. If a child grow up knowing that their parents are married but don't love each other what example and values are they setting for this child.)

TL,DR: I'm a really stupid person who got involved with a pos, now I'm pregnant and pos finally acknowledged it after 6 weeks.",19Jun2020,1
366,"I'm unraveling. I'm a long standing atheist, don't believe in spirits, God, the ethereal, anything supernatural at all. 

But lately my mind has been racked with the thought of hell. An idea that somehow it is real - and nothing anyone can do will prevent it from coming. 

Lately every moment of silence it drifts back into my mind. I start thinking about all the horrible things that could be done to me. Niche fears and pain I consider the most unbearable, inflicted on me for the rest of eternity. 

It started small but it's growing. I thought I'd passed this, a long time ago. But now it's in this new form with that inevitability aspect I mentioned. I know it's irrational, every reasonable part of my brain is coming up with totally legitimate reasons why the idea is absurd. 

But it just won't stop coming back. I can't stand the feeling of my voice not being the only one I think with. Of my own mind invading itself with these ridiculous thoughts that drive me mad whenever I have them.

I’m an 18, almost 19 year old female.
T = my best friend. M(18)
E = friend who had a birthday tonight. Also M(18)
R = my boyfriend. M(19)


I’ve been best friends with T for 11 or so years. We grew up together, went through every single public school system together, and have hung out with each other practically every day of our lives. He is my rock, my best friend, my brother, my vault, etc. I love him so much, but only as a friend. He will never be anything more to me than just a friend.

T knows I have a boyfriend. I’ve been with current boyfriend (R) for awhile and I’m very content and loyal within my relationship.

Tonight I was celebrating a mutual friends (E) birthday with T. While we were out, T asked if he could grab my ass. I immediately said no, told him I had a boyfriend and that I had no romantic feelings for T. He continued and said that my boyfriend would never know if I just let T squeeze and fondle my ass for a little while.

Now, fast forward a couple of hours. To continue celebrating E’s birthday, T, E, and I head to the pool. While we are swimming, T is trying to grab and fondle my legs. He also tried multiple times to swipe at my vagina. 

Disgusted with him, I left for the night and went home.

What do I do? I’m in a very weird position. I wanted to get this off my chest, but I’m also in need of some advice. How do I approach this? We’ve been childhood best friends and I’m not sure what to do. Do I drop the friendship since he obviously doesn’t respect my choices, or is there another path I should take?",19Jun2020,1

Maybe I’m going crazy or something, but I have a really good feeling that he might propose? I don’t know, I feel it in my heart and from hints from friends.

Anyways, he’s being really honest about things lately, he says, “I really love you. I love you. I like your mother because she is independent and cares a lot about you, but I feel your father doesn’t care about you. Like at all. He cares more about his other daughters than you.” And I’m like...hurt, but at the same time, I understand where he’s coming from.

He is tolerating my parents, but he seems to respect my mom but seems to low-key hate and resent my dad? I don’t get it. Please make it make sense!

375,"I’m currently renting a room as a lodger in the UK. I was not getting on with my landlady before lockdown and being stuck inside for 4 months is driving me nuts. She has hinted at kicking me out a few times and changes the house rules every few days. She’s yelling at her husband and threatening divorce/to kick him out as well. I’m constantly on edge as I never know what mood she’s going to be in each day and just hearing her come up the stairs makes me tense up as she’s lectured me on really random stuff recently. As an example she gave me a 10 minute lecture on how to close the bathroom door properly the other day...

The problem is that I’ve got absolutely no income at the moment apart from the the government assistance scheme. I’m a self employed dog walker and whilst I do expect some of my regulars to come back around August/September time I think it’s going to be a while before my business recovers. About 40% of my income comes from cat feeds and no one can travel at the moment. I may also need an operation on my knee later this year which means at least 2 months off work.

I have been looking into other work I could do but no luck yet. I’m also in the process of starting up a second business that I’d be able to run completely from home. That business should launch end of August but will obviously take time to get off the ground and see decent sales.

The gamble I’m thinking of taking is using my savings to rent a place of my own. I currently have £50k in my house deposit fund. In the area I live I could rent a flat for a year, furnish it, pay all bills etc for about £20-25k.

So worst case scenario is the new business flops, I find no other work, but can comfortably support myself for a whole year and still have £25k in savings.

Likely scenario is new business takes off or I find part time work and can finish a year with still ~£40-50k in savings.

Best case scenario is new company does really well or I find a new job, I don’t have to dip into my savings and I get a regular enough income I could look at buying my own house next year (only reason I haven’t bought yet is my incomes too irregular to get a mortgage approved).

But I’m so scared at the thought things might go wrong. I hate thinking about having to deal with estate agents and make phone calls etc (severe social anxiety). On the flip side the thought of having my own safe place and not constantly being scared of every movement my landlady makes is incredible.

Would you take that big a financial gamble with your savings with no guaranteed return for the sake of your mental health?",19Jun2020,1
376,"My best friend and I met in 8th grade and our friendship has only grown since. In sophomore year my best friends parents decided to move across the country near the end of the year of school and my family and I offered to let her live with me for the last 4 months of sophomore year to let her finish the year and of course keep her up here with everyone she loves. Her parents are pretty well off but are going through a rough patch right now and have never been the greatest family to her, as they arnt very accepting and understanding and are just plain rude sometimes. After the last 4 months of sophomore year was over she had to head to her new home and I broke down in tears letting her go of course. Now flash forward a few months into junior year, I fell in love and started dating a wonderful girl and have been dating her since. I really do love her and after so much I've been through, she is so very special to me. While my friend was living in her new house across the country. I went through junior year being able to have my girlfriend over, spend the night and just have privacy with her in the comfort of my own room. Now we are gonna be close to 8 months into our relationship soon and I couldnt be happier. However in may of this year my best friends mom had to come back to our town to do work and took my friend with her and we offered to let her stay for a month until her mom had to head back home. Once that time came, my friend asked to stay another month since her mom would have to be up again in a month and suggested she just leave with her then. So I asked my parents and they said yes so now she is living with me until sometime in july. However, now she wants to stay up here for the rest of the year to finish her senior year off in her home highschool. My parents love her and said she would be more than welcome to stay here for the next school year and last year I said the same thing. But now I have a girlfriend that i love very much and get no privacy with since I'm not exactly welcome at her house alone and my parents dont even know we are dating, so if I were to just say I'm going to another friends house they would think its rude or weird to not include my own best friend. And anytime I try to talk about this with my friend she internalizes it and gets offended and thinks I dont want her in my life or that shes not as important as my girlfriend. And now my girlfriend is coming to me saying she misses the personal and private intimate times we had before my friend lived with me and how shes worried we aren't going to have any moments again like that for the entirety of senior year if my friend stays living with me, which is exactly what I worried about from that start too. And my girlfriend isnt the jealous or selfish type so I know she isnt just trying to seperate me from my friend since she loves my friend too. I just dont know what to do because I dont want to send her back to a city where shes miserable and with a family that doesnt treat her right, but it also feels like she just kinda invited herself to stay with me for senior year and just begs for me to go along with it. And I miss spending time and bonding with my girlfriend alone. It's so overwhelming and stressful and I just dont know what to do. Please help if you can think of any.",19Jun2020,1

379,"I’ve never said or typed any of this so sorry if this post is a total cluster fuck... I don’t even know where to start.
for background, I’m 19. A while back (October) I moved out with some “friends”, didn’t work out and I decided to move out shortly after. I was going to move in with different friends but ended up not moving in with them because we couldn’t agree on house rules. In the midst of being unsure what to do, I moved in to my grandmas house. My grandma only stays in this house occasionally, but lives with my grandpa in his house (yes they have 2 houses. that situation is also complicated, but irrelevant). The reason I decided in the first place to stay here was so my dog didn’t think I was coming back home for good, then I’d move out again the next week, ya know? But the reason I moved out of my moms so hastily(it was a really stupid situation altogether), was because the house was such a dirty mess and I had to get out. I had to, I couldn’t take it. 
I love my mom, I do, but she was not meant to be a parent, and she’s never been very good at it. She loves me and my brother(15) more than anything , but love isn’t always enough. I hate saying that because if she ever knew how I felt, it would break her heart. But it’s just the truth. 
Our house has always been pretty messy as long as I could remember, but I managed it. When I was younger, all I had to worry about was school, and for a couple years, I did online school, so I had plenty of time to keep up with house work. My mom and brother almost never did anything. Since I was 14 or 15, I did basically all the cleaning, grocery shopping, laundry, cooking, whatever. I’ve always had to take care of everything. After I didn’t like online school anymore, I went to the local community college for classes. That took up much more of my time. While I was at the college, I also got a part time job. Which I quickly got more and more hours at so even more of my time. I went to the college for a year, but by the time I was done &amp; gave my work full availability, it was taking up much of my time. During that time I was busy with school/work, the house just got messier and messier.. and because it kept getting worse, I didn’t want to be there anymore, so I hung out with friends as much as I could. So I was there even less and it got even worse. Flash forward to now, it progressively got worse and I went over there today(haven’t been in maybe a month), it’s so bad... the animal poop and pee is absolutely everywhere. Garbage has started to pile up a foot or two from the ground. There’s not a inch of that floor without trash, poop, and or pee. I knew it was bad but today broke my heart and I just don’t know what to do. I got the dogs out of there as quickly as I could. My mom and brother are spending the night at my grandmas with me tonight. I don’t want anyone I love in that house. 
My whole family is going on vacation next week and I told my mom I don’t want to go. I have to figure out what to do. They leave the 25th, so I have 6 days to make a plan. Our plan was to take the pets to a puppy hotel while we were gone on vacation, I told my mom I want to stay with a friend when they’re gone so she’ll still take the pets there. 
I am someone who bottles every single emotion, fear, problem, everything up inside as best as I can. But I can’t do this alone anymore... I don’t know if I need to tell a friend, I don’t know if I could trust any of my friends with this. I don’t know if there are people that can help me. I live in southeast washington if anyone knows anyone. I don’t really want to invite strangers into the house.. but if they’re reputable I would consider it. I can’t do this alone I just don’t know what to do. 
Things will have to stay this way til they leave for vacation. Afterwards, I will do everything I can to keep animals and my brother out of that house, until it is livable.  I don’t want my other family members to find out.  I just need advice, to know what others have done in my situation. I don’t know who to confide in.

383,"OK reddit, help a girl out, I need advice on my next steps with one of my former best friends. To give you the background:

I have been friends with S for over 10 years, she worked with one of my friends and we hung out at a lot of the same events. I was single she was single, we'd go out dancing most weekends. After some really shady behaviour on a holiday (essentially, she ditched me on my birthday in a foreign country for this guy) She stayed with this guy for a few years and would generally ditch us for him, spending most of her spare time with him and his friends and even inviting him to our girls nights out. All her interests changed to his interests too. It was noticed across the friendship group but after he cheated on her we rallied round and spent a lot of time with her.
During this time, we were all going through things, I was planning a wedding, one of our other friends had a parent with severe health issues, but we all spent as much time as we could with S as she didn't want to be alone. She then met her current partner A and they have now been together for 4 years. None of her friends have spent much time with A, not through trying though but she's literally not celebrated her birthday with us the past few years and doesn't bring him to any event ever. She has ingrained herself in his friendship group (like the last boyfriend ) is only interested in what he is interested in and spends every weekend with him and his friends. He lives a 5 minute drive from me and I've suggested meeting up either as couples or just girls a number of times but the question just gets avoided. 
After my wedding which was now nearly three years ago, I've maybe spent time with her on about 8 occasions? Obviously our friendship isn't what it used to be and the rest of the group has stayed tight knit apart from her. 
She has suffered with her mental health previously and her issues were triggered at the end of her last relationship. I worry that if her relationship with A ends she will suffer again and she won't have anyone, she has alienated all her friends. 
My husband tells me it's not my issue and she's no friend of mine so why do I care? One of our other friends has said she wouldn't see S suffer but won't be there for her like last time, especially as she didn't even ask once how she was doing whilst she was losing her mum... 

I don't know if she's just a selfish person and I should just cut my losses, do I call her out for being a shitty friend or do I just put in as much effort into the friendship as she does and let it come to its natural conclusion? How do I progress? 
I do feel bad though, this girl was one of the most important people in my life for a long time and it just feels harsh to ditch her.

One of the girls is getting married this year, and S has bailed on the hen do but was still going to the wedding with A.

My mom is doing whatever she can to make us some extra money. She buys lots of lottery tickets but she never wins, so she decided that making a YouTube channel would be a great way to make some money on the side.

The problem is she isn't great at operating technology, so she always gets me to edit her videos. So far we only have one up on her channel, and all week she's been nagging me to edit another video to post. I keep explaining to her that I can't as I'm super busy and when I'm free I feel burnt out and tired, but she keeps asking the next day continuously. It's really starting to drain me.

Today she asked me again and I told her I can't as its just about the only day I get to rest, then she yelled at me and said 'FINE! You never help me after all I've done for you!' and went on to guilt trip me, talking about how she raised me and how she's done everything like payed for my schooling fees, food and a roof over my head ect.

I can't deal with this. It's draining to edit YouTube videos with my packed schedule, and since I only have one day without work to myself I want to spend it doing the things I love like painting and playing video games.

How do I tell her I can't help her out that much? How do I tell her to stop nagging me all the time as it's really draining? Should I try and spend a day with her teaching her how to edit (like that one quote 'you can give a man a fish and feed him for a day, or you can teach a man to fish and feed him for a lifetime' or something?)?

- High pressure 
- Giving up a decent amount of my free time 
- Not enjoying it 
- Don't feel respected by players 
- Worry what others think and what they may be saying about me. 
- Comparing myself to other coaches. 
- Covid worries 

Due to Covid 19, the season most likely has a maximum of 4 months left. I know my friend really wants me to stay and values me. I don't even know now if my anxiety is whats making me not enjoy it. 


Do I keep my commitment, stay, face my fears and finish off the season for my friend, even though I'm not enjoying it? 

Do I just leave and put myself first and expect him to understand? 

Do I just finish the season off, but on a more casual basis? (Not attending every single training etc.)",19Jun2020,1

392,"Hey guys so I am 20 years old, oldest of my brothers and sisters, i still live with my parents (yeah ik moving out this year) but my brothers steal my cigarettes all the time (and again yes I know smoking is bad) but I grew up in a weird family to say the least and have been smoking sense I was 8 years old my brothers basically started the same age as I did (1 starting at 10, the next oldest starting at 12 and the next oldest starting at 10 as well) I don't mind sharing, but packs go missing all the time.
 if I have 1 pack it lasts me around 4-5 days if these guys know I have a pack it last 4-5 hours. (if I'm Sharing not if they just take the whole pack and run) I hid them in my room in a old toy bin no one uses anymore in my CBD cabinet (I have a place I keep all my CBD products) in my pocket while I sleep (yes they apparently have stolen them from my pocket in my sleep and I'm a light sleeper usually so this baffles me) in my dirty laundry basket, basically anywhere I could think to hide it I've tried and they somehow always find them but I don't know if it's multiple or just 1 person I want to find out who it is but more importantly punish them when they try and steal another cigarette
I've been told you can put gunpowder inside them itching powder on a filter or even put hair inside the cigarettes (honestly putting hair inside a cigarette seems like the best choice so far they'll probably throw up or at least have a bad taste they won't get out of their mouth for days) I don't want to do anything that would kill them I just want to know who it is and punish them (I'll kill then after personally)

394,"So every summer I work at a day camp located in a park , before that I worked at an after school program in an elementary school so thanks to covid I’ve been on unemployment since March. Now yesterday the program leader asked if I was good to work for the summer and I said yes but to be honest I HATE that job. For the past 4 years (I’ve been working every summer since 2016) I’ve dreading going to work and it’s literally agony. I want to go home, the park is full of mold , rats, dust so my allergies are always going off and I come home with a stuffy nose or hives (in the summer!!) and my asthma acts up to the point where halfway through the day I can’t breathe. At that job, I work almost 40 hours a week on minimum wage ( which for the amount of work I do I don’t think it’s worth it as I’m in my final year of college as have to pay for this last year). My job at the school campus does not give me this much stress and anxiety as the park job does.

After the program leader messaged me I began to regret agreeing to work ...

I don’t want to work this summer because 
1. Covid cases are going to increase for-sure and my sister and father are immunocompromised. (I don’t know why I didn’t think of this beforehand) 
2. I don’t think I can handle another summer at that job. I do not get along with anyone there and I don’t my body can recover from hives and allergies as fast as I used to. 

I don’t know how a summer day camp of 40+ kids is going to avoid cases of covid since masks are mandatory in public places now (for my county in California) I’m not sure how they expect us to wear masks as we play sports with the campers. 

I am extremely stressed (or I may just be overthinking it when the obvious answer is to just quit that job) but I am not sure how to tell the program supervisor I don’t want to work. I am not sure how to bring it up. If I quit, I void my unemployment which is helping my family out.

398,"I work at a small ice cream shop, and we close at 9 on week days, 10 on weekends. This is my first job, and due to our old manager quitting, I became manager after only 3 weeks of working there... Which I'm not happy about, but that's another story. 

Cleanup after we close normally takes 45-ish minutes, and I only get paid until 30 minutes after close. I won't get into specifics, but I keep having people coming in 5 minutes to close or later, with the occasional person coming in up to 20 minutes past close expecting to be served. Now, the people coming in 5 minutes or less to close... Would I be a dick to turn people away at 8:58 when we close at 9:00??? They never seem to want anything simple, which just kills me inside to have to make a complicated cyclone and then have to clean everything when they order at 8:59. And don't get me started on big groups that come in that late. I know I'd probably be a dick to turn them away, and I normally just grin and bear it, but it sucks.

 Also, can anyone offer advice on how to politely turn people away when we're closed? I've turned people away before but I always feel so bad and often times they try to argue or get mad at me. Is this just a universal thing I can't really help, or is there a better way to do it?",19Jun2020,1
399,"We basically found safe spaces in each other to vent about life. We ended up liking each other, but he didn’t want anything serious and started shutting me out, so I started talking to other guys. I told him, we got into a fight, and we stopped talking about a month ago. 

He hit me up today out of the blue, and I already knew something was of off. His uncle that he was close to committed suicide. He’s been isolating himself from people in his life. He just feels hopeless and he’s saying that he wouldn’t mind doing it.

I don’t know what to say. I tried cheering him up and I told him I don’t want him to go. But he sounds so tired. I’m familiar with that tired feeling, and it scares me that he feels that way on top of isolating himself. I don’t know what to do to help him.

He says he called the hotline and they didn’t answer. He’s pushing himself away from his friends. He’s only over working himself and going to bed.

Basically my friend squeezes her little sisters chest and says “boobies!”  as a joke to make her laugh and it freaked me out.

My counselor had told me it sounded playful and  innocent so she would not be reporting it (by law she has to if any abuse is going on so I guess no abuse is going on)

And nothing came out of the online police report so they possibly did not find anything concerning 

So should I do anything more? I contacted a crisis line and the woman said that I had done what sounded right.

She told me she was planning on jumping in a fast moving river near her house in an attempt to drown and end her own life. She had even looked up how long it takes to drown and how painful it is. I obviously told her not to &amp; tried my best to talk to her about it. I was worried for her. I took her seriously, she's been down in life for a while &amp; I genuinely thought/still do think that she is being serious. I'm not a psychiatrist and not trained to handle a situation like this in any way shape or form. She lives across the globe from me, so my ways to help her are extremely limited. I felt helpless &amp; like I had to do something (I genuinely thought this was urgent because she was talking about doing it in the next few days). So I decided to message her sister that I found through one of her facebook posts. Because I thought someone close to her &amp; someone that understands her country better could stop her &amp; get her help. I told her that her sister was talking about harming herself &amp; I was concerned. I also asked to her talk to her and help. I did not mention this to my friend. Later, her sister read the message and I'm guessing asked her about it. My friend then messaged me &amp; told me to fuck off &amp; that I just made things worse. She said she was done talking to me. I tried to explain that I understand that but I was just trying to help in one of the only ways I could. I feel like shit &amp; helpless. Especially if I made the situation worse for her.

In the type of person who needs instruction on everything. I overthink things a whole lot. If you tell me to organize something, I’ll ask a lot of question. Where do you want this? Is this good here? Ah that stuff.

I’m afraid of dealing with customers. I have social anxiety, and talking to me people is hard for me. 

I’m also afraid of doing things myself. I’m very much a follower and not a leader. I’d rather have someone tell me every single time what to do and when to do it rather than figure out what to do myself.

I’m 18, it feels like I’m never going to build up the courage to really try to apply for a job, but I never follow up because I’m afraid of changing what I’m used to which is being at home and playing games.

410,"Lots of places require a mask in all public places. Now, I completely agree with this to stop the spread. But what do you do if wearing a mask interferes with preexisting medical issues?

I have severe anxiety and also very minimal PTSD from being locked in a hot car. The combination of these two makes is extremely stressful to wear a mask (I mention the car because wearing a mask very closely mimics a hot, humid, and claustrophobic environment and is a massive trigger). It almost always induces an anxiety attack to wear them, which is awful enough. But additionally, I worked at a medical center (before COVID) where masks were required, and I would often lose my vision and hearing and almost faint, etc. it’s a condition called near syncope if u wanna look it up (all the symptoms of fainting, but you don’t exactly lose consciousness). I was taken off the mask-required tasks because my boss said I was a hazard, and eventually had to quit because because of this. Then COVID hit just a month later, and now my whole life is like working at the medical center. 

So reddit, what do you recommend doing? I’m scared of getting yelled at in public and I understand that masks are necessary, but I just cannot wear one for more than a few minutes.",19Jun2020,1

412,"Hello all, I'm really in a difficult situation here and hoping someone can help me. I recently just rebuilt my relationship with my parents after years of being no contact. 

About 5 years ago I was hanging out with my aunt (mom's sister) i can't remember what I said as it was pretty trivial. But apparently I told her something that my Mom didn't want me to. My Mom was super angry at me and instantly banned me from speaking to my 2 aunts, 2 uncles and my grandma (all her side of the family). 

I begged her not to ban me but she insisted that if I ever spoke to them again she'd be even more angry at me. I asked her why she was banning me, and she said that I'd just end up telling them information she doesn't want them to know. I suggested that anything she didn't want being said, she could just tell me not to. It wasn't enough so I went no contact with them all. 

A few years later I moved to Vietnam for work. One night my neighbour broke into my house and sexually assaulted me. I emailed my parents and told them what happened. Their response was that they were done with my 'drama' and wanted to go no contact with me. I was completely heartbroken by this but accepted it and got on with my life. 

A year later they started counselling and their therapist told them to visit me in Vietnam. They did and it was ok I guess. 

Just before corona virus happened I came to England to visit my boyfriend. He got sick and couldn't come, lockdown happened and I had to stay with my parents. I managed to rebuild the relationship with them and ended up having a nice time. 

Now my Mom says she wants me to start speaking to her side of the family again. They were really confused and hurt that I went no contact with them for no reason (that they knew of). I can't face having to pretend like nothing happened and just talking to them like I hadn't been ignoring all their calls, e-mails and messages for years. My Mom is now angry at me for making her life harder by still avoiding them. She said that I'm just being stubborn and spiteful but seems to have conveniently forgotten that she asked me never to speak to them again. 

If only I could tell them that I'd been banned from speaking to them, but of course I can't without making my mom angry. What can I do? 

Please help, I can't bear the thought of loosing my mom and dad again.",19Jun2020,1
414,"Ever since i’ve been in a relationship (online relationship) i’ve just gotten used to all of the love/care/affection etc I think. It was a hard relationship breakup for me and all I seem to think about now is talking with other guys to try and get that same feeling back I guess. 

I think my body just automatically misses someone being there like he used be. I was in the relationship for 2 years. So it was fairly long. Now it seems that when every guy texts me in a friendly/flirty way I seem to get instantly attracted to them.

424,"So this girl and I met in class and we started talking and we got closer to the point where we were FaceTiming each night for hours on end or till we both fell asleep on the phone and of course I caught feelings but she was in a toxic relationship with this guy who had cheated on her and they were off and on constantly and she basically cried every day because of him and I tried to help her as much as I could to my best ability and so eventually she broke things off with him and something changed instantly in her she was just more happy and cheerful so I waited and we still were growing closer and closer to which the point of me telling her I loved her and she said she had mutual feelings so I was super happy but she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship even thought it had been 2 months since she broke up with that guy so I said I’d wait till she was ready so fast forward another month to where we are saying we love each other constantly and I ask her if she was ready and she said not yet so then we go on and I ask her what we are and she said she didn’t know and sometimes she’s super passionate about what we have and other times she’s just very dry and so for the past week and a half I thought she was ghosting me cause she didn’t respond to any of my text but she was also posting stuff on Snapchat then she finally responded to me saying “hey I was busy what’s up” which didn’t sound like her at all so I asked what she was doing for almost two weeks and she just said she was visiting family in California so I brushed it off then she stopped talking to me again and still won’t respond

So here I am wondering what to do if I should confront her if just wait it out?",19Jun2020,1
425,"(Sorry about punctuation and structure which I more than likely butchered)

I (15) love my friend group and can't stand not being around them, but on of them (also 15 in case it helps I guess) is so obnoxious, he screams all the time, jumps around, pops those seal lock bags all the time and it's tipping me over the edge. I'm screaming at him to STFU almost daily. I've tried talking to him in private but he doesn't care, I've asked him politely a thousand times but he doesn't stop, the only way I feel I can shut him up is by yelling some of the cruellest things at him but I don't want to do that, and even if I did want to, the rest of my friends would hate me and take his side.

I can't just leave my friend group because they're my best friends and it's just overly petty to leave a group because of something like this, and at the same time, they don't really want to get rid of him (not that I've asked, I already know the answer).

He's also such a hypocrite and whenever I start to 'sing' (which by the way isn't that common around) him), he tells me something along the lines of ""no one cares"", ""shut up"", or ""can you not"".

429,"First off, sorry if I've posted this in the wrong place and I hope this makes sense. 

I worked in an extremely unprofessional, soul destroying environment for 5 years a little while ago. I was bullied and picked apart relentlessly, I was sexually harassed, I was overworked, and I was completely burnt out by the time I left. On top of this my home life wasn't any better. I got no support at work or home when I brought up what I was experiencing or how it was affecting me. I guess I was just too depressed and felt too hopeless to quit. My issue is with having nothing to show for the years since I left. I've avoided or just given up so many experiences and good opportunities since then out of fear, anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. I haven't done anything that would have set me up to be in a better place than I am now. I didn't do anything to expand my horizons, take me out of my comfort zone or help me positively connect with others. I squandered my savings and wasted the years I had available to me to create a happier, more fulfilling life for myself. I even messed up the opportunities and experiences that I know would have made me happy; that I deep down knew I wanted. 

How do you reconcile all this? How do you get over the guilt of wasting your own time &amp; life? How do you forgive yourself?",19Jun2020,1
430,"You must think I'm joking huh? I'm not. It's true. For the past 3 months, after my friend gets his paycheck from his work he immediately cashes it and orders a bunch copies of Mein Kampf to my doorstep. This all started with some joke he made with his friends. He said something to the effect of ""Wouldn't it be funny if I ordered a bunch of copies of Mein Kampf to blanks door?"" And for some freaking reason he did it. The most recent package was yesterday, and my roommates opened it. They are a different kind... They literally think I'm a Nazi now. Even with all the explanation they still won't understand. I don't want this happening anymore, so I ask him to stop, but he doesn't budge. I literally beg him and he says no.

431,"I have a bad habit of befriending people, becoming super close to them very quickly, and then noticing a flaw and deciding I don't really like them because of it. This isn't always the case though, I have multiple friends I've known for almost a decade now and none of them bother me at all, even with their flaws!

But *everyone I've met after them* gets on my nerves after a while.

One of my pet peeves (and usually the one that makes me grow distant from a person) is constant negativity. For example, I have a friend I'm growing apart from that I met through a fandom. She thinks it's hilarious to pick and choose a random character to hate for every season. It's not because that character gets on her nerves, she just really likes the feeling of hating someone. Usually it's a character I like too... I'm not sure if it's on purpose. She's told me multiple times that she hates cheery people and can't stand positivity. She wasn't like this when I first met her and I'm getting bored of her.

I've also had multiple friends that refuse to help themselves in bad times. Friends that refuse to at least try to improve their situation. That bothers me the most. A good example is my ex-friend who needed to get his GED. I offered to be his tutor, pay for the test, drive him, and generally support him through the process. He said no and, as far as I know, still hasn't made any attempt to get it despite *constantly* complaining to me about how badly he needs it.

When I feel myself start to dislike a friend, I don't reply to them as much. I don't completely ghost them, but I prioritize them less until it feels like we're hardly even friends anymore. I've struggled to tell them why I feel the way I do because I can't tell if I'm justified or just picky/pretentious.

If it helps any, I'm 20. Most of my friends are in the 18-22 range.

Does anyone know how I can stop becoming sick of people so easily? How can I look past flaws in a person and keep friends longer? Is it normal to struggle to make friends at this age? I'm a decently social person, so I'm open to suggestions on how to make friends that are more like me. Thank you to anyone who reads this and sorry I'm so wordy.",19Jun2020,1

436,"My BF and I had our 1 year anniversary yesterday. We hung out and I got a lot of messages from friends saying congrats and it was just a really nice day. 

The night of our anniversary after he went to sleep, we have this thing on his snap where we put photos of each other in his my eyes (like explicit ones). I went onto his snap and was going to add some more in as like an anniversary present, when I saw he had one or two messages from friends he doesn’t really speak to much. I opened a few messages knowing they would be about our 1 year and it was replying to his story saying things like congratulations. It was really sweet. 

My boyfriend has a female best friend. I won’t name her but we’ve had troubles in the past so we don’t speak anymore. She betrayed my trust in her before for reasons including flirty actions towards my boyfriend, and I’m not sure of her opinions on me. I used to have a lot of trouble w them hanging out because of how close they were but I’ve accepted that now, and have a hell of a lot of trust in my boyfriend. I know he would NEVER cheat, and I should trust my bf’s judgement on who he is hanging out with, even if I don’t like his female best friend.

I saw she had messaged him that day, and I never read through their messages. The last time I did was maybe 4 months ago and I felt awful for it (there was nothing wrong, I just felt really nosey). But I really wanted to know if she had said congrats, or if she had mentioned me.

So I read the messages, and I feel so guilty. I was scrolling through and everything is fine. There weren’t many messages since my bf had been mostly off his phone since he was w me. 

But then I saw a message from this girl to my boyfriend and a link to a tik tok. She wrote ‘the video is cute but the audio is about us.’ My bf was watching some funny tik toks when we were together and I thought it was one of those tik toks, so I wanted to see it.

I clicked on the video and it was a video of two dogs, but the audio said- ‘what’s a soulmate? Well, a soulmate is like a best friend but more.’ -As soon as I heard it I just got this overwhelming feeling of anger towards her. The way she said the audio is about them is basically implying that they’re soulmates. I don’t know if that is my biased opinion of her reading into it too much, but it really hit a nerve. I’m not meant to know about this message at all. He didn’t say anything to her about it after.

My bf has said to me multiple times, I need to trust his judgement in his friends. Should I be worried about her sending him things like this? I want to ask him about it but I know that he will say I shouldn’t have read his messages. I shouldn’t have, but it’s just eating me up inside. What do I do?

TL;DR - I read my bfs messages to his female best friend and saw a message she sent him that I didn’t like. Do I pull him up on it, considering I’m not meant to know?",19Jun2020,1

When I was in high school I pretty much played video games all day, I didn’t make any meaningful friends throughout those 4 years because I lacked confidence and was very shy.  At the end of my senior year I told myself that I would force myself to change in college.

439,"2020 is draining me dry.

I've been debating posting this as I feel like my issues are so minuscule compared to others, but here I am. I will post a TL;DR at the bottom in case you'd prefer to just skip ahead. *It's really late so I will post now and check replies when I wake up. Thanks!*

First things first: I'm a college student on my last semester of school as of Fall 2020. It's great, I'm excited. I hope to graduate with honors, which means lots of hard work and dedication during my last semester. It's taken me an extra semester to graduate, but I'm a first gen student coming from a low income family so I'm proud of myself. With that being said, I've been going to school on financial aid since I started. I've been lucky enough to qualify for two grants that typically cover the expenses of my school years, so I haven't had to take out any loans (I've been trying to minimize my debt because becoming a DPT is gonna be expensiveeee). I'm fortunate enough to also live with my fiancée, whom I've been with since 2013! High school sweethearts, FTW. Things have been going well enough as far as school and finances go... Until they weren't.

I recently found out that I will not qualify for grants during my last semester due to the, shall we say, ""fine print"" of financial aid. So.. I have to come up with enough to pay for it. We have been affected by the pandemic as many others have, and are currently unable to work due to myself having a compromised immune system. In high school I started working as soon as possible to provide for myself and save money (didn't have a great home life). Due to this and my frugal lifestyle/compulsive saving up to this point I have been able to live on my own with my fiancée throughout college (both on our last semester). She's also been able to save which helps us live on our own. So, you may be wondering, if I have a savings then what is the problem? Well, it's not enough for my classes, as I have been paying for our future wedding. (Yes, I know. A wedding? In this economy?)

Why did I make this decision? Our original plan was to get married next year in the summer before going to our respective professional schools. We were saving up for this, with said original plan costing more than 2x the amount of our current total. This gave us more than a year to work, save, volunteer, etc.. Then, the pandemic hit. I live in Texas, which has been and still currently is a hotspot for the virus. It's been a rollercoaster ever since my city had its first case. Recently we have been lifting restrictions statewide, to mixed results. My city was not ready to reopen, and arguably still isn't. Once restrictions started to loosen though, our chosen wedding venue contacted us and gave us a, let's say, ""special offer"" due to the pandemic. A smaller wedding, with less benefits than our original plans, but only 1/4 the cost of the original venue cost. It was a steal, but a rushed option as this meant we had to have our wedding by the end of this year. I had just paid for summer classes with my savings, and did not know that my fall semester wouldn't be covered so it seemed like a great idea at the time. It still is a wonderful option for us, as it's way more afforable and we thought we'd be able to cover all the costs ourselves with our current savings. After talking it over and weighing the pros &amp; cons, we decided to say yes. We did the math, signed the contract, and now we're having a wedding!

But as I mentioned before, I recently found out my fall semester wouldn't be covered and already paid for summer classes through the local community college. Plus, I had been donating a lot to animal rescues and charities before I knew of and agreed to the new wedding option. This means my savings has taken quite the hit. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, I'd just work it back and save some more. However, it's not safe for me or her to work right now. If she were to catch and bring home anything, or if I were to work and catch it myself, there's no telling if I would be able to survive. My family really can't afford to help me with school or the wedding, or simply doesn't want to. I haven't previously mentioned it, but I'm a woman engaged to a woman. This hasn't been the best news for our families, but most have gotten over it and accept us. Her family is not so supportive all the time, and we're used to it by now. 

We hate asking for help, and have been trying to handle things ourselves as far as the wedding goes. We can't just push off the wedding to a later date as the contract is signed and a deposit has been put down. A few friends have made small contributions to help us which we really appreciate, but wish we could do something in return. The math that we previously did no longer applies for a few reasons (taxes, tips, incidentals, etc. etc.), so we're a bit short of the final wedding cost as well. A full semester's tuition and short for the wedding. It's greaaaat. The family that accepts and supports me has offered to help, but I feel bad accepting and won't for some as they are already in bad financial situations. My fiancée, however, hasn't had the same luck. 

I'm stressed out not only for the wedding, but also my last semester. I don't know if it's worth risking my health or not, but I feel that my current best option is to find a part time job to pay for these expenses. I'm conflicted, sad, stressed, excited for the wedding, and upset that the universe loves to kick us when we're down (as it does for everyone, lol). We've been doing all we can to cut costs, in literally every little place that we can. Even cutting out guests from our already super small guest list, which means a lot of family. I've been told to start a fundraiser, but it feels icky asking strangers for help as I'm all about giving something in return. I've also been told to start an etsy shop for some 'crafts' I do, but don't feel as though it would be worth the stress as I am not confident in my work. Especially when there's nicer stuff out there! 

*TL;DR* (and who could blame you?): I'm a female first gen college student on my last semester &amp; lesbian having a wedding at the end of this year, and was previously able to cover wedding expenses, but am now unable to. Plus, I recently found out my last semester of college doesn't qualify for financial aid so I have even more I can't cover. I have a compromised immune system that currently prevents either of us from working, so I'm stressed out and looking for advice. I also can't ask anyone for help planning the wedding as noone in my family has ever had a wedding. 

So any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated. Even wedding planning tips, like how to make a bouquet on your own! Lol. I have tried applying for scholarships since finding out about financial aid to no avail, but if you have some you think I could qualify for I'd love to know! Thanks a bunch.",19Jun2020,1

448," hope you guys can give me some advice.

I am a law student in a foreign country, I am working in a cleaning service company. Even though I speak the language in this country very well, I couldn't find a better job to pay for all the living and studying costs, for I am a foreigner and do not have full access to the job market.

As it is one of the most unattractive jobs, you cannot expect well educated people to be working. My colleagues don't speak the language of the country. However I always respected every single person at my work, because who am I to judge others.

When the corona situation started, there was this one colleague, who btw. cannot properly write in her own language. At any positive sign (border opening for example) she would say that it woudln't happen thus spreading negativity. I myself have called the police and asked them questions which they very gladly answered, I was informing myself. This person still said that the police are lying to me because her sisters sons daughter didn't cross the border (who also doesn't speak the language and isn't informed!). The other day I talked about how I didn't pick up my passport for three months, and she said that they wouldn't let me pick it up, because three months passed.

This person never reads the website of the respectable ministry. She just spreads negativity around at the workplace and it is getting on my nerves, but, as I am much younger than her, I do nit want to be disrespectable, but still I wish to tell her in a nice way ""If you don't have an idea what you are talking about, shut the duck 🦆 up.""

451,"The first time I actually noticed this happening was when my grandma died two years ago. My parents told me she had died and I felt nothing. It's not like I felt numb which is a rather normal form of grief but rather that nothing changed in what I was currently feeling. Even at the funeral I didn't cry. I felt awful for not even being sad while every body else was bawling their eyes out. Now that my great aunt died I again didn't feel anything. Is it because I already kind of came to terms with the fact that they'd most likely die (both were very sick before their death)? Or is it perhaps a mental disorder? I've been exposed to death in form of family friends and family members dying (though not frequently, just when I was still quite young) from a very young age so maybe that also plays a part in it?

I feel like this is a really stupid question and if I ask it I feel like it most likely won't even help with my issue but it probably won't hurt to try. I'm 17 and i've been addicted to porn for a solid 5-6 ish years and I've also been trying to quit for a solid 5-6 ish years to no avail.

She says to me all the time that I could tell her anything at all, and she'd still love me, and help me work through anything, and just overwhelming amounts of support but I'm still just so ashamed and worried that she'll leave me, because porn just feels so different compared to anything else. I've already told me parents and they're supportive of me quitting and they believe me when I say I'm trying to quit. They understand how hard it is and my dad himself faced porn addiction and struggled for years to quit, and he knows that it's a completely different beast than it was when he was a kid and that it's much harder. If what my girlfriend says is true she should react the same way, but i still just don't know what to do. I feel like I've been rambling for way too long, so I'm gonna end this post here. Any advice on quitting this addiction, or what to do with my girlfriend would be much appreciated.",19Jun2020,1
454,"We are in 10th grade but please, don't tell me to focus on my studies instead because I already am doing well there, I just want to get through with this issue. 







So last year, there was a girl who I was kind of obsessed with. I always tried to get her attention and was essentially her lapdog since the beginning of the year until we actually got into a relationship together in the last 2 months. Then she kept putting her social status over me so we kept breaking up and getting back together and then breaking up again. So I broke things off because I just couldn't deal with it anymore.








This year, I saw this new girl and started having a crush on her. Similar to how I felt about my (at the time) girlfriend after the beginning of the year at stronger. I had been trying to get close to her (she was very shy) and be her friend but after like 2 or 3 weeks, we started dating. She is a big upgrade, we have a lot in common and just get along so much better. Now here is the issue, throughout the school year, my ex has been trying to make me jealous (only worked once but I didn't really do anything about it), flirt with me, and stuff like that. Now, she went from targeting me to literally message and get her friends to just basically verbally harass my now girlfriend.









It sucks. A lot. At first, my girlfriend was okay but now that the texts and messages are getting really personal about her past and just really bad, she is starting to have a breakdown. She almost went through a depressive episode because of this. I have tried to talk to some actual adults about this but they play it as just teen drama, which is really exhausting. Everytime we block one friend, they make another account and keep going. It's weird and just getting ridiculous at this point












TLDR; My ex from last year (who treated me like a lap dog) keeps harassing my now girlfriend who is now getting really hurt as my ex keeps getting more and more personal. I tried to tell adults about it but they don't care and I just don't know what to do anymore.",19Jun2020,1
455,"I (19F) and my brother (26M) get along really well normally. However, whenever he gets mad or annoyed, he would just suddenly start yelling at me. I’ve tried to have civil conversations about his anger. But he says he doesn’t like to talk about it when he’s angry... but then when he’s in a good mood, he ignores the issue altogether when I try to bring it up. 

I’ve been getting really fed up of being yelled and cussed at for small things. My mother’s advice is to just minimize talking to him until he manages his anger.

I know what’s said in news is just a small fraction of people but it’s still going now, even as you read this post people are dying.

I know it’s a bad thing to ignore such cases and let people be killed but I want to learn how not to let it bother me so much that would leave me sad for the whole day.

Most people solve this problem by just thinking that they don’t care what’s happening on the other side of earth but these are the same people who blame others for not caring when something happens to them. 

How do I think in a logical way that will solve this problem, what methodology do you guys follow in your life to such problems, do you just get sad for a few minutes and then forget about it ?
Well for doing such thing we’ve just created an unconscious priority ranking system, is it bad or just human nature to not care for unknown people ?

Have a good day,

He has always been a gentle dog and this is highly out of character for him.

459,"sometimes i have moments like this, when im unsure of everything

well, to be more precise, i feel like a prey.

like, i feel like i could be killed in the streets, if people wanted to.

the thing is, i generally am not like that, but sometimes i cant help but think of the worst things that could happen. 

i've developed this mindset which is a bit antisocial probably but not that far from truth

i know it might sound corny and shit, but, well, it is true

NOBODY'S SHIT. EVERYONE'S THE SAME AND NOBODY CAN TELL ME AND TEACH ME SHIT. if thing's

&amp;#x200B;

i know it sounds a bit corny/edgy, but again,  its true.

i've realized that i dont have to do shit, i dont have to work, i dont have to study, make money, i could just go up to a shop and fucking rob it, or rape someone, or even kill them, if i WANTED to. 

obviously, im not going to do it, cuz its stupid (i mean, majority of people dont think that way, and going again the common sense, will get ME fucked up (jail))

but, it helps so much. even with fears or stress.

like, there's realistically no one in the history of mankind that has done shit i can't do. all the greatest kings, athletes, world leaders, they ain't shit, well, in a sense, that they aren't gods or anything.

nobody's word mean shit, if 

also, same goes to everyone obviously...

i can literally do whatever i want.

again sounds edgy, but it is true.

&amp;#x200B;

but  sometimes i feel like a pussy. a, i think that its only healthy to be that way tho, i mean, im not a born psychopath, i dont think naturally the way i described (majority of people dont)

&amp;#x200B;

but i wish i could maintain that type of thinking all the time. it does help.

again, as i said, sometimes im fearful (which is normal obviously), and i use anger to counter it and i works for sure, but i would love to not have those thoughts in the first place.

whenever i go outside, im ready to kill tbh, cuz im angry, and honestly, people feel it, they genuinely do, and i love it.",19Jun2020,1
460,"Disclaimer: it’s 3:30 am where I am, and I’ve taken Xanax, also this is my first-ever post (!), so apologies in advance for length and any typos!

My little sister, who’s 24, was supposed to get married back in May, but rescheduled to this November for obvious reasons. I felt a little weird about that, but it was so far into the future at that point that I kept quiet and figured I’d deal with it in the fall. 

Then George Floyd was murdered. My sister and her fiancé live in Minneapolis. The venue was damaged during the protests and won’t reopen till late 2021. So naturally, my sister rescheduled the ceremony to... the end of August. This August. Putting aside how inappropriate and tone-deaf this is, we’re also likely to be looking at the second wave of coronavirus right around then, yeah?

So when she texted me this week to see if I was coming, I said I needed some time. She told me she would “totally be okay with it if I just Zoomed in!” as I live across the country in a serious hotspot. She’s my only sister. She’s also planning to have a larger ceremony in 2021!

I was pissed and also fairly hurt, but I asked her, out of genuine interest, what she was planning to do to protect guests, as a wedding is kind of, I dunno, a breeding ground for contagion? She said they would “encourage face masks and have sanitizer scattered around,” but that “it would be up to the guests to safely socially distance” throughout. Our dad, who is 60+ and extremely Republican, has been proudly not wearing a mask for months. He was also intubated in the ICU with pneumonia just two years ago! (Which, woof, but I digress.)

The conversation quickly devolved into her postponing the wedding, but not before she involved my mom, and they both are now blaming me for ruining this Very Special Day. Which, okay. My sister’s the first to get married among my siblings (I’m one of three), and so my mom has understandably been LIVING for this. But ... we’re still in a pandemic! Without a vaccine! I’m super close with my mom, and I’m devastated by this reaction. She’s even been making masks (hundreds!!) for family and friends! That neither of them can see the irony (hypocrisy? both? words are hard, I’m so tired) is making me feel crazy.

I feel like I’ve done the right thing, but my family is kind of all I have right now (I’m isolating alone) aside from my dog. I’m unemployed because of corona, I can’t afford therapy, I don’t have health insurance, and I’ve interacted with, like, four people IRL since this started. The idea that multiple people I love could literally die because one person didn’t wash their hands before they drunkenly hit the buffet table is terrifying! Am I overreacting? 

The way they’ve made me feel in the last 48 hours makes me feel like I am, but ... a wedding, in August, during a pandemic?? Postponing is the only way to guarantee no one gets sick because of it. How do I express that this is the safe, responsible thing to do, in a way that doesn’t put them immediately on the defensive? How can they see reason, when so many people out there right now are acting like this virus is over? How can I avoid a “fake news” rebuttal, if I’m right in thinking this threat isn’t overblown?",19Jun2020,1

I'm a hygienic person. But I work in a deli within a supermarket. And they have a rule: Wash your hands every time you enter the department. That means, if a customer asks for you to direct them to an aisle, then you have to re-wash your hands.   


I wash my hands and try to mitigate leaving my department so that I don't need to re-wash my hands. But I usually ease up on the hand washing when my hand plays up severely (as it currently is). Last night it was bleeding due to how frayed my skin is.

Should I just resign?... Work is hard to come by currently. But my hands can't endure this amount of hand-washing they expect. And being lectured and spoke down to just really got me down when I can't help that I have dermatitis.

470,"Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this short.

Basically on Wenesday morning I woke up with a really horrible cramping just under my belly button. It got worse through the day and moved to a sharp stabby pain in my lower right abdomen. I felt nauseous all day and as though I was all blocked up. 

Eventually I called the NHS and got taken into hospital. By 2am the pain had died down to almost nothing and stayed like that for an hour or so until a doctor pushed hard on the left side of my stomach and the right side became blinding pain. 

I was given morphine and admitted to a ward for tests. Until 1pm I had on an off pain, sometimes it was a 4/10 but it reached a 9/10 at certain times. My ultrasound didn't show anything in that area (they checked my ovaries and my kidneys as well) and my bloods came back normal. The last pain I had was at 4pm yesterday.

Today I feel fine, though I can feel a sort of wiggly, rumbling feeling in my lower right side. It's in one really specific pin-point area. Sometimes I also get general cramps across my abdomen. The doctor saw me and said that since it seems to have gotten better I'm being discharged. I trust the doctor and if my bloods are fine then there isn't an infection or anything.

What I'm worried about is that if I go home will the pain start again? If it does how bad will it be? Basically I'm just hoping that someone else has had a similar experience so I can get some idea of what to expect. I know everyone is different but it would help me.",19Jun2020,1

478,"This is my throwaway account for obvious reasons. I tried posting this on AITA but they don’t allow anything mentioning sexual assault. 

So I recently reached out to an ex after 5 months of silence in order to speak about things, specifically my perspective on the events that led up to our eventual falling out. We’d broken up because our relationship crumbled after a proposal rejection. It was shocking to me that she decided to cut me out of her life for so long especially considering how close we were. Really close to the point of talking about kids, marriage, etc and we had been together for over two years. I felt I must have done something wrong in her eyes for her to completely cut me off, and so I reached out. 

In that conversation a situation popped up from about a year and a half ago, where we were in bed, I tried engaging to have sex and she said she was tired. She fell asleep shortly after. I was okay with her not wanting sex in that moment but wanted to talk about how recently our sex life was really not doing well specifically because she was always wanting to sleep. She had always went to sleep in times of us trying to spend time together and this was around a time in our relationship where we weren’t able to spend that much time together. So I woke her up and wanted to speak about it, she went back to sleep after saying she was tired. This made me upset and I woke her up again, her falling asleep felt like My concerns were being ignored. Especially because we’d gotten into arguments before about her always sleeping in when it came time for us to have any time together. She kept telling me she was tired and didn’t want to talk, and kept going to sleep on me. I woke her up and things  were getting heated.  Looking back at it waking her up was childish but me in the past didn’t see it that way. After being woken up again, she just engaged in sex and we went to sleep. 

When she brought this situation up, she said I’d coerced her into sex, and that I wasn’t taking her no for answer. In hearing that I immediately apologized that she felt that I had pushed anything onto her or that she felt like she had to have sex. I explained that me continuing to wake her up to argue was wrong, and childish but in no way did I force or pressure her into having sex. I had a problem with our sex life and was making that known, I wasn’t telling her to have sex right then and there, and in no way would I ever want to make her feel like she had to have sex when she didn’t want to. I apologized with all my sincerity because I hate the fact that I made her ever feel that way and that I hurt her in that way. She said she appreciated my apology and we talked about other problems we had during our time together.  

Today I texted her saying that if she ever wanted to talk my lines are open to her, and she told me thanks. I asked if she’d ever want me to reach out to her and that she was still my best friend at the end of the day. She replied that she was terrified of me and that I raped her, the only real reason that she spoke to me was so that I “can get help” and she was making sure that I never “did that to another woman”. This really shocked me, I understood that she had said that I coerced her, but after my explanation of events, I’d hoped that everything was settled, or at least not seen as me maliciously doing something as terrible as rape. I basically said I didn’t rape her, and that I didn’t coerce her, my intent in what happened wasn’t to get sex in that moment only to talk about what was happening with us. She basically told me that it didn’t matter what I meant, only what happened. She then brought up other situations where she said I’d done some terrible stuff, but in every situation she brought up she’d say it was sexual assault or bringing up situations I don’t even recall happening. They all had this spin to them as if I was being sexually predatory and to be completely honest I feel as though I wasn’t. This ended up in argument where I had said I didn’t rape or force her to do anything and she’d say “get help”. 

 I do feel however that since she truly does feel like I was doing something sexually predatory I must have been? I feel both extremely guilty because of the way she said I hurt her but at the same time upset and lied on because I truly do feel like I didn’t force anything on her. I am really confused on how to feel about this or what to think of myself.

486,"My biological father left me and my mum when I was about 1, moving out and having a few other families with different women after - I know of 3 half brothers/sisters but there could be more. He left my mum depressed and me without a father. Since then my mum married the man I call my Dad and they had my brother and we've called ourselves a family and not really mentioned the fact I have a different father. Not that my parents have ever hidden it from me, it's just a bit of a taboo subject. 

However, last year I found my biological dad's Facebook, turns out he lives far in the Middle East now with his family but a few years ago he had been posting pictures of me captioning them 'Pity she doesn't know about her real Daddy' and weird shit like that. I ignored it although it's been really hard for me to process. I had thought that he didn't really think about me/want anything to do with me as it looks like he never paid child support etc. 

Also, he was controlling and manipulating towards my mum which has put me off contacting him the past couple of years. 

So it's my 18th birthday on Monday (ironically the same day as his) and I have had a funny feeling he'd try and contact me via email or through my mum. Its the type of shit he'd do because he'd use the 'she's 18 and an adult now, her mum can't stop me or her etc' card as that's the type of man he is apparently. 

Yesterday i'm sitting watching youtube then the notification pops up saying he'd sent me a friend request. BUT, by the time i've screenshotted the notif and then composed myself enough to be able to click on his profile and open Facebook, he'd like un-requested it and it was gone. But he DEFINITELY sent it as i have the screenshot. 

I just have so many questions - like why after 17 years would you send a FACEBOOK FRIEND REQUEST to get in touch with your daughter? Why would you then delete the request? Is it some mind game shit - does he want me to know that he's there and watching? Was it an honest mistake? Is he waiting for me to message him?

People who constantly make fun of people like me at work make it so much more hard. I know I am awkward, twitchy and weird but I really don't think it gives them a right to make fun of me. I don't really know what to do. I don't want to be a snitch and get people in trouble and these people are making it harder to go to work.",19Jun2020,1
488," I have cried 3 times this week because of work and I’m actively seeking something a little less stressful but do to the current pandemic jobs are a little hard to come by. I think having an extra break will help me learn to like my job again but because I was essential during my states “shut down” I feel like my stress levels need to be leveled. I have a little get away planned for this weekend which includes having a few day’s off next week. Doing a little site seeing, napping, reading, camp fire building, etc. Nothing major but just something my partner wanted to do this summer to help mitigate stress and try to enjoy a socially weird time in our lives. 

My partner has today off and we haven’t packed yet. I’m supposed to finish work early but deep down we both know that’s a lie given current projects work. I know she wants to be on the road by noon but if I work we won’t leave until 3 maybe 4 pm and won’tget to our camp site until at least 9 pm. 

I have sick hours and accrue them faster than any other category of time off at work.

489,"Basically half and hour ago , i had a huge fight with my dad. Basically i had a a paper i needed to fill out for next year to enter in my sister's school. But i had a question for my sister. So my dad brought me the phone and the papers telling me that my sister was on the line. I started talking to her. And my Dad told me to speak tamil(mother tongue) i kinda just ignored it and talked in English. The for some reason he started getting angry . I didn't understand why. I apparently made a signal with my hand of disapproval or something. I denied it. Things degenerated fast.  He got angrier and angrier tells me that i am lying. I tell that i am telling the truth. He grabs my hair and he said to stop lying or he will beat me(well in our culture it's considered normal to discipline kids like that). He goes away. I told him again that i did nothing wrong. He comes back with a belt and beats me once in the shoulder, my mom comes in and tells him to stop it and listens and tells me to shut up and tells dad to go back to the room. I was half crying half shouting at this point. I tell my mom what happened. My dad comes in yelling that i am always bad and it's my mom's fault for always defending me and that's the reason i will grow up a ""criminal"". Mom says that he should listen to me a vit too. He starts shouting and says mom doesn't listen to him at all. And says ""If I die it'll be because of you(me)"" . That got me upset. Most of the fights between my mom and dad was always because of me or something i did. Most fights in the family is almost always caused by me too. None of the fights we had were as big as this. I am on my way to school now while writing this. I don't know what to do. I don't know if i should just shut up and not talk back to my dad. I don't know how i am going to face him. I don't know what to think. I don't know what i should do. I don't know how this stupid fight came to be.

490,"My whole situation is kinda complicated right now. My current employer tries really hard to keep me but has to fight for it over company policy during corona where they don't continue contracts that are running out.

I sent out applications to 5 businesses and got offered 3 interviews (so far). The first interview was earlier this week and the second one will be next week.

The first company just called me and said they wanted to hire me, but the conditions would be pretty much exactly the same as my current employer - the work would just be more boring. It would be easy work but I just had a really hard time telling them that I need to sort out some things on my end and I would get back to them soon.

Some more context: this is a working student job (8-16h a week to get through my studies at uni)

498,"Hey! 

So pretty much the title. I'm 24 and recently I have really big struggle with this. I work shifts as a nurse and live alone. Which means that often I have like 2 or 3 free days in a row. But most of the time I just spend them alone at my place. Even though I end up sleeping trough most of the day because ultimately when I think about it I get bored alone. 

For example I can go and spend 3 days at my moms place. My siblings are there and we usually have a ton of fun. There's an amazing water there where I could go fishing and then grill the fish I catch with my family. My older brother is probably the one I have strongest bond with and we either end up spending the night somewhere in a bar playing pool or doing some movie marathons at home. Or just playing PS4 together. I definitely can just sit there and play by myself as I would do at my place. I don't have to cook or anything since my mom does that and as I said it's usually super fun to spend time with my siblings. I'm always in a hurry. Always been this way. Thinking that if I don't go to my place quickly I'll miss out on the time I could be alone. Even though the time I spend alone often sucks compared to time I spend with family. And it's not that I need to recharge or anything. I get 2 weeks vacation and can't spend more than 3 days anywhere because I feel like I'm wasting time I could spend alone. 

Anyone experienced this and/or can offer some advice?

Thank you and have a great day!",19Jun2020,1

Maybe a month ago I was up for 50 something hours and I started seeing things in my room out of nowhere and I could only not sleep less. Ive had problems like this for around 3 years now. Even while during school a majority of those days I would stay up all night and nap the moment I came home. Ive been up 24+ hrs too many times to count the past 2-3 years. I stayed up 30 something hours fell asleep woke up 2 hours later at 2 am and stayed up another 30 something hours. 

Weed fixes all this I can drop to sleep instantly whenever I want when im high and I can stay up which a lot of my friends ask me how I smoke so much and dont instantly sleep. 

I would use this and just smoke all my life to deal with it I like it. Xanax also puts me to sleep right away but im not interested in that.

500,"Tldr: Does the approach always depend on the problem in question or does it just differ from person to person? What approach do you normally PREFER to use if you can approach the problem in two ways?

The long version: To be specific, my Institute has provided a deadline which ends tomorrow to - - either opt out of the exam in July and give it later in November OR risk Covid-19 infection(which is predicted to be at its peak in July in my country) and attend the exam in July which may not even be conducted if the Government feels it would be dangerous to conduct it. This decision will only be taken in July first week. 

Another problem being, vague assurances about the precautions that will be taken or the planning. 

Until today I had decided not to opt out and just wait it out and the make a decision later in July, at a miniscule cost of not getting a refund for the fees.

But now I'm feeling my approach is too Reactive and me being dependent on happenstance is far from ideal and this basically me allowing to get bullied. So my options are,

A. The proactive approach, take control and Opt out, make peace with my decision even if the exam is indeed conducted in July and then attempt in November and thereby lose 4 odd months. 

B. The reactive approach, Wait it out and hope the exam isn't conducted in July(practically it seems very remote that the exam may actually be conducted) but if it indeed is conducted, then decide just a few says before the exam whether to attempt or not, depending on the situation around my examination centre. Another major problem here is, the uncertainty of the situation itself feels a lot to take. 

C. Prepare with vigor and confidence and hope the exam is indeed conducted in July. (here, in reality the ""vigor"" and ""confidence"" aren't exactly at optimal, but there still are a good 40 days in hand.)


Additional facts as of yesterday's data:

501,"So before I begin, I’d like to apologize in case the post is long, or anything of the sort. *If you don’t want to read all that, I’ve summarized it into like two sentences, at the end of the post.* 

I’d also like to mention, I’ve recently gotten out of a mental hospital (going on 5 months now) and I was in for about 3 months. If it matters, I’m a 21yr old female. 

About a year ago, I got my associates degree, and I tried to juggle work, family life, friendships, and school. I gave it my all, and as a result of that and multiple events, I pushed away any emotions or feelings I had regarding my personal life. Immediately after getting the degree, I enrolled in a full time university, and only half a semester in, I had a severe breakdown. I have struggled with self harm for a long time, and continue to use it as one of my few coping skills. During this breakdown, I took a mass quantity of pills, and began to hurt myself further. I’m not going to go into detail on the matter. Anyway, that’s when I went into the mental hospital. Going there brought up previous trauma, and I discussed it, making things even worse. This is around the time I started to disconnect with my emotions and empathy. I began to start to pity others instead of sympathizing and empathizing. Eventually, I simply did not care about anyone anymore, including myself and my family. I understand how messed up it seems (to not care about the lives of my family), but to me, it doesn’t matter as much as it used to, because not only did they play a large part in the trauma, but- it is what it is. If something happens to them, it happens. Why worry and feel upset about something inevitable? 

Now coming to the present, I’m still struggling with these issues, but I want to care. I see everything around me as dull and pointless. I no longer get angry over things, and I’m at a lifeless state of just existing. I want to connect and empathize with friends, but I can’t seem to understand why they feel what they feel. I used to be extremely emotional, but I’ve suppressed my feelings to a point where I genuinely cannot understand how they can be so passionate/upset over certain things. I’m not stupid, I can put together reasoning, but I can’t relate or empathize at all. 

I am currently seeing a therapist, but her only answer is medication and meditation, and that hasn’t helped me in the slightest. 

*Summary:*The point of all that rambling was to say: I feel lifeless, and it’s as if nothing matters. I no longer get angry, happy, or feel anything really. I’m just- existing. 

All that aside, the purpose of this post is to ask for advice on steps I can take to get back to normal. Any advise is much appreciated. Thank you to those of you who actually read this.",19Jun2020,1
502,"I've had three aspirations throughout my life - when I was a kid I wanted to be an inventor, a psychiatrist, and a writer. The first one was never serious, the second one I ditched after I realised you have to study at med school, and I stopped writing after my teenage years and never managed to get back into it, so the third one never came up either.

I went to uni to study a subject that interested me (linguistics), but which I didn't see an enjoyable career path in. I've graduated two years ago, and have since done a TEFL course (which I didn't enjoy,) worked in an administration (which I definitely didn't enjoy,) have worked in a pub for a while (which is fine, but not a forever job,) and worked for a summer school (which I really loved ... but those kinds of jobs don't last all year.)

I recently started looking for software developer graduate or apprentice roles, and got offered a 2 year apprenticeship. I haven't started it yet, but I recently realised that even this doesn't really appeal to me - the idea of working in tech just doesn't make me feel like ""Oh yeah, that's what I want to do.""

The only things I know I like doing are working with people - something like advice work, counselling or that sort of thing - but after already having completed one degree, I would need to retrain heavily to go into any of these things, I still need a job in the meantime, and I don't even know if I would like any of those career paths either.

The problem is that I have no ambition underpinning any of these things. There's just nothing that I really **want** to do with my life, and at 24, I'm starting to get concerned about that. I want to earn money because I want to live and have a comfortable lifestyle, but I wouldn't choose work if I could avoid it - it just seems like a necessary occupation until I die.

So my question is: How do you find an ambition? How do you develop this knowledge that **this** thing is what you absolutely want to do in life? How do you know for sure what the right thing for you is?",19Jun2020,1
503,"Ok, there will be philosophy exam on Saturday,  I am nit from Usa, so here is a quick story.
First of all I don't know should I waste more time to prepare for it or just skip it and get my C grade (75 out of 100). So here are some pros and cons whether i take it or not. Let's start with worth reasons:
-I spent like 40 hours to find information and still searching. So it's huge amount of time
- I can have better grade and if I make 90 points i will have scholarship (50$ next 6 months). The chance i got scholarship is 50% cause other students have high grades too.
- I don't loose anything, I ll still have C (75) even if I don't know say anything on exam. its still a lottery ticket, so better trying than doing nothing.
And some reasons to not trying:
- I am afraid of talking in public, a bit confused and i might have to listen that I don't know anything and etc etc from professors
- I think philosophy is useless to my job, I'm in art major, so it's kinda stupid and actually its Learn-and-forget subject
- I have to study over night and spend another evening on smth not usefull. 
- Maybe I won't have any more points and I will still get C.

504,"It's been about 8 months since I discovered, accepted, and forgave my wife for cheating on me. The relationship has truly gotten better than it has ever been due to this situation. It really made me redefine myself as a better husband and father. I know I love this woman and wouldn't want to ever live this life without her. I took her for granted and should have rook the time to really LISTEN to her cry. She is a great woman. I am not justifying her infidelity by not means. There should never be any reason for two people who took vows to love each other unconditional to death do us apart in the arms of infidelity. This woman has stood by me in some many ”storms of life”. That's why forgiving her and fighting to prove my love for her was not an option; it was mandatory. 

However, 8 months later I now have lost all the motivation to continue this marriage. What happened all of a sudden for me to feel this way?  This is where I really need y'all advice at. I didn't know a lot about this man who she had the affair with. He was a very nice looking guy and apparently was very financially secure. I was fine with all of that about him. Nevertheless, a female colleague whom I found comfort talking to her about what had happened hit me with a dagger that has shattered all hope for my wife and I.  My coworker didn't know much about this guy either until she was at a friends party. It's there where she found out a lot about this guy.   She said he was truly a ladies man in public and in the bedroom. The women at the party were totally faltered by him.  I haven't been able to pull myself together following the last conversation my coworker and I had about this guy. All the women who he had been with were talking about he had the biggest penis they ever saw and he knew how to use it. Yes! I am and was jealous. While she was in that affair she totally didn't want to have sex with me. Likewise, sex hasn't been the same for us within these past 8 months. That's how I discovered something was strange going on with her. 

She didn't want to talk anything about the sexual part of the affairs. She would always say she’s not conformable talk about that. She easily volunteered much information about how this guy really knows how to treat a lady.  

I cannot get out my mind this man, his enormous penis, his perfection as a ladies man.  How can I ever compete with that? I feel incompetent in my marriage now. I too often wonder is my wife thinking about this man? Did she only come back to me because of the children? What do I do NOW?",19Jun2020,1
506,"For some background I (16M) and my brother (25M) are overall pretty close. Recently though, he quit his job and despite having his own apartment, is over all day long.

My brother has always had a hard time with boundaries and social cues, for example yesterday morning I woke up to him bursting into my room to show me a video on YouTube. I was obviously annoyed with him about this, but he never seemed to pick up the hint to get out of my room. The rest of the day seemed pretty similar, he just kept trying to show me memes and things like that while I was playing games and cooking dinner. 

Similarly, my brother can talk enough for two people. I get the impression that he has to talk until he finishes his thought completely, but usually it comes down to him talking for 45 minutes while following me and just talking louder whenever I try to speak or if there’s any sounds in the area.

Before, I didn’t have much problem with him because he would come over for a little while, we’d have fun playing games and looking at YouTube videos and such, then he would go to work. But now that he quit his job, the fact that he’s over all the time is draining my patience 
 
My problem comes from how I can tell him what’s up. I’ve tried telling him before not to burst into my room, but he just played it off as a “teenage boy” thing which made me feel pretty embarrassed. I’ve also tried telling him when I get annoyed with him but he usually passes that off as teenage angst too. How could I tell him without feeling like an ass or offending him?",19Jun2020,1

Hello there!
So here’s my situation: I work as a lawyer and I’d consider myself as average good paid for this kind of job. In average I earn 4000,- Euro net.
During m studies in my twenties I already worked in different jobs like McDonald’s or at gas stations and I started an insurance for the case I’d be not able to work anymore.
Lately I had an accident from which I cured quite well so far and I absolutely don’t have any limitations anymore. But, because of some phrases in my insurance contract and I would be able to go into retirement already now. I calculated I‘d get exactly 3.267,16 Euro net for the rest of my life. This amount is under inflation and I’d get every year 5% more.
I wouldn’t be allowed to work anymore if I take the money. 
I have a wife and a daughter. I could spend the time raising my child. I also thought about going to another country where things are cheaper.

Mostly I consider to go into retirement because I started to hate my job. It’s not because of the company I’m working for, it’s because of the work I do. I wasn’t happy in my job anymore for more than 1 year now.

I ask you reddit members, would you take the deal?",19Jun2020,1

513,"A little bit of backstory. My father had two kids with a different lady before he met my mom. And when he met my mom when she was 30 they got married soon after and had to kids of there own ( my brother and I). My parents marriage didn't last long because my father was a horrible person.

In fact I only have two memories of my father, and the good memory is the day in court when he legally abandoned me and my brother. I remember he specifically looked at us and said, 'I never loved you' as he walked out. 

The things that that man did to me has given me severe trauma. I have severe PTSD, to the point I have nightmares almost every night and even flashbacks in the middle of the day. And pretty bad bipolar disorder caused by the trauma. 

I've never told anyone the full details of what he did to me. Due to the fact I have no desire to relive the experience. 

But I've always been a little bit curious about my half siblings. My mom never mentions them. In fact we hardly speak about my childhood at all. 

So when my half-sister reached out to me via facebook, I wasn't sure what to do. I don't know what her relationship is like with her father and whether or not she'll try and talk about him. I just don't want that. 

I've only met one other person in my father's family as she lived in the same neighborhood. It was his sister. And she actually blamed me and told me it was my fault for the things he did to me and for my parents divorcing. And I don't want my half-sister to be able to put me through and depressive/traumatic episode, but I'm curious as well.

517,"Hi reddit, so basically a few months ago I had hooked up with a guy who never told me in a relationship until after we hooked up. The girl is still all over his social media and she is very oblivious as to what a cheater he is. The worst part is that he’s so SHAMELESS and his friends actually condone his behaviour. It’s unbelievably sick. My moral conscience is killing me. But it’s not about me, and I think this girl deserves to know the truth. 

The ideal situation would be that I would tell him to confront his girlfriend, or I would. However, the problem is he has some videos and pictures of our fun together. I am actually really afraid he would be posting these clips online as revenge porn or something. 

Please tell me what I can do to make this right.",19Jun2020,1

519,"Hello!

   Early last year, I ended my friendship with someone due to months of constant bickering and problems. For context, we were online friends and spent every second together. He tried his best to make me the best version of myself, and I never really took his advice and took him for granted.

Now, it is about a year and a half later. I took the time to work on myself, deal with some personal issues, and to take a deep look into how I treat others. I took my ex-friend's advice a year after our friendship ended, and I worked very hard on making myself a good person. I will refrain from going into too much detail to keep my privacy. One of my best friends, who is friends with my ex-friend, decided to help me reach out to him. Without going into too much detail, my ex-friend said one day he might speak to me, but he wants me to leave him alone. I have a strong feeling that this will be forever. Unfortunately, I learned some shocking news about my ex-friend that, if I had known sooner, would have made me post-pone trying to reach out due to him needing personal time.

  I know for my own sake I should move on. I spent a very long time trying to work on myself, and him shutting me down was very discouraging. Reddit, should I hold on to the ounce of hope of him changing his mind or should I forget about him?",19Jun2020,1
520,"I tried to find the post to link it on here but I used a throwaway and then I’m pretty sure I deleted the post. The gist of it was, an anonymous person texted me that she found my husband’s profile on Tinder and sent me a screenshot. I asked my husband about it and he told me that it must have been a prank and deleted the message without telling me. I was so confused and upset that I posted on here asking for advice. Everyone told me he was cheating and I shouldn’t believe him. But, he was my first everything and I couldn’t believe he would do that to me. He convinced me over the course of a week that I was absolutely crazy for believing anonymous people over him. I still felt that doubt but I ignored it and life moved on.


Then, in December, two years after I found that profile, my husband and I were sleeping on the couch together and his phone started buzzing. I picked it up and it was a message from a woman asking him to come over. At 11 pm at night. I knew his password so I opened his phone. I could barely see straight bc I wanted to vomit so I could only read the last two messages: one where he said he was coming over and then the one before where she said she was tired so there was only a 20% chance of sex. That happened six months ago and those words are still burned in my mind. 


A lot has happened since then. He’s lied a lot and I’m not sure if I’ll ever believe him again. He’s come out as a sex addict. He’s sexted multiple women over the past three years we’ve been married and been sexually active with two of them. He’s also been extremely remorseful and going to therapy, willing to do anything to make this marriage work.


My only question throughout this is why. Why would he do this? I was a really good wife/girlfriend. He was my first everything; first kiss, first date, first love. He was four years older than me so I wasn’t the same for him, but he insisted he loved me and wanted to get married when I was 23. I never pushed for marriage. I was finishing dental school at the time and lived kind of a sheltered life, but he pursued me and our families encouraged it bc they were close friends and of the same culture. 


I would say I’m fairly pretty. I haven’t let myself go or anything, and I still get hit on pretty frequently at 26. I have a good job as a dentist and I make the majority of our income since he’s a resident right now. I do everything around the home because I have good hours at work and his life is pretty exhausting as a resident. I thought I had a higher sex drive than him bc he was always tired from work but I’d say we at least had sex twice a week before all this. Including once right after he came home from the other woman and I had no idea. We never fought, I never nagged him; we honestly had never yelled at each other in the 5 years we knew each other till now. I don’t understand how he threw away our life and our future, everything that we were so in sync with for women he legitimately doesn’t care for. 


I thought he was my best friend. And now I don’t know. He’s been going to group therapy for sex addiction, marriage counseling with me, and he tells me everything I want to hear. But still, this is eating me up from the inside. I’ve gone to therapy for myself but I don’t know what I’m hoping to get. I just don’t understand how I could have been fooled so long. I just want to understand why he did it. What did I do wrong?",19Jun2020,1
521,"I’m 23F and in the US. I graduated May 2019 with a Bachelors degree in PR. I’m from major southeastern city A and I moved in Sept. 2019 to major southeastern city B (3 hours away from city A) to accept my first full-time job at a large publishing company. I was promoted from a remote internship (position I held for 1.5 years at that company) to a marketing coordinator.

My job has changed a good bit due to some changes on my team and some overall organizational changes, and I’m realizing that there isn’t a future for me here. I don’t want to be in a marketing or publicity strategy role, which is the growth trajectory for my current role—I’m much happier on the administration/coordination/content creation side of things. I also don’t want to be in the publishing industry.

This career realization + no solid support system here + COVID has created the worst depression and anxiety cocktail I’ve ever experienced thus far. I’m seeing a counselor in city B, which is helpful, but I’m completely miserable—filled with anxiety, dreading work, crying multiple times per day, etc. I’ve been working completely remotely since March because of COVID, and after spending some time in my home city and realizing how much healthier it is for me to be around my friends and family there, my parents and I have decided that it’s best for me to move back.

Here’s the plan my parents and I discussed: I am starting the process of completely moving back and I’ve started applying for jobs and speaking to recruiters in my home city. I’m going to for sure quit by the end of September when my lease runs out. My team is small, we’re down two positions, we’re unable to hire more people until 2021 because of budget constraints, and my company is on a hiring freeze, so I plan on giving my boss 2 months notice of my departure at the beginning of August to give her some time to figure out what to do. I will quit sooner if I either accept a job in my home city before then or if my company asks us to return to our office building to work in person before then, at which time I will tell my boss that I’ve moved back to my home city and am quitting.

Here’s my problem: I want to just go ahead and quit SO bad. I’m filled with anxiety and dead every time I wake up on a weekday to work. It would be such a mental and emotional relief for me to let this job go. My parents are adamant that it would be best for me to hold onto this job for as long as I can so as to not have a gap in my resume and to keep a paycheck, but I’m so burnt out. I have a place to live rent-free with my parents, I can cover the rest of my rent in city B with my savings, and what’s a couple of months of a gap, especially now when lots of people will have gaps on their resumes because of COVID?",19Jun2020,1
522,"Well, it's not really a challange I've recieved by anyone directly. I (17M and about to be 18 in two months) don't really have the best relationship with my parents. And I know the reason why; I've started smoking weed **(*****BECAUSE OF MY CHRONIC PAIN AND DEPRESSION*****)** when I was just about to turn 15, ofcourse they found out as soon as I started: the smell is potent.

As they are caring parents, the freaked the fuck out and have, using all of their rational thinking and problem solving capabilities, found out the best solution to their whole problematic situation and treated me like a heroine addict without any hope for recovery since. Sorry for the little rant, I hate that they have not listened to me about anything or trusted me with even being alone for 10 minutes (they have even locked me out of my room in the fear of being a drug dealer - never even thought of that).

So the long, well.. ramble cut short, I have educated myself about drugs and gained quite a bit of knowledge on the topic on the internet, but I'd like to know much more about the brain and what we factually know about its' functions, different processes and other fun stuff you can learn about the human brain. I'm mainly driven by my interest in psychedelic substances like LSD, psilocybin (magic mushrooms), DMT and other less known tryptamines, but also yesterdays' argument (more like a debate I had no say in) with my mom.

I have downloaded a pdf file of the textbook ""Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain"" (didn't start reading it yet because I'm super tired), so I think I'm on a good path to learning it, but what would be the best text I could download to understand these processes?",19Jun2020,1
523,I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I am. I have been working for a company since September 2019. I work as a caregiver with only positive comments from my clients.

I have gotten 4 other people to work for the same company. We had gotten extra pay for the whole Covid deal but that has since stopped.

524,"I have been in a relationship with someone my better judgement told me not to involve myself with for nearly seven months. This person has been intense from the off which I mistakenly shrugged off as a quirk of personality difference rather than the red flag I should have seen it as. 

Every attempt I have made to pull away from this relationship has been met with manipulation, emotional blackmail, insults, and threats. I am absolutely terrified that he will make good on them when I finally get shot of him - yesterday for example I had told him I feel he doesn't listen to me or my concerns, and in response he ordered me to be waiting for him when he finishes work: ""I *will* come to your house and you *will* be waiting for me and we *will* talk about this."" I told him not to tell me what to do and that he was scaring me, he responded ""Do you have any idea how easy it would be for me to hurt you? If I wanted to hurt you trust me it would be so fucking easy."" In the same day I told him I was horrified that he thought he could order me around like that, and he denied everything, calling me crazy and delusional.

Whenever I've called out his behaviour he responds like this, if I tell him he has done something I see as a red flag he says things like ""So you think I'm a red flag?"" ""Oh so you think I'm disgusting/horrifying/manipulative?"" he can't separate the behaviour I'm talking about from the person, so everything I say is taken as an absolute.

He's prone to mood swings and frequent bouts of rage fuelled jealousy and paranoia. He more than once has told me ""I won't let that happen again"" when I have met with male friends (most of my friends are gay men, he knows this), and told me if I ever stay at a friend's house or share a bed with them (again, gay) then he will ""Not let it slide"". A lot of this is furthered by conversations he admits to having with his friends about the same subjects, recalling to me later how they always agree with his perspective - this makes me think he might be misrepresenting facts to them in order to feel vindicated in his choice to make threats and accusations.

We were both sexually abused as children, we've talked about it and understand each other in that sense. I made him aware that sometimes not wanting to be touched is a problem I have resulting from the abuse, but still when I pulled away once because I didn't want to be touched that day, explaining to him that I was having an issue with it that day and it wasn't personal, he became enraged. He got up, threw a bowl of fruit at me, told me to go fuck myself, and stormed off. This being my new normal I remained sat alone because I was relieved he had left and had no intention of running after him, checked my phone after a few minutes to listen to a voicemail. He saw this and sprinted back to ask me ""Who the fuck are you on the phone to"". I had to show him the voicemail from my job to get him to stop accusing me of cheating. He had been watching me after he ran off. He has since minimised the seriousness of this incident and others like it, telling me I'm being abusive when I tell him his anger scares me and I don't feel comfortable meeting him. 

He finds strange things to use against me: the lockdown of public places has been a blessing for me because every time we went out together before he would find excuses to get into confrontations with strange men he thought were ""looking at me too much"", saying they should ""keep their eyes to themselves"". Of course any perceived slight from a stranger would eventually fall back on me and become my responsibility. He frequently warns me that my ""actions have consequences"" but refuses to elaborate on what exactly that means in context. Once I ran into an old friend when we were together and hugged them, he then held it against me ""Oh so you don't want to be touched but it's fine when he does it"". 

He has admitted to obsessively ruminating on these past events, telling me he won't sleep or eat for over a day at a time because he is so consumed with rage and jealousy - but in his mind this is justified and all my fault. That scares the hell out of me.

I may have gone on too long there and taken this as an opportunity to vent - sorry about that.  I need advice because I am terrified of this person but desperate to cut him off. Thankfully we don't live together, but he knows where I live, he knows my routine, I frequently find him in my neighbourhood both on his own and with his friends when he hasn't told me he would be here. He knows I go to a local running track every day and I've seen him there once before. He later told me he was there with friends but I didn't see them anywhere near, only him on his own. 

I'm scared and I've never been in a situation like this before. How do I get away from this person without risking my own safety?",19Jun2020,1
525,"I like to talk to myself a lot in my head. I narrate things and I just have conversations with myself. It's a bit sad because I've make jokes with myself and made me laugh.

I'm just wondering if this is normal. Like I constantly talk in my head and it really feels like a normal conversation now.

One of the most common things I do is practice conversations before talking and remind myself about things constantly. Which has been causing a few issues with me repeating myself because I forget if I had said is already as I'm used to repitition in my head.

I blame this on being alone a bit much as a kid and reading way to many books. Like when I read I can immediately imagine the situation and feel like I can hear and see the story as I have a fairly vivid imagination.

526,"Well I'm right pissed. 

Wife and I are working out in the garage. I built a really nice garage gym before we met and with Covid lockdowns we workout together almost every night. She's been doing Crossfit for a year, she wants to loose all the baby weight. It's a really good CF gym too, top notch instruction, we've both been really excited with her progress. I typically cycle programs, but that doesnt really matter for this story, but I was in the middle of a heavy squat set. 

So she's out on the lawn doing some lunges as a warmup then she suddenly comes running in right angry. Then she starts yelling at this girl who is walking down the street with her husband (jacked to fucking hell btw). I'm pretty sure they didnt hear her at this point because she was just a kettle fumming trying to figure out what she just saw for a good minute before she blew up.

 She had apparently filmed her in a casual way as to hide it and then she, according to my wife, snickered something to the guy and they both laughed. My wife runs inside the house in tears and I'm trying to keep it cool. Maybe she just wanted to take a pic of something she liked in our yard so she didn't have to interupt us working out.

 Well I decide that I'm going to drive after them and ask some questions but they disappeared pretty quickly. So they definitely live on our street which makes me even more mad. So I check my security video and she totally fucking filmed us, it's completely obvious. I drove around again this time asking anyone on their front lawns if they've seen them. Nothing. Fucking ruined our workout, wife feels like shit and I'm so mad with no outlet. I need to yell or punch something. 

I feel like they fucking won, like they were trying to shame her into stop working out because for what, an ego boost? 

Here's the really kicker, they walk by our house every night. I have them on video the night before laughing and snickering to each other as they pass us too. 

Every part of my being wants to confront them tonight when they come by again but I know nothing good would come from this. 

A- the dude is jacked and I'm 90% certain he's a cop in our area. I'll get my ass handed to me.
B- Even if all that happens is a shouting match it gets us no where except ensuring I have to watch my back everytime I step out the house. Or maybe they start doing stupid stuff like vandalising our property. 

I think we just kill them with kindness? It's the only way I see it not going south and we at least get the satisfaction of knowing we didnt buy into their asinine behaviour.",19Jun2020,1
527,"This is not about a romantic relationship but about friendship.

I met this girl online 3 years ago. We've been talking almost daily during all this time and I feel like it's been the best friendship I've ever had. Even better than my real-life friendships (and trust me I have the best friends I could wish for).

We just work so well together and understand each other in a mature way.

I know she has a little crush on me, and I kinda like her too. However, we live in different countries so we've never really brought up the topic.

The problem is she's moving to another city within her country, and a few days ago, out of the blue, she told me she doesn't want to talk with me ever again. She sent me a long letter saying how much she appreciates me and that she loves me, but also that she wants to start a new life and leave everything behind when she moves.

I didn't reply because I was hurt so badly and I wasn't willing to show her that in that situation.

Yesterday she texted me again saying it was the last time she was going to say 'goodbye' to me, and again I just replied with ""it's alright"" because I didn't like she was making it seem like if she was giving me a chance.

Today I was kinda angry and sent a little text to let her know, to what she replied ""Sure I understand"", then a few hours later she blocked me (I'm not sure about this tho, but I think she has)

Do you think she will come back and text me again? Should I reply to her letter or just let it go and not talk again? It feels bad to end like this. Also, I really wanted to meet her in person.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My friend is going to move and wants to start a new life. Both of us like each other, but she's told me she doesn't want to talk with me anymore and sent me a goodbye letter saying she loves me. I've not replied to that nor to her last messages, should I?",19Jun2020,1

532,"Okay, so I'm a senior in highschool in a country that isn't the US (sorry for any possible English mistakes), but we have a thing similar to states. Now the problem.

My whole life I've been wanting to leave my hometown and my whole state if possible, and my parents know this. They always supported me studying college out of state, although they weren't too happy about it. The plan was that I would sign up for this program that lets you live with an elderly person rent-free while you study, in exchange for helping the person do chores and stuff. But recently I emailed the program asking for sign-up information, and they said that I need to have a backup plan in case there's no space for me, so my parents and I started looking for student housing. The thing is, the city where I want to study is the only city in the country that offers my dream major, and it's also the most expensive city in the country, which means I would be paying 8000 or 9000€ a year just for housing and food. This may not seem a lot for Americans, but to my family it would be a huge financial strain, so my parents are now trying to convince me to study in a college inside my state. This would have two advantages: I wouldn't have to pay any tuition because my parents work in a college in the state (although I got a scholarship that means I would have to pay very little tuition out of state anyways), and, most important, we would pay just 2000€ for housing and food. However, it would mean that I'd have to find a different major, and I really have my heart set on the one I want. 

My parents say there's no pressure to make a choice, but I know they're worried. I have asked them several times in my life to let me get a job, but they've always refused. Also, I don't qualify for housing scholarships. What should I do?",19Jun2020,1

537,"I’m not talkin crack, coke and heroin as those days are behind me, I’m looking for advice and info on running a small but profitable drug businesses. It’s not like I’m new to drug dealing but I want to scale back and have a more passive business with a more relaxed client base, where I can stay more anonymous

How do you launder money ? I employ 5 people from my estate to wash cars and only one of them knows it’s a laundering business. It’s not an ideal way to launder money what are some other ways without running a legit business ? Apparently you can fake inheritance or there are services out there which will launder money. Also how do you explain to family and friends the money your making ? This is mainly how my parents discovered I was a drug dealer amongst other reasons

What drugs are most profitable, cheapest to buy, in most demand etc ? In terms of drugs to sell previously I have extracted mescaline and DMT and have tried to synthesise some of Shulgins drugs (it’s not as easy as you would think). All of that is time consuming so I believe buying xtc, 2cb, Xanax, Ket, LSD, DMT, Bromo-Dragonfly and THC vape liquid  of the darknet is the way to go. Also I’m attempting to grow shrooms, does anyone know if the yield is worth the effort ?

In the UK meth is very rare so its one of the most profitable drugs you can sell imo, as well as cooking H and whipping crack (never done this personally) but this is too risky, how do people manage to stay low key while selling this stuff ? As addicts won’t leave you alone and the feds dedicate all their time to trying to catch you. Can you sell harder drugs without becoming a rival to more violent dealers ? 

I made a prior post about KFC and I did not mention that I was involved in running it, as I wanted to gather opinions about how efficient/risky it seemed, you all brought it to my attention how common this system of drug dealing is. After most people were fired I am planning on infiltrating my local Burger King, after learning from mistakes I previously made.

How do you stay anonymous when drug dealing ? This in my experience has been incredibly difficult but it’s important to me as many people in my life would question who I am if they found out, also people start attempting to rob you which is something I want to stay away from.

My final question, how do you manage employees ? As I can’t explain to them how dealing on a small scale is better for everyone, their making money and want to make more and will always want to move more weight, with no regard for the additional risks it brings.

Thanks for reading and this is all hypothetical of course, so if ur a fed fuck off

538,"I haven't gotten replies on r/meToo that's why I'm trying here. 
So my sister (11) was harassed/assaulted (idk the difference) about a month ago and she just told me yesterday. If it had been someone we didn't really know id probably beat the sense out of the assaulter and get a sentence myself but the thing is the assaulter is our second niece (15 or 16) and our families are really close. Her father helps our dad a lot (my dad is sick so he can't do much) 

My sister is really scared of her and idk what to do if they'll come visit us.

And today she's asked me if I ever like a girl and i answer yes. I currently like my former classmate but I don't think she's like me, then for break the awkwardness I asked about her love life too.  And for her personal question part. She asked me if she too fat or not. Well I'm being honest with her, if she's loose few pounds it would perfect imho.

541,"I knew a girl for a couple years whom I've always had chemistry and a connection with, I never met her in person for the 5 years I've known her. We would flirt and talk for hours but I always resisted going all the way with her because I hadn't had it very easy in the couple years and I didn't want to get her entangled in my personal mess of a life.

 I never formed a emotional bond with her or talked to her heavily and I've dated other people and so did she but we still had a magnetic pull with to her and her to me.  It wasn't until late april of this year where we decided to go all the way and we actually sat down and started talking heavily, learning a bit about eachother more and began building the seeds to a relationship, we basically passed the friendship threshold.

 A month into talking the way we did she insisted on meeting despite me saying it was way too early but we met and I picked a bad date setting (you know quarantine not too much open)  I didn't go with my guts original plan to have a more private setting with just us two to be focused on eachother and chose the public pier instead. 

 She didn't feel a spark the first time we met, I wasn't personally expecting it the first time it's our first time meeting in person we were both awkward, shy and nervous but she slowly began to distance herself away and I knew this but she insisted it wasn't the case and it hurt knowing what was to come soon and it did. 

She wanted to go back to being normal friends...but I don't think I can simply discard my feelings so easily and bounce back so easily and I explained to her my need to break contact with her because not only am I hurt but I can't just go back to those old feelings &amp; view of her so easy, but I also have and suffer from PTSD and I know that forcing myself to stick around will hurt me more than heal me and make me feel at peace.

My husband turns 60 in August and I want to throw him a surprise party at our house/yard( rather large with multiple bathrooms), located in the USA. Our 3 kids (all 20 something year olds) are all in but I am still not sure this is a good idea. It would be about 40-50 people.

543,"Ok, lemme give a little context. So there's this cat that my mom found under her car and now it's in the house with me, who is allergic but likes cats, my little brothers (who are 3 and 4 respectively), my mom, the nanny who lives here, and the maid. Neither the maid nor nanny seem to think animals have any need for comfort if my dog was any measure. 

Now I have had cats before, I grew up in my grandma's house until i was 7 and she had 3 cats. I hate the idea of my little brothers getting anywhere near it because it isnt fully grown and I dont want it to suffer at the grubby hands of those cute little demons. I say this because I remember when I was 6 and I tried to put my cat into my backpack to take to school and 8 left it in there for half an hour, I wanted to bring it to school for show and tell because i really liked him.

I told my mother about this and she said she was thinking of keeping it, because having an actual pet would be an experience for them. I managed to convince her that this would probably end in them breaking its bones at best, or atleast managed to sufficiently annoyed her into saying that she wouldn't keep it. She said that she would atleast tell the guards to ask around and see if anyone lost a cat.
Whether this is from a lack of respect or from some minor narcissism on my part but I dont trust that woman to be bothered to even make some vague call to whomever.

So now knowing this, what should I do? Should I just ask around myself? Would there even be a point? If it is just a stray, how could I convince my mom to contact any shelters? How do I prevent it from getting hurt in the mean time? Please give me any sort of advice I hate feeling like this.",19Jun2020,1

548,"As title states, I’m 25 (almost 26) and having a really hard time dealing with it. I’m getting married next month, buying a house with my fiancé in the next 6m, and work for a top 20 where I’m trying to build my career. 

I should be really happy and a good bit of the time I am, but I’m also having some big identity struggles with my age. I feel like after we buy a house, I’ll have done everything and that my life is pretty much over already. I don’t want kids and traveling is out of the picture for who knows how long with COVID going on. 

When people bring up Gen Z I get so jealous and feel panicked. While I’m very happy with how my life turned out, I wish I could do it all again knowing what I know now. I wish I had fun in middle and high school and focused more on my grades. I wish I had matured faster and had friends instead of being a loner during those years. I wish I’d gone to prom and experimented.

With college I wish I had taken it slower, gotten a degree in something I loved, really made connections and joined more clubs. I wish I’d dated more guys and done a travel semester. Then I wish I’d moved upstate like I always wanted to. Somewhere cool and fashionable like Chicago or NY. 

 I think all the things Gen Z has now are so cool. I wish I’d grown up with the technology we have now. I wish I could have been an e-girl or instagram model, but I’m closer to 30 than 20 and that’s just not me. My fiancé and I don’t participate in any kind of social media because he thinks it’s toxic. 

I feel like I’m already such a boring adult. All we do during is work and watch tv with some video games sprinkled in. I hate it and I hate that everything is pretty much over for me already. No more dates, no more school or social opportunities. 

I just want to rewind to 15 and do the last decade all over again. I want to be the cool popular e-girl in middle and high school who gets into NYU and goes to work for Buzzfeed.

550,"I passed my driving test 9 months ago (4th time) and come from a non driving family so it was very nerve wracking and scary. I wanted to give up but my instructor insisted I persevered as he genuinely believed I was a good driver and just needed to try get over my nerves. 

My issue is that since passing, I really underestimated how scary it would be driving without my instructor by my side, and since no one in my family drives, I have no support. So the past 9 months have been spent only doing mostly local drives at 10-15 minutes max. 

Since passing my test I’ve managed to hit my car off my driveway twice and nearly caused an accident twice. First near accident was about 6 months ago when changing lanes, I checked the mirror but forgot to check my blind spot and a car had to swerve to avoid me. Safe to say he was very angry and I was super shaken up about it. Ever since that incident I’ve been a nervous wreck. And my nerves make all my logic and common sense go out the window. 

Second incident was today. I had no option but to drive somewhere today I feel really uncomfortable driving as I had to help someone out. I was at a busy junction and trying to find a gap to go. Let a few possible gaps go due to nerves so when I spotted one I decided to just go for it. Pressed on the gas and from the side of my eye see a van coming that I’m about to cut off. I panicked and quickly braked before reversing out the way. The van came to a sudden halt directly in front of me before they started beeping at me.

I honestly have no idea how I managed it. I constantly check mirrors, blind spots and always slowly edge out at junctions due to being extra cautious after the first incident. I’m really shaken up now and ended up in tears thinking maybe I just shouldn’t be driving. My nerves are clearly dangerous:(

I was thinking of trying to make a point of going out super early and late at night to practice when there is very little traffic to try increase my confidence but I feel like I shouldn’t even step back in the car after what happened today.

551,"Hi there to anyone who reads this,

Im currently stuck in a situation i feel there is no way out of. I am a 30 year old male and I work as a manager at a local restaurant, i have been working there for around 11 years now. Over the time I have been there my mental health has seriously worsened, I have had many incidents of OD, even at work because i just couldn't take it anymore. I have no passion for the job, all i do is let them down due to feeling so anxious and scared to be there. I don't know what to do anymore, this time away from work this last couple of months has made me realise so much about how badly that job affects my life and my health in general. I have recently been contacted to return to work but i have so far been afraid to answer the calls due to talking to them about this, I feel concerned there isn't going to be anymore they can do. Over the years admittedly they have helped me with some things, given me the correct days off to attend my therapy sessions, to give myself some space sometimes but I always end up back to where i was and then having to take sick leave to try and get my head straight, I just don't look good to the job and I feel there is no escape here and im scared that its going to get to a point where I will make another rash decision without thinking and damage more than i ever thought i could, I don't want that but in the past those bad times have been exactly that. 

My options at the moment are 

1: If i leave the job on my own accord then i will be government sanctioned for 12 weeks which means i will become homeless and lose everything because with no money, how can i pay for anything?

2: Continue to work in that job on the downward path of losing myself slowly to my mental health and probably end up losing everything again.

Is there anything i can do here?

So I’m putting two and two together. I went to look at his game info up on Apex Legends (a video game he plays)  tracker to see his level..I found more then I wanted to. So we were texting on the 17th  and he said said gn at 11:23. He has a job and has to sleep before 12, plus his strict parents would take his phone away. His score was 13,663 when he logged off. 

 I saw on the tracker which says the time they played the game, it said 12:46 on the 18th. 
He always says gn before 12. So he’s up past his bed time. And it said at 3:33 as well. 
I’m surprised because he has very strict parents and he has work the next day. Unless he has off and he didn’t tell me. But he tells me when he doenst have work. To make matters worse his snap score went up that morning. At 4 am his snap score only went up 2 numbers. Each snap is one point. So he got 2 snaps. The score was at 13,663 when we stopped chatting that night.
And at 1 pm it went up again.
 
So my guess he wanted to stop talking to me and continued playing his games and texted someone. Or someone texted him.

The in-laws live opposite. FIL is terminally ill and has severe tunnel vision. Bless him, he tries his best to look after the garden, cuts all his own hedges but we he does it practically leaves him bedbound for days. He has cut through several lawn mower cables. The poor sod needs help! Dad is a gardener, so problem solved right??? 

Thinking my dad would be more than happy to help, we asked him. He thought about it for over a week, stressing about what to charge as he doesn't want to charge full. He was taking so long FIL told us to offer dad £100 a month for doing what ever needs maintaining (Not a massive garden and it would be a regular income). I offer that to Dad, that makes him stress more, he said he would give a quote on Friday (today). Today he tells me he doesn't want to do it at all because he doesn't like charging family but he can't do it for free. He hasn't even been over there to explain this to him. 

I feel so awkward about it, I feel terrible that FIL is so desperate for help, has bent over backwards to help us &amp; my Dad won't help him because he feels awkward. Now I have to break the news without making out that my Dad is some kind of unhelpful prick. I know Dad isn't trying to be unhelpful, he has anxiety issues and when something stresses him out he would rather just avoid it entirely. I understand that but it really looks bad.

577,"Howdy. Excuse the new account; until now I've only been a reddit lurker.

Over the past 9 months, I (23M) spent roughly 1,500 hours making a video game for a small group of friends. An RPG starring all of us as party members filled with inside jokes and so on.

It was a long and, putting it simply, stressful process to finish the project, and I was looking forward to everyone enjoying it, but it doesn't seem that it'll happen. It's been a little over two weeks since I gave it to them, and only one's played it through. Another one hasn't even opened it, and the rest played about a quarter of it.

It feels pretty lousy, but I don't know if it's fair to feel rejected like I do. On the one hand, I know RPGs aren't exactly for everyone, so maybe they're just not into it, but I can't help but thinking if one of them custom-made a video game (or board game, or any expression of friendship) for me I'd enjoy the hell out of it.

I'm also conflicted because another friend and my girlfriend, who both volunteered to bugtest with me, played it all the way through twice each.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is this: Am I allowed to feel hurt by them not playing a game they're not really obligated to play?

Thanks

Hi!

I got a tattoo for the first time a few days ago and i need to travel up and down to get to my bf. Now when i wear a cardigan in 27 degrees it’s not that nice since it pretty hot. Now i put a sock over it and when i’m inside I immediately take it of. Is this a good idea or should i make the sacrifice of wearing cardigans?

Thanks in advance!

579,"My father’s parents passed away a few years ago and he received a lump sum of at least $300k cash from the sale of their townhouse and possessions. He also took grandad’s car which he later sold for about $8k, without even offering it to us first. 

Dad has never been good at managing money and through various family members I found out that his parents have bailed him out of debt many times. This includes alimony to an ex-wife and paying off the mortgage to his current property which means he hasn’t had any debt for a decade. Despite having no debt, he hasn’t been able to save much for his retirement either which is approaching in about 5-10 years. 

He used most of the inheritance to purchase an investment property (also mortgage free) so he is receiving rental income and has about $100k cash left in the bank. Before Covid he was also looking at Porsches and nearly bought a light aircraft. 

I know it’s his money and he needs to plan for his retirement, but it would have been nice if he shared a bit of it with us - 3x adult kids. We’re all struggling to get ahead in today’s economy so a little would go a long way. My husband and I are professionals in our 30’s, still paying off our student debt and renting because we can’t afford our first home yet. 

It just feels unfair that Dad had so much help from his parents to get ahead but he wasted those opportunities by mismanaging his money and now he can’t pay it forward to us. I’m not sure what normally happens in this circumstance so is it wrong to feel entitled to some of our grandparents’ inheritance?",19Jun2020,1

584,"Hello Reddit!

Disclosure: This is a temp account

I’m sure as many do post here, I’m in search of advice. I do not have many around me that I can ask for advice, I also have no one that I’m open to seeing as a mentor anymore in my current spot. Which is really why I’m here. I’ve had such things in the past, but now days it's only been my wife who've I've looked to.

So let me try my best to paint the picture of my life and hopefully not get too personal.

My life is a very unique and unaverage comfortable family life. My recently separated wife (Almost 8 years of marriage, we’re still in the same house) is of foreign origin, though a US citizen now and has been pretty successful with her work and did travel a lot, prior to Covid.

My background, I joined the Military at 17, I had no plans, nor any job experience, and was a great choice at the time, and my time was enjoyed. Then I got out at basically 10 years of service to be able to better serve my family and help support my wife by being more available. Unfortunately as many know, military life means time away a lot, or it can be difficult to get the time approved to be away and serve your family's needs. My wife’s work also had lots of travel, being the breadwinner, I gave up my job in the military. Which was great at the time, but I also basically threw my career away doing so.

We both agreed that I would get some sort of job or do something else.

While this sounds simple, it’s proven to be a difficult thing, since being able to find a flexible job is very difficult, and especially one that is of actual interest to me as well or one to help bring balance to my life.

I’m the sort of person who does something because I want to be good or the best at it, have interest in it, I tend to aim high and achieve high, a bit competitive, and am result driven, but fulfilling my interest and my family's needs has sorta failed because of this, and I have inadvertently dug myself a whole to where I’m trapped, and I became a dependa. (If you have a good understanding of military life, then you understand what a dependa is. If you don’t, then it’s basically someone who only takes things.)

While I still help and am regular about helping with things (I’m not a full on lazy dependa, just the kind that currently doesn’t have money), it unfortunately has not panned out, because I’m not providing money I feel. All I wanted was the perfect puzzle piece.

The craziest part is, we sorta have money, we’re not broke, well, I am, about 95% of my money is wrapped in bills, my dd/family car (which at the time was for a potential work avenue, but no longer is), my fun car (which i can’t really support, but one of the few things brings happiness to me), and all of our cars insurances, plus other things like lawn care, and few personal things. So I’m lucky to end a month with any money, if I literally don’t buy anything. This money comes from the VA for my disabilities. So for the most part, I have to an extent supported myself, but some months I had needed extra money for support. I can understand how that can be cumbersome and tiring. To also top it, it is me, who usually ensures bills are paid on time. It's like a double edged sword, because I'm constantly talking about money, and ensuring money is going to where it needs to go.

What I believe has happened, is that we’re both in a mid life crisis in our early 30's. We have done marital counseling, but it hasn’t really helped us, because, we have only really invested into our personal lives, rather than that of a whole family. Which is where I messed up, because I’m stuck in a hole. Neither of us have admitted to this (the stuck in a whole part I did, which greatly makes me feel worthless), but instead rather blamed each other or blamed ourselves, which is again the problem I think. Also not really allowing things to adapt or giving proper time for change. I make no claims of being perfect. Though I feel I wasn't given a fair chance, things were looked at under a microscope, and judged to often.

I wish for things to work out, but I feel betrayed. I’m not sure that I can undo that feeling, and especially how things have worked out and the suddenness of this (2 days ago). A week ago we were talking about having my family here, being nervous hosting them, moved to a new house 2 months ago, etc, the list goes on. So this is truly a shock to me. (I'm not sure of what caused this to happen now)

I am at my lowest point, and I’m not sure where to go really.

I wish to not lose my family but I don’t think that’s possible, especially after being told, that this was feeling all the way back from when we said “I do”

I want to move forward, I want to be happy. What will sadly make me the happiest is to run away, but I can’t because I’m stuck in a hole.

My wife did say she would help me, and I have a place to stay till at least Covid and whatever else is better.

\*having a hard time writing at this point, everything still hurts, and the lack of sleep doesn’t help\*

I’ve generally given up everything, minus a few things, and rarely do things for myself. Like I don’t know how to be me anymore. I’ve lost myself, and somehow got wrapped up into being something else.

At this point and with current times, I only want positivity in my life, which it is greatly lacking, and part of my unhappiness.

Alright, enough with the back story, and before it turns overly sad. To the advice part.

My work background, I don’t really have interest in because I need school to get to where I want to be (management/oversight), and I unfortunately can’t handle the hard labor side of it anymore. The only exception would be sales or a trainer. Which is quite rare to find, especially around my parts.

I have the VA as an option, to go back to school, which I had started to pursue, then Covid rolled up and took away in person class (I really need that, with my bit of ADD), and also my kiddo’s school. So I had become dad/teacher mostly.

I could try to see if I can’t slightly better/change my bills. What would be perfect, is about $10k so I can unfuck my upside down car, then refinance it, and or also sell due to it being a lux car, since maintenance is typically less than Ideal or practical for normal/regular lifes.

Then do I try to file for unemployment to help me get some more money? So that I can at least get back on my own feet?

I generally don’t have a good sense of what unemployment is, and I hate that I'd consider that, but it is what it is. Are there drawbacks to it?

What I think i’d want the most right now in life is just to be alone, do some soul searching, and find the positivity in my life that I need and have needed for a long time now.

Another dream is this will pass with some change, and we can be a family again. Something like from the movie Fireproof. I just don’t know if that’s even a reality right now.

My other closest family is about 13.5 hours away and several states away, so they’re not much of an option besides phone support. I have told my sister about our change, but otherwise we’re keeping this pretty down low.

I just don’t know what to do. I think I have to find myself again first. I 100% have other underlying problems that I am ignoring, but I have no one I can really trust because I have trust issues and most of it is just really messed up shit, and therapist or not, I’m always afraid of being look downed on, judged or just something a long those lines. Also to add to this, I had talked to my wife about one my problems, a week or two ago, and now we're here. So trust is huge problem for me.

I also had a less than ideal childhood, no dad, several stepdads, juvenile trouble, etc.

My apologies for information being sporadic, I am a mess right now.",19Jun2020,1
586,"I stay in a flat with my childhood best friend. I’ve been talking to someone for the best part of the last 3 months, we’re in love. We haven’t been able to meet because of lockdown and coronavirus, but now that the restrictions are being eased I’m getting her down to come see me. The official restrictions say that only certain people (those who live alone) can visit one another indoors, otherwise it has to be outdoors. However, we’ve been having friends over to stay the night since the beginning of lockdown.

I want to have my girlfriend overnight, but my flatmate seems to have a problem with this. His justification is that “there’s a pandemic” and he “doesn’t know her”. I brought up the argument that our friends can stay overnight n he has no issue with that, but he says that’s because he knows and trusts them. I told him that she’s from a physically and mentally abusive household and that time away from her family is really beneficial for her, but he doesn’t empathise with this at all. I would understand if he didn’t want her over, if nobody at all was allowed over, but it’s apparently ok for some and not for others. I brought this up but he just doesn’t see my point. He just keeps telling me to wait “until it’s allowed”, but to some degree it already is. 

I’m really stressed. My girlfriend is really hoping to just get a day away from her family and she’s got her hopes up, I don’t want to let her down and upset her, but I don’t want a big argument with my flatmate either. I feel like I can’t win, how do I convince my flatmate to not have a problem with this? If I just go ahead and invite her over, he’ll be straight on the phone to his parents and then my parents will inevitably hear about it and everything will just go to shit.

587,"*Light trigger warning. This is more of a life decision than relationship advice as I am single and plan to remain as such*

Surprisingly, I have only seen mention of this sort of thing once on the internet. I am not an attractive guy, but I have had chances with ugly women in the past. I realize that I can't do any better as far as looks go but I have held out for 22 years without a relationship and if my current mindset persists, will refuse to exercise my options and would probably remain single for who knows how long. I handle being alone better than most people as I still do not have any real life friends, I believe most people in my situation would just ""accept"" their situation out of desperation and settle for whatever girl they could.

anyways right after I left she pretty much deleted me on all social platforms, I tried messaging her on ig but she didn’t even view it. Like idk why she is over reacting I didn’t say yea to selling it to her in the first place. 


I know I shouldn’t care and say fk it but that’s hard to do when u have known someone for years and consisted them a good friend. Also now I have no friends at all and it kinda sucks because she was kinda my only friend that I actually chilled with and talked too. 

Other than that I didn’t do anything major unless she’s mad at me for not recycling.

I cleaned it with paper towel &amp; a bleach solution, but we haven't used it since because I'm concerned about safety.

593,"I don’t really know what to do right now. This is also very hard to talk about. Okay, so quick little background. I (25F) have a best friend (25F) and there have been a few times that we have messed around after getting really drunk. It’s always just meaningless and drunken stupidity and we just move on the next day. She also has a boyfriend (28M) who is also my best friend. I actually introduced them. He knows about all of this and doesn’t care. They have a generally open relationship and she is bisexual. 

So, about a week ago we were all hanging out and drinking and it was my first time drinking in a very long time and I blacked out. When I say I blacked out I mean, I do not remember a single detail. I remember generally what happened but no context. It’s like flashes of memories. She and I messed around. Her boyfriend was around. The next day, along with a killer hangover, I had a really bad feeling. Like a nagging dark feeling. So I texted her a few days later to ask if we could talk about it, and turns out I had been persistently trying to make something happen between us that night and she wasn’t about it at first and eventually gave in. She told me she felt pressured by me. I was completely shocked because it just didn’t sound like me at all, and of course I feel incredibly sick and guilty. I immediately and profusely apologized to her and she accepted and told me she didn’t want me to be too hard on myself. I later asked her boyfriend, my best friend, why he didn’t stop me or say anything (because again, I was completely blacked out) and apparently he kept asking her if she was okay and she said she was. 

I just feel like a complete predator and a monster. I don’t know what to do with myself; I don’t feel like I deserve to forgive myself even though she says she forgives me. I also fear that this is the end of our friendship, which I would completely understand. We haven’t spoken since that conversation and I know I should let her come to me if she wants to still be friends. I just don’t know how to live with myself now. I feel complete shame.  My depression has worsened and I don’t really want to be alive right now. I don’t know if there is any advice that can help, and it seems like I’m the only one being this hard on myself.

597,"Been in a relationship five years and I've learned some qualities about my partner which have me now questioning is this the man for me. 

I get no ones perfect and I do love him as he does follow through if you ask him to do something (sometimes). I love the fact that he loves my body even though there are many times I have self doubts. He's really taught me to love my hair as before him self esteem was awful. He checks in on me regularly throughout the day to ensure i'm okay and so much more other caring things. I'm coming to this conflict-ion ""is this the man for me"" as yesterday I was on my way home from work from running errands for us and I was starving skipping lunch that day. He was home so I asked him to take some food out the freezer to defrost. I got home a hour later from when we spoke and he didn't bother to start cooking meat was totally defrosted, he was just chillen playing video games. I felt hurt that my partner that I've helped some many times to ensure I can pitch in however didn't even think to cook the food for me after hearing me express everything about being hungry. Do you think I was right for being hurt ? or am I being to emo?

**Some context around our relationship....**

I cook regularly cause I don't like to eat out and some days he eats my food some days he does his own thing and Idc about that but it pisses me off when he doesn't communicate when he's going to do his own thing cause we've wasted a lot food with this issue.  I'll like leave plates of food out come back the next morning and see it there when I know he saw it. (Yes I can cook very well that actually one of the things he loves about me)

He will never initiate anything, barley even sex. So say we have to go grocery shopping I'm the one who has to say something that we need to go. Say we have to pay a certain bill I have to bring it up, or ask him, everything is in my name cause he didn't bother to initiate setting up the utilities in the house he kept silent knowing babe's got it. If I paid for something we agreed to go half  on for the house or whatever, I'm stuck reminding him numerous times to send me the money. Eventually I get the funds but what if I was tight on cash?  Cleaning the house he only cleans like once a week or when he sees me cleaning he fakes puts things away to look like he's helping. He never does laundry, nor dishes and he drops two cups in the sink per night. 

I also have to say something about the dog he purchased for us, I have to remind him to buy dog food, give it a shower, needing to feed it, doctor appointments and so forth CONSTANTLY. I feel like everything is on me as if I'm the life reminder. When it comes to just life things just getting done in general. I find his interest only lies on what interests him such as video games, hanging out with friends buys the latest electronic. 

I've had moments I hold back and don't say anything seeing if he will speak up first saying we gotta do this but nope has yet to take ANY INITIATIVE ON ANYTHING literally. Is this someone really ready for a partnership based off what I'm saying? Or is this something that isn't that bad and I just have to pick my poison and what you can deal with cause I've heard my mother say that about my dad a few times. I also don't want him to start hating me cause I'm the discipline essentially for us where he doesn't have any discipline. Thoughts? Be honest please.",19Jun2020,1

If I’m unlucky there might be 1 or 2 other people there and a worker. I’ve been going there at these times consistently since all my classes are online so my sleep schedule doesn’t really matter.

602,So basically for the past basically 8 years of my life I would take a shower like every month and basically never brush my teeth as my parents never taught me person hygiene and never forced me to do these things and yes I do realize it's mostly my fault for not taking care of myself. Now FINALLY at 14 I've realized how important personal hygiene is and have been researching on it and trying to get into a routine of taking care of myself. Do you guys have any tips on how to get into a routine of doing all of this and just everything to do with personal hygiene?,19Jun2020,3
604,"Throwaway because my friend has reddit.

I have a friend whom I consider to be my best friend but I don't think he evens sees me as a friend, but rather just someone to spend time with and complain about stuff. We've been friends for 4 years, I honestly don't remember a single nice thing he did for me, he isn't the most considerate person and can be hurtful sometimes. 


We spend a lot of time together, but haven't done much work on our friendship,we rarely have any meaningful  conversations. I feel like I know a lot about him and nothing at the same time. I want us to be closer, but I don't think he does. I'm usually the one who initiates text, and when he does he just asks me if I wanna hang out, he's never asked me for a favor and I've never asked him for one either.


I don't want to lose him, but we spend a lot of time together and I care about him, but I don't think he does the least about me. I've cut ties with a best friend once for the same reason, and I slowly lost all my other good friends in that circle. I don't want this to happen again.
I don't have many friends, and all my friends are in the same circle as him and I don't want to lose them too.


TLDR; I don't think my best friend values our friendship, and I don't know to make it better without losing him.",19Jun2020,4

607,"edit. blocked him

i don’t know what tf just happened but here, last night someone added me on snap i’ll call them nick. nick added me by search and so i added him back and texted “hey, who r u. just wondering bc it says u added me by search” he claims it wasn’t by search and that it said we had mutual friends. so we talk anyways for a little bit bc i wanted to make sure he was in high school (my contacts r connect w my little brother’s phone who is in middle school and his friends add me sometimes). we found out our towns are about 15 mins away. he asked if i’m single and i’m like oh god i know where this is going but i say yes i am and he begs me to facetime sending me his number. i read it and didn’t know what to say but he said “ugh i know ur about to say no” so i called him because i felt bad honestly. thinking i’ll call him for maybe ten mins and hang up. (the actual facetime lasted about 2.5 hours) 

but he got really invested in it saying he hasn’t facetimed a girl in months and personal stuff about his parents and insecurities. there was nowhere to just hang up on this kid. i said some personal stuff back but nothing crazy deep like he did. 

but there were also red flags. he was saying how he feels like he can’t do anything right and he gets really really mad at video games like punching shit or throwing stuff. he also kept calling himself a nice guy w bad luck. just things like that generally.

before hanging up the facetime i basically told him it was nice talking but i’m not sure if i want something as serious as he had been going on about and that i’m not sure if i’m 100% invested (which i feel is fair i just met the guy) but he started crying, i asked if he was okay and he said i’ll let you go now. and i hung up. i sent him a sorry text saying sorry for leading you on, and he said he cried for hours and couldn’t sleep last night. which i feel is so odd like he poured out all this deep personal stuff on me, how is he that attached?? 

the thing is that i need advice on is that i’m kinda into him and this opportunity to meet someone new who’s into me but there’s half of me that just wants to unadd and block him because of the “red flags” am i an asshole for “leading him on” or would i be right with blocking him because the way he reacted made me uncomfortable.

608,"Aye, aye, aye! I have an old high school friend who is in that dreaded on again/off again relationship cycle and it's worrisome. She broke up with her boyfriend for the 3rd time in late May, and posted one of those ""feeling sorry for herself"" Facebook posts. A week later, and now she's engaged to the same guy she was heartbroken about leaving. 

I've tried to express nicely and not so nicely that she needs to take a long hard look in the mirror and talk to a therapist. Because that pattern isn't healthy or enough time to sort out all their issues. Not to mention friend has been going on \*ahem\* Tinder dates, or trying to drag me around town for a night out between said boyfriend because she ""doesn't want to be alone."" She also said that she wants to ""get married and have a baby"" and that I need to ""stop shaming her for her dream."" Even though she objectively needs some kind of help.

612,"Hi I'm (20f) and I live with my grandmother. I moved in with her 3 years ago due to me being closer to my university and not having to pay extra school fees living on campus. Me and my grandmother always bumped heads constantly. She is very old schooled, picky, and judgmental. My grandmother is the ""Karen"" of our family. Yesterday she sat me down for a talk.

To make an hour long talk into a quick explanation of what she said, ""we're different in age groups, I don't understand this generation, I'm very old schooled, I'm hindering you from real life experiences, you need to be out there in the real world,  I'd like my space back, and you need to find some place else to live."" She's giving me a week to think about things and search for an apartment complex. But here's the thing, me getting an apartment right now is slim to none. A lot of Apartment housing rules has changed since COVID and because of everyone getting unemployment. I just started working full time so I don't have a year of working full time under my belt which is needed if you want to get an apartment. There's also a million other reasons why I can't get an apartment atm and I am too stressed out to explain.

My grandmother doesn't understand how hard it is right now with everything going on because she is just trying to have her house back, which I do understand. I had a couple of options on where I could go but they've all kind of fell out. My mom said I can come back home with her but, there's no room left in the house since everyone has spread out and gotten their own rooms(I have 3 siblings). A really close friend of mines mom was always down with me moving in with her but she has since changed her mind. Lastly, the other option was military. Personally I don't want to join the military and I know beggars can't be choosers but I know that the military isn't for me.

So I'm left with where tf do I go. I knew this day would come, but I didn't think it'd be so soon. I have two more years of school left and this semester I'm taking my classes online since my city is a major hotspot and my university is still adjusting to COVID. So the option of living on campus is out. Even if I was able to convince my grandmother to let me stay for a little longer, I wouldn't want to be someone else's burden in their own home. I've been asking around and no luck. I honestly just want to pack all my things and move to a whole new state and start a whole new life but that's easier said than done.

I need advice on what I could do and where I could go.",19Jun2020,1
613,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons.

So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director.

Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else (i only stayed at community college before doing mortuary school online ) because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety/Depression so i didn't get to join a frat/ meet girls at parties/ etc on campus . The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day( my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist). I have had some big and small anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this.I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse.

I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS,everyone and my twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS/MS due to my Anxiety/depression over the last 6-8 years. I feel like i can talk to guys easier then girls, i don't talk/text to a lot of girls which is fucking 0 girls.

Also i use tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday/ puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety/depression. i don't know that why girls on tinder don't reply to me or stop talking to me after 2 messages but most likely my speech impediments. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off for my speech and anxiety. i told everything to My mom/my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds ( i signed up for a gym before covid came), i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too, (slept 2-3 hours on some nights). i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too. I just want a normal life since i am at my fucking wits end right now too.

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. My speech is only affected too. What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ?

How do I file these missing forms? I use to do TurboTax, but I'm unsure if I can do that in this circumstance.

I am much too broke to hire a 'tax guy', will I need them?

What forms would I need?

If I file my taxes now, will the government get angry that I haven't done them before?

I haven't had parental support since 2016, but I know that they did file me as if I was with them in 2017. (They're horrible people), how can I check if they have filed me as if I was living with them all this time.

623,"Lockdown has been lifting gradually where I live for the past couple of months. People go to work again, use public transport, come together in public spaces, go shopping, go dining...

Due to finals, us students won't be free to do all of this until mid-September. After that though, we're not going back to uni.

Classes have been online since March and will be until **September 2021**. We are not allowed on campus grounds and all activities (eg the sports team and all the university orchestras) are cancelled until **2021**. I'm at a loss. 

When I was a child, I suffered from an undiagnosed disorder that prevented me from being social and making friends and made me prone to bullying. I've spent more weekends and evenings at home, even in the summer, than I'd like to admit. I indulged in books, music and the scenery here (I live in a rural area) to not feel the loneliness. It was isolation, not because I had to, but because I didn't know how to break free from it.

That issue now has been adressed, after 20 years, and my life has improved tremendously. I was looking forward to my uni experience (I'm a newbie!) as I was finally going to have the typical life every other person has, but unfortunately, with all of this happening, I only tasted 5 months of freedom before going back into the isolation state I've known all too well. 

And now I've got the confirmation that this won't change for the next 15 months.

Life has restarted, but not for us students. We'll have to follow all of our classes online, will not be allowed to meet our friends, will not be allowed to participate in any activities, and will still have to pay for a room that we're not using. We're still stuck at home while everybody else is going on with their normal lives. We're not allowed to catch up either - we're ""too much of a risk"" since we have ""such broad networks"". Only students who live relatively close are allowed to catch up, but I live so rural that there aren't any people my age in the vicinity.

And I don't think I can bear this any longer.

I've spent years alone in this room, in that unvoluntary isolation. My university time was going to be the time in which I caught up with all the things I missed out on, the friends, the activities, the going for lunch with classmates... Now, it seems like even this will be taken away and I don't think I can handle the isolation any longer. No one seems to care about us students, not even the university with their ""we know it's hard but we're not going to change it, get used to it!""

How can I turn this into something positive? How can I feel less isolated from life and people? Basically, how do I survive?

**tldr: I have missed out on a lot of things and this was going to be my time to have a normal life. Due to heavy student restrictions, I'll be in another involuntary isolation for the next 15 months. How do I survive this and how do I turn this into something positive?**",19Jun2020,1

I could go back and do the course again, but it's a lot of money. I just need advice, different opinions on what my next options could be. I did apply for an art course, but if it costs me a lot of money too, I don't think I'll be able to do it.

I’ve come very close on 2 different occasions to landing major roles on prime time tv shows, but never made the cut. This friend of mine who’s around the same age was in the same boat for a while until he exploded on social media. He found his niche and now has well over 2 million followers on Instagram. He’s got other projects with tv/ commercials. He’s made it big. We weren’t best friends, but were always relatively close during high school and for years afterward.

We spent more than a few nights improvising dramatic scenes and playing out scenarios. While he hasn’t made it big for his acting, he’s got a huge platform and he runs in those circles now. We don’t speak often, but I’m sure he’d respond if I reached out. I just feel incredibly gross asking for any favors regarding my acting career  now that he’s rich and famous. Im sure I’m not the first person asking for these favors and I’m not even exactly sure what he could do for me. All I want is some opportunities to audition.

It’s hard to explain, but we talk pretty much constantly especially due to the fact that he has insomnia. He sent me a message and let me know his phone was at 2% so he wasn’t going to message me until he got home, but it’s been over 12 hours now and I’m just worried. I know that might sound overdramatic but I care for him a lot and the idea of something bad possibly happening worries me. It doesn’t help that the area that he lives in is known for being not really safe at night.


I can rule out the idea that he might be sleeping since he doesn’t sleep much, and I know for sure he wouldn’t sleep for 14 hours.


I could say that maybe he’s away from his phone and just never charged it? But even then that’s pretty unusual for him.


My last idea is that he’s taking a break from his phone and this one I feel like is the most probable. However, this idea still just feels off/out of his routine ever since I met him.


We live in different countries so its difficult for me to do anything, and honestly idk what/where I’d even start. Lastly, I have no one to get ahold of that also knows him to ask if they’ve heard from him.

630,"Edit: I'm 25 years old living in the US for context.

So I started this job maybe three or four months ago. It was right before COVID hit the US hard. My first week in the office was great! All the people I interacted with seemed awesome, and I was truly enjoying the job at the start. This is for a system admin/service desk job, $40k a year. The pay is great for my current situation, and I'm almost making as much as I was while I was in the Navy. I thought I'd stay here a while and learn what I can while I study up more on my software development skills. However, after my first week of working in the office, we all were sent home to work remotely due to the Corona virus, and this is when the issues began.

We started using Microsoft Teams to communicate with our teammates, as well as other teams in the company, which is an awesome idea and I've liked it for the most part. But multiple times a day, I run into people straight ignoring my messages. These are for things that I don't have the access to perform myself, they have to be completed by these other teams. Then the next day comes and I have an angry end user calling me about how their issue isn't resolved yet. Okay, so I send them another message. They say something like ""Okay, I'll look into it again"". Cool, should be resolved today then. WELL GUESS WHAT! Angry user calls back again, hey my issue isn't resolved! This has been my last couple months of work and it's been infuriating. I'm not sure if these people see my message and just don't bother to respond, or if they severely lack multi-tasking skills?

I've also come to realize how much I struggle with dealing with people. Not like I'm anti-social or have a short temper or anything like that. But I got this job because I want to fix things. I want to learn more technologies and make me a more appealing employee to future companies. I DIDN'T expect to be receiving calls for tickets from 70 y/o people that don't know how to capitalize a letter on their keyboard or how to even google something. This has been infuriating, and truly draining on me. 

I'm at the point where I dread going to work every day, even though I'm working from home. It seems like every week, they're adding more and more responsibilities for the service desk to take over (that other departments SHOULD be doing). There's one guy on the Telcom team, that I'm convinced does absolutely nothing throughout the day. He takes two hours lunches, takes like every other day off, leaves work early, but is still pawning off responsibilities onto our team. I just don't understand. I'm not sure if he's buddy buddy with the manager or if he's a master at making it seem like he's busy. But there's just no way. There's like 5 tickets a day that come in that we have to reach out to him for, and he fails to even complete those tasks when I ask him.

I'm just not sure how much more I can take here. I can't even force myself to answer another call, and my girlfriend has noticed how it's affecting me as well. I've always known that I wanted to work for myself, as that's how I work best. Maybe it's time for me to bite the bullet and volunteer to be laid off so I can fully commit to studying my software dev skills. I just don't know how to handle it. The thing that really sucks is I was really enjoying the job when we were all in the office, but it's sounding like it's still going to be a while before we're all moved back in there.

It makes it even more difficult because I know how lucky I am to even have a job right now. But what's the alternative to quitting? Being miserable everyday feeling like I'm receiving no respect from anyone and doing other people's jobs for them. My girlfriend has brought up that I should try bringing it up to my manager, but I'm having a hard time with that. I'm a very introverted person, so confrontation isn't my strong suite. Plus, I'm the newest member of the team and I feel like it's not my place to bring these things up. Nor do I care about the company enough to fix their issues for them. I'm not even sure what sort of advice I'm looking for, but I already feel a bit better after typing all this out.

I initially applied for apprenticeship because it’s been a struggle to find a decent paying job after college but I luckily got into this decent paying job fairly recently. The issue I have is that my current boss is fucking crazy and I can imagine myself getting fired at the blink of an eye for the slightest fuckup.   

If I were to join the union I’d get a significant drop in pay to around $16 per hour with $4 yearly increases so I’d be making what I’m making now in like 4 years from now which feels like forever from where I’m at currently.   

I’m 27 years old, have an awesome girlfriend who I’m thinking about marrying and all the future of family stuff so I’m torn between making/saving decent money now (and hoping I don’t get fired) and working for a union where I’d have a bit more stability (I think?) and eventually make decent money, but it’s gonna take some time: like a 5 year commitment.   

I don’t think my heart is in either of these avenues to be honest. It’s purely about the money for me. If I were to choose what I really wanna do, I’d like to be an entrepreneur of some sort (working on a business project now). It’s like if I don’t take a few shots in running my own business before I die, I will have regrets.

Both of these options are a means to an end for me and would only serve as a launchpad for what I truly want. I’ve asked my parents and my dad (who works in the trades) says to stick to my office-related jobs where it’s not too hot out and you won’t break your body down. My mom (who knows what it’s like to work for a shitty boss) thinks I should expand my horizons and just take this apprenticeship opportunity and see how it goes because I can always leave if I don’t like it. She puts an importance on “work happiness” versus the money (which I put a great deal of importance on.). 

Personally my gut tells me I should stick to my current job for the money and hope I don’t get fired because my heart isn’t in the electrician field.

But I would appreciate any and all perspectives and advice! I’ll answer any questions you guys may have to elaborate further if necessary. Thank you so much.",19Jun2020,1

640,"I don't like experts. I think it has something to do with being run over by a medical doctor who decided that she had fainted when she ran me over on the pavement and a court believed her, and how my friends who are doctors contradicted me and said ""pregnant women are inclined to fainting"" telling me some vague guidelines that got passed to them when I had scoured the entire literature on the topic.  Also I remember family doctors who refused to help me join the gym and exercise after I was run over - even though this was the best medical course of action because they didn't understand my injury. Also all the way through the run up the trial the police screwed up, didn't do what they were meant to do (take victim statement, invite me to court dates, tell me about the result of the court date, tell me when the trial was happening on the day of the trial etc), and I feel as if being ""nice"" and deferential here screwed me over a bit - if I had just interrupted complained been assertive, criticized (""I was run over by a car on the pavement and you can't even be bothered to invite me to court dates and then you add a six month delay in court case and won't even tell me why""!)

I also enjoy thinking, come up with new ideas and have read lots, and like expressing what I have to say. I think the combination of having experts moralize at me, mix up expertise with telling me what to do, lie, and my underlying ""do-it-myself"" attitude has combined to make me someone who might rub people the wrong way.  The lockdown doesn't help either, being locked in a room on my own with nowhere to go, and having doctors tell me what to do when I know

But I'm afraid that this way of thinking might bring me into conflict with others. I think I have tendency of walking all over people's expertise, and not respecting boundaries like this.

I'm all for understanding experts, reading what they have to say, trying to understand it as deep as possible. But I think even that could lead me into conflict with others, they might misinterpret my desire to ""understand everything"" as a desire to tell them what to do and mansplain. I sometimes feel as if expertise can act as a form of ""shut up and do what I say"", and I guess I'm just not willing to do that given what's happened to me.

I really want to help people I work with express their ideas and not make them feel ""spoken over"" or disrespected. But at the same time, I'm not going to shut up because I don't have the right to have an opinion.

How can I be who I need to be and who I am without being a horrible mansplainer?",19Jun2020,1

650,"So I’ve been with my boyf for coming up 2 years, and while the relationship I have with him his incredible. His family, not so much. 

I feel as though they’ve been very cliquey from the start, even though they have been nice people. There is something just not quite right and I feel there are certain members who just don’t want me there, for example my boyfriends sister in law, I get the impression I have pissed on her parade a little bit. I think she was a bit miffed I met my boyf just before she got married and so the attention went from “hows your wedding planning going?” To “I hear *joe blogs* has a new girlfriend?”. subsequently my relationship with her 3 year old child is strong, and I think she doesn’t like it, even to the point where she tried to stop me being called “auntie”, until my boyfriend said something about it because a think a lot of people thought it was out of order. She hasn’t been very welcoming, has been known to give me dirty looks from time to time. I’ve even been laughed at by her, I don’t like the girl and I don’t know how to address this without breaking up the relationship or the family! 

As for the rest of the family, including parents, when certain people aren’t there, it can be really great, but over all, I feel as though because I’ve not been in the family the longest, I feel like I’ve not been fully accepted, and it’s hard to explain and deal with. My boyfriends relationship with the ex was horrid and no one liked her, and I get the impression that to a point, they’re think I’m going to be the same and I’m not, I’m really not. They can’t take me seriously either I don’t think, me and the boyf have been talking about getting a house next year and you could tell in her voice his mum was quite surprised, I have even heard rumours when we booked our holiday that she said if we were to break up, that he should have it, we had that holiday, and I felt like it proved people wrong a little bit. But hearing that statement, hurt a lot. 

In fact sometimes I feel as though his family completely forget about me, during the UK lockdown I got told she would send me messages to see how I was feeling, I got none! 

I know my message sounds jaded, and probably very confusing, but I’ve written this unedited and from the heart, But the conclusion is, I feel as though I am either not welcome, or not allowed to be included to be part of my boyfriends family, I have tried my best to be apart of it, but I feel as though I’m seen as just a girlfriend who will be forgotten about in a few years when infact me and my boyfriend have discussed a future together and it seems that can’t be taken seriously either.

I recently gained back all the weight that I lost on my weight loss journey and for me, a trigger is caffeine.  I drink a huge cup of coffee at least once a day and exist on only diet coke. I know this is unhealthy and have been able to quit caffeine several times. When I do, I drink only water and stick to a healthy diet, but the quitting consists of headaches and vomiting and general awful caffeine withdrawal.

I am asking for advice, not only with quitting caffeine, but with the symptoms of withdrawal and how to stay off it for good. Caffeine is my only vice - I do not drink, smoke, or do drugs. How have some of you succeeded quitting and staying off it?

653,"Right now, in real life, I am judging men to kingdom come. Which I know it is so wrong. I can't help it. I wish I could throw this away. I wish I could love men and look at them in a different way without already making the conclusion they're all assholes who hurt women to gain power or feel power. Physically or emotionally. Like my dad for an example and my sociopathic mother's women beater garbage boyfriend. Both equally having this superiority complexities which isn't surprising.

So, I'm gonna just tell a little short life story about me. 

I'm a female, i definitely was suppose to be protected since I was a fetus. But no. As a child, I was molested by a male when I was 7. I was used as a kissing practice object by my own male cousin Kevin when I was 9 and by my own brother. I was this child, a dumpster that my dad had to let out his anger and frustrations on by yelling at me, basically emotional abusing a fucking child. I've seen so much violence as a child from my two parents who constantly physically fought each other and heard my sociopathic mother saying awful things- doing all these things right in front of me, the both of them. I was a kid who was basically another poor kid who got emotionally neglected, sometimes physically neglected. Physically abused at times. Taking care of myself as a kid was nothing new to me. My poor also neglectful babysitters also neglected me to the point I fell down the stairs (wearing braces rn). Jesus, even my aunt left me alone. Anyways, years went by- still being abused and emotionally neglected by my now narcissist dad and now, by my own brother. My mother was out of the picture since 2011. Now I had to endure hatred from two males. The worst. 2 males vs 1 female. Yikes. Okay. 
1 or 2 more years went by, i lost my friends, had troubles in school, tried to end my life because I couldn't take it anymore. Few more years went by, the abuse from my dad worsened, also my brother's bullying ass, as well. Tried to kill myself again, couldn't. I've had to endure all this hate from these two males for 10 years, now I'm _this_ (TITLE).

Communication in our household, sadly, it's like....a forbidden thing. Which is sad and awful. I never had this chance to really let it out to anyone. I'm still holding it in me. Even trauma. Now I am this woman who sees other men as this and that.  Because communication doesn't even fucking exist in this house or town. Because of the trauma. None of these men said sorry. I'm slowly trying to not be that person who wants a sorry from awful people. I've realized they will never say sorry. 

I'm just hurt. Tormented to the point of giving them the satisfaction of not existing anymore. 

Right now, I'm trying to hustle in life. I'm 21 years old now. In men's eyes, I am a cold and distant female who gives all young men, men who are the same age as my dad- the glare, the annoyed look, the disgusted look because of how much shit I had to endure from my male family members since I was a kid. 

It's honestly repulsive. 

I don't want to have this toxic mindset anymore. I DON'T want to hate all men anymore because I just know I'll be a gross feminist karen either in my middle age or when I'm an old lady. 

...I just want to be proven wrong that not all men hurt women for many reasons, not all men are awful. That some men are just normal and sweet....I want to be this woman who sees men as nothing but humans with flaws, in a good way. A HEALTHY way. 

But, how..

Just how...? 

I know, THERAPY will be thrown at me. 

My friends... therapists in MY (poor) town are non existent. My town can't afford them or something. So please dont bother... 

...hope I find something here. 

If not, I'll be deleting this. I'll do everything on my own instead.

I’ve been trying to google these answers, still a little confused and pretty new to the work force, so please forgive if these questions sound dumb.

At my job this week I had to work 
10 hrs Monday 
10 hrs Tuesday 
13 hours Wednesday 
&amp; 11 hours Thursday 

To complete a VERY last minute project my employers assigned. 

After working to midnight Wednesday I was told I needed to come in early on thursday and I would get off early. This didn’t happen as you can see, but the important part here is that I was told I would be not receiving a lunch (on this Thursday) until the project was finished. The project was not finished until 2 hours after I was supposed to be off work. So I worked 11 hours straight no breaks no lunch. 
This is NOT legal correct ? I could be wrong, don’t want want to look stupid lol. 

Second, I was given today off, but then told more needs to happen on the project so I can no longer have the day off which means I am most certainly going over 40 hrs for the week. I should get paid overtime for those hours right ? Like not the normal amount that I get paid for my normally scheduled time.

686,"Theres a guy I (f) met online 5 years ago on a MMORPG, I became friends with, swapped numbers, talked for like a year I think and eventually lost contact. (Half by chance and half because I started to realize something wasn't right, nothing creepy, just not right). I was a teenager back then, gullible on a level at the time because I felt desperately alone and wanted friends (I was made to do online school.) I gave this technical stranger my stupid name without any assurance of the fact that he was a legitimate person and not a psycho or a catfish. He told me his ""name"" and hobbies and where he ""lived"" and his ""age"".... but I NEVER once saw a real photo of this guy and NEVER had a single call from him or ever heard his voice. (Its so dumb, I know, trust me, I would never do that again.) 

I should note that he never asked anything inappropriate and never asked for me to send a bunch of photos or to call him or any really personal information. Things were often very surface level.

A few weeks ago, I received a follow request on 2 Social Medias, 1 of which I have never posted on and it doesn't even have my profile picture, just my name. 

I instantly recognized who it was even tho there's no personal profile photo on his account, its just an avatar screen-shot, and a vague username but a part of the username has the first 3 letters of his name. Even after 5 years, it was instantly recognizable. 

I panicked at first because I wasn't sure what to do and I was shocked that he remembered my name. However I eventually ignored the requests and went on my merry way thinking that he would dissappear again.

 I even almost forgot about him again.

Until a few days ago when he re-submitted a follow request (my account is private) and I assume he did it in order to catch my attention.


Now, I'm reconsidering reaching out to him. 
But here's my concerns.... He could be anyone, he could be slightly crazy and once I confirm my identity  again and by assuring that my acc it isn't just a dead account by acknowledging him, he could easily turn the situation into something negative. My name isn't too common and so its very easy to find me. For all I know he could be something dangerous. 

But then again... he could be a 100% normal person who's just reaching out to an old memory. 

I wont lie, I'm curious to know if he's real and if so, what happened to him, but I dont have the intention of building up another friendship, I'd probably keep him at somewhat an arm's length. But man, it feels like an unsolved mystery that I might never have the chance to solve again.

I'm just worried about the things that don't add up.... 

What should I do? Message him? Stay away? 

If I should engage and message him, what should I say, should I act like I dont know who the account is and ask who it is, or acknowledge that I recognize who it probably is and ask to be sure?

I mean he never even tried to message me. He only sent a follow request.




TLDR; Technical stranger/old friend who I never actually met in person/dont know if they're real, finds me online after 5 years, sends follow request, but this could potentially go downhill or potentially turn out fine. I'm worried about possible repercussions but extremely curious. Should I take the risk and msg him?",19Jun2020,1

Now, I suck at making friends and recently I started to feel really depressed and alone. So I messaged my friend telling him that his friendship does mean a lot to me and that I understand sometimes I'm weird and difficult to be around and I apologized if I had been with him. We talked for a bit and he told me I shouldn't apologize and all that good stuff. That was a few weeks ago. Ever since this virus came along and we've been under quarantine we've been texting sense we cant hang out. Well hes been updating his snap with stories of him chilling with his other friends. And he hasn't been responding to my text as frequently. Like, I'll text him on a tuesday but he wont respond till Friday or Saturday. And when I ask him if hes free to hang out he tells me that hes too busy with work or that he has family obligations. And I get that, so do I and so does everyone else. But pair that with his snap stories and when he tells me about when he did this and that with so and so the few times we do get together. It kinda makes me feel left out. I use to ask him to invite me to these parties he was always going to or to introduce me to his other friends so I could widen my circle and meet more people easier, but even when I told him ""even if it is just a spur of the moment thing shoot me and text, more often than not I'm just at home bored"" he keeps telling me that he forgot to. Hes 21 and I'm 20. I asked my dad about this and he told me that when he turned 21 he kinda stopped hanging out with his friends that weren't all together until they turned 21. What do you guys think? Should I listen to my dads advice and continue to be lonely till I'm 21 hoping by then we'll go out more? Or what?

690,"After being away from my apartment for 2 months, my work place started having us work from home every other week. Upon my return four weeks ago, I started getting bites on my forearms and feet (on the side that I sleep on). These bites appeared within the day and appeared in lines of 3-4. After a while they would turn into blisters or combine into a giant blister. These blisters are leaving deformities on my skin and are are tender to the touch. I would also get raised bites with hard centers, as well as rashes nearby. 

I'm concerned that these bites are either mosquito or bed bug bites. I've never had reactions to bugs like this before but I've never dealt with bed bugs either. The bites are appearing where I usually am fully clothed except for when I'm sleeping. I looked for traces of bed bugs around my bed and found no obvious traces, but every successive day I would end up with worse bites. I stopped getting bites during the weeks that I didn't stay at my apartment. 

This week I was away from my apartment, working from my parents house, so I asked my landlord to check my place. I provided them a picture of a bug I found in my apartment during the week that resembled a bed bug. They sent an exterminator to treat my apartment but they found no traces, so they did no treatment but left traps. At the same time, I went to a dermatologist who confirmed that these were bug bites, but could not tell me whether they were bed bugs.

Next week I am expected to return to work. If I know that the exterminators didn't treat my place, then I feel as if I'm going to just get new bites upon my return. I could probably request to continue working from my parents house, but then my problem would just persist if nothing is done. What options do I have to diagnose this problem while avoiding getting new bites?",19Jun2020,1

“Masked lives matter.

Unmasked lives matter.

Oregon, don't mess this up.  Human beings need contact, and that comes with germs, bacteria, viruses, and the like.  Nobody likes getting a little sick but the benefit is we can exercise and strengthen our immune systems.  We'd never survive a sunburn if we lived in a sanitary world!  I've shaken more hands and had more hugs in the last week than I can remember experiencing during ""normal"" conditions.  I think most people are ready to ""take the risk"" of getting the seasonal cold or flu just to get it over with get back to not living in fear of what ""government"" or ""experts"" have to say.  
So many conflicting sides, so who is right?  I say we all know what's right, and that is to tell the government to stay out of our personal health/ lifestyle decisions.  

Why not encourage people to eat better, make sure vitamin D levels are healthy.  Take zinc, echinacea, vitamin C.  There's lots of things we need to be reminded of in times of unrest, but the least of those is to be reminded to be afraid!  I say get out there and get you some brotherly and sisterly hugs, high fives, and hand shakes.  Encourage each other to get healthy by eating right and taking good supplements if need be.  Come on Oregon, do not force people to wear masks.  They're arguable ineffective, and my personal doctors say they make the inhaled air worse!  I'm an unmasked life, and doggonit, I matter.

I hate it so much, and it pisses me off to no end. Why is it I don't get better with practice but instead this shitty vicious cycle comes to visit me? Is inconsistency really just part of success and I'm just overthinking it due to my perfectionism or is it something else? I feel really irritated everyday thinking about this.

Hi guys

I have never written on this platform before but I am at a loss.

To give a little background information about my partner and I, we've been in a long distance relationship for 2 years now, we've met up with each other often and now we are so close to closing the distance after this whole Coronovirus pandemic is dealt with.

He's 22 years old, and he has a little sister, 18 years old. As far as I'm aware, he has always had a great relationship with her. She considers him a best friend, but when I ask him about it, the feeling isn't mutual. Instead, he tells me that I am his best friend.

With university being finally over, he is home now with his family. I've seen this before, multiple times and I have actually approached him about it. I feel that the sister takes advantage of him.

Always borrowing money, and not for essentials, it's more just for ""just because"". Always begging to be picked up and dropped for at work even if it means to wake him up when he didn't get plenty of sleep, and dropping everything that he's doing just because she calls him to pick her up from work. He complains about it to me too. And when given advice on what I'd do in the situation - e.g tell her that if it's not for essential, I don't think I should give you money, you're working too. Or if I'm awake I can drop you off work, or if I'm not busy to pick you up, I can pick you up. He would brush me off or tell me later that he'd feel sorry for her.

I don't know if I sound whiny, but there are other stuff that she does that I've come to find extremely annoying. I know I am not the only person who feels this way about his sister's behavior. When approached about what I feel with his relationship with his sister, he always brushes me off. He always tells me he would rather not speak about it and it leaves the rest of the day as us feeling a little sour with one another. I feel like I want to talk about it with him, but it doesn't seem like he wants to. I know the saying goes that if I marry this man I end up marrying the family. Initially I thought, I'd hate to be around his family, but we both realize we don't even want to be around the family if we decide to get married. And yet, I still don't find that reassuring, I still feel that if it came down to it and I really do hope this does not happen, but if he had to choose between me or his sister, he will choose his sister. The day has not come yet, but I am too afraid to see if I am right.

I might come off as sounding a bit harsh, but frankly his behavior with his sister is a huge turn off.

How do I go about this? Please help.",19Jun2020,1

703,"Sorry this post is so long.

I (19f) recently got a puppy. We're both staying at home with my parents right now due to Coronski.

He is now 4 months old and the cutest little guy. I tend to eat kinda slowly, and I don't think it's fair to him to have to sit in his crate and do nothing while I take an eternity to eat so I decided to put him in my parent's sun room. (And my parents are completely fine with this. They're even willing to pay the pet fee when I bring him to college) I thought it was a perfect solution because I leash him in the center of the room to an old table, I put his bed there in case he wants to sleep, a little fan in case it gets hot, his little treat ball (a ball that spills treats if he turns it), his fav chew toy, his water bowl, and a bell to let me know if he needs to go to the bathroom.

I've been doing this for about 2 weeks and he has been fine. In the morning it's pretty shaded and he likes staring outside and seeing the squirrels. I bought a longer leash so he could walk around the sun room, and the only reason I keep him leashed is so he doesn't chew my parents' window screen since he's teething.

So yesterday, I'm FaceTime a few of my friends while I'm eating. Most of them drop off and I'm left with this one girl who I'm don't really know. We're not friends. She's kinda like the caricaturized version of the anarchist. She's vegan (but she secretly eats chicken when she think we're not watching), she thinks that feminism is about shitting on men and that women are the superior gender, not equality, she constantly gets on me for being vegetarian with no intention of going vegan, and she attacks me for coming for being Indian. Just being Indian, because she thinks that the crimes in India are horrific, which I know, and I want to change in the future, but she think that I have a duty to drop my life goals and go fix India. So you can probably guess that I don't really like her.

She asks where my dog is and I show her the room that I set up for him where he's sleeping peacefully, and she gets REALLY angry. She says that I'm chaining him up, and I'm abusing him, and I'm subjecting him to the hot sun. She calls me a callous bitch and an unfeeling whore. She hangs up before I can say anything and refute her points. She tells all of my friends about ""how I'm an animal abuser"" and how they should take me to the police. I called each of my friends individually and fixed that problem, and now she's angry at them. She texted me that she's gonna post on social media, then she blocked me. I'm worried because this could ruin my relationships, or even get my dog taken away from me. I don't know if she's actually going to post it, but I'm really worried.

How should I talk to her about this since she's blocked me and everyone else in our friend group? Also, is this animal abuse? Because I thought it isn't.",19Jun2020,1

Although she managed to get P/T bar work she had to claim child support.  Her life spiralled downwards and she had a breakdown which led to 2 suicide attempts in October 2019. She was taken to hospital both times, discharged the first time and self discharged the second.

Her contact with the children has decreased since then and lately she has only been having them once or twice a week and only during the daytime. She is always making excuses as to why she can’t have them and usually it’s because she doesn’t feel well enough. I think she has been drinking but she denies this. Her rented house is a shit hole and she is forever pleading poverty. Her father and I are continually giving her money some of which she says she needs to pay the rent. 

Yesterday my SIL found out he is to be made redundant with immediate effect. He came to see me this morning to tell me that he was going to tell YD that he was going to have to claim the child support so that he can continue to have a home for the children. Seeing as he has been having them 95% of the time I think that he is being totally reasonable as he could have claimed something before now but knew YD needed the money. He told her and she has gone berserk. She rang me and when I told her that I could understand SIL’s position she has screamed at me, accusing me of taking SIL’s side against my own daughter, that I have never supported her and that she is done with everyone. I have since found out that she is at least 6 months behind with her rent and her plan was that she would be kicked out of her rented house and that she would then be able to get a Council house because she will be homeless with 3 children. She says we have ruined that plan and now she will be homeless. I offered for her to come back to stay with us until she gets back on her feet but she refuses saying that if she does that she will have lost everything. 

Because of her previous attempts I am frightened she will try to take her own life again. She will not speak to me on the phone or if I go to her house. I have been in contact with her closest friends and asked them to keep an eye on her. What else can I do?",19Jun2020,1
714,"I’m 23(f) and always had really low self-esteem.

When I was 17-20 I was so disconnected from myself I drank to the point of blackout weekly. I had sex (mainly oral, sometimes vaginal) with guys I barely knew in club bathrooms, parks and alleyways. There were a lot of blurred lines and I put myself in dangerous situations, it’s a wonder I didn’t get into serious harm or end up pregnant.
My friends were worried about me but I didn’t always tell them what I was getting up to. Without surprise, I ended up getting a name for myself around town (not victimizing myself by the way, it was totally my own fault).

I don’t even know why I used to do that, nor that I even enjoyed it. It made me feel sexy and desired in the moment but I hated myself after. I’ve cut out alcohol altogether since because of how it made me behave.

It’s been a few years and I still feel regret from what I’ve done. I’m disgusted that my first time was in a nightclub toilet with a stranger ‘just to get it over with’ and wish I could undo all those years, but what’s done is done, and some folk only remember me for ‘being a slut/cheap/can’t control herself’.

I am a US citizen that moved to a different country while i was young. I studied from last grade of elementary school to finishing my degree in this country. It takes 6 years long years to complete this degree in this country. 

I moved back to the US recently, and I have started the process of getting this degree evaluated to start working here in the US. Due to complications with the university and other stuff this process has dragged on for 2 years.


I got the results this past week. It turns out my education is insufficient and I may need to go the college another 2 years (costing money), add to that my education would need to be evaluated again (which is more money) and the fact I also have to take an exam if i ever to finish getting up to date (just more money added to the equation).


Due to present circumstances, i was laid off, i just started working last year in the US so i have dont have many savings.


What should I do? Im tired of all this stuff with my studies, I fought tooth and nail with my old university to give me my papers and I sunk money into this process. Should I just call it quits?",19Jun2020,2

719,"TL;DR at end. 

I (19f) currently am back home from college with my parents and younger brother (16m) due to COVID. Since I've been home, I've started realizing the differences between how my parents treat my younger brother and how they treated me at the same age. Some of it is minor- having him help with more yard work (he is a bigger, strong dude, so having him lift stuff the rest of us can't makes sense, but it's a lot more time of yard work than what I ever had to do, which sucks especially since we live in the southwest US where its crazy warm all the time), or emailing his teachers constantly about his grades (which are not straight A's as mine were, but are still good enough to get him into college). I started realizing things were getting a little worse when they harassed him for weeks to get a job, where at that age I was specifically told not to work so I could focus on school, with maybe some babysitting every few weeks. I'm starting to get worried after a recent thing that I didn't witness first hand, but heard about from my brother. He missed a deadline for signing up for an SAT (when I was his age, they insisted on doing everything for me and didn't let me sign up for it on my own), and they made him both pay for it and sit through a 10 minute lecture about how he is never going to get into college and better hope the community college/ tech school will let him in. This is completely irrational- he has taken the SAT before and has a pretty decent score, and a good enough GPA where he could at least get into a few of the schools on his list no problem. I never seem to be in the same room when stuff like this goes down, but I feel like I need to stand up for my brother and have them either treat us equally or give him less crap about his life like they did when I was his age. Any advice on how I can go about this without making things harder for him?

(And yes, I realize I didn't have as many responsibilities as a lot of people growing up. I'm trying as I get into adult life in college to become more financially and general life-stuff independent from my parents, despite what they might want. This isn't about making my life harder, it's about making his easier.)

&amp;#x200B;

721,"Hi everyone, I’m a fairly new hire at a job and thus am still in the learning stages. As a result, my supervisors routinely call me in to go to the office to do some work. I am afraid of going in though when all this can be done remotely, specifically due to covid-19. My coworkers almost never wear their masks (and when they do, they don’t cover their mouth or nose.. like what’s the point). The few times I have gone in, I wore my one N95 mask from a project from long ago. But i have worn that too many times now and only have my cloth face mask left. I’m mostly worried because I live with my family and many of them are high-risk. Because my region is slowly in the phase of reopening that includes offices, I can’t say anything about it, but I am constantly nervous and would really prefer to do all this remotely as much as possible. Is there a way I can, at the very least, voice my concern about their lack of distancing and mask wearing so that when I do have to go In, it is safer, but without sounding crazy or ungrateful that I’m employed? Is anyone else in a similar situation? It’s really stressing me out.
Edit: I should mention, not everyone in the office comes in. It’s usually only 2 or so that are also in, the rest of the office is always remote working",19Jun2020,2

If I forget for even a day, there’ll be a post it note. Yet, she leaves her dirty dishes in the sink piled high so I can’t even use the sink. She also moves my things without asking me, I don’t have a lot of things or food so she seems to think that means they belong at the bottom of the shelf or fridge. 

Lately she’s left notes asking me not to touch the thermostat. The AC in our apartment is freezing and so I just adjust it to a higher temp. But she’s left a note saying it should be at one exact temp the whole time and to put on a jacket if I’m cold. Call me crazy, but I’m not fond of wearing a jacket in the height of summer. This is all just really irritating and starting to get unbearable. She also has 2 cats that knock things down, 1 of which she doesn’t pay the pet fee for.

 I've been taking dance classes for almost ten years, but I've been taking a break for several months now because I can't handle how anxious it's been making me. My body image issues go beyond just thinking I look ""fat"" (although that is part of the problem as I am currently recovering from an eating disorder). I literally am repulsed by my body, especially anything ""sexual"" such as my boobs or any ""womanly"" curves. I can usually manage my issues if I wear SUPER baggy clothes and avoid mirrors; however I can not do this in dance class.

728,"So, both my (17f) parents got laid off from work. They worked for the same company (which I know probably wasn’t the best move, but whatever) and it’s a pretty small company. The owner is (in my opinion, I guess) a complete A-hole, and spent all of the company money on a fancy house and boat and stuff over time, and so there’s no money left to pay my parents for work. They work in construction, which was considered an essential business, so they didn’t ever run out of work, just slowed down. So that’s not where the money went. The kicker is they were 2/3 employees that got laid off, and they don’t even do the same job. 

Anyway, regardless of the situation, how do I help my parents. During the recession I was too young to help, and we lost our house and pretty much everything else.

Me and Lemon have known each other for a long time since her mom and my mom are good friends. Our family and her family are technically friends. Lemon is a conserved and “nice” person until she has her friends around lol. She wouldn’t act that way if our family were together. She just took advantage of how nice my family was to her an pampered her but if it was just us two she wouldn’t be as nice. As a young person (i’m 18 now) I was naive and wouldn’t confront behaivour like that but now i’m aware and shouldn’t of let myself be so nice to her. It was like i gave her 100 she only gave me 80.

Anyways this situation happened maybe 6 years ago. Yeah I could of let it slide but what she said isnt only disrespectful to me it was disrespectul to my ENTIRE family...idk what she was thinking. 

What happened was she told one of her friends (who isnt nice, a bad influence and she’s openly rude to people) something about me and my family which was highly disrespectful. Imagine what the girl is doing with that information now! She could use it to embarrass me :( Till this fucking day I can’t believe she said it and I wish I could say what she said on here but that’s how private it is to me. She told her friend and then Lemon told me to confirm that it was true. I was young and didn’t know what to say so I acted like i didn’t hear what she had said. 

Yes, she was young at the time but not young to the point that she had no idea what she was talking about. Even an idiot wouldn’t say what she said with good intentions. What she said makes me look “bad” and ruins my reputation... imagine how many of her rude friends she might’ve told and they could spread that information! So fucking gross. If i tell my mom what she did the family friendship would probably end. 

So with that being said how can I confront her and talk to her about this? I want to make sure it doesn’t go wrong and that I don’t mess up. I specifically want to ask her why she said it and who else she told since it makes me look bad.

I have never been controlled by my parents for anything and always got ample freedom to choose what to do in my life. Am I the idiot who's being ungrateful for robbing them of their daughter's wedding..?",19Jun2020,1

So recently he texted me and told me that he is in a sad mood and depressed he talked about suicide but says that he is too scared to do it. I’ve known him for for 4 years and this year is when he started being depressed.

747,"i've been around people, and i never felt that way.

even tho, after they have said that i am pretty attractive (like, exceptionally)

and tbh, i get shocked by it

and no, not cuz im being called attractive, ( i dont want to sound like a deluded douche but i've always had girls crushing on me at school, get checked out on the streets, etc) cuz im kinda used to it

but the fact that i felt if anything the opposite around those people

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like an ugly loser most of the times

well, i dont act like one (if anything im the opposite), but for some reason, on the inside, that's how i feel

and tbh, it fucks things up

for example now that i look at it, it makes taking jokes very hard

like for example, if someone as a joke takes a funny pic of me, it fucks me up. cuz i feel like a fat ugly loser (even tho im skinny model looking) and it makes me angry thinking that they're implying on that, and i've done actual violent stuff cuz of that.

even tho laughing it off would be much more graceful and better.

but at that time i can't really do that

and i've noticed that after seeing an attractive person go thru it, im like, oh, cool, it doesn't look that bad.

like i feel like i think i look (not like physically) worse in a certain situation than its actually the case

and again, it has caused lots of conflicts.

tho, tbh, in those cases, i cant help but feel that awful.

i wish i knew how i look from other's perspective..

&amp;#x200B;

and its also double weird, cuz i have a big ego too. i know sounds weird. but i genuinely think highly of myself

but that's the thing. There's a big difference between how i ""THINK"" and ""FEEL""

so, obviously, instinctively i react to situations according to my feelings..

750,"Hey! Just a heads up, I suffer from anxiety, and with the stress of the outer world bearing down extra heavy on us all, it has gotten a lot worse, though honestly, having lived with this condition for almost two decades, I’ve gotten it under control for the most part, and so this is a pretty rare flare up, and I’m actually rather pleased with myself! (However, because I am very self aware/“high functioning” doctors often overlook how bad my mental illness really is because I can “act normal” very well.)

Anyways! Here’s the background, and the problem; I (19f) draw to cope. I draw almost constantly. Usually, my own silly made up characters, mostly zombies and animals and stuff, but recently with the… um… everything that’s been going on, and being separated from my friends, I have been drawing my friends *waaaaay* more because I miss them so bad.

I have a friend (22m) I work with (we are essential workers) so we’ve been hanging out there, but also outside of work, with proper precautions. We’ve always been really close - people often assume we’re dating, not because of any kind of PDA (neither of us are the type for that) just our dynamic and perceived chemistry. Our relationship is strictly platonic, yadda yadda, but he *is* admittedly an attractive guy, but… that kind of doesn’t mean anything to me really. Because he’s the only person I can hang out with, and vice versa, we’ve gotten a lot closer, and I’ve been drawing him a lot more. Now, I do have his permission to do this, so that’s fine.

For the most part, they are silly comics and very cartoony sketches. Like just doing an illustrated, four panel bit for a funny conversation we had, or whatever. Me and him ended up talking about my art for a while the other day, and how I make deliberate stylistic choices to represent each person (fictional or otherwise) I draw. He thought this was really cool, and he was especially interested in my choices in drawing him, so last night I made a sort of brief guide showing all of these choices I make when I draw him, so I could show him!

This led to a bunch of other related drawings, some of which some could see as kind of intimate. Not sexual, or anything, the main thing/embarrassment is just as a sort of reference, not included in the guide, that showed him shirtless. It’s really rather tame, and was for a separate reference I didn’t want to include in the very PG main guide (however the picture is just his head + torso, to get the right shapes down and body hair patterns.)

I know that sounds fine, and *probably* is!! I just get super nervous about any form of emotional vulnerability, having been shamed and bullied very badly growing up (by peers, teachers, and parents alike.) I guess I just want to know if this is/seems normal. Thank you!",19Jun2020,1
751,I don’t know how to start this but my dad told us to always be strong and did not nature to our emotions. Growing up I was more sensitive than my brothers and I choose to be different from my dad and feel my emotions so i would be different. Both my brothers drink more than casually so do I in a sense. But I am on medication to stabilize myself and doing work so that my kids don’t make the same mistake like my dad. My dad is widowed so he hasn’t fully recovered from that he doesn’t drink that much but he watches the news and distracts himself to not feel his emotions. The easiest emotion to feel is anger and my dad treats me like he doesn’t know me because he doesn’t respect that I’m going into psychology for my major.

756,"So, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend and then met another guy from tinder. We talked everyday for 2 weeks and it was great. I really got to know him during that time and was looking forward to meeting him. He lives 2 hours away, which is much closer than the 20 hours away that my ex was. I was excited to maybe start a relationship with him because for the past 2.5 years I hadn't been able to just go visit a boyfriend whenever I felt like it.

About a week ago, we made plans to meet. I was going to travel to his city and we were going to spend the night together. We would've just had dinner first, but you can't really do that with resturants being closed for the virus. He would always tell me that he was excited to meet me and that he was attracted to me.

The plan was for me to go to work today and then from there travel to see him. It would've been around 10pm tonight. He never mentioned being uncomfortable with the plans and always went along with my suggestions.

However, last night I messaged him after I got out of the shower and he replied. I replied to his reply asking what hotel he was thinking of meeting at. A few hours later I noticed he hadn't opened it yet, but no big deal I figured he'd get to it. Another 2 hours goes by and I decide to check on it again only to find that our conversation had dissapeared and he unfriended me. I sent him a text asking if it was just a glitch or whatever and asked if he still wanted to meet today. He didn't reply and he actually even unmatched with me on tinder.

I feel really shitty because I'm not sure what I did wrong. I would've been understanding if he has just told me he wanted to wait or just be friends. Instead he straight up dissapeared. Part of me wants to message him on Instagram, which is easily found because he has a semi-unique name, and ask him what I did wrong. I keep procrastinating doing that though because I don't want to come off as crazy. What should I do? Just leave him be? I don't want to let him go, but I also don't want to try forcing something if he doesn't want it. Any advice is appreciated, thank you",19Jun2020,2

762,"I don’t know where to begin with this story but I’m in desperate need of perspective from those who’ve been through a similar situation. My (25F) best friend (26M) and I have been working on music for three years now and we’ve become as close as he would warrant. For a good part of it, he had been really distant from me. Almost as if he was scared, but always gave me the feeling he wanted me in his life. I’ve been there for him through a nasty break up and depressive episodes.

Eventually, I noticed he stopped taking interest in the things he once did before. In a major way. We’d jam, record music and skate frequently. He’d become easily confused and visibly distressed whenever I’d have a conversation with him or while he listened in on friends talking to others. The equipment he once knew inside and outside was now alien to him. He picked up a shard of glass from the ground to chew it, as well as flipped out in a parking lot, shirtless, attempting to fight passerby. I was distraught by this point and stayed with him for a week straight to keep him sane and in the house. 

The day that marked the beginning of his decline was this month when he’d disappear for hours without explanation. When he came back, he was noticeably more paranoid, incoherent and high strung. He’d then go on to tell me he was healing his schizophrenia through smoking crack.

Around this time and before I knew as much as I do now, our friendship evolved into something sexual and I honestly regret it. I’ve been in love with him for a year now and lost myself in trying to help him this month. The night before we had sex for the first time, A lot of his statements contradicted themselves in general and he had anxiety attack while opening up about attraction. Specifically, he’d go back and forth between saying he’s in love with me to he knows in his heart, we’re just friends after explaining to him how I felt. It pretty much drove me into insanity. After this, I was convinced he was in love with me too; it was just the drugs; that he wanted to be with me solely for me, but now I realize it was all empty. He was using me due to addictive behavior. 

On the day of my assault, he smoked crack again. This time his paranoia was inconsolable. He threw out some of his personal belongings bc a voice was telling him to. He asked me multiple times if he should throw his money from the safe and phone in the garbage. I was at this point yelling at him to not do so, that he’s not himself. 

Fast forward to that evening, we returned home from a day of drinking with some friends and left things on an alarming note. He was completely disassociated from smoking weed. I asked him to drive back because I was too drunk. When we finally got to his place, I told him I have work in the morning, I need to sleep. He for some reason took this as me wanting to have sex. The argument eventually dissolved into him repeatedly asking and saying I’d feel better if I’d sucked his dick, him climbing on top of me, fully clothed, to hump me, then started moving his hand south to my underwear. Throughout the entirety, I kept telling him I don’t want to have sex right now. Stop. Please. but he still didn’t get it. I began crying and having a panic attack, tried to reach for my inhaler but he snatched it. I was wheezing and hyperventilating. He kept saying I didn’t need it, then proceeded to put his hand around my throat and squeeze it. luckily it wasn’t too tight so I could pull him off of me but I was fucking mortified. He begged me to stay and cried when I said I needed to leave &amp; didn’t feel safe lying next to him. That I’m the only one he wants to be with. It‘s an awful night seared into my brain that I want to scrub clean

We’d never been around each other that much up until he started to onset. A huge part of me feels like a convenience than someone who matters. His family now knows everything and are taking him under their wing for support and treatment. I still find that I love him deeply and can’t help but longing to go back if he ever gets better.

I am a person who befriends anyone kind to me and respectful to me.
I give everyone the benefit of the doubt and make my own judgments.
I’m a RIDE or die friend and I will never give up on someone; even if they have issues. I try to educate them or get them help. My empathy and compassion is too strong.
But this is my downfall; I care so deeply about my friends and it’s hardly ever returned. I’m dropped like a fly. Easily disposable. 

I’m 25F, and my “best friend”; we will call her Lauren. She was my bestfriend since we were 13.
My other friend, “Amber” is white and was using the N word in a Live video (which I didn’t see when it happened). It went viral so Lauren deleted all social media.
I have people literally calling me a racist for associating with her when I had no knowledge of this until it went viral.
My “best friend” wants nothing to do with me now and wants our matching tattoos removed and everything. Making this a huge ordeal.

Now believe me I confronted Amber about the use of that word and how wrong it was. I’m educating her completely but ppl want me to drop her. I want 0 involvement with this. I have super horrible health issues going on and it’s making me sicker dealing with this drama.

I’m not defined by my friend’s mistakes. 
Do I drop her? Or do I further educate her?
She meant no harm by it but she still shouldn’t be using it. It was wrong. And if I knew before I would’ve stopped it. But now I’m getting the shit end of the stick for even associating with her so I’m lost. Idk what to do.
Seems like Lauren was looking for a reason to not be my friend if she can drop me that easily. 

Amber apologized for the word use and she said she’s going to work on herself and do better.
Do I drop her like everyone says? Am I really going to be defined by her? Is “amber” plastered on my forehead?

766,"I (31M) live in a city of over 300,000 ppl but I grew up in a very small town that is about 30 minutes from the nearest city of 50,000.  Spent a lot of time in this city because it was the only place to go. 

I moved away from my family after getting a job in a different city and have been 3 hours away from them since 2012. The thing is I don’t like going back to my hometown so sometimes I only see my family 1-2 times a year. Mainly because I have four dogs and traveling with them is a big stress factor for me. My parents don’t like dogs in the house so I always have to find a place to keep them and I don’t like being away from my dogs or having others watch them. I worry a lot about them which is a whole other thing. 

I have a good life where I live and a job that I love (best job i have ever had easily) but part of me does miss my family and I feel like a bad son and sibling for not visiting or seeing my family especially my parents who are in there 70’s. They have health issues and I worry they might pass away sometime in the next decade. A decade can go by in an instant and I don’t want to regret not being around for their last years. 

I feel selfish for not wanting to live in the same town as my family and I’m concerned if I move back there I won’t be happy. When I do visit, that place brings up bad feelings and all I want do is get back to my actual home. I love my family but I do not love the place they live mainly because I grew up there and I know the only things to do is drink or go to the movies and I don’t drink. 

Where I live it’s a big city so there’s a lot things to do and it’s a big outdoor city because of mountains nearby so I do a lot of hiking and biking. All of this is lacking in my hometown that was built in a big flat valley surrounded by farmland. I would have to travel an hour at least to hike. I’m not the most outgoing person as I like to be home and play video games but when I do this for a long time without going out I start feeling depressed so I mix in a lot of outdoor physical activity. I worry I won’t be able to do this as easily if I moved. 

Iv been thinking about this for a long time and the only positive thing I can think of if I were to move is that my family is all there. That’s it. 

Honestly as I write this I feel like I’m answering my own questions maybe that’s all I needed to do. But does anyone have any experience moving back to their small hometown? Any regrets?

767,"Hi everyone, I volunteer to host yoga classes  on Saturday mornings for victims of DV and sexual assault. I used to be a instructor for a studio but I left a few years ago because I wanted to focus on getting my undergrad degree while being pregnant and raising another kid at the same time.

Anyways, recently a male DV survivor was referred to me and I met up with him on Zoom last month. He seemed normal and not like a sleeve guy trying to wiggle into a traditionally woman’s environment which is always a worry I have about men.

Two weeks ago we recently restarted the classes outside and giving plenty of space in between due to the pandemic.

He attended both sessions and made very good progress for a beginner. I’m so proud of him.

But I have now received numerous complaints that his presence is making some of the female survivors feel uncomfortable. I tried to assess why carefully but they basically all said it didn’t matter his story - that this was their safe space away from the opposite sex and the worries and triggers that come with.

One is skipping tomorrow and the other hasn’t told me if she will still be coming. However one promised that she was representing more women than just herself and that tomorrow I would see only half the class there, if that.

I really don’t want to evict this poor guy from our class because he is so sweet and fun and he is a survivor too and my classes are for anyone who was abused or assaulted.

But I need to remember that my clients might not feel the same way and I should consider their emotions and feelings in the matter.

I’m wondering if I should have asked them all first if they would be uncomfortable if I invited the man to join our sessions. But I didn’t do that and so the boat is missed there....

If I had enough men for a class I would consider splitting jerk ins clad for women and one for men, except he is the only male. He’d be all alone and that defeats the purpose of the class to socialize and share experiences. And I don’t wanna discourage him. But also even if I did have enough men it would require me to spend twice as much time which I guess I could do. It’s only going from one hour a week to two. Big deal? No....

I’m at a loss as to what to do. The class is tomorrow and I’m sick to my stomach nervous worrying about the ladies who are made uncomfortable by him. I’m nervous for him that he will perceive that he is not wanted there. I’m nervous for myself that I will have to del with a possible altercation due to his presence.

Can anyone help suggest alternate ideas that I haven’t mentioned already? I’m really in need of some help and guidance.

I don't especially like talking about what I do, because it seems to kind of alienate people around me. I'm not big on drawing attention to myself, I live a normal life... mostly.

An example of what I'm talking about: I had the opportunity to see the Princess of Thailand at Cannes Film Festival last year. She seems like a nice lady. It was a wonderful experience and I feel blessed to have had that experience, but I also recognize that it's not a very common life experience.

Something that I'm noticing is that there's just a huge disconnect in life experience between myself and the women that I've dated. Many women that I've spoken to will often say that their jobs are boring, and I'm just not really sure what to say. Like I make films but I don't know jack about accounting or corporate efficiency, and those jobs might not be sexy but they do make the world work. I want to be able to talk about my experiences in life, but it seems to alienate people when I do...

771,"I (20F) was working on my car outside my father's apartment complex. After finishing up, I realized my bra was sticking out from my tank top. Later I was on the phone with my mom and joked about how many people probably saw and how embarrassing it would be if my dad saw. Hours later, I wake up to countless calls from my father and my grandmother. I called my dad and he asked why on earth I would tell my mother he touched me while I was working on the car. I had to explained what I really told my mother and got in a fight with her about why she lied. She claimed she was protecting me and said things along the lines of ""oh so now I'm the bad guy"" and ""sorry I gave a gave a fuck.""

I quickly realized she was intoxicated and decided to wait to contact her for a few days to let her cool off. I messaged her in a very mature way, making sure not to blame her, but instead state why it upset me and why I feel like my feelings are being invalidated. She immediately played the victim and told me to ""fuck off"" and ""go fuck myself."" THEN my aunt calls and asks why I would be ok with ""my dad grabbing my ass while I'm washing my car."" So she is still lying to my family for a reason I can not come up with. I don't know who she told or what she told who. I asked why she is still lying and she literally said ""because that's what you told me.""

I don't know if she truly does not know what she did wrong, if she truly believes her lies or just needs attention and to be the ""good guy"" for once. I do not think I can move on without a proper apology, but I'm also afraid I will never get one. Not only me but my father. Who knows what people are walking around believing what my mom said about him. She did apologize but it did not seem genuine and felt more like a...""I'll just apologize to get this over with""...kind of thing.

Being a virgin isn't a bad thing, but he has hopes of meeting someone special and everyday without someone like that is soul crushing to him. Basically he's not doing it ""to fit in"" he wants to be with someone he really cares about. Like saving it till marriage but not for religious reasons. 

He doesn't really go out; he does stream which I guess is at least introducing him to people with similar interests, but it isn't a huge community either and other than shopping, he doesn't go out.

Perhaps the answer i'm looking for is ""it's none of your business"" and just be supportive to him. I guess you could call him an incel in that he is an involuntary celibate, but I don't think that's fair given the stigma that incels hate women which he doesn't; i've never met a nicer guy. If anything I suppose he's a bit too childish which some might not find appealing.

I want to help him because I care. Sure, he's not less of a person for being a virgin at any age, but he wants to experience it; that not having at least 1 partner in his life makes him depressed and I want to help him, but being a virgin myself, I don't know what to suggest.",19Jun2020,1
774,"Ok so basically there's this guy I know from school (he was a friend of a friend) that wanted -100 karma. So he tried to do that by posting a picture of a kid who was finally adopted after about 2 years in foster care. The thing is, he posted it in r/Cringetopia. Then he shared it in a group chat that I so happened to be in. I called him out and so did alot of other people. After an argument and several people hating on him, he left a comment on that post stating: ""Since im getting this much exposure go follow my main u/Gab_riel0203, exposure is still exposure"". And for whatever reason, people bought it. Only about 2 people are on my side right now while everyone else thought I was the edgelord. What do I do to resolve this?

777,"I'm having an arguement with my friend. We're talking about the thing that he owes me but told him to give it after the quarantine. But still, he thinks of other way to give it to me. I refused and told him my side and he agreed. I thought it was over but then he replied again and and replies yes or no. When I disagreed, he got angry from me and have told something that he told me I told him a while a go but I didn't even told him that. 

So the problem is, I'm really confused. I've become the kind of person who stops replying if I think that it will go out of nowhere or when I think that there's a possibility that what will I reply will make the situation even worse.

I have something in mind that I really want to tell. Well, there are three. I managed to type all those words that I want to tell but I constructed three. One which contains things that I have done for him, another which just I made while I'm angry and another one which I made when I'm calm but I feel that this is not finished yet. 

So should I reply or just let it be? I have reply for several hours because I want to make myself calm but still, I can't decide.

Also, he told me to understand his side. He agreed to me so I should agree on his too. That's what he told me. But I can't even understand him because his reasons are contradicting.",19Jun2020,2
780,"I have a group of friends and they're pretty cool most of the time, except when there's a new movie/game/show comes out. They love spreading spoilers like wildfire to their friends (also my friends) and everyone loves doing that-except for me, I totally hate it. Like when Avengers: Endgame came out they race to tell the others about who died, or when the latest Game of Thrones/Walking Dead came out. 

Here's the thing, they seem to enjoy spoilers. Like when &gt;!Rick ""died""!&lt; on TWD or &gt;!Jon killed Dany!&lt; in GoT, they just sort of gasp in disbelief but eventually believed it and move along. Sometimes they even ask for more details and would talk about it. They still watch them.

I however hate spoilers because it basically ruins the point of watching/playing for me. If I tell them please not to give spoilers to me they would just tease me and mercilessly give spoilers. If I go serious they don't think I mean it that much because it's only me who hate it that much. What should I say/do in this situation? Thanks.",19Jun2020,1

787,"Hello. I have no Idea what I should do. My stepmother is making my life here hell! I can't go in a room where she also is in without her looking at me mad, jealous etc. 

(Before: I have a big sister, a half brother and a half sister (both younger than me + they are her children) )

She favours my half siblings and pretends to treat us all  the same. Example?
My brother get's 70€ pocket money. He is 14. Also when ever he needs money he gets extra 20€.
I get 50€. And i am 18. I didn't get money when I was under 17. Yes I got pocket money when I turned 17. I always had a job. I helped my sister delivering newspapers when I was 10. After I became 13 I had my own area. When I turned 15 I became a waitress (I still work there).

He gets everything. He throws a tantrum and then he gets stuff he wants. (Mobile phones, Wii Switch, TV, expensive clothes, etc.)

I once said ""those tomatos aren't really fresh anymore"" (they were still okay and I literally ate them while saying this). She became mad and told me I was spoiled. Meanwhile her son doesn't eat any vegetables or healthy foods!?!?! But that's okay and not spoiled.
She never belived my sister when she said she has depression and said: ""She just doesn't want to clean her room!"" Even doctors confirmed her depression but still she said my sister is pretending. Then after a year she started saying she was also depressed and had a burn out and her feelings are hurt.

She broke up with my dad to fuck another guy and came back when this guy said she was just an affair. My dad and her were seperated for 6 months and then lived seperated for another 6 months). I said I would move out if she comes back in. (I was 16 later 17) Eventually she moved back in. 

She and my father planned it as a test to see how things were going well. I didn't want it but said okay cause it was a test but... She cancelled the contract of her flat so she had to stay. (My dad was against this but she did it)

I had to remove my concealer &amp; mascara from the bathroom because: ""I am the woman in this household."" then she told me her friend also has stepchildren and they aren't allowed to have make up in the bathroom. I asked how old they were and she said ""13&amp;15"". My brother than said: ""Mom. Don't lie. They are 9 and 12.""

But well then she said: ""there is not enough space!""
There was. Eventually I removed my make up.

Anyways. Now I bought some food because it was late and we had nothing here. (She and my dad slept the whole day) When I came back I put it in the kitchen and she saw it cause she was awake. I went into my room and after 10 minutes I came back to the kitchen and what did she do?

Cook it? NOPE!

She put it in the cupboard and started making pancakes with my little sister.

I fucking hate it here! My dad isn't doing anything to defend me and I don't have enough money to move away!

788,"Hello! Hope everyone is well. This is my first post here and I am looking for advice on something that has been happening at work over a span of a few weeks. Also I’m on mobile so be aware of that. 


So I (23 F) work at a deli that is individually owned. We have multiple vendors and lately one of them has made me feel really uneasy with his comments. It is my job to check in the vendors and pay them which includes going over the invoice with them and making sure all the merchandise is there and accounted. This particular vendor is a large one so it can take about 10 minutes to make sure everything is there. We’ll call this vendor Steven for clarity sake, and if important, he seems to be in his mid 30s. 

-This started a few weeks ago with what seemed like very harmless flirting on his end. We were making small talk and he asks me “So does your boyfriend work as much as you do?” I clued in to the fact that he was hitting on me and told him that my boyfriend does  construction. The conversation dropped off.

-After that, the next week, when he greeted me, he lowered his voice into a husky whisper and make a joke that that was his “sexy voice” and started laughing about it. I gave a small laugh to be nice and so he has greeted me like that every time since then. My fault there. 

- When I check him in, I usually am standing in front of him and the merchandise so I can see everything. We were backwards once so I asked him to switch sides and he commented “Oh you like it from the front huh?” and then winked at me. I didn’t respond back and let his joke fall flat. 


-Today I was walking in front of him on the way to check him in and he comments “Oh you’re wearing jeans today. They look really good on you” Again I didn’t respond back. 


He has also made many comments about me being a very pretty girl. 

It makes uncomfortable to check him in sometimes and I don’t know if i’m blowing it out of proportion but I do really dread what he’s gonna comment on next. 

I have told my boss but she is an old fashioned italian lady and she thinks men will be men.


Am I being sexually harassed and what should I do about it? I don’t feel like there much since my boss doesn’t see it as a big deal.",19Jun2020,2
789,"I live in California and my best friend moved to Nevada a few years ago. We’ve been in touch ever since, playing video games, making music, etc... We were planning on his dad picking me up this Saturday (6/20/20). He stopped talking to me Tuesday night and I didn’t think much of it. After a full day of no contact I started to get worried that something terrible happened. My worries were unfortunately proven to be correct Thursday morning. I got a text from his contact, it was his dad. The text basically said that he got in a really bad accident and nearly lost his arm. He has since been through over 15 hours of surgery to reattach his arm. He has since recorded a video saying that he in fact had lost an arm but the doctors managed to save it. I am in disbelief. He is the closest thing to a brother that I have. I want to help but I can’t seem to do anything.

(these stories won't all be in the order that they happened but it shouldn't matter)

my father (and possibly mother) has been smoking pot inside the house (my house is basically a hotbox) with no windows open (to my knowledge) neither of my parents knows I know about the weed, I am a minor in Canada and from what I've read you can't smoke pot in an establishment where children also reside.

(this one's a little blurry) my grandfather's birthday wasn't long ago he's dead (please don't say ""I'm sorry for your loss"" or anything like that) so we got ice cream, my dad had been singing or something so I told him to stop because it pissed me off because he tells my mom to stop singing in the car because she ""sounds awful"" he sounds much worse, while I was scooping ice cream he bumped my arm (I'm autistic with an amount of touch aversion, and I have adhd) and I asked him if he could move (I probably used a pissy tone) he grabbed me by my shoulders and either pushed or sort-of lifted me then pushed me out of the kitchen (order of events in this next bit are blurry but I know each of these things happened in my room) so I went upstairs without putting down the scoop, and he came and barged into my room not long after and asked why I thought I could talk to him like that, I didn't answer I was thinking, then he barged in (as in entered) and asked again so I asked him why he thought it was ok to be abusive, I don't remember what he said but he didn't answer then he asked me why I was being a bitch when I got to have ice cream (I'd barely touched my ice cream) and that it was I treat, then I asked him if he'd rather for me to throw it out, then he got up grabbed my ice cream and threw it at the wall told me to clean it up then left. while I was alone I decided to hide in my bench (it has a large compartment) with my computer.

791,"I (21f) live with my mom but have a room at my dad’s house. My dad, his wife, and her son - Jake (mid 20’s) live there. My bedroom is upstairs, Jake’s bedroom is upstairs and we have a bathroom up there. 

I used to live with my dad, he met his wife, they got a house together, so I moved in with my mom - but all my stuff that was at my Dad’s (besides clothes) is at my dad’s new house. I visit from time to time but don’t sleep there usually. 

So my dad mentioned a few weeks ago that Jake met a girl on his last vacation out of state and that she was coming to visit. Didn’t think much of it assuming she was just in town or would be getting a hotel, or maybe staying in Jake’s room. We didn’t discuss it other than him mentioning her visit. No one has met her besides Jake, nor did anyone know anything about her. 

I was surprised today when my sister texted me (she found out from her husband - my dad told him) that apparently this girl has been staying in my room for the past week. When Jake and this girl stopped to get dinner, my dad went upstairs to vacuum and walked into a mess. Food everywhere, alcohol bottles, grass and dirt on the floor, towels used and wet on the carpet. From what she said it was a mess - charcoal from the bonfire wiped onto towels and stained onto my mattress. 

Although mad about not knowing what of my stuff is ruined - I’m very uncomfortable that this stranger was allowed to stay in my room, with my belongings, and some special heirlooms that have been passed down from my mom’s family. I’m upset that I was never told an absolute stranger would be in my room so if there was something I needed or wanted to protect, I could do so. I feel like my privacy has been invaded (I have stuff in my nightstand and some clothes/underwear in my drawers - I don’t know if she’s looked through it) and I want to go get my special things that I would be sick if they were stolen or destroyed, but I don’t know how to say it without breaking the promise to my sister that I wouldn’t tell my dad she told me. 

Apparently my dad confronted them after they came home &amp; said he was paying to get the room professionally cleaned (so it must be bad). And whatever is still there by Saturday will be thrown out.

What should I do? Tell him I’m upset I was never told, or pop by and say I need something from my room and just grab what I need (which might be hard if she’s in there at the time)?",19Jun2020,2

I asked her if it was that guy she quickly declined saying it’s not that or my fault rather it was herself. Her reasoning was she isn’t happy with herself and needs to learn to love herself as  in her words “she doesn’t believe she can love me the way I deserve when she feels so numb”

I typically help her around it by doing things like cutting grass, checking mail, and making sure the renovation goes smoothly while she's in New York (Can't come due to Corona). 

**Pros**: I'd be living there rent free.

It has internet/wifi 

I'd have my own room. 

**Cons**: 

I'd have no privacy since there's a ring doorbell that looks at everything on the outside. I'd feel weird bringing girls to grandma's house if I wanted to...

My whole family would know where I'm at (and they can be a bit controlling at times). 

The kitchen isn't done yet (early stages of renovation), and I feel a bit gross cooking in it due to this. 

My mom's house is tiring to live in because she's a bit narcissistic and controlling. She expects everything to be dropped for her regardless of what you're doing, and she throws a fit whenever you don't (or she'd threaten to take something/not do something for you).

For the longest time I was sad and lonely seeing everyone have fun with eachother while I sat behind my phone screen alone, just looking at everyone be happy, hanging out together. I started becoming obsessed with searching every single question I had. “Why am I lonely, why am I always sad. Why does this happen and how does this affect it. Etc.” I ended up graduating high school and going to college for psych. (Currently still going) The more I learned the more everything made sense. Anyways, I ended up dating a guy who was a real introvert. He was a very stable, peaceful person. His interaction with friends was online, he played video games, and watched videos, read books and pretty much spent this time online. I started trying to do the same.. hmm.. Spent my time doing reasearch, watching videos, playing my Nintendo switch. I got opportunities for real life friendships and for some reason.. it only lasts so long until I want to go home. The entire time I think of how cool it would feel to be in my own bed being away. How I’m not satisfied enough to want to spend the time there. I think about 1000 more questions and articles I want to search. I can’t live outside my head. I know I’ve had crazy levels of anxiety my whole life, But I just don’t know if what I feel is anxiety or actual introversion.. I know I dream of having friends who I want to spend time with and going to social gatherings. But I don’t get enough satisfaction from friends anymore. I feel like I can’t be myself and I feel like I can’t understand people either. Maybe I’m socially awkward, maybe it’s the anxiety or even isolation.

I act very strange almost involuntarily sometimes and I am looking for an explanation. 

I noticed I have a problem articulating. Even if I know what I want to say I will often say just the important words and mumble in between them. (Though its easier for me to type online, I even take a long time wording things.)

A lot of times my thoughts get so disorganized that I say a long uhhhh mid sentence then ask a really basic question as a cop out. And the person will look at me wierd. I often feel drowsy/in a daze when this happens. 

I also laugh uncontrollably/silently a lot at really abstract things, even in public. 
Its also very hard for me to follow directions that have more than 2 steps. I am 22 and cannot drive or do algebra because of this.

Young guy here just curious and hoping the good people of this world can just give me their two cents.

I’ve been dating this girl (25F) for a month now and she’s started to tell me about the guys she’s dated. One story she told me she travelled to another state during college to be with a guy and she told me he will be in town soon. 

Another time she said that she was quite desperate for another man which she sounded ashamed of. She said she would go to the restaurant he worked at right by her place and they’d just kiss when he saw her, but he never asked her out and that the one time he invited her over for dinner he was wasted and told her his dick is basically huge. 

Now I’ve not been bothered by this because hey she’s dating me and we have a great time every time and we talk for a long time when we see each other or over FaceTime.

For example, about 6 months ago this kid quietly took this pic of me looking through my crush's Insta, and it spread to a lot of people. Everyone laughed at me for about a week or so before forgetting about it. In the moment, I was obviously pretty embarrassed, but for some reason I never really gave it much thought or care any time before this all went down. It was only after school closed that I looked back on what happened, and felt so angry. 

I contacted the kid who did that and asked him why he did that. I get that I should've been wiser, and realized that looking at a girl's Insta like that in a public space wasn't really smart, when just about anyone, not just that kid, could've taken that pic. 

He told me it was just a funny meme that has long been dead. I told him my side of the story, and how I kept thinking about it after school closed, and how I really didn't like what he did. We had about 8 conversations about this. After realizing how much I was dwelling on it, he said he was sorry for what happened, and admitted that what he did was stupid and immature, and promise not to do something like this again. He told me that when he took that pic, all he saw was just nothing more than a funny picture. He wasn't thinking about my feelings or how I was going to feel about it the next summer. He said he wasn't thinking in the near future. He now understands what he did was wrong, and promised not to do anything like that again after hearing my side of the story. I get that laughing at people is fun (I've been guilty of that myself), but being the one getting laughed at isn't as enjoyable. Bottom line, I stood up for myself, and I told him how I felt and how I didn't appreciate what went down. 

But still, even after everything was said and done, I still feel like a victim. What bothers me is the fact that I was a clown among all those kids, because no one respects the clown or takes the clown seriously. I constantly ruminate over my past, and feel like a victim even now, and that because of that victim label I put on myself, I will never achieve anything great or noteworthy in my life, no matter how hard I work. Because in my mind, victims never amount to much and will never get anywhere in life. I have weekly therapy sessions, so I'll definitely bring this up with him to get his take on this. But yeah, what should I do?",19Jun2020,1
811,"So basically I sold a table on Facebook marketplace. The buyer came to pick up the table and loaded it onto their car. After about an hour, they texted me saying they don’t want the table for the price I sold it.

When I was younger I was that girl that would yell in school have a loud mouth and did whatever and said  not caring of others opinions and was just myself carelessly and I was pretty confident. Now I'm 19 I have a son and another baby on the way I had to grow up super quick and I'm definitely not the same person. While growing into a more mature version of myself I learned to just keep my mouth shut rather than start anything or voice my opinion loudly like before. Which is a good thing and bad thing now...

I just got moved up to a manager at work and I'm obviously young so I work with other young people in fast food. I know it's not a big deal to many but I love my job and I really care about getting the job done and correctly. The same co-workers of mine that are around my age don't view me as someone above them. I'm only 5ft also so I don't really fit the profile of someone in ""charge"". Today at work I realized they didn't care I was there and goofed off rather than work. One boy even started taking over MY duty's and told me it would be good if I swept the floor.🤦 

I'm realised in life as I grew older I somehow became a people pleaser. Not saying what I wanted so I didn't upset people. Doing a task myself rather than telling someone to do it like they should. I hate feeling this way. I feel weak and not confident. I don't want to be a bossy bitch to people but I do want them to respect what I ask and take me more seriously. 

How do I become a more confident person to voice my opinion to my coworkers and give them directions? I know I will get attitude from a lot especially the girls so how do I handle this? I need to grow into a stronger person who will stand their ground like before so I'm just asking for guidance. Thanks for all who takes time to comment advice",19Jun2020,1

815,"I'm a 25F and I'm really not sure what to do here. When I was a bit younger and in college I was really comfortable with dating mostly because I didn't mind moving really fast or even just having one night stands. 

Everything is different now. Now if I don't know you, I don't even want to hold hands. I'm fine with being this way, and I think it's a sign (for me personally anyways) of becoming more mature and also being more interested in quality then quantity. 

I'm actually bisexual and dating girls goes really well. But with men I'm at the end of my rope here! No matter what I do, they seem to always want to push me past my limits or push past my communication. Even the ones who say they respect whatever I want, will not stop trying to at least get a kiss or something on the first date even if I communicate that it's not going to happen. And it's not like this is just a few men, this is most of them!! I've been dating a lot since I'm young and it's always the same. 

I really dont want to stereotype all men, but at this point I pretty much just turn them down no matter what even I think they're cute. Most of them try to wife me up in the first five seconds, wanting to hang out all the time or ""spoil me"" or cuddle after knowing me for a day. It's smothering. 

I'm having a hard time having male friends also, even though I really like having guy friends, because they seem to always want more even when I make it clear what my boundaries are.

827,"I am a female in my early 20s, i am considered to be very attractive because i am tall and some people told me i should do modelling. But i also suspect i hace mild aspergers based on my ability to make friends and understand non verbal communication. I have really struggled to make friends in my home country when i was younger and i was never a girly girl or a party person. Also, all of my family members have done maths all their lives and i guess that contributed to the way i was raised.

 This got a little easier when i went abroad and i managed to get a friend group though i feel like people in it find it a lot easier to socialize and party. All of my introverted and extraverted friends have had several relationships(or at least 1) over the past years but i never understood how they do it. Before i was 19 i didn't even understand why i should put an effort to find a partner but i feel like now i start to fully understand what i was missing out on. I didn't even desire to have sex. 

My problem is that i don't match people's expectations of me based on my experience. I know that i will get told that i don't have to match their expectations, but first impressions do mean a lot and i can't help it.

Guys that i know(in the same group) all think i am attractive but i never felt attracted to any of them enough to want to be in a relationship. Sometimes i have no idea if men are trying to be friends with me to sleep with me. This has happened before. Even now whenever i start talking to them i am never sure what they have in mind. I feel like people in general don't understand what i have to deal with in tearms of social difficulties and they automatically give me qualities that i don't have. And it's nor their fault - people's brain is wired to select pretty females and see them as better than they really are. 
So far i have noticed that guys could openly ask me why i am so quiet, why don't i show my skills more and stuff like that. They would never ask an average looking girl those questions. Why am i not allowed to be introverted?? It feels like because i am pretty people assume they are allowed to come up to me and point out what i can change and what they don't like. It feels acceptable for them to discuss my flaws, even though everyone has them; when you are attractive they are more visible. 
At this point i feel like i have no chance of finding a partner. So far guys have either been really surprised by me, intimidated by me, hated me for not following up to their expectations or were obsessed with me.

828,"Okay - so I just want to get stuff out in the open as all this time in furlough has me dwelling in the past and how to move forward. Right now I feel like every day is a battle with my own thoughts and terrible memories. 

For a bit of background - I came from a bit of a broken home. Had an extremely violent alcoholic dad who passed away in my early 20's. I'm 30 now. However, I still made life work for me, I had good mates in school and a long term boyfriend. Things again went a bit crazy at home after my dad moved out - my mum had a breakdown and chaos ensued and I got kicked out at 19 and my sister at 17. 

Ended up moving away and working minimum wage jobs for a really long time -which I enjoyed at first but after 6 years of that I went back to college. I ended up doing quite well in that subject and got accepted into all the best Universities in my country (at second and third year entry). 

I accepted the wrong one - I did this thinking the University was prestigious and was ridiculously hard to get into, therefore the course would be good.

It ended up being two of the worst years of my life - everyone there came from money and I ended up being the token poor girl. I stuck out like a sore thumb and was extremely loney. However I knew this would be my only chance to get the degree so I stuck it out for my bachelors. Two years - sometimes I woke up with tears in my eyes because I was so alone. I also met a guy who routinely cheated on me and with no support network I basically went insane and developed a social anxiety I've been dealing with since. Also the course was terrible so don't let appearances fool you.

Three years on from then I work a job in my subject but the pay is terrible and I'm left with the mental scars I feel like I will never recover from. I know a girl who was accepted into one of the Universities I turned down and all the work was incredible from that year. It's the biggest regret I've ever had.

About my mom and my brother, how i was suspicious that they were involved in some kind of relationship. An intimate relationship or whatever, i don't even know how to describe it. I just passed it off as my imagination. But i was right about them. I caught them in the act. They didn't notice me or anything, i saw them and bolted away.

What happened? Well, i had been staying with mom for about a week. My brother has been getting pretty mad at me, he'd constantly ask me when i was going home, but mom told him to leave me alone and that i could stay as long as i want. But last night, i caught them. I don't want to get graphic or anything, but in the middle of the night. They were hugging in the hallway, then he was literally kissing her on the neck, they went in her room and he shut the door. I couldn't believe it. I remember actually trying to excuse it, like maybe they were just hugging. But i kinda looked through her keyhole and saw them. Engaged in the act. No mistaking it. I almost threw up in the trash can when i saw it. I couldn't go back to sleep or anything.

This morning, i hastily made my leave. I told them i had to go back because of school. I lied, but i had to clear my head. What now? What do i do? Do i talk to them about what i saw? Ignore it? What? I'm still pretty freaked out. I don't know what to do at all.",19Jun2020,5

834,"Hey guys,

So I've been trying to get my life on track which involved speaking to a therapist. I've known him for a while but only had one meeting with him so far, and it seemed like he may be able to help me. However I started to have really lowkey feelings of attraction to him smh. I think it has to do with the fact that he just listened to me and told me kind advice. He is also kind of close in age to me so that doesn't help but also makes me feel like I can relate to him as opposed to someone who is older. However this has happened to me when I spoke with an older therapist in the past.

He is also married so obviously it is completely off the table. Since trying to get my life on track, I have completely put relationships on the back burner entirely so probably my loneliness doesn't help. I thought maybe I should try to find a new boyfriend so that I won't fall in love with random people but atm there doesn't seem to be many options just because of my circumstances and I don't think I am ready for it.

I obviously have zero intention on acting on it but it saddens me that the thoughts are lowkey there. I don't want to be like subconsciously trying to make him attracted to me because I had the tendency to do that to people in the past. Even if the other party doesn't realize it I still have evil intentions and I don't want to.

I am totally willing to break off the relationship but I appreciate his advice and found it helpful and hes less scary than some of the other people I could approach for help. I think as soon as i resolve my main issue I will probably try to avoid him. I want to not have any evil intentions in my heart :(

I also thought of speaking with a different therapist but I feel like they won't get me. Maybe I subconsciously only want to talk to this one idk I can't really tell what my intentions are. 

To make it clear I 100% have zero intentions of acting on anything because I've already messed up my life a couple times and the whole point of me talking to someone is to put in the work to fix myself. I just don't want to have these disturbing thoughts and intentions.

I tend to basically develop feelings for any guy that is nice to me which is kind of sad. I wish I could just meet ""the one"" who won't take advantage of my feelings and that way I can only focus on him.

840,"Repost because I'm still unsure of what to do and got no advice.

Please don't say anything about me being a simp. That was old behavior.

I'm gonna put the tl;dr up here.
Screwed up a friendship, drama happened, friends changed dramatically and that lead to many arguments and friends being lost.

Now what I want advice on is on how to cope with these feelings, which I will explain later.

First, some context. (I don't want to hear stuff about meeting people online. You can meet some very genuine and nice people online.) I'll keep try this as short as I can, but basically I met a girl on discord, who I simped for. (Don't attack me please.) I'm also friends with a few of her friends. There are about 3 of our mutual friends involved and 1 of their friends (I am not friends with this last one.) My simping continued after the girl I met got into a relationship. (Stupid, I know. I had a disorder called Obsessive Love Disorder. You can search it up.) 

Eventually, I was confronted by 2 of our friends and I stopped some of my behavior. It lingered slightly, and I was confronted again, by everyone mentioned previously this time. It was a lot of telling me what not to do and stuff. So, I stop contact with said friend because that's what I was told to do. In the discord server, I was previously a staff member but was booted and replaced by their friend who I was not friends with. (I don't do posts like this often so sorry if it gets confusing. You can ask for clarification.) In the server, we had previously changed our nicknames to Sailor Moon stuff. For example, mine was ""Sailor Sol."" This time, they added something afterwards, such as ""Sailor Sol: The Speed."" 

Apparently the friend I was previously simping for had done this again, however I saw some of my other friends doing it and joined in. I was accused of doing this to get her attention and was admin-abused by the person who replaced me in staff, who was constantly changing my nickname to ""Stop copying,"" even though he himself copied the nickname and despite me having stopped my behavior and cutting off contact. (He does this again afterwards, when the owners put ""issa"" in the beginning of their nicknames and he does the same. I don't know what the joke was but he was copying them.) He also has broken the rules several times when I searched his messages (racial slurs, disrespect, etc). An argument ensues because of his abuse and eventually, the friends who were against me start turning against this person.

Fast forward a few days. The people who confronted me were my friends now, but the girl I simped for and her friend were getting into arguments with them. The guy told one of them to kill themselves and the girl was acting overall toxic, calling them insults and even banning them from her servers. The point is that now, they're gone from our servers and we all (besides her ex-girlfriend) hate her. 

I'm conflicted between hating her and wanting her to come back. I believe that her new behavior is due to her friend's bad influence. Part of me wants to give her a second chance, hoping she'll realize her mistake and come back. Yet there's still a lingering part of me that's wants her to suffer. I want to yell at her and attack her (not physically) but I need to hold myself back for the sake of not causing drama and for my friend who is still on good terms with her. I'm very confused on what I should do and how I should feel.",19Jun2020,1
841,"Okay so I'm panicking really badly, so my girlfriend has been diagnosed with depression for about a month or so and has been probably suffering with it for a couple years. I thought she was good at dealing with it, she's never needed therapy or pills or anything and she's pretty good at handling it but this is fucking bad.

Sso her parents told her she was ""a bad daughter"" because she got a lower mark in art than usual (she tried her best) despite the fact she did well in every other subject (she goes to a grammar school)

Her parents have known to be semi-abusive in the past (leaving her to eat nothing but bread for a month turning her anorexic for a while, leaving her outside, hitting her for anything, cussing her out, being homophobic, ect) but I can't deal with this anymore.

She self harmed. She hasn't done it in years and she just relapsed which means something very fucking bad is happening.

I'm practically spamming her trying to make her okay and I'm begging her to call the police. I really don't know if I should do it for her as I've never had to call the police before.

This is really stressful. Somebody please help. Please fucking help this is serious, help. She keeps taking breaks from reading my messages and when she finally replies its something really short.

She's not okay. Please help. Somebody help me, what do I do. Please. Please. Does somebody know what to do. She's called childline and abuse services in the past but they've just dismissed it. Please please please please please.

842,"My family cares for stray cats, and they sometimes like to bring us “presents.” Well, earlier today, there was a bird going absolutely bonkers next to our porch. I went outside expecting a dead bird, but found a live non-injured (no blood, no broken wing) fledgling hiding behind a pipe. I picked it up and tried to put it back in the tree its mother was in. The cats were already interested in the bird and started climbing the tree. I didn’t know what to do except to take the baby into the woods a few hundred feet behind our house. The cats were distracted easily by some food I put out, but I’m worried that the fledgling might have been too far from it’s mother. 

Should I have left the fledgling in my yard, should I have taken him inside away from his mother, or did I do the right thing by putting him in a bush further from the cats? I don’t usually get the chance to save birds, but I figured handling him too much was a bad move.

843,"Throwaway since i dont want the people chatting me to know about this.

I recently joined with another account on r/depression, seeking help where it is due, but i usually find myself trying to help people most of the time i’m on that sub.

Ive done this for a couple of days, and it’s been nice for the most part, i help people vent, give them advice (but not too much since i know my boundaries and i fear that i might worsen their feelings if i dive too deep), and in return i get a feeling of happiness after that. 

Recently, all i have been doing at night is just looking at that sub and trying to help as much people as i can, and all i think about is that sub. 

Every time i turn off my phone and try to sleep, there’s an overwhelming feeling of guilt that covers me like an uncomfortable blanket, I feel obligated to spend most of my time trying to help people on that sub and ignoring my family and ignoring my starvation and basic needs.

What should i do? I want to stop but everytime i click off that sub, i feel something’s wrong with me.

844,"I'm (16f) on a diet, I had a formal visit today and they kept shoving a huge piece of cake to me although I told them repeatedly that I'm on a diet.

I whispered to my mom if it would be polite to just leave it, but she told me to eat it all because they gave it to me and they would have to find something else to give me if I didn't take it.

Eventually, I ended up eating it without enjoying it's taste in the least and throwing it up as soon as I went home.

847,"Just graduated from college, got a pretty good paying job. To give some context, I'm from a small town, my parents are working hard to put me in college and also borrow some money. But my college tuition fees are paid by my aunt. I'm fully aware that they sacrifice a lot for me and I'm grateful for them. My little brother are going to the same college I went to, pretty expensive and he take the same route as me in which my aunt are going to pay the tuition fees. 

I have mixed feelings of my college though. Due to being poor af to the point I have to scavenge coins around my room to make for a dinner and depressed, having suicide thoughts because I'm not able to participate in a lot of social activities and I do believe that I missed a lot of opportunities due to that. All I do in weekends are learning and learning, even I didn't get into any sort of relationship because my self esteem is so damn low. Despite of the shit I went through, fortunately it doesn't break me too much. I'm still feeling depressed from time to time, but it isn't as bad as my college days. And since I got a job, I'm noticeably happier in every way, and a lot of my friends noticed that.

My parents asked me to 'sacrifice' a bit by turning in money I had left for the month, even they calculate how much money I'd left in a month (they know my salary and my living cost). I said that I could send like 20% of my salary to them, to help with my little brother's tuition fee and monthly allowance for my parents. Apparently they aren't too happy with that, they want literally EVERY CENT that I've left in the month. I refused by saying that I want to manage my own money, all I can do is that 20% salary of mine. I wanted to keep some of it by investing and emergency fund, also I got list of things that I really want. And they said they will give back my money if I have anything urgent, but tbh I don't like the idea at all. I want to have complete freedom over my hard earned money. And after I tell them that, they're angry and haven't replied to my chat lol. We had a lot of arguments like this, all about money. I'm so annoyed with arguments like this to the point that I'm not really feeling anything anymore, not even too angry about this.

I understand that I need to take responsibility of my little brother and my parent's debt. I really do, but all I can do know is allocate a bit of my salary (and hopefully in the future I get raise and promotion so I can contribute more). Also I want to not live miserably, I want to explore so many things and of course, they costs money. My college years are 4 miserable years, I want to make up for that by doing things I really want to as I have the financial capability to do so.

i'm a teenage girl who loves video games but seeing so many girl characters with perfect bodies all being light skinned with no unique design at all makes me so upset. They're constantly so sexualized with bikini skins or skin tight armor it just bothers me way more than it should. And there's the whole lack of diversity thing that just makes me upset in a whole different way. 

i.e. in original character designs, a character was suppose to be a black man but in final development was turned into a white woman because it was more marketable. stuff like that

So the sum it up: I need advice on how to get over this and just play the damn game and enjoy it for what it is and not focus on this stuff. It's messing with my head and making my relationship with my bf strained. I'm overreacting and need advice on how to let it go

My views, mainly on sex are unpopular and if I express them people will hate me. Even now I sure someone in the comments is just ready to pick up a pitchfork.

I wont go into the details because if there's anything I learned it's that people don't care, they hate me for it and any detail or just looking for more fuel to add to the fire. Basically I'm a very sexually reserved virgin and I want a serious relationship with a girl who's a virgin too.

This seems to upset people, especially online quite a lot and to top it off I live in a very liberal area. People will tell me that I cant just reject a girl based of her past, that I'll never find a girl who's a virgin, that they don't exist past 12 years old, that I'm a misogynist, that I'm going to die alone, etc...

Regardless, it's too important to be and I can't deal with the emotions of a girl I'm with having been with other guys. And yes I've gone to therapists and psychiatrists before one of you pulls that one. Contrary to popular belief online they don't actually help with that. All of them told me to just find a girl who's a virgin but then people get furious when you want that.

So I (20M) have a pretty good friend I've had a crush on and been trying to get with for a while(19F) and she knows it. I have a bit of drinking problem and I've told her. About a week ago we were talking on snapchat and she sends me a snap of her driving somewhere so I ask where. She says a friends house the friend has had a rough day and she needs support (so going to a female friends house) then a few hours later she sends me a snap in bed with a dude. I get pissed and we get into an argument with ends with her saying sorry and she loves me. Then a few days later she posts a dude on her story and says she's in a relationship with him. I get pissed again and just drop her. Then last night she calls me about 11pm and says she's on her way to mouse shell be here in about 10 mins (we live about an hour and a half apart) she shows up im already drunk she gets drunk takes her cloths off and starts grinding on me. Me expecting to get some fuq do the foreplay as u do and eat her out. Pretty sure she had an orgasm then she says her stomach is upset and she goes to sleep. I pass out and wake up and get pissed again because I didn't get any but she did. I felt like she used me. I decide to step outside because I needed some fresh air and I needed a cigarette to calm down. I turn around to see her headlights as she's leaving. She shows up smokes my cigarettes drinks my whiskey eats my food gets eaten out doesn't give me anything and leaves in the middle of the night. I've talked to her since then (she doesn't even seem to care she cheated on her bf she's been with for like a week) and she says she was scared because I was stumbling around but I was drunk she drank with me so i don't think that makes sense. I was still super pissed the next day so I decided to go hang out with a few close friends from high school (both 20M) and tell them the story and they laugh their asses off at me calling me a simp and just won't stop giving me hell about the whole situation. My friends are usually very supportive when im down but in this situation the just drove the stake.. so where im at is I really like this girl but it seems like she's doing everything she can to piss me off and use me and its working. I've had a really rough year lost allot of people that were important to me. currently unemployed because of corona and I feel like I'm losing a really close friend, really the last female friend I have. I dont wanna be a simp but I don't want to lose that feminine touch. What should I do? Or just post a comment and talk with me about it.

853,"This is an alt account becuase my irl freinds follow my regular user.

My whole life everyone around me called me ""the smart one"" and my parents always had high expectations for me in that regard. I even skipped a grade which further played into my personal belief that I was intellegent. And overall my early childhood was pretty great. 

In the 8th grade I had my first experiences with my laziness. I just wouldn't do work when I didn't feel intrested in it. I would have near perfect scores in everything except math simply becuase I wouldn't do it if I didn't feel like it. 

This problem worsened in 9th grade onwards as I slowly stopped caring and my grades went out the window. This never truly affected me until early 11th grade I found out I was to be held back a year. That gutted me, but it was okay becuase I was able to graduate on time with my freinds if I did this credit recovery program. So all was supposed to be ok. 

Then halfway through the year COVID stuff hit and suddenly I couldn't complete the makeup work becuase the teacher responsible for refreshing those assignments didn't do so. And then even with that I dropped out of an AP chem course so I needed to take summer school to make up a science credit. 

So when we spoke with the councilor to see what I needed to do suddenly I had to take summer school for upwards of 4 classes. Which I was ready to do in an attempt to graduate on time. But the councilor never got back to us in time and now it's too late for me to take any of them. And I have no choice but to spend an extra year at highschool. 

I'm not stupid. I know I'm not. I feel such an overwhelming self hatred towards myself. All my freinds will graduate like normal people May of 2021. And I'll be left behind like a sad stupid goblin in a pit of my own mistakes.

857,"I'm talking a summer class in order for me to graduate on time. During the summer while I'm taking classes I have two things I need to do this month, one of those things being filling out a insurance check. I know I have procrastination issues, and sometimes I have a habit of putting things off until the last minute. While my mom is tell me about why writing checks are important, why we chose the insurance we picked out, and going on a 15 mins tangent I feel like she's talking to me like a little kid who doesn't know anything about insurance or checks. Then my mom starts going off about how I shouldn't be procrastinating on the check and getting frustrated by my lack of communication as she's going on her tangent that she starts to say something like you're act like a retard, or you're being like a retard. Furious I tell her that's really rude and as usual she starts making excuses saying she was frustrated, didn't like that I procrastinated, I said like a retard I didn't call you a retard, and Ididn't properly write the correct date. She finally apologizes but I don't feel her apology was sincere. She was still yelling, and adding in other excuses to justify her anger. I know my mom is Japanese and  English is not my mom's first language but she's fluent in English enough to know that she's being rude. I usually can brush rude comments off but when my mom says them I start crying and my anxiety goes up.

  Finally,  My dad comes in and tries to stop the yelling. He tells me that I shouldn't bug my mom about the retard comment since she apologized. I was allowed to keep bugging my mom about it if she failed to apologize. 90% of the time my mom is a great mom telling me she loves me (something a lot of  Asian parents don't always express) praises my academic accomplishments and motivates me to do my best but when she gets really really anger she blurts out whatever she feels, and makes excuses for her behavior.

861,"Ok so I've never done this before and all that but the gist of it is I have two friends, let's call them L and A. The three of us became super close around 4 years ago during school, mostly because everyone else sort of sucked, and all three of us clicked and we've been super close ever since. Picture the perfect trio essentially. The problem starts when it comes to, well I guess ideologies.

L is your typical liberal feminist in a way. She'll spend all day fighting misogynists on social media and in real life, she (correctly) believes that everyone is equal and there can be no judgement based on anything other than personality. Well A believes the same things but she's a science sort of person who likes debating about random topics just because she can. Here the problem arises. 

We talk a lot about social issues and L and A always end up sort of arguing over an issue they both agree with. To give an example let me tell you about what happend right now which prompted me to come to reddit. L mentioned how she was fighting a paedophiles apologist online who was saying that pedophilia is a sexuality and as long there is consent, it's fine. Obviously this upset L and she came to our group chat to rant and she said that pedophilia is a mental illness or something along those lines, to which A said that yeah well until a couple of decades ago homosexuality was considered a mental illness so who knows if the world keeps progressing as it is we might legalise necrophilia and pedophilia (cause apparently someone in the US is working to legalise necrophilia I dont know, I didnt fact check) 

To this L responded that homosexuality and paedophilia can never be the same on account of pedophilia being you know, pedophilia. Then A brought up Incest to compare it to homosexuality and saying that if she fell in love with her non existent, above 18 brother and he responded in like, would we support them or not. Because it would be a consensual relationship and they'd get sterlized and always use contraception and they deserve to get together just like any gay couple.

Now this obviously pissed of L who just had her sexuality compared to incest and she just stopped responding on the group chat and messaged me privately talking about how A annoyed her and how A, being straight, would never understand her struggle of being a bisexual women in a developing country. L also said how A doesnt think her sexuality is valid cause why else would she relate it to incest, paedophilia and necrophilia. 

Now, I didn't know what to do and offered to talk to A and L stopped me. I want to respect her wishes but also this isnt the first time they've had this kind of argument and they never talk it out and these kind of feelings build up. 

It is also important to note that all three of us are actually pretty close and none of us support pedophilia and we all support the LGBTQ plus community, it's mostly that for the sake of argument A, who works on logic, will always try to argue some insane point (she never does so with anyone else) and it pisses of L who works on morality.

So I guess what I'm saying is should I force them to talk to each other or tell them what the other thinks and says or just let it be? I dont want my two closest friends to fall apart.",19Jun2020,1

My mom has been really agitated with me and always tells me “why do you look so miserable as usual?” It really gets under my skin, I’ve told her countless times about my anxiety and depression.

Ever since then I figured she really doesn’t respect me as much as I thought she did.

I went to the doctors yesterday for a physical exam required by my college. They needed my immunization records, which they told me they didn’t have for whatever reason yesterday. After I get home my mom was pretty pissy about it, saying “you should’ve had them on your phone.” I did, but they needed a physical copy of all of my shots on one page. I told her that and she told me “I told you to print them out.” She never did. She’ll always find a way to make a situation I couldn’t control my fault. 

I was nearly crying after that because I was so irritated and frustrated (I’m not at all close to that “time of the week” either). 

I’ve tried therapy before and my therapist was uncertified. I didn’t know that until she straight up left. She took my moms side on everything too without actually trying to explain why or help me and just gave me mental health homework, physical pages. I did them, but they were never brought up again.

**TL;DR: Friend wants me to help me write them an email that turns down an interview while also using the opportunity to complain that the job listing itself was unfair. I want to advise them against this, since this does not seem like an appropriate time to give feedback to their employer, and will cause needless internal drama.**  


I help my friend often send emails because their first language is not English. My friend applied for a job in their company internally, but planned to decline the interview as a form of protest. My friend believes that the job position was posted as a formality, and in reality it is only for one person in the department (not him). They wanted me to help construct an email that both declines the interview while also offering feedback/complaint that it seems to only be made for one person in the department.

I haven't been in this situation before. Usually when I edit/correct things for this person, it involves spell-checking, grammar, but the content of the email isn't confronting anyone. If my friend sends this email, it will come off as wasting the employer's time, while also appearing to be envious/jealous that the job seems to be written for one specific person. Worse the friend could possibly lose their job since this appears to be them mad and causing needless internal drama. Should I write this email how they want, or do you think that I should tell them that this is not a good idea and refuse?

868,"First off, moving out is something I’ve considered, but seeing as I’m the only person in my household who knows how to clean, I would be leaving my parents to a fate of filth and I love them too much to do that

They don’t expect me to clean or anything, but they just don’t seem to care at all about clutter like I do, so I worry that a few years after I left our house would look 10Xs worse 

Growing up I always just thought the way we lived was normal, everyone in our neighborhood keeps junk in their yard/houses and doesn’t have a problem with it, but it makes me feel so dirty and depressed. As I got older and branched out a little bit, I realized we were the weird ones. I was never encouraged to invite friends over, and I never knew why until then.

As for social class, that literally means nothing to me, but cleanliness is something I value highly and have a hard time respecting people who don’t know how to pick up after themselves. I love my family beyond compare but just because we’re not rich doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be able to be clean, I don’t understand. 

We have a relatively nice house, and with some touch ups and organization it would actually be really nice and normal-looking 

Every time I walk into the living room (my room is a haven of cleanliness so sometimes I forget what it’s like) I just get hit with a wave of hopelessness and sadness beyond compare for how we live

How does my family let junk accumulate and not even care or notice? 

I can spend a whole day cleaning and make our house look nice and then the following day it looks like trash again. One time when my sister was on a trip I cleaned her room and made it spotless, bought her matching furniture and hung up lights and pretty curtains, then within three days of her return you couldn’t even see the nice new stuff under all her clutter. How? I don’t know. She didn’t mean anything by it, she’s very nice and one of my best friends, but how is it so hard to be clean? 

The fact that they don’t respect how hard I work for them sometimes has caused me to stop cleaning entirely, and I’ve told them they’ll have to doing it on their own. I told my mom I’ll no longer clean a mess I don’t make, and she’s finally starting to realize cleaning is important. I will help her of course, but I make sure I’m no longer the one doing all the work

What do I do? I can’t keep living like this because it affects my mood and I’m always depressed and angry because of it. Any time I try to clean their mess now I just end up crying and cursing and giving up because it’s just so much junk

My parents are always depressed too and it makes me so sad, I know for a fact that the condition of our house heavily contributes to it. It’s not like they don’t have enough time to clean, they do. My dad is a teacher and he has whole summers off, and my mom works from home. I want them to be happy but I don’t know how to help them since it’s something they’ll have to work on themselves",19Jun2020,1
869,"I graduate uni in 10 months and will be getting a job in my career (software engineering) at that point, but I am wondering if I should keep my current job until then or find a new one. Unfortunately this question will require some wall of text for context. I will do my best to make it concise and palatable to read.

I have been working in a grocery store for 10 years, I am 26 now. I fell in love with a cashier and I've known her for 9 years there. During those 9 years, I haven't had feelings for anyone else and I've tried incredibly hard to improve myself (with moderate success imo) in order to become the right person for her. I confessed to her for the 3rd time 2 weeks ago and she did not reciprocate my feelings. Now, she is 28 and has also never had any relationship, and this is probably a big part of why I remained attached to her for so long. I somehow felt like eventually we would end up together, because we had so much in common and throughout the years so many people have told me that she and I would make a great couple (and not due to any suggestion by me).

The thing is I have to see her 2-3 times a week and it kills me every time. Every cell in my body is screaming to talk to her like I used to, to make her laugh and smile and tease her until she acts sulky. Even after her rejection, I still like her more than ever before and it's killing me. I have no hatred towards her because I know you can't choose who you're attracted to, but it makes it even harder to move on. Last week as I was buying a bottle of juice at her cash, it had a picture of a smiling flower on the cap, she said ""Hey look it's a smile, for you!"" in her sweet high pitched voice, she was trying to console me. How am I supposed to stop being in love with such a pure, sweet human being?

I'm seriously depressed right now and have a hard  time doing anything productive, and not being able to meet new people because of lockdown isn't helping at all. The thing is, part of me thinks I should quit my job and try to find something else since seeing her is tearing me apart, but part of me feels like right now I am so messed up emotionally that leaving a job that I've had for 10 years would just make my life feel even more destabilized.

I just have no idea how to deal with this situation and I'm terrified. I know it was my fault that I allowed myself to think I could somehow ever have a chance at being in a relationship with my favorite person... but I feel like I've trapped myself in a hole with no escape.",19Jun2020,1
870,"The title say's it all really, but for more context, the group of around 10 of us has slowly been growing apart for the past few years and the only time we all chat to each other would be through out group chat. But recently it's become quiet and unused apart from me and one other guy. So only a few hours ago I left without any explanation or warming, my thought being no point dragging this out any longer than it needs to be.
I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here, or even if this makes any sense to you guy.
I think I just feel this is an end of an era and I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this.

I know this might sound very trivial and childish but for a very long time this group meant the world to me, we've all been though a lot of hard time together. Especially the last two where two friends past away within a year and a half very suddenly, which probably has a lot to do with this.

871,"So background, I have severe depression and externally I've had a somewhat rough life, but objectively my circumstances haven't been too bad. I haven't been put through hell like so many other broken people. Been on different antidepressants for years and in therapy for a decade.

I don't act like it though. I'm a complete emotional wreck. One big reason is because I take everything too personally. Any general criticism, any callout, I take as a vicious attack aimed specifically at me. This got especially bad recently. I started going on about how activism is useless and the world is 100% fucked and there's no hope for anyone at all, then someone tells me to stop whining and go help, even if it's just some community service. I went off the fucking rails and now I have a grudge against this person for telling me to grow a pair and pull my head out my ass.

At least I recognize such a reaction is a problem. But that realization doesn't help, it just makes me feel even more unstable and insane. Especially since I have zero idea how to begin tackling this problem. All I know how to do is bottle in my unwarranted outrage to avoid friction. It's not healthy at all I know but it's either that or snapping at everyone who tells me I'm wrong and driving them away.

tl;dr I take everything as a personal attack and it's making my life way more difficult than it needs to be and I'm sick of it.

872,"I graduated high school this year, a year earlier than my age class. It's a complicated situation, but to put it simply:

* This March (my junior year) I had 5 high school credits (you can get 6 a year) because I was online schooled and just didn't do any of the work
* I enrolled in a competency program so I could graduate on time and not when I'm literally 20 (Pass tests instead of have a certain amount of time spent in class)
* I worked like 10 hours a day on school and passed all my tests in a month (to be fair, they were extremely easy tests)
* It's June and I can be in college in 3 months when I didn't know I could pass high school 3 months ago

To people who have more life experience than I do (AKA pretty much everyone), what should I do? The tests were surprisingly easy and I have a knew-found love of learning. I actually have motivation to push myself, which I've never had before because school has always been too easy. I want to go to college, but with my GPA of 0.7, I don't know if that's plausible. I got a 25 composite score on my ACT in March without schooling for like 3 years, and I've heard that's a pretty decent score.

I have no hobbies (other than reading which I took up last year), no passions, no friends or acquaintances, and no idea what to major in or do for a job. Any advice?

876,"Some background: I am married to my husband who has adopted my daughter as his own. My daughter is only 7, and he has been in her life since she was about 1. She calls him by his name and knows that hes not the biological dad but doesnt know the details. All she knows is thats her dad, even if she doesnt call him to his face dad. We are getting closeish to telling her about her biological father since she is starting to question why she has always called him by his name. But we arent there just yet.

So, her biological ""dad"" has never been in her life. He left me when i was a month into pregnancy. We were teenagers, but he was physically abusive and emotionally abusive. Has attempted to shoot me, strangle me, and throw me in a river. Amongst other things. Im glad he left early. My dad knows about the abuse. He is a meth addict, racist nazi, who has been in and out of prison since 18, now hes going to be in until he is 27. He will get out, mess up, go back. Repeat till death. While he is in prison, he is always talking about being sober and a Christian reading his bible. That was a fucking selling point for my bible thumper father. 

So, for a few years he would write to my parents house since he knew their address and not mine. I always just read em, chuckled, trashed em. It was always about ""our"" daughter and wanting to talk and be in her life etc etc. Well about 2 years ago he was out and called me, i didnt know it was him when i answered. But i had told him she has a father figure, she knows nothing about you, we are happy. Please go away. And he agreed. He actually knew it was for the best and he was off the hook. 

Well I had told my mom this, and she had told my dad. My dad then took it upon his self to write to him, since he ""must be doing better!"" I found out today that hes been writing for MONTHS now, befriending the same absuive guy who, when was banging on our door with a gun, told his pregnant teenage daughter to ""duck down and hide"" so he wouldnt see us. My dads a pussy. And is now friends with him. He is now back to wanting to be in her life thanks to my ignorant father. Hes trying to get pictures again, writing her letters, and trying to get his parents in the picture! 

My mom is the one who told me after knowing for a couple weeks, but she wanted to do the right thing. She is sounding like she agrees with my dad, and they are PRAISING him for ""being sober and Christian"". Even though he is only sober and Christian when he is in prison. 

This is a complete breech of trust. I feel so betrayed. Who becomes friends with a dude who knocked up and abused your daughter? I dont know if i should just stop talking to them altogether. My daughter wouldnt understand why, and would be devastated. But this cant slide. My husband is going to talk to my dad tomorrow. I just really dont know what to do or how to go about this. 

Sorry if this was disorganized wording i have so much going through my head right now.

877,"First post because I didn't really know where else to ask or who to talk to.

Okay so some backstory first;

When I was about 12 my family and I moved to Germany from Serbia. 
I was a pretty social kid before the move and had a good bit of friends (As far as you can call 12yo's shitting around with you friends) but when we moved to Germany I was hindered from making any new friends in school because I didn't speak the language and because Serbia is generally just different from Germany.

3 years pass and I'm in 8th grade still without any friends, sitting around alone during lunch breaks and my daily highlights being an interaction between me and a kid from my class saying ""Haven't seen you in a while"" each time we saw one another for the first time that day.

Eventually I got like 2 or 3 'friends' (which were just kids who didn't have any friends, like me) and managed to, somehow, get a girlfriend in 9th grade.

Me and her got along pretty well at the start but she eventually started getting very jealous when I'd talk to girls, which wasn't really such a big problem since I was an unsocial shit who couldn't talk to girls anyways.
After like a year of dating the jealousy got pretty out of hand and she'd get jealous when I'd talk to male friends or answer questions in class that female teachers asked me. This resulted in me shutting myself completely in during school or whilst outside, since I was scared to talk to other people, now not only because I got unsocial after the move but also because I didn't want to fight with her. 

All of this isn't the point of my post, it's just to showcase why I think I'm dealing with what I'm dealing with.

Skip another couple years and in grade 11 I meet this guy who's new on our school. We get to be pretty good friends and he invites me to hang out with him and his other friend group. Him and these people are literally the only reason I am able to hold conversations with people and I genuenly feel like they are my family and I love them more than anything else on this big blue ball.

The problem that I'm dealing with now, which is also the subject of the post, is that, after being completely drained of all social contact for about 5 years and finally finding friends and spending my last year pretty much daily with them, as soon as I'm alone in my room without anyone to talk to and recieve attention from I immediately go back to my dark place.
I have issues in my life that I don't feel comfortable sharing online and as soon as I'm stripped of my only stimulus, which I have been craving for for 5 years, I feel like a drug addict getting stripped of their heroine and I can't stop thinking about all of that stuff. 

I would really love to know if anyone is feeling the way that I feel, even if they're in other circumstances, and maybe has any tips on how I should deal with being alone because undoubtedly I will have to be alone at some points in my life and I don't want to feel completely empty whenever I am, especially if it's over longer periods of time.

882,"So I’ve never made a post like this, so bear with me as I try to transfer my thoughts correctly.

I received a message from this account on FB and a couple days later received a message from this supposed person asking how I was doing. I understood there was something fishy about this account, but I ignored my gut out of apathetic curiosity with the idea that if it was a like porn bot or something trying to sell me something, I’d sarcastically mess with it or whatever. Anyways the conversation seemed to be holding up, she stated her age and what she did for a living, and I stated mine. Eventually through lewd statements, this person wanted to start a video call in the bathroom, which I stupidly capitulated.
The call starts with the camera (no microphone) and the video shows this girl in her underwear. She then starts wanting to exchange nudes, so I show her my member and she does the same in revealing her body. 

Almost 30 seconds later, her video feed cuts to a recording of mine and then starts messaging threats how I need to listen to her, and if I don’t do what she says she’d distribute the video to my contacts involving my family and friends, and begins posting the list of my friends and family on FB. I asked why when she’s the one that engaged in this in the first place. 
This person continued making threats that then, I noticed, starting cycling back to reused messages of those threats. I deleted the conversation and blocked the incoming messages from text message of this person (my phone number was on FB, which I didn’t know it wasn’t  set to be viewed by only me...)
Now I have already reported this to FB and explaining, in full transparency, of what happened involving that account and am pretty sure I’m not the first or only one this account is doing that to.

The reason I post this here is that I’ve done all I can think to do, but I am still frustrated by my own immature stupidity, and feel genuinely bad that I took part in something so evil and dumb, even if I was the one receiving those threats. I would just like to have others’ perspective and honest take on this mess, and whatever advice anyone can give that I should do, if anything.

She's 19, and 24. She's from the Ukraine (moved here 2 years ag) so there's a bit of a culture difference and lots of miscommunication. We've only been living together for 3 weeks now.

Is it too much to ask for the dishes to be put in the dishwasher when you are done using it? To clear the dinner table (which I rarely use) after you're done and to return dishes to dishwasher?

To separate your recycling and to just be chill about it? If you see the garbage piling up take it out? Do I need to resort to a schedule/turn based chores? I thought it was common sense to take out trash and clean up after yourself to keep the space clean so we don't get fruitflies (summer time oof) When I told her about recycling she responded with, ""Oh, so Canadian""

If you're cleaning your plants in the bathtub... please remove the petals that have fallen? Because it's now clogged the bathtub... and she doesn't do anything about it. Oh, and it looks like she cleaned her shoes in the tub too and left a trail of dirt on the sink and the bathtub is getting grimey &amp; dark... Like, do i really need to plunge the bathtub and remove the dirt for her? Is it cruel to tell her she needs to? I understand I use the tub too, but I'm not the one clogging the drain causing a huge ass puddle whenever we shower... She literally won't do anything about it until I fucking reach in there with my own hands to clear it out.

Her dog is peeing/pooping on the balcony and she seems like she's cool with it. Also I told her about house training her dog but she made one attempt (put a tarp down on the balcony) and that tarp is still there a week later, curled up, unused, left on the balcony as trash now.

So far I've done most of the grunt work (70%) which includes cleaning bathroom sink, countertops, taking trash out, wiping down cupboards, organizing the house so it feels more like a ""home"" ...

I really want to clean the bathtub and bathroom since I'm starting to get grossed out... but she's the one who's made it much more dirtier since she's washing shoes and plants in there. Like, I'll be the bigger person and do it, no worries, but I don't want to be taken advantage of.  I'm not an angry person, but this is starting to build up some resentment and I don't want a hostile environment.

Am i being nitpicky? Is it fair for me to bring these issues up all at once or just... gradually... Maybe she's never been taught how to be clean?

884,"First off, moving out is something I’ve considered, but seeing as I’m the only person in my household who knows how to clean, I would be leaving my parents to a fate of filth and I love them too much to do that. I’ve seen how my grandparents’ house looked after their kids grew up 

They don’t expect me to clean or anything, but they just don’t seem to care at all about clutter like I do, so I worry that a few years after I left our house would look 10Xs worse 

Growing up I always just thought the way we lived was normal, everyone in our neighborhood keeps junk in their yard/houses and doesn’t have a problem with it, but it always made me feel so dirty and depressed. As I got older and branched out a little bit, I realized we were the weird ones. I was never encouraged to invite friends over, and I never knew why until then.

As for social class, that literally means nothing to me, but cleanliness is something I value highly and have a hard time respecting people who don’t know how to pick up after themselves. I love my family beyond compare but just because we’re not rich doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be able to be clean, I don’t understand. 

We have a relatively nice house, and with some touch ups and organization it would actually be really nice and normal-looking 

Every time I walk into the living room (my room is a haven of cleanliness so sometimes I forget what it’s like) I just get hit with a wave of hopelessness and sadness beyond compare for how we live

How does my family let junk accumulate and not even care or notice? 

I can spend a whole day cleaning and make our house look nice and then the following day it looks like trash again. One time when my sister was on a trip I cleaned her room and made it spotless, bought her matching furniture and hung up lights and pretty curtains, then within three days of her return you couldn’t even see the nice new stuff under all her clutter. How? I don’t know. She didn’t mean anything by it, she’s very nice and one of my best friends, but how is it so hard to be clean? 

The fact that they don’t respect how hard I work for them sometimes has caused me to stop cleaning entirely, and I’ve told them they’ll have to doing it on their own. I told my mom I’ll no longer clean a mess I don’t make, and she’s finally starting to realize cleaning is important. I will help her of course, but I make sure I’m no longer the one doing all the work

What do I do? I can’t keep living like this because it affects my mood and I’m always depressed and angry because of it. Any time I try to clean their mess now I just end up crying and cursing and giving up because it’s just so much junk

My parents are always depressed too and it makes me so sad, I know for a fact that the condition of our house heavily contributes to it. It’s not like they don’t have enough time to clean, they do.

889,"So, this will need some context - bear with me.

Around two years ago, I dated a guy (who we'll call Bill) for about two weeks. I finished with him because I can't handle long distance (he lives two countries away), and that was that, but I made it clear that I still have feelings for him - I just can't be with him. That was clear from the start.

I met my 'best friend' (we'll call her Leanne) at uni a few months ago, and we plan to live together next year. I'd been talking to Bill as a friend, and she hopped on a few of the calls. I told her everything with Bill, and how I still had a lot of feelings for him, but obviously I can't be with him. She very clearly understood that.

Fast forward to around four or five months later. I'm in a new relationship with a girl (we'll call her Fenn). We all go into lockdown, we all move back home. Unbeknownst to me, Leanne and Bill have begun talking separately.

Now for the three incidents:

1. Leanne calls me around a week into lockdown and tells me she thinks Bill is flirting with her. I tell her he's just naturally like that, but ask for examples through screenshots. I say I don't think he does like her, but even if he did, it would make me really uncomfortable if they dated or if she flirted with him, because he's my ex and I still have feelings for him. She agrees, and promises not to do it again.
2. Leanne then messages me two weeks later and tells me she's still flirting with him, and says sorry. I'm understandably upset. Bill also gets involved and tells me he was flirting back. I said, 'Okay, but as I've explained multiple times, please don't, because it makes me really uncomfortable and you both know how I feel about it / Bill.' They both agree to stop, and promise me they won't do it again.
3. Yesterday, Leanne and Bill add me to a group chat and tell me they didn't stop flirting and that they both have feelings for each other, and ask if that's okay. I quite understandably I think am very upset, because that's two times they've betrayed my trust. I call Bill, and Bill tells me I'd be 'just as upset if it was anyone else he got with' (bullshit - he's had other girlfriends who I have had no problem with, and the point is Leanne is / was my *best friend*) and that I'd be 'more upset if they hadn't told me for months' (which isn't the point). I am later told by a mutual friend of mine and Bill's that he told her he 'feels like I'm not letting him move on' (which I am - just not with my best friend?) and that 'he's hurt too' (over a break up that happened TWO YEARS AGO from a TWO WEEK LONG RELATIONSHIP).  
He also tells me that he 'knew I'd react like this', while telling me he 'cares so much about me' - which leaves me thinking, why would you do it then?

Now, here's the advice I need: should I take the advice of my girlfriend and multiple other people and cut them both off, despite the fact that I'm meant to be living with Leanne next year?

I have called them both and been very clear that if they get together and make it official, I can't forgive them, and I'm struggling to forgive them already. It hurts so much because I trusted them despite my gut instinct telling me not to.

I also feel bad for 'controlling' their lives, but I don't know whether I should, because they really, really fucked me over here! They're essentially throwing away very close friendships for someone they've never met in person and have been speaking to privately for about two / three months (and probably will never meet or be with, as Leanne has said to me that it 'wouldn't go anywhere anyway').

895,"Someone called my mom from a doctors office. They said “Ms (Smith), we’re calling you regarding payment for your edoctor visit yesterday.” She told them she didn’t do anything of the sort yesterday. The girl said “wrong number sorry.” And hung up. The number was the legit doctors phone number that also shows up on google. I used this doctor 5 years ago but have never been back there since. My mom never used this doctor and doesn’t even live in the same city as me. They literally just closed for the weekend when I tried to call them to ask what happened.

It’s a bit odd and has me perplexed. How could it be a wrong number? She called her by her name? And then abruptly said it was the wrong number and hung up?

I used this doctor 5 years ago for strep throat and never went back. So I know they have my information and probably my moms too.

897,"I am a 29-year old woman who has had multiple jobs in offices (some temp jobs, some regular) and more than once there has been one woman in every office who just doesn’t like me. It’s become such a pattern, I couldn’t help but notice. I could usually tell as soon as I introduced myself, it’s something in their eyes. But sometimes it develops in the first few days. They are distant, sceptical, give me a few dirty looks, gossip about me. You could say: who cares if one person doesn’t like you? But since some of those offices were small, it’s cost me two jobs so far. Where in hindsight I found out they were gossiping about me To superiors or telling my boss they didn’t think I did my work right. And in small offices, that counts when you’re new. I’ve tried to find the running theme and all I could come up with, is that they were all the ‘alpha’ woman in the office. The dominant one, who knew how to get things to go her way. I tried to be friendly to them, but usually kept my distance. 

I am very much a ‘girly girl’ myself, I only have girl friends. So it’s not that I don’t relate to other women or get along with men better. In fact, I got along with the other women in those offices just fine. But in some instances, the gossiping did cause a bit of a divide.

Are some women just off-putting to other women? Is it something Im doing? Had anybody here dealt with this? I really don’t know how to fix this.",19Jun2020,1
898,"Hello, just graduated high school and looking for advice on when to host a grad party. I think that I should host one a few days before/after so that people are more likely to come instead of having to choose between mine and someone else's on the same day.

899,"So a while back ago, I got into a fight with one of my friends. Let's call her Jodi. She decided to accuse me of stalking her. At the time, I decided to cut all my contacts with her. This was around the same time as when the whole Amber Heard -Johnny Depp stuff was going down, so I was afraid she would ruin my life with false accusations. She had already made a couple of my classmates to turn their back on me.

Around the same time, one of my old friends messaged me on Facebook. Let's call him Bob. Me, Bob, and Jodi first met each other in the same class. Bob is a good kid, even though he used to act distant toward me. But all in all, he is a good kid, who had me in his hang outs. However, at the time, I suspected that he was sent by Jodie to spy on me. I acted cool though at that time.

Anyway, about a week ago, I decided that I was done. I needed to know why Jodie decided to tell those lies. So I face chatted with Bob on Facebook, and told him I was going back to my home country. My reasoning was that if Jodie believed that I was out of the U.S.A forever, she would not bother to press charges against me. I hoped that my theory about Bob being Jodie's spy was true, and he would tell that false information to Jodie. Couple of days after that face chat, I emailed Jodie and told her everything. I asked her why she told those lies, reminisced about the good memories in the past, and then told her my final goodbye.

However, right now, I realize that the whole ""I am going out of the U.S."" was a stupid idea, and poor Bob might not have been aware of all of these. So I am just wondering how to apologize to him and tell him the truth.

901,"Hey guys, I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out. I need to know if I'm in the wrong here. I recently got a B in a class because I got a zero on my final paper because my professor accused me of plagiarism. I know a B in a class isn't horrible, but this class is a simple GE class I should have gotten an A in. 

Here are the instructions to the assignment for clarity:

For this assignment, you will pick one chapter from the book Why Evolution is True, read it, and write an annotated bibliography.  

**How to do the project:**

1.  Write the citation for Why Evolution is True at the top of the page (in the format shown below – this is the only part of the paper that is single-spaced).  

2.  Pick a chapter.

3.  Spend one paragraph summarizing the chapter (note which chapter it is in the beginning).

4.  Write a second paragraph describing one specific aspect of the chapter (this can be a specific example or story within the chapter that Coyne describes).

5.  Use at least one short quote (one sentence or less) in the bibliography and cite the quote in the correct style as shown below (using author last name, date of publication, and page number).

**Here's the story:** 

My professor gave me a zero out of thirty points on my final paper because Turn-it-in, the plagiarism software, claimed that I had 44% similarity to other papers on the internet. Here is what my professor said:

""44% plagiarized on turnitin (this paper is not original work - it has been pasted together from various internet sources and lightly changed from there).  Please don't do this in the future.""

I honestly could not believe this. I would never and have never plagiarized in my life. I put my paper through Easybib's plagiarism software which said that I had 27% of my paper plagiarized. Easybib claimed that I had ""plagiarized"" quotes from my book (which I had properly cited) and terminology from the book that I could have not avoided using in my paper since my professor had asked for a summary of the chapter. I emailed him back with screenshots of the plagiarism check and said this:

""Hello Professor, 

You may have seen my comment on the assignment for the annotated bibliography, but I am emailing you to prove that I did not plagiarize a single thing on my assignment. I looked at the Turn-it-in evaluation of my paper and it claimed I had plagiarized the title of the book, the title of the chapter I wrote about, and phrases such as ""the theory of evolution"" and ""natural selection"", all of which I could not have avoided. Additionally, Turn-it-in also says I plagiarized quotes from the book that were written on other papers online. Shouldn't this be normal because those other papers have used those quotes before? I ran my paper through another plagiarism checker and it says that what I have ""plagiarized"" is the citation at the top of my paper, the six parts of evolution (which I had to use straight from the book), and quotes from *Why Evolution is True* which I properly cited according to the format you requested. I have attached screenshots below so you can view the results. I would never support plagiarism nor would I do it. Please review the evidence I have provided you with and reconsider my grade on this paper because I believe that I don't deserve a zero on this assignment or a permanent mark on my record for something I didn't even do.""

He replied with:

""Unfortunately, you did plagiarize, and the grade stands.  I know you did not take someone else's paper and copy it directly.  What you did was take sentences from the book and lightly change them by replacing a verb or adjective, and pass them off as your own.  These are not the quotes, but rather the body of your essay.  Your percent plagiarized was 44%, not the 27% that you claim.  I do not expect 0% (because direct quotes will of course come up as ""plagiarized""), but once the paper hits about 25% or so, there is likely something wrong.  44% is way off.

This is because you did things like this:  
The book - ""Gradualism does not mean, however, that a species evolves at an even pace.""  
You - ""gradualism does not mean that a species evolves at a steady pace.""  
What you did was take a sentence from the book, erase the word ""however,"" and change ""even"" to ""steady.""  There are other examples of this in your paper.  Again, these are not quotes, but passed off as your original work.  You simply cannot do this kind of thing in college.  
Ultimately, you need to change your writing style.  You need to read the article, then use your own words to describe what you read, instead of looking over the article and picking a few choice sentences to lightly change."" 

I don't know where I went wrong. He asked me to summarize the book, and I did. For the quote he used to prove that I plagiarized, I wrote this: ""Finally, Coyne mentions that gradualism does not mean that a species evolves at a steady pace."" I never branded these words as my own (I wrote ""Finally, COYNE""; aka the author) and I gave multiple in-text-citations. I always gave credit to the author when I used the words of the book. I felt like he changed his argument; initially he said that I had plagiarized off of multiple sources online, but now he was saying that I plagiarized directly from the book by slightly changing sentences. 

Please help me out. I really don't want a B in the class and I want to appeal to the professor or the dean so I can either have this class taken out of my record or get another chance to receive an A in the class.",19Jun2020,1
902,"I’m new to Reddit, so I apologize if I am in the wrong place. I’m still getting the hang of it. 

I (16f) am feeling really confused on what I should do about the situation at my school. My freshman-junior year I was sexually assaulted and harassed by another student in my marching band. Even after he left the school, he would stalk me and show up to my home. It got to the point where he spread photos of him raping me throughout the school and people started calling me a liar. Including some of my closest friends. Last year, I found out these “friends” in band made a group chat where they made memes about my rape and joked about it. They shared it with others. 

When I found out I reported it to my director, and they took it to administration. They were kicked out of band for the year, but I was told that I had to decide if they are allowed to return when the time comes. 

Now I’m entering my senior year, and I have to decide. I honestly don’t want to let them in because it’s scary. I just want one year that isn’t filled with harassment. However, I feel like a lot of people in band will resent me for not letting them back into band because they were strong musicians and their friends. Should I just let them in because everyone else wants them back? I’m honestly really conflicted with this situation, I don’t know what to do.",19Jun2020,1
903,"22/f who lives in an apartment with her boyfriend of 3 years. I'm currently going to a community college to get my gen eds out of the way and then plan on transferring to get my Bachelors. The big issue is that I have **absolutely no idea** what I want to do with my life. The past 7 years I've worked in different restaurant positions. I've worked at my current restaurant for 4 years as a server until last year they promoted me to be a supervisor and now am on the path to become a manager should I be willing to relocate to another restaurant in the district. There are pros and cons to this. I have always had chronic anxiety and depression, and recently my therapist diagnosed me with a borderline personality disorder and PTSD from childhood abuse. Being in such a high stress work environment has really deteriorated my mental health. I've been on antidepressants for years but my psychiatrist recently recommended detoxing and seeing how I feel because the different meds I've tried have been giving me weird side effects, I'm definitely dealing with withdrawals. The idea of returning to work after this quarantine ends has given me nothing but panic attacks. Every day I go to work I feel unhappy. I've applied to so many places to do receptionist work but have had no call backs or receive responses saying I need prior experience but I don't know how I can do that if no place is willing to hire me.

The pros of this potential management job is that they would give me tuition reimbursement and salary pay which would be double what I make now (which is basically nothing). But then comes the issue of what I want to be when I graduate. For the longest time I wanted to be a psychologist but I don't want to be in crazy debt with student loans because I will have to get a Doctorate degree to practice. Also going to school full time for that long would be wayyyy too much with doing a required 50 hour work week management job. I've done a **TON** of research on different career paths but haven't found anything that's really sparked an interest in me besides maybe human resources. Right now I have my major listed in business. I really want a job that is lower stress and pays decently well. It's just hard finding a place that would be willing to hire me as I will be getting my Associates next winter. I also don't qualify for federal student aid as my dad makes too much money but is unwilling to help me with paying for college. 

Overall I just feel extremely unhappy with my life, my family is extremely toxic and treats me like crap. However, my boyfriend is great and we are planning on getting engaged some time this year, we have 2 wonderful rescue kittens who have been keeping whatever shred of mental sanity I have left in tact. I do yoga to try and calm my mind but I honestly just don't feel like I fit in anywhere. Any advice would be appreciated.",19Jun2020,1
907,"Hey Redditors, I wasn't sure where to come to ask this so I'm hoping here is best. Basically I'm a single 29/m and moved from a low income area in Kentucky, to Hilton Head Island, SC about three years ago. I moved here after my father passed away ( as a token to him because he always wanted to retire here and loved it and never had a chance to live here.) The area here is extremely wealthy, and even 45 minutes off the island (where I work), rental properties for 1BR range from $1,100-1,600. This was a shock to me at first given where I moved from but I get it. I pay $900 a month now for a bedroom with two other roommates who party and are pretty sketchy. I sell Hot Tubs here for a large pool company and make 4% commission on top of my $14.50 a hour wage. I very rarely get commission however, as I never get any of the online leads (given to ""next boss in the making"" employee) so I get my customers off cold calling and luck and community outreach. I bring home about $500 a month after taxes with overtime. I am very unhappy here, and don't have many friends as this place is a huge tourist destination and everyone I meet leaves. I was just offered an opportunity back home, making $10/hr and 4% commission selling hot tubs for a small family owned company and a really good owner. I will also make my 4% commission on the pool tables, shuffleboard, saunas, basketball rims, poker tables ect that they offer. So I'll have a wider range of opportunity, and a great owner who said all leads would be split between one other employee and I, and a home field advantage to the people I know in the area. Although the cost of living is LARGELY different, part of me is still scared I won't be able to afford to live with a $10 base pay, my real money would rely on my commission. I can rent a 2 br house for around $500-800 where I will be working and will be within a hour of all of my family and friends that I miss dearly. This is a big decision and I am just seeking whatever advice I can get, I would be much happier being able to see my family and friends on the weekend with a hour drive, instead of driving home 9 hours every 3 months or so and only being able to see them for 3-4 days before driving back down south. I would be leaving the beach ( that I really  never have time to enjoy because I work so much,) to move to the poverty ridden Mid West, but that's where I am from. Part of me tells me to stay here for my father, even though I cannot afford it unless I work two jobs, but the other part tells me to take this very rare opportunity to work close to home in such a rare career field that I enjoy, and rely on my sales skills and commission. Thank you so much for reading this. I have until 6/20 to make a decision. Can't thank you enough for reading this.",19Jun2020,0

909,"     Hello. First post. Apologies if I make some newbie mistakes. I’d like to first start off with my motives for writing this, I am tired of ranting to my friends who are surely tired of me ranting to them. I am in high school and I’m male, but I’d like to think I’m very mature for my age. I’d also like to apologize for the length and the spelling errors as I type on a very cracked phone. Also I realize that this is a temporary thing but it’s happening in the now. It irritates me now. It makes me hurt now. 


     Okay, to start off I’m not the best person. I’m not the worst, but I’m no stranger to my many faults. After a long and toxic relationship(mainly me being the toxic one) I joined an all girl friend group. Which is not an issue for me since I don’t mind being considered gay or not sleeping over. But I’m naturally a very clingy person. I live with my grandparents and my grandmother has suffered three strokes and has early stage dementia. I care for her. In the following months this became my life. At home I would care for my sick grandma with my irritating grandpa and at school ,and outside of it, I would be with my three friends. One of them I had known since second grade. Our bond was so so grand. Let’s call her A. With backstory out of the way I’ll begin explaining what happened. It all started when another member of the friend group, I’ll call her E started dating this awful awful boy. I hated him so much. Mainly because he reminded me of myself when I was toxic and awful. 

     Loooong story short I start hanging out with E for so long that I start getting a thing for her. Another note-I am not attractive. I’m lightly chubby and have the weirdest nose. But I am extremely good at reading/knowing people. But I always don’t assume because I never know if I’m wrong so I just observe. E and I start hanging out without the others. She said her boyfriend doesn’t know. We would tickle, play fight, go on these romantic sort of places. But we never did anything. She was not cheating. But I fell for her. A little bit after she cut the whole thing off, said she was guilty. I was hurt. But life goes on. I start to eat healthier and I practiced Christianity in a more dedicated fashion. After a few weeks she asks to come over. I hear from A That she and the toxic boyfriend broke up. We went on a picnic. It was a beautiful day. She’s not oblivious either. She’s better at reading people than I am. And we both start to hang out more. Welcome back, bliss. 

     This is where around the time grandma has her fourth stroke I believe. Time blurs. For those of you unfamiliar with a stroke, refer to my crude analogy. Think about all your skills and traits. Each of them on a single golf ball, grouped together. Motor skills, sight out each eye, etc. A stroke swats some of them away. This fourth stroke was definitely the worst. Ferocious. It took most of her speech. She could talk. But it was difficult for her. Still is.  As well as it made her walking much more difficult. Maybe a month of me and E bonding and me helping meme go. And one god awful night ruins it. Weeks earlier my grandpa asked how to wipe his history. I asked why and he said he thought you had to. A few things about my grandpa. He’s a liar, and a very self righteous man. According to him he’s never felt jealous or lied about anything in his whole entire life. 

     I chuckle, thinking he’s watching porn and I think it’s gross. But I tell him I don’t know how and he doesn’t need to. I go onto his laptop the previously mentioned night. I’m on call with another friend of mine. I’ll call her AJ. I look. Rethinking this fills me with this rage- on that man’s history was sugar daddy dating cites. Before all of you say wait-maybe it was a pop up or a accidental link. No. Not only was he shopping for a bikini (no female family close to us) he had also visited this site a lot. Bing searched “silver dating sites” terminology alone showing he knew what he was doing. Plus this is the exact kinda crap he’d pull. I called E in a horrible horrible fit. I cried. I didn’t think I should’ve. But I cried in front of her. I arranged to come over the next day. I then called my mom. We aren’t close. She’s not the trashy type, and she’ll do anything for me. She loves me but we don’t mix. And she hates my grandpa. She says quote “I don’t get why you’re upset. He’s not going to leave her.” Which isn’t the point at all. He’s the closest thing I have to a father, cheating on the closest thing I have to a mother. All the whole preaching on how not to lie or cheat or steal. I don’t know who else to call other than my aunt, my grandma’s sister. She lives in Georgia. I once did because my mom is an awful human being and married her son. Yeah. My grandma’s sister’s son. Full blood. 


     I arrange to go to Georgia the next week. I can’t stay. I couldn’t act normal with the information on my mind. I stayed up all night. E stays up late usually. She was a light that I thanked the lord for having. But she told me to wake her up that afternoon by calling her. I just couldn’t. I pictured this sleeping angel. So I slept on the couch after a loooong time awake. She was slightly disappointed and upset. For some reason I didn’t ask to come over the next day. I often wonder if I had come over would things have gone differently. But regardless she doesn’t answer my texts for the next few days which makes me freak. I shouldn’t have. But I did. We argued when she got back to me then she full on ghosted me. I’ve never felt more alone. I go to Georgia and it’s not what I’m used to. Very unclean sometimes. But I love everyone there. I stay for about a month. During this month a few things happen. After being ghosted for so long I leave the friend group. I tried giving her space and apologizing but nothing worked. I get into a massive two way argument with the remaining friends which E ends by saying we can’t be friends anymore. 

     A and I still text on occasion now but she’s avoiding me. Hardcore. It’s mostly memes back and forth. I can’t even call with her. I fear I’ve killed that friendship even though we agreed that if there was friend group drama we would stuck together no matter what. More lies I suppose. So then my grandma has her fifth stroke. During all this mess even if I could return to my state at the time the hospitals weren’t letting people in. I call her daily but the guilt is heavy. That I wasn’t there when it happened. I arrange to leave and say my goodbyes. 

     My mom drives me home. I spend one day with my grandparents. This fifth stroke is the worst. She no longer wants to watch tv. Which I thought was good for her. She loves murder mysteries so it stimulates her brain. She hates phone calls more than she did before. Now she just sits there staring off. She uses a walker now and can’t get up without us. Which we hope is temporary. I fear this time she has given up. But after this day I’m contacted to find out that someone in Georgia tested positive for COVID-19. So I’ve been quarantined at my mom’s to avoid exposing my grandparents. During this time E contacted me but it’s just awkward small talk. She dry texts me and it’s hurtful to see. I’ve apologized but I don’t know what else to do. 

     My life is hell. Every component that I leaned on for support is gone. My two weeks are nearly up but I don’t know how I’m going to manage. I understand if none of you wished to read that. If anyone read all of it thank you. A quick skim and honest advice would help. I can’t tell my grandma about my grandpa’s infidelities. I want her last coherent years to be nice and uneventful.",19Jun2020,1
910,"I'm a vet tech. Love my job. I've been working at my current hospital for a little under 6 months. I came to this hospital fully trained. I can draw blood, monitor surgery, intubate, place IV catheters, etc. I don't make as much as I would like, but they wanted to make sure I didn't lie on my resume about my skills with the idea I would get a raise in a couple months. Well no raise, and when I asked about having a review, I was told I had to wait until I've been there a year. I also have yet been allowed to be ""surgically trained"" at this hospital and I miss it.

My current hospital has other... issues... as well. Including, but not limited to, there is like a war between techs and receptionist. They hate each other and it shouldn't be like that. And whenever there is a problem, the owner of the clinic and the office manager side with the receptionists. And it sometimes results in the techs being forced to do more work and things that used to be a receptionist job. Like taking messages for Rx refills. 

So, today I was offered a job at another hospital. Smaller hospital (3 doctors vs 8), same pay, promise for a review with a raise within 6 months. They would want me trained for surgery almost immediately. They also have little work/life balance things such as staff outings every few months and End-of-Year bonuses. The owner is also EXTREME supportive of the fact that I'm a pre-vet student. To the point where he said he would have a job for me after graduating vet school. Oh and this place is NINE minutes from where I live which is awesome.

Basically, I don't plan on leaving the first job to begin with. Just cut my hours and work both, but I'm second guessing myself (especially because I'm in school part time). I also really like some of the people at my current hospital but I'm not out side of the ""work friend zone"" so yeah. I don't know.

916,"I just dunno what to think. He died really suddenly of cardiac failure yesterday at 5 years old. He was always a little sickly, but he was just such a fucking great dog and it was such a blessing to have both him and his sister together, being a little pair of mischief makers. 
We’re getting her checked up too to make sure she’s okay and making sure we follow any and all recommendations from the vet for her, but she physically seems very healthy and always was more robust than her brother. Yesterday, she seemed understandably shocked and shaky. 
She’s technically my dog but lives at my folks house. They thought she was so lovely when I got her that adopted her brother too, but because the siblings were so attached to each other and I was in college anyway I didn’t want to separate them. My Chesapeake has died a few months before we adopted them and it felt okay that they had each other, where I was really the main person for my old. 

The whole thing just making me crazy today. We always bought them food that we researched carefully, fed them at appropriate times in appropriate portions, treated them frequently, walked them twice a day, gave them plenty of space and sunshine, attention and training. Someone was always home with them and for them. We all worked really hard on making them both less anxious, dogs included—the brother would literally fear shit himself and bite us every time we tried to touch him as a puppy, but I could never imagine him even thinking growling at one of us as an adult. I just can’t believe he’s gone and I can’t even imagine how his sister feels. 

Now finally being out of college and working I was looking to buy a house sometime in the next year with my partner anyway, partly just so we can have some dogs and not answer to any bullshit landlord requirements. I live near my folks and it would be easy to have the sister live a bit with both of us if we wanted. Again, someone would always be in the house with them, and I work very close by at pretty sane hours. Is it screwed up that despite losing this dog and feeling so pained, it just makes me want to have a house where I can have a few dogs even more than before? I just don’t want to get a dog for the wrong reasons and treat them in a way they don’t deserve just because I’m a stupid mess.",19Jun2020,3
917,"Sorry to annoy with this, but I thought someone might have a tip for me.

I know this will sound like I'm a complete asshole, and I probably am, but I want to fix it now. So for two years or so I don't really have strong feelings towards anything. It's not like I'm completely emotionless, bc then I wouldn't write this, but it doesn't feel normal. It was different at some time. I didn't really think it was big of a problem, but now my best friend recently ""left me"" because he said I was too distant. That he would do a lot to keep the friendship up while I didn't do much. I thought he was kind of stupid at first, and just let him go, but I kind of self-reflected during quarantine time and realized that I:

* Didn't really care about my grandpa's death
* Nor about my mom crying her eyes out about it, it was rather annoying
* Left my (ex)girlfriend just because she slighty pissed me off (which is weird bc Im pretty sure my feelings should have been stronger towards this, but I kinda didn't care at all. At least didn't back then, now I kinda do. I didn't even properly break up, I just left and then ignored her. I know, it was a dick move.)
* Don't really care about my sister moving out soon
* And I probably watched too much gore online for it to be considered okay

I'm pretty distant towards everyone, which I realized after my friend telling me. I don't feel much connection to my family, but I do want back my best friend.

I have to somehow fix this, but I don't know how. I know that if I keep on doing this, it will not only hurt people like my best friend, but also myself bc this is probably not socially okay. Idk. I just have a strong feeling to change something now, but I don't know how to even start. I'm sorry if this somehow sounds weird, I'm bad at explaining, but I'm 100% serious. Any advise on how I can better myself is highly appreciated",19Jun2020,1
918,"tldr at end.

So my upstairs neighbors, who i know well, we moved in at the same time and looked at the apartments at the same time. All was well until their mom moved in with them, and brought their untrained dog along with. The mom and dog technically should even be here per the lease agreement. 

But they are and that's not my problem. My problem is that i can't go outside on my own deck without being afraid of being peed on. Their dog pees on the deck almost every time I'm outside. I don't have any outside furniture yet, i was going to get some soon, but now i feel like i can't even use my own deck, i would have to put everything away or cover everything and have an umbrella or something because every time i go out the dog pees, and it drips down onto my deck. The mom doesn't ever care, or really notice that this is happening. 

I have almost been peed on 2 times already, i can hear the dog when its up there so i try and move so I'm not anywhere near it, and it has almost peed on me when this happens. 

I have plans to put out furniture and to use my deck but now I'm not so sure because i don't know how long this dog is going to be here, and I'm not sure how i can prevent this dog from peeing on me and my pet. My cat loves to go outside on a leash and just enjoy being outside but i can't even do that because i don't want to get peed on.

I don't want to start anything because we are good friends with the neighbors, its just the mom and dog who shouldn't be here that is causing issues. I want to use my deck but i can't. please help i don't know how to approach this.

tldr: upstairs neighbor/friends dog that they shouldn't have  pees on upstairs deck so i can't use my floor level deck. Idk how to approach this without getting them in trouble with apartments, or cause strain on friendship.",19Jun2020,1

924,"Hi guys. Obligatory throw away account/ on mobile / trying to keep it short yada yada.

I've got a friend who I'll call Jake. He's lived out of state for several years, but we became close over a year or so of knowing each other way back when. We're both late 30's. He was there for me when I was going through a tough period in my life and, similarly, there has been some bad stuff out of his control that he's had to come back my area for, and I've always been there to help him through it. 

Here's where I'm looking for advice: Jake's got issues. He suffered through a terrible childhood. He's got some serious military related PTSD. Normally he's just a good guy, but he's had blow outs when drinking where police have been involved. I've never been there for any of these events. I know about them only because there are TWO now ex girlfriends of his that have called me and asked for help. (The most recent time was last year) I'm guessing they called me because they know he trusts me and I've always been a good friend.  

I am FIRMLY against domestic violence, and I told him as much after the first girlfriend reached out to me. A lot of time had passed before he reached out to me again, this time with a new girlfriend and abstaining from alcohol. I was really happy for him, and thought he was turning his life around. A few weeks later the new girlfriend called me. He was locked up. He blew a gasket again. I basically told her to run and I haven't heard from him since. (I've been in light contact with her over this time and we've remained friendly)

My dilemma is: he's in town and likely wants to hang out. I don't know how to respond. I don't condone his past behavior, but I love this dude like a brother. I don't want to go into any details about the stories that I've heard first hand from these girls, but it wasn't pretty. 

Do I ghost him? Do I confront him? Last time I told him that I loved him, but had heard about what happened and I'll always be there if he needs help, but left it at that. Help me, please

TL:DR good buddy has a patterned history of abuse in relationships, I'm not sure how to/if I should cut him off

928,"I guess some background would help here. I always grew up thinking that family was the most important thing in the world. I joined the military to pay for my own college and avoid being a burden to my parents (and so my sibling could attend instead). I’ve even loaned my dad thousands of dollars to support him in his business venture. 

I grew up in a conservative environment, but throughout my path into adulthood I’ve adopted different stances. I’m not sure what I’d label myself, but that’s not important. The thing is, whenever I’m visiting my dad and stepmom, all they talk about is politics, but in a toxic way. I try and chip in respectfully, hoping at least for a productive conversation. They are stubborn and often resort to strawman arguments and red herrings, and although I find that problematic, I’m fine with just leaving it at “we agree to disagree”. 

What fucks me up is that my dad will also make comments like “I’ve lived longer than you, I have a right to dismiss you” and “You and your generation will ruin this country”, and that I’m just a fool/puppet/whatever word you wanna use for “sheep”. Likewise I’ve had people in my family chat calling me stupid, and that even geniuses can have empty minds (both were comments from my grandma directed at me and my sibling).

Everything I’ve worked hard for, every time I’ve forced myself to see the good in them just because they’re family, everything I’ve done to become who I am today, and they’ve reduced me to “stupid, fool, millennial, snowflake”

I’m an empathetic person man so this year has been just awful seeing all the suffering around me while I feel powerless. But to also hear that from those who are supposed to be the closest to you... it just fucked me up man. At one point I just called my mom who lives in another country and bawled for an hour. She’s helped me so much but she’s so far away... and I can’t talk about this with my dad because i know he’d probably just think that a grown man crying over feelings is pathetic.

I don’t wanna be at odds with my family, but I don’t know what to do. Even if there’s this “relative peace”, i know deep down what they all think of me. The other day my dad tried baiting saying he registered me to vote as a member of his party. I ignored him but damn guys... i don’t know. If I had a son, i know i would never treat him with such disrespect even if we disagree. It’s got me fucked up man, and I don’t know what to do.",19Jun2020,1
929,"I (22F) tend to be pretty negative and complain a lot of the time without even noticing it. It feels so involuntary. When someone points it out I always get offended, but I just pretend like it doesn’t bother me. I have been actively trying to stop and think before I speak, but it doesn’t seem to be working well enough. My coworkers, as well as my boyfriend, have made a few comments on it in the past few weeks. I really don’t want to be this way anymore and i’ve been so frustrated and down on myself. 

I completely understand that I probably need years of therapy to fully change this within me, but that’s not something I am able to afford at this point in time as I am a student. It just sounds so simple, just stop complaining, but I have been trying and the comments about my negativity have increased this week alone. While talking with my coworkers I said that I really wish I was good at playing golf because I love to go golfing. It turned into everyone ganging up on me saying stuff like “wow did you hear that?! She said she likes something!”. Those comments still hurt even though I know deep down that they’re true. 

I’m just looking for any advice or tips on this. I am able to identify when I am complaining, but it’s not as easy for me to tell when I am just being negative overall (unless someone tells me).",19Jun2020,1

So for context I’ve struggled with a lot since I was a kid, at about 6 I had to see people die on the spot from an accident, I also got beat up by my family members and got mentally tortured by my peers and my teachers who I helped in every way possible and was told to just understand everyone else since my worth is lesser than theirs. And so I became cold and calculated while being somewhat of a super social person and the reason I like her so bad is she’s one of the first amongst the people in my life who didn’t call me some freak or called me too sensitive and that really makes me feel happy and I want to make her happy because she wants a special someone that understands her but idk how to be that someone for her so please all help is considered and appreciated.

As I've supported her posts, I've noticed she has focused on topics that I was planning on talking about too. While I am pumped for her as I read these posts...there's a part of me that feels that if I were to begin posting publically the content I want to share (which is similar to hers)- she may think I am copying her, encroaching on her space, taking away from her following etc. I care about this friend and I would hate for her to think that. I have already hinted to her that some of the templates I would be using on the Instagram might be similar (and she was completely fine with it)....but I am very aware that something within me 'feels guilty' and 'wants her permission' to move forward. I have people-pleasing tendencies and definitely don't want to give in to this if it's not healthy.

My girlfriend lives with her mum and nan. The situation that found the three of them living together is really long and complicated, and not that important currently: however what is important is that the mum doesn’t work, and the nan pays for everything, in return, the mum does all housework, shopping, cooking, cleaning etc etc. It’s just the deal they have. 

I’ve been with girlfriend for four years now and she suffers with anxiety. I’ve always known her Nan to be a pain - but this is something else. She is disgusting towards the both of them. She swears at them non stop, she won’t allow the mums boyfriend in the garden (socially distanced of course), even though I am allowed. She does not want the mum to be happy, and is spiteful towards her. She constantly phoned the neighbours and speaks in a horrible manner of both my girlfriend and the mum to them, and complains non stop. She cries all day, looking for sympathy and pity after having an argument with the two of them. And she is getting worse.

A lot worse. It is affecting my girlfriends mental health, as well as her mums. My girlfriend suffers anyway, but it is making her daily life almost impossible because of how low she feels. The nan has nothing wrong with her, she’s healthy with no mental health issues that we know of. 

My girlfriend and I don’t have enough deposit to move out just yet, and she can’t come live with me, as we have a lot of people in our house as it is. My girlfriend cries most nights, has panic attacks, and is feeling lower than I’ve ever seen her, because of her nans treatment to the both of them. 

What are our options? I don’t want to use this word lightly, but I would classify it as emotional and psychological abuse. She runs them both down, to their lowest, and relentlessly hurls insults and hateful comments to them. Is there anything we can do? 

My priority here is my girlfriend and the mum. It may seem harsh, but I’ve seen how the Nan acts, and it is absolutely evil. I have no sympathy for her whatsoever. 

We are in the UK. Is a care home an option? Or is there something else?

941,"Before I started applying for College , 2 years ago, I told my parents that I was unsure on what I wanted to be. I had ideas, and one of them was to be an Occupational Therapy Assistant / Physiotherapy Assistant (OTA/PTA) for short. My parents, and grandma thought it was the program for me, and I was forced into it. 

For the first year, I failed by 2% in 2 mandatory classes. Yes, **TWO** percent. This led me into having to take the 2 year program in 3 years instead of 2 to do the program. 

My first semester of this year was those 2 classes, and that was it. I passed both of those, and was excited to go onto the classes I couldn’t take in semester 2 without having these courses.

I did well in 3/4 classes with 75s. However, I didn’t pass one class because my teacher , whos the program coordinator, didn’t mark a paper, which led me to fail. 

Since I had an academic probation before with my first year, and I failed this year, it led me to getting booted out of the program. 

I’m really nervous to tell my parents that I got kicked out of my program, and feel super embarrassed, and guilty. 

They really pressure me into College, when I simply think it’s a waste of money, since I’m unsure of what I want to do.

But because of my mindset that I don’t deserve anything, let alone affection, until I am thin makes me want to try to look good for self esteem purposes. Most days I feel like a joke and I am trying too hard so it doesn’t help, but some days I feel okay! 

I have battled ED’s in the past, whenever I diet/exercise I slip back into old habits where I don’t eat for three days then I binge. Sleep gets fucked and I feel even more disgusting. 

How can I build my self esteem and not feel like a piece of shit loser when I am trying? I just want to stop hating myself. Also if anyone has diet/lifestyle change tips for a girl that has had bad bouts of bulimia I would appreciate it.

943,"So I am to report back to work a week from today. I am part of the manager staff, and the people in this scandal are technically my employees. We will call them: R, J, and M. (not their real initials.) 
What happened was over our quarantine, M had gotten out of a broken relationship of 7 years. She was feeling down and alone and was manipulated into a relationship with R. I sort of approved of it, only because I had lived with R prior for only a year due to being desperate for a roommate. Things were not the best living together, I was gaslighted to believe I was just a bitch and he was always the victim with everything. If you would like more context on that whole abusive ordeal, I can add it to the comments. Anyway, our last night of living together, we agreed to try to be friends (since I felt I was always the bitch with every abusive manipulative thing he did to me, I thought I could try to be his friend.) 
Moving forward to the quarantine and this new relationship. M was repulsed by him, but felt like she couldn’t be alone, I guess he was a rebound in her mind. Long story short, this lasted a few weeks until he sexually assaulted her one night after getting her drunk. She was never really my friend, neither was J, but they both contacted me to meet up a few days after this. They apologized to me for not believing me about everything I vented to them about R while I was living with him. So they told me what happened about the assault and other things he did while they were in this relationship, like telling her he loved her and was never going to let her go, and trying to keep her away from J. 
To this day, it has been over a month since the “break up” and he has not left her alone. She had to block him on every social media site, phone number, etc. She has an android phone and it still shows you when you get a blocked call and who it is from when it happens. Because of this harassment, she won’t come back to work and found a new job. He also has pictures of her all over his social media and is still telling people that they’re still together and everything’s fine between them. 
J and I still have to work with R, and don’t know how he will be around us. He is always contacting J, apologizing to him to tell M because he wants his life back. J and I had to block him because of this as well. J has said he will not speak to him at work unless it is work related, and I am not sure if I can do the same since I am his manager. 
My worry is that J will blow up on him and it will then be discussed by the manager team , and I know for sure they will ask me if I know anything seeing as though I used to live with R and therefore must still be in contact with him. I don’t know if I should tell them the truth because it’s not work related, it’s a fight that happened over our time off. Plus, we can’t outright fire R over this, (not to my knowledge) so I don’t want to be the one who slanders his reputation with every other manager and I don’t want to share such a personal detail about what he did to M. I don’t know why I’m so worried not to ruin his reputation, because I know he did it to himself and deserves to be exposed. Plus, i confided in him details of my own assault, and at the time he acted so sorry for what happened to me, and thought r*pe is bad. I’m even more upset that he acted so upset about what happened to me and then does it to someone anyway. so I am not sure why I worry about keeping what he did a secret. 
Can someone please give me advice on what to do here? I am scared to even face him at work because the panic sets in from my own traumatic assault and I don’t know if I can even treat him like a regular employee. Also, what do I do if I’m asked about what happened? Do I tell my GM/ AGM or should I lie and say I know nothing?",19Jun2020,1

Right now, I am a full time college student and now also work full time. Luckily, I can take some classes online, and I only go to school 3 days out of the week. 
My current job is taking a toll on me because I am working by myself 4pm-12am. I don’t mind the work load, but I get deep in my thoughts for 8 hours a day on top of the fear of being alone, especially being a young woman. I find myself exceptionally sad at work. I stay there because the days I work fit great with my school schedule, the job pays well, and pays gas for my commute. The job is pretty easy work, I just clean and sanitize things all day. I’m certainly busy but not overwhelmed. It also doesn’t require me to work weekends or holidays which is a huge plus. I used to be a waitress and missed out many holidays and weekends. 

However, a few weeks ago due to COVID-19  I was relocated to a hospital where I worked with others through the same company and I loved it. My boss offered me the job on the spot and everyone who I was with wanted me to stay. They were welcoming and kind. It was a seamless fit. The problem is I get paid a lot less, have a longer commute, and my weekends, holidays, paid commute, and other perks are gone. I will likely not be able to afford the apartment I sought out to get without being strapped for money. 

I understand my happiness is important, but I’m not sure what option will help me find it. On one hand, I don’t like my job, but I get the apartment and freedom I have wanted and am working towards. On the other hand I like my job, but remain unable to have my own say at home. It’s a hard decision and I appreciate any advice I can get. Thank you all! 

TL;DR: I don’t like my current job, but I need it to get an apartment I want. I can get a job somewhere else but won’t be able to afford an apartment without being virtually broke. (Don’t know how to bold it on mobile!)",19Jun2020,1
945,"I have recently married (September) into a family who owns and runs a pizzeria/restaurant in a small rural town. I left my hometown in another state, where I was a part of my own family’s business in another industry, to move to my husband’s hometown. My husband has gone several times back and forth about wanting me to have a role at the restaurant, but as of October he wants me to not even step foot at the business (nothing happened, he just made that decision on his own). His parents, who still ultimately own the business, want me to be a part of it but my husband does not want to compromise at all. I can give more information if wanted/needed, but I was just wondering if anyone else sees it as sort of insulting that I am not included in the family business? I understand the whole not wanting to work with your spouse thing, but really with Italian culture especially (we are both first generation Italian Americans), family is such a strong bond and force that I feel left out. Does any of this make sense? Could anyone share their thoughts?",19Jun2020,1
946,"I know fighting is trashy and there are better ways to solve an issue you have with someone, please don’t lecture me on that part. This girl was basically slut shaming me for “flirting” with so many guys, it was ridiculous. I’m not a push over so I stood up for myself and it escalated so much that we ended up pulling each other’s hair and fighting. Well it ended with her on top of me punching me, and people had to pull her off me. It was embarrassing because I was wearing a skirt. A lot of people witnessed it including my friends, and it got recorded and the video is being passed around. My face got a little messed up I have some bruises and I’m embarrassed to show my face. The whole situation is embarrassing and I can’t escape it right now. Everyone is talking about what happened and I’m just so overwhelmed by everything. I could use some advice on how to face this.",19Jun2020,0
947,"So I have been in uni for two years now, and have not made many friends as my year and uni are very small (200 people) and we only really see people in our class. We had a zoom call where we played a game of psych earlier today and she decided to say as an answer to a question about me: her fake dyspraxia. Now I do not just have dyspraxia. I have dyspraxia that is so severe that it makes me not able to speak properly, I cannot walk properly, and communication is difficult. So telling me, even as a joke that I do not have a disability is deeply insulting. I know it was part of a game and she told me not to get offended, but I feel like that's my call. Should I confront her about it or do I just let it go? this is not the first microaggression there have been many but this one has made me feel terrible. 

TLDR: I got told I don't have dyspraxia and I want to call the person out but don't know if that will start a fire.",19Jun2020,1

I slept around a friends house and got drunk, I was with her , her sister and her sisters friend. I woke up this morning feeling bad worrying I might’ve annoyed them when I was drunk. I went home hungover, and was still worrying, when I worry I have to tell someone for reassurance. My friends sister was smoking weed and my parents are AGAINST weed. I said to my dad that they were moaning at me for being too loud ( as they didn’t want to wake their mum up) however the only person that said that was my friend. But I obviously couldn’t tell my dad I was drunk or he’ll go and at me so I used the excuse that they were moaning at me and told him they smoked weed 🤦🏻‍♀️ my dad didn’t really mind.

I honestly don’t know why I feel so bad, like a terrible human being, like I don’t deserve anyone cause anyone that likes me or I like them I bitch about. Literally I can’t sleep because I’ve been awake worrying about it.

951,"Me and a friend from middle school are moving to the same city after college. I had no desire at all to live with her because middle school was not a happy time for me and I have made a lot of new friends since that I would rather live with. However, I just found out that she assumes we are going to be living together. I was in shock.

She just made this assumption and started asking me about leases and stuff. I was very shocked. I really don't think I want to live with her especially because recently during all the stuff going on with BLM she posted some really problematic stuff on her instagram. She is also very strongly pro-life (which is fine and valid) but personally I am VERY PROCHOICE and feminist so I would just feel bad living with her. I'm really politically involved so I guess this stuff is really emotional for me.

I would feel guilty to bring guys over and stuff because she is really religious. I am also religious but I guess we have different levels of commitment.I know I would be judged by her. I would just feel not at home. I kind of told her I would think about it but I AM HORRIBLE at saying no to people. and it scares me that she might hate me if I do??? I probably need to see a therapist for this. My friend told me to just tell her I'm living with a friend from college.... I guess I could say that?? But I'd still feel bad to say that to her given that she kind of asked me first and I didn't really imply I was considering other people. But any advice that isn't ""Just tell her."" would be greatly appreciated. Like idk, just because we were besties in middle school it's a bit bold to assume we would still gel together 10 years later imo.

Just to clarify we went to different high schools, and colleges but have stayed in touch through occasional calls. So like that's why I was so shocked. ",19Jun2020,1

953,"We signed a lease starting this June for a house. At that time the rental company asked if we wanted to rent the detached garage before they rented it to a different party. We declined and fast forward 3 weeks and somebody signed a lease for the garage. The thing is, is that the power to the house is our responsibility, but the power to the garage is on the same meter. This means that I will have to pay for any power the garage tenants use.

 I contacted the rental company and they replied with ""The garage has only an LED light for electricity usage.  There is no garage opener.
In the event the light were left on constantly, the approximate charge for electricity usage would be approximately $1/month.""

This was followed up with a link to an energy use calculator for an led light. They then gave us a 25 dollar credit and told us that it would ""cover the cost of the electricity in the garage for the next couple of years."" 

I can see in through the window and there is an outlet in one of the rooms and I'm sure there is another light in the main area of the garage. There is no way of knowing if they will put a deep freeze in there or run a space heater in the winter. The possibilies of what they use the garage for are endless. 

Am I justified to be concerned about this. Would just shutting off the breaker to the garage make me in the wrong?",19Jun2020,1

TLDR; I’m at a big crossroads between choosing college or military life. I have negative perceptions of college due to my upbringing and I’d like to know if there’s any weight to those perceptions.
——————————————————



I’m a recent discharge from the Delayed Entry Program in the US military. My plan for the last year has been to become a marine, but it didn’t work out. And now I’m forced to consider other options. 

I come from a pretty lax homeschool background, having been pulled out of public school in grade 5. I have little familiarity with the environment of traditional education, and my parents’ negative views on college have colored my own. I wasn’t going to attend college, but it’s now the most obvious option having failed my debut into the military. 
I want to give college a shake but I’m intimidated by it. And while my parents always support me, I know that they don’t put much stock in higher education. They think the military is better because of the fiscal benefits. Better job security, better experience, boosts confidence, etc. I think I tend to agree with them. 

Then there are the commonly touted perceptions of college- Too expensive, too political, degrees are of less value than before, and college can’t guarantee a decent job. That said, I don’t feel ready to give the military another try. I’ve always been more of a thoughtful person and I feel my abilities might be better suited to an educational environment, although I do lack experience as a conventional student. 

If any you could help me weigh these conceptions on merit of truth, that would be great. I’m 20 years old and I have no real direction.",19Jun2020,2

972,"   

Disclaimer: This might be long and awfully formatted, I apologize, I just need to get this off my chest and seek advice on what to do, if anything. 

My family consists of me, parents, and sister (whom is mid-twenties). To cut exposition short, my mom basically suffered a lot of financial abuse from my father and his family when they got married young. My mom’s family had moved countries, and so she was mostly alone. They had my sister, and he proceeded to basically be nonexistent as a parent, even believing she wasn’t his blood. Then they made a money agreement, which led to his family stealing a lot of money from my mother. We moved to the US when I was a toddler, and my mother had to stay beside him for 15 years taking car of me and my sister. We lived here for almost the entirety of my life, and throughout it, because of the idiot my father is, we always struggled to get money (for example, to pay for my sister’s college funds, such as books and classes). 

Mom, sis, and I were tight-knit because of how we endured lots of shitty things together. Whether it be father’s financial abuse, relative’s being awful people, and more we were close. Things started rotting away for a few years and escalated incredibly quickly until now we separated. The prospect of moving back to have a better life, as my father began to repent for his actions and would work our living whilst me and her studied professionally, became an option. That didn’t happen when my sister graduated, before the moving agreement, and happened a few months after I graduated. The issue with that was that she decided to stay and told us a week before our flight and moved out a few days later. Mom and I moved countries, sis stayed with her bf after fights with my mom and dad, and now our contact is strained.

Conflict began when it came to my sister’s current boyfriend \[J\]. When they met they started out fine. Though he didn’t have a job nor went to college. My mother got tired of how often he came over because she wanted my sister and him to go out more. She talked with one of a relative (relatives are POS) and got him a job. She expected that to give him money for himself an to take my sister out more while she tried to study for a career. Boyfriend is a “half and half” dude, which conflicted with mom’s ideals of a relationship. I sided on my sister on that front, however things started to change. My sister, on the other hand, wasn’t, and from my perspective generally poured more into the relationship than he does. Here are some things my family noticed about him. My mom had health issues where she couldn’t do much without starting to grow in pain (she and sis went to the doctor and doc told my sis the pain she endures everyday and how she never has a “good day”).

\- An example is how she once bought him a collection of the dragon balls (bigger than a fist with the stars inside, made out of glass) for his birthday, while he gave her a rainbow metallic knife for hers. 

\- He started having issues with the fact that each Sunday we went to the movies as a family, which before he had his job he never payed. Afterwards he only paid for his ticket.

\- He’d often become irritated when she asked to go out to eat. She would sometimes order a larger meal to bring to us to taste at home. This infuriated him. 

\- Said mom was lying about her health to manipulate sister into staying by her side forever, even calling it “stress.” If my mom ever stood up without pain, he would call her out to my sister. 

\-My mom always had things to do on her mind, such as house chores, yard sales, or family days for the three of us. Unfortunately, it conflicted with my sister’s plans to go out since neither communicated what they wanted to do; sometimes even when they did she would still want go out the same day we had to do something. 

\-One Christmas we had spent with my mom’s family (she’s close to my grandparents which is why we went), and it turned out to be my grandpa’s last Christmas. We had planned a “Santa comes by” event for them to see. It was already late into the night, and my sister then asked us if we could go to bf’s house to spend some time there. Mom asked if it could wait until after the event, as she was gleeful at my grandpa’s reaction to the event, but she insisted. Mom relented and so we went. When we got there, she got down to knock at the door and out came the bf. From my perspective she started crying and apologizing while the bf stood nonchalantly looking at her. Eventually after a few hours, we went back to the party (event had ended), and went back home. Turns out the bf didn’t let us in because we were late (around 12 am) and he wouldn’t let us inside as we had offended him. Mom then after used this day to show my sister that she’s not being shown the same value she shows him.

\-One New Year’s Eve her bf stayed with our family. It was a normal night until really late when I heard yelling (fell asleep early). Turns out mom, dad, sister, and bf started talking about their relationship after a few drinks. I don’t know what caused it, but sister’s bf decided to berate my mother on how much of a toxic mother she was. He called her manipulative, toxic, abusive, and a bunch of other things to her face. Basically, whatever my sister ranted about her to him he decided to state, putting her between a rock and a hard place. She told him to leave and he did, my sister trailing behind him apologizing for how my parents acted. Ever since then (few years ago), he hasn’t apologized for it. He came back “to the family” (ie entering our house) after my grandpa’s death.

\- The most recent one was July 4th last year, where the bf decided to stay with us a bit. Late into the night he became incredibly erratic and then spontaneously left. Sis disappeared so we all thought she went with him. Turns out bf had left her crying outside in the street because he was pissed, they didn’t spend any time with his family (despite the fact we sent Christmas with his family). It was very late at night and to me he left her in a very vulnerable state without regard to her.

\- The day before my graduation my sis decided to leave with J to eat. They didn’t come back until the next morning, and so whatever plans my mom had to celebrate (balloons and such) went out the window. 

\- We had planned to visit an antique train one day as a family trip. Sis went out the day before and came back at 7 am. It was a three-hour drive and the event started at 10 to ride the train. She knew of the event and to me forfeited it for a night out. 

\-They went to college together. Sis wanted some shared classes with J, and often times you would see her the night before frantically looking for available classes because J had already chosen hi and never wanted to tell her. 

\-J would always joke about how he would “steal my sister from us” or how, when my mom called my sis “her baby” or “my girl,” he would say “not for long.”

\-When we needed J’s help cause of a car problem he never answered any calls as he was “studying and had no time for interruptions”  
 

There’s more things that have happened, but I have terrible memory. What ended up happening was that my sis and mom started fighting consistently over my sister’s relationship, or about when she would go out as it conflicted with any things we had to do or days we wanted to spend as a family here before we moved countries. We ended up not doing any of these “family events prior to moving” because sis “never had the time.” Any time we would get an extension to the moving date she would already be planning events with her friends, sometimes even after the moving date expecting us to change the date for financial reasons. Thing is my mom did often agree too her days alone. She even cooked food for her friends when they had planned a camping trip. Though they often fought, sis almost always ended up going out. 

Things escalated when she told us a week before our final moving date that she was going to stay in the country. The plan to move was a benefit to all of us as she and I would be able to study in a high class university outside the country and live a more stable life due to the monetary exchange rates. She didn’t even let us discuss this as she immediately left the house as she said that and moved in wither her bf’s family. We changed the date two months to discuss her decision. As the date came closer, her and my mother increasingly fought over her decision. Sometimes it became full on fights. She one time said that she would call the cops on us if we didn’t giver her the stuff she had in the garage that was hers. (To this day she hasn’t gone for it, despite having been over a year ago that she moved).

Things haven’t gone better, and my father (the coward he is) yells at my mother for being the problem as to why she left. My mom feels betrayed over how she acted prior to leaving, and is hurt every time she hears how “she’s doing fine, happy” from her family. Now apparently my sister has stated that she plans to be pregnant with J and plans to just work at McDonald’s. To me the issue is that she hasn’t finished college yet, and is planning a life-changing decision with someone whom I feel isn’t worthy of her and has shown it time and time again. My dad has started trying to coddle her, and basically blocks me and my mother put when we call him out for how he acts. I’m at a loss of what to do, can you help?",19Jun2020,1
973,"TLDR: my sister refuses to lower volume on her phone while watching tiktoks around the house, making me listen to the same annoying 8 second sound clips all day for weeks on end, until the next trend comes along, and the cycle repeats. 

————————————————————————-

Sorry this definitely isn’t as serious as some other ones on here, but this is seriously grinding my gears so much that they break. 

No matter what, my (16m) sister (13f) always chooses to watch her tiktoks in the living room, kitchen, family room, anywhere but her room. She refuses to use her AirPods that my mom got her. The thing that makes this so irritating is that I have to hear the same 8 second clips from songs or movies all damn day whenever I try to live in my house normally. 

Now I actually use tiktok on a nearly daily basis since I have a horror themed series that has been getting a lot of traction recently, but what’s so annoying about tiktok is how these sound clips are trending for weeks at a time without them changing hardly at all, a lot of them being really vulgar. The fact that these completely meaningless songs get on the radio baffles me but that’s beside the point.

I’ve asked her several times in the past to please just simply use her earbuds/airpods or whatever, or even to just turn the volume down but she exclusively responds with either “who asked” or just silence. My mom doesn’t care. 

I know I could avoid it by going somewhere else in the house, but our house is very small and it’s hard to be in one place for a while before getting bored. 

I’m sick of this. I’m not going to be spending my partly-quarantined summer dealing with this issue. Can anyone help me with this?",19Jun2020,1

977,"I (a female teenager) have a younger brother who is 13, we both live in our parents house. If I were to describe him in a sentence, it would be- He is a loud, selfish prick who is addicted to the family computer.

He cannot handle simple chores, it has taken him over three years to be able to do the dishes within the same day he is asked without crying and screaming. And even when he does them he leaves the pots dirty and doesn't properly wash everything. Dishes aren't the only thing though, he gets royaly pissed off when asked to walk the dogs, or even bring cups and glasses down from the computer desk. It's at the point now where my parents joke about how upset he gets when he is asked to do ANYTHING.

His computer habits are awful. From the second he wakes up to the minute he goes to bed (give or take an hour or two) he is on the family computer. When he is on the computer he talks loudly to his friends and can be heard from anywhere in the house. When he isn't talking to them he is playing alone, where he gets frustrated and starts slamming his hands on the keyboard, which also can be heard from anywhere in the house. And god forbid I want to play computer games, if I go on he will beg me to let him back on every half hour.

He is a huge hypocrite, he will yell at me for missing dishes when I wash them, or when I make ""too much noise"" from the computer desk, the worst racket I made was from quote ""clicking the mouse to much"".

He will never do anything unless it benefits him, not even talking to his sister. Everytime he has a conversation with me he ends up asking for me to make him food or drive him somewhere. The only reason he does chores in the house is so that he has grounds to stand in when begging our parents for allowance money.

The worst part is that I am not allowed to talk to him about any of this. Every time I bring up the fact that his habits bother me, I am stared down by my parents and told in private not to cause issues or ""act like a parent"".

Normaly I would be able to tolerate him, we go to different schools, him in middle school me in high school, and are almost never on the same floor of our house, because I stay in the family room on the first floor and he is constantly on the computer on the second floor.

This all changed with quarentine and summer, now we actually have to interact with eachother and after three months of this I am at my breaking point! I would like to know ways I could try talking to him or how others dealt with similar situations so that I can survive this summer without snapping.",19Jun2020,2

I could just stop it. I have no idea what the other person would think though, as it's kinda like ghosting. I could try to create conversation, but there usually isn't anything to go off on their third selfie, so anything I could say would be off-topic and a bit out of nowhere.

982,"19 y/o Male here.  My dad has pretty much avoided contact with my mother/the family for the past week, I require advice on what to do about it.

A bit of backstory on my dad, he is 42, an asthmatic, works very hard, and is an overall good person.  He came from a poor and broken upbringing, his mother divorced his father and mistreated him during his entire childhood. Now married, he had 7 children with his wife, with me being the oldest.  We live in a decently sized house. A weird thing about him that he's always believed, is that the cleanliness of our home is a sign/measure of how much his wife; my mother; cares about him.  He is asthmatic, so things do have to be somewhat clean for him to breathe easily, but it's always been a challenge to keep up with due to how many people live in our house total.

&amp;#x200B;

A week prior my parents had a fight over what had been made for dinner by my mom.  My dad complained that it made his stomach upset and told my mother to ask some of my siblings if they were feeling nauseated too.  (Something was off about what she had made, I think a couple of the ingredients had gone bad).  When my mother came back and reported otherwise, he became enraged with her and began yelling.  My mother didn't want any confrontation with him so she simply walked away.

My father followed her out and continued yelling at her, telling her that she kept the house in a filthy state all the time, and even went so far as to smack her in the face.  After he walked away, I followed him and confronted him about what he did, and told him to go apologize.  Now, I never get involved when they fight, since it's between the two of them and doesn't involve me, but I did this time.

He apologized, but they both continued to argue afterwards, which mainly consisted of my dad complaining about the nasty dinner and how she was trying to kill him with it/dirtiness of the house.  They went back and forth arguing over past and present, over and over, till finally they just both stalked off.

Since that day, about a week ago, he has not eaten with the family, has said little to my mom, and has slept in his office on his couch instead of in his bedroom.  Keep in mind, my mother isn't angry with him about it all, he has put himself in this self imposed exile.  Today, we got a delivery for a futon for my dad.  I found that he ordered it for his office to replace his couch.

I require counsel on this matter.  I love my father very much, and so do my siblings and my mother.  What can I do to get through to him and get him to rejoin the family?",19Jun2020,1
983,"
Hi everyone. I’m gonna be thorough here just so I can see my options.

I am 20 years old, a rising finance junior in a nearby university. I work part-time in retail and get paid $14 per hour. I live in Massachusetts. 

Reason for moving out: I’d like to live independently and be away from my parents (not because they are the worst, but they still treat me like a baby/child. e.g. they never let me do my laundry, still require me to be home for dinner, or be home at curfew). I’d like to just have my own room as well (I share with my brother; I’m a girl and never had the privacy).

I found an apartment with two other people. The rent would be $433/month plus utilities. Which is very cheap for my location. 

This would be my expenses monthly if I move out of my parents house:

Rent:  $433


Utilities:  $80


Car insurance:  $150


Phone bill:  $50


Tuition:  $243


Groceries + personal:  $200


Gas:  $60


Spotify: $4.99


= around $1230.

I have $4,000 in savings right now and work 25 hours per week. I will be working 30 hours when I go back to school. My income minus taxes would be around $1500 when I start school. I think I’ll be able to make it, since I have savings and also work.

984,This is gonna be pretty nsfw!!! I’m 18f and have been feeling more sexual but i have this weird thing with me where I cannot orgasm :/ like I cant even do it myself half the time. With penetration I bleed half the time and it’s just not comfortable... but I get naturally very wet so I don’t think lubrication is a problem :/ The thought of sex and everything sexual related turns me on but it just doesn’t really feel that good. I never thought that this would be something to be ashamed of but I am. I’ve grown comfortable with it but I think in long terms if I find someone to be with could that be an issue for someone else? I love giving but due to this I don’t really like receiving. I think it would be nice to achieve an orgasm with someone but idk. I read something about a porn block which I think I may have but i’ve been working on it. I haven’t watched porn in months and i’ve been trying on just discovering myself more but it’s really hard and frustrating. I cant just make myself horny and it’s pointless to just try when i’m not.

987,"Tw: insinuations of child abuse/sexual assault? Idk

Hi guys, ive been trying to find a good therapist for a while but have been struggling. I though I found a good one. The first session I really vibed with her, the second... not so much. It felt like she was trying to shove a bunch of natural healing spirit stuff down my throat.  

She was talking about things like emotional channels getting tangled and a type of therapy she called emdr that I think she said was supposed to help me remember things I had forgotten. 

She strongly believes that everything is the results of somethding that has happened before and that my issues right now are the results of something I'm suppressing. 

So far I'm willing to play along, I'll give anything a fair shot and insurance is covering telehealth rn, but problem is it goes farther then that. It feels like she's trying to insinuate my family sexually asaulted me as a child. I can handle that if its real and learn to cope, I'm just scared she may somehow convince me of something false if I even give her one wrong sliver of info. I trust my family more then I trust myself and I never want to see them that way.

 The only reason I would be open is if it actually was a real therapeutic practice. 

So what do you think? If ur a therapist are those real practices? If ur a regular person does that sound even vainly legit? Have u heard anything bad about those practices? Anything good?

Ive got enough issues already that I dont want to get even more trauma and stress to wade through. 

Ps: pls say if ur a therapist. This wont count as any form of therapy or tharapist/client relationship. I just want to know from a professionals pov if those are real practices. 

Thanks ahead of time for any help!",19Jun2020,1
990,"I live in a southern part of Texas (might be the reason) and they’ve opened up almost everything not to long ago, now there’s more increasing cases of the virus once again. However there are many business keeping it hidden if someone had gotten a positive on the test.

I’ve been switched positions at work to something I have no experience in and that unfortunately requires me to have close contact with people consistently through out the day while also having to take on tasks and duties untrained and told to just google it or relax.

Several times I’ve been told to either downplay something, or told off for not doing a task that I was never aware existed as again I am untrained and have never done this position before. They hired someone who could have taken it, but instead put them somewhere else and told me that it’ll be just for a while till some event that I suddenly had to plan.

A couple of weeks turned to two months, now it’s three months and they’re not going to give me back my old position I know it because they want me to take over some specific administrative work that I will have to be trained by some council of approvals or whatever.

They’re not asking me either they’re just telling me this is what will be. I was a private contract with them and now was hired in at the same pay, despite my six month review was suppose to come up so I could get a raise. Found out from another employee that they haven’t given people raises and one employee who’s been here 3 years is still at the same pay they had. 

While this is going on of course the COVID is also becoming an extreme issue as we deal with people from many different small towns and cities (we are clustered together) and a few people had admited to being in contact with people who tested positive.

I had originally warned them this would happen of course since people are generally irresponsible and you can’t keep track of everyone and what they do outside of the building.

There’s been more cases building back up once again, of course, and now I’m head of the entry way checking everyone who comes in, even employees, but some refuse and enter to a different area ignoring what management is forcing me to do.


My own job in particular is trying to enforce the safety precautions now but clearly it’s not gonna work since everyone half asses the rules. And of course it’s those that aren’t even dealing with the general public that are doing this. Other businesses are doing the same and keeping it quiet if someone did test positive (just basically letting them go but not reporting it) and some places don’t even close down to get disinfected.

I feel like even reporting some of these businesses that are keeping it hidden wouldn’t even help the situation as I’m sure every place is having issues. 

At the same time quitting, while it is an option, is not something I or many of us can’t let go of at the moment. Because the job we have isn’t hiring for more and other places, well basically  there isn’t much offers right now and even unemployment isn’t much of an option for others.

It honestly is a huge mess and I’m not so much as stress about the virus but more so that everything that I have worked so hard to keep and maintained so I can improved my previously fucked up life is going under once again so fast because of stupid fucks who want to sweep things under the rug and just saying everyone has to do their part to take on more work, while conviently only piling it on to two employees with very low pay grades. 

Honestly, there are moments where I think maybe suicide really would have been the better option if I just didn’t try to seek help long ago. Every step forward feels like miles back because of this location and any time I try to get out something fucked happens.

What could I even do? If there is anything I could do actually? Honestly I’m just tired.. and I don’t know when finally I’ll stop being tired.",19Jun2020,1

993,"I'm almost 20 (F) and I have never dated anyone, but almost a year ago l met someone l actually liked more than I fancied. 

He was really intelligent (one of those math olimpiad people) and that is one of the things that won me over the most, and to this day I can't stop comparing myself to him and feeling bad because he is so much more accomplished than I am. I know it has no point to compare myself to others, but it still hurts terribly. 

Back to the main story, 
We would hang out sometimes amd he was one of the nicest and most caring people I had the chance of spending time with. 
 Even though  I knew he just doesn't see me that way, I told him how I felt, hoping to get rejected and get on with my life, but I still felt the same afterwards.

He still wanted to be my friend, but it was making me too sad. 
I eventually ghosted him completely, I deleted his number and MY own social media accounts (Instagram and fb are useless, plus now I can't stalk him anymore, so it was convenient solution)

So now, we don't talk, I can't get in touch with him even if I wanted to. 
 I do have stuff to do, and he is not a part of my life anymore, I am sure he probably forgot I even exist, and we haven't talked since December, 
which is reasonably long time to get over something trivial. 

But I don't understand why do I still think about him, why do I miss him so much, why do I hope to see him passing by, even if I know that he is thousands of miles away now, and none of it will happen. 

I'm so mad at myself, I'm trying to fight my obsession, but I feel hopeless because I'm so irrational.

My brother was the ONLY  one of these members to say  ""we should invite them""

fack name: She dumb

fake name: Like

fake name: 300% dumb

The party happens and everything’s fine, and eventually everyone goes home so it is just me, my friend, and my brother. As a little context, my friend and brother do Not get along. He thinks she is a terrible friend (which I didn’t believe at first, but here we are...) so I usually don’t like hanging out with him when she’s over. Anyway, we’re watching TV when they start getting weirdly cuddly and touchy. I told them to stop multiple times and they didn’t so eventually I just bring my friend back to my room. It’s there where she tells me that he asked her on the couch if she would come to his room when I’m asleep to have sex. I was totally grossed out. Then she asked me for my permission, saying she would never do it if I wasn’t comfortable. I have said “don’t have sex with my brother” multiple times before (she had a thing with my best friend’s brother a few months ago and I said in my position it would NOT be happening) so she knew my stance on it. Still, after I already said no she started BEGGING me to let her have sex with him. I again said no. She then asked if she could at least go to his room and tell him that she wasn’t going to do anything with him and I said fine (not stellar reasoning on my part, but other cognitive factors were involved). She leaves and after three minutes I go to his room to see what’s up and she’s lying pantsless on his bed. I was heartbroken that she would prioritize sex over our friendship. 

We have texted a few times since then, mostly her apologizing and me saying that I need time to process. But I’m done processing. I have been looking back on our friendship and I realized that she is just not someone I want to be around. I don’t want to make this post longer than it already is, but she has done many other things like this (not quite to this degree though) before and I’m just done. 

Sorry for all of that background, but that’s the context for where I need advice. She texted me today and said “Would you be willing to call me sometime?” What do I say?

1001,"i’m copy and pasting a big portion of this from my post last night on r/offmychest

i’m desperate for any advice that can help from the collapse of my relationships around me.  

heads up that i’m 18f

since nov 2018, when my grandfather shot himself  in front of my great grandmother, i haven’t felt okay. i was already in a depressive episode as i’d moved across the country from my year long partner at the time. being vague for my protection, within that six months i was raped, and went through a break up. i blamed myself for all three occurrences that happened in that short period, and still struggle to cope on occasion. 

i made it out that summer okay. i visited my grandmother who has been taking care of her mom since my grandfather committed suicide (the trauma of seeing him shoot himself made her dementia and alzheimer’s progress rapidly.) it was a nice break. 

my family moved back to our home state and i moved in with my current partner of six months. i came down with my family for the initial move. 

i was supposed to fly out tomorrow. 

when i arrived, that sunday i decided to visit and stay with my grandmother and her mother. despite being my great grandma, she has always been as if she was just another grandmother. she did everything she could for us, especially in my younger years. not everyone gets to spend their formative years with a great grandparent, but i did. despite being at the age of 93; 75 years my senior, she had been a prominent figure in my life. 

my grandmother was quick to inform me before i saw my grandmother that she’d been in some pain that day, let alone in the recent months. she spent 4 hours of the entire day in her chair in the living room, and the rest asleep in her room. her first words were to me, “i’m glad you came to see me, i don’t have much time left.” i couldn’t help but roll my eyes that at despite her pain, she was written with a clean bill of health for her age. she’d also been telling that to my father and brother who visited two weeks before moving down. my whole family was back in town, my younger sister and mother being the only of the two who hadn’t made it out to see her yet, as she was sleeping when they’d come over. 

i told her i loved her, and soon enough she was off to bed. she told me goodnight as my grandmother helped her to her room. 

i’d left some time the next day, just to come back the next. that night, id told her i was happy to see her. we didn’t talk much as she was watching Yellowstone with my grandmother in the living room, before talking of some pain in her left leg. my grandmother said she was gonna put her to bed soon, so i hopped in the shower. i took my time, even watched a video while i was at it. when i got out of the shower, i walked past the living room to see her lying on the floor with my grandmother on the phone with 911. 

i told myself if was okay. my grandmother has fallen before, even once when i was watching her. i just called my father and he picked her up and all was well. 
she’d audibly broken her leg this time, though. and it was visible. 

knowing i couldn’t help as EMTs were on their way, i gathered my grandmothers dogs and didn’t say a word as this was “the drill.” they said it just looked bruised, but sure enough once they got to the hospital, she’d broken it and it required surgery as soon as possible. i spent the next two days as my grandmother was at the hospital with her mom watching her dogs. one wouldn’t leave my great grandmothers bedroom. i was under the impression everything was okay. i even went out to catch up with a friend for a couple hours before coming back. i had a striking headache and laid down. i was called about an hour after and shit hit the fan. 

after telling my grandmother that she was going home right before surgery, she’d coded. 

she’d coded as they began preparing her for surgery. they brought her back, but this happened two more times before that was it. 

i hear my little sister saying things like, “i didn’t even get to see her!” and it does nothing but infuriate me. i understand she’s grieving but since we’d moved, her last memories were of the great grandmother that was fully there mentally. she may not have been able to walk fully but she still ate. she still watched NCIS until she fell asleep. she was still herself. 

the last time i saw her i didn’t say a word. she was lying on the floor. last time i heard her speak or anything was her pained moans as she cried out for my grandmother who was gathering paperwork for the hospital. 

i just can’t stop thinking about what if i had talked to her more? what if i had kept her busy in the living room, so she didn’t try and move herself to the couch? what if i hadn’t needed to shower right then and there, and taken my time, would i have had a real opportunity to say goodbye at some point down the line? 

at the same time, i struggle. i don’t believe in any organized religion; but i believe in some higher power. i believe there was some reason things happened the way they did. i also believe her old ass knew what was happening, or had some decision on when it was going to. i was supposed to leave at 9:30 am tomorrow, but i was conveniently on a leave of absence from work that i can extend. out of all the falls she’s had, she’s never been injured besides maybe a bruise. my whole family came back and within less than a week, she’s gone. she knew my grandmother wouldn’t be okay after her husband suicide a year and a half before without her family near. her son. so when we appeared, she knew it was time and left. 

i’m so emotionally confused. i haven’t been emotionally available for a while. i normally just sleep. i don’t have any hobbies any more and i have no motivation for anything. i stopped getting adrenaline rushes in life threatening situations. i didn’t think i could feel genuine sadness until today. it serves as a bittersweet wake up call— i’m not okay but i’m okay. 

i don’t know what to do as i don’t have much money and don’t know if i can afford a therapist at the moment. since my father got laid off due to COVID19, i won’t have health insurance after this month. i know i need help because i’m starting to get scared of myself. i feel like it’s repairable but i don’t know if i can fix it. i’m scared of falling down the same path i did with my grandfathers suicide that i haven’t fully recovered from, or my assault. i’m not even sure if i’m mentally okay enough right now. 

i’m confused emotionally. im scared of the damage this may cause on my relationship, and i can’t really afford to end it even regarding my situation. i’m freshly 18 and i live with him and his mother, and i cant afford to live on my own despite having a job if something were to happen (not that i’m counting on it.) i’m just terrified of not being able to emotionally recover, i’m so scared of being this way forever because i’ve been this way for over a year now.",19Jun2020,3

Its not the first time about 4-5 years ago this happened before, and it was for 3 year that  I did struggle with suicidal thoughts but I never told anyone and basically couldn't handle them at all and did attempt to drown myself but gave up because I knew it would take to long.

1007,"So I work in a supermarket. For like a year I got promised to get promotion, but there was always something going on so I had to wait. A few weeks ago I got a call where he told me I can do a course and I would finally be able to get promoted. Ofc I said yes and did the course.  


Last week two coworkers got promotion. I had not worked yet so I thought I will hear it later. At my shifta my teamleader already went home so I thought maybe something was going on. So now I was thinking of waiting how the weekend shifts went or else I would text him.   


But now I heard from my coworker she bumped into my teamleader in the bus. She asked who else would get promotion and he only named the other two. So basically, even tho he told me I would get promotion, he was never planning to do so.  


I get so tired of this situation and I feel used, since I basically work at the days and time nobody actually wants to work. I honstly don't really know what to do bc its clear he doesn't want me to promote. I cant quit bc its pays well and have a permanent contract which is nice since I am a student and really need a job. My teamleader also never tells me when they are doing something different, which makes me always get complaints about ""forgettin stuff"" I didnt know I had to do. Which is also really annoying and makes me feel he wants me to fail or something.   


I feel lost and I really dont know what to do in this situation. Does anyone has any advice for me?

So I get to be with this people, and even though I didn't fit in (I never do with the people of my age), I felt comfortable and had a bit of fun, which was more that enough for me. But all of the sudden, one day I'm with this people and she comes, and I lost my mind. And, worst of all, she's coming to a kind of party (well stay in a friend's house all night until next day in the morning).

1012,"My son is ten years old and recently finished the fourth grade. I'm sure every parent would say this, but he's always been a very compassionate and kind kid. I've gotten emails from his teachers about how sweet and helpful he is to other students, and I've seen him go out of his way to include kids he sees by themselves. I know I'm biased, but he really does have a good heart. Throughout his life, I've tried my very best to raise him socially conscious. My husband and I are both proud feminists, and we've been sure to give him female role-models and educate him about feminism and equity. I thought that he was very responsive to this, but I guess I was somewhat mistaken.

My son was at an (all boys) birthday party yesterday. (Don't worry, it was all very socially distanced.) Late last night, my husband and I received messages from the parents of several girls in his class saying that he and his friends sent inappropriate text messages to their daughters during the party. ""Your boobs look hot,"" ""I want to grind on you,"" ""You turn me on,"" etc etc. All of the things you would expect from a fourth grader trying to be sexual.

I was deeply, *deeply* disturbed to hear this. This type of behavior is of course absolutely unacceptable even when self contained, but I'm also concerned about what this could spiral into in his future if it goes misaddressed. Sure, it's a few text messages now (which, again, is unacceptable on its own), but who knows what kind of seeds could be planted if he gets the idea that this behavior is okay. The parents of the daughters involved are trying to get the school administration involved, which I would be in full support of, but we live in a very conservative area and frankly I would be surprised if the school gave anything more than ""boys will be boys"" and a slap on the wrist.

So now here we are and I have no idea what to do. I want to punish him, of course, but I'm a strong believer in empathetic parenting as well - that is, making him understand *why* what he did was wrong rather than just getting angry. I want him to really, empathetically understand the kind of impact that this behavior can have, and not do it again in the future because he believes that it's wrong, not because he's afraid of getting punished. That only leads to a ""don't get caught next time"" mentality. Right now, I'm planning on having him write personal apologies to the girls he sent messages to, but even that could feel like a chore to him rather than an opportunity for empathy if I don't approach it right. I just don't think I know what ""right"" looks like.

I'm facing another dilemma here too: his younger sister. She's only eight and she looks up to her brother with shining eyes. He feels the same way about her. He helps her out with her homework during his free time without ever being asked by my husband or me, he actively includes her in his games with his friends even though she's younger, he used to read stories to her at bedtime, etc. They have one of the best sibling relationships I've seen. I have no idea how to talk to her about this, if at all. Typically, I let the punishment of one sibling be between us and I don't talk to the other about it - the humiliation is unnecessary and cruel. But I don't know if it would be socially irresponsible of me to not talk to her about it in some capacity, and I don't know if I could hide it from her even if I wanted to. Whatever punishment we land on, it's almost certainly going to be something she notices.

I am really, really at a loss here. I love my son to the world and beyond (as I'm sure any parent does), and I really want to approach this with empathy. But I also know exactly how terrible this kind of behavior is, as someone who has been on the receiving end of it in the past. I want him to *get it,* but I don't know what more I can do than what I've already done throughout his upbringing. I'm posting this to multiple subs in an attempt to get different perspectives. Any advice is much, much appreciated. And don't be afraid to criticize me, either - I'm trying to be introspective with this, so if you think my tone or the way I'm approaching this is wrong, please let me know how I can do better. Thank you.",19Jun2020,3
1013,"Notice: This will probably be a long read

I turn 23 this year and want to share my story up till now involving my upbringing, the effects I believe it has had on me and where I am now in life. This situation is pretty broad and I am interested in any thoughts you guys have on it, but to focus what I want from this I would say just advice on what you think I should do moving forward.

So my parents had me at 18, the year they graduated from high school. We live in a very poor area of the country and both of them were really starting from scratch. (what I mean by this is that they both come from broken homes, both grew up without a father figure, and in general did not have any sort of support system for their own lives much less for helping raise a child aka me) when I was around 3 they had my first brother and got married shortly after. My brother was diagnosed with autism around the age of starting school so I believe I was around 10 or so. From what I can remember about my life up to this point everything was relatively normal, I mean we were always living paycheck to paycheck, we had a really small family circle and everyone was doing about the same, and of course I was young and didn’t understand everything at the time. We were living with my paternal grandmother at the time after having moved around a lot and my third brother was born shortly after. We moved to a new area that had slightly better schools and my parents finally had their own place. 

Things were looking up because my father got a job in the oilfield and was able to make more to support us (my mom did not have a job). I was in like 5th grade at this point and up till now had been in a different school nearly every year. Obviously being the new kid every year sucked but I made friends pretty quick in this new school and things were okay for a while. Around 6th grade I started to mature enough to realize that my mother was developing a really bad alcohol dependency. I know this had been an on and off thing for quite some time but me and my brothers were way too young to understand and a lot of those memories are quite blurry and my parents did an okay job of making things seem normal. 

Well this recent development very quickly came to the forefront of our lives with my father being away in the oilfield for extended periods of time. My life was changing and before I knew it and realized what was going on I would come home from school to my mother completely wasted and more often than not already asleep in the middle of the day. I was 11 or 12 and Seemingly out of no where I was put in a position of taking care of my brothers because my mother was unable to. I would get home and have to find food for us to eat because she would sleep through the day. I didn’t realize how much this effected me until much later in life, I was just numb to a lot of things at this point and felt like my days were on autopilot. My second brother was only two years younger than me but for obvious reasons he did not understand and so there was a large wave of isolation and confusion going on at this point in my life. 

My mother was on her second DWI at this point, something I obviously did not understand fully at this point. There was a large strain on our family and at one point there was talk of divorce. I have a memory burned in my head of my mother talking to me while completely wasted saying that her and my father might split up and I needed to decide who I wanted to live with. I was like a preteen, with no one to talk to about this and I think pieces of me just started to shut down. I felt like I didn’t really have parental figures anymore, I was so confused about everything in life and I lost all trust for my mother and my dad was away often working his ass off trying to make enough to keep this ship from sinking. I became very distant from everything. I would get home and just go to my room for the rest of the day. This was a really dark period in our family’s life and so much happened and I think I started automatically repressing the things around me trying to get some sort of balance. My mother continued having trouble with the law because of driving intoxicated (sometimes with us in the car) she did jail time for a couple of months at some point and around the time I started middle school she was forced to take AA classes and got her license suspended for a while. By this time my father had managed to work his way into a supervisory position at the local plant for the company he worked for and was able to work a more normal schedule and be around again. We moved again but thankfully we were able to stay in the same school system. For a while things were better. My mom was staying sober from what I could tell and things were starting to look normal again. She completed her program and eventually got her license back but had to do random drug tests and had a breathalyzer installed in her car so that it would not start unless she blew clean. 

By this point I had such deep scars and had built this shell around me just to be able to breathe. My parents were just kids in their own right with very little life experience. We just pushed forward like it never even happened. I had friends at school and my life felt normal when I was out of my house for the most part. But I was forced to grow up so much in such a short amount of time and it just was hard to be a normal kid. It was like I was just watching life go by. 

I was really introspective and trying to figure out where my life was supposed to head at this point in my life. I had a lot  of resentment for the environment around me and sometime in 8th grade something clicked in me. I decided I would do whatever it took to make sure that I could get out of my shitty small town and not make the same mistakes my parents and other people around me made. The only way out that I could see was college. I threw myself into my education. Over the next couple of years there were episodes where drinking would become a problem again. I was just trying to get through high school and mostly focusing on that. Once I could drive there were a few times where my mother would pick us up from the car rider line drunk, and we would get into an argument and I would force her to pull over so I could drive us home. 

Come senior year My parents finally got a divorce. I had laser focus on my future and trying to keep my brothers safe. That is all I cared about. My relationship with my parents at that point was more like friends than parents. I don’t feel like Ive learned much of anything from them and I had been very independent since a young age at this point. 

My mother came home drunk after picking up my brothers from school (I had a car at this point at was driving to half days the second half of my senior year so I was already home) she was planning on getting in the car and leaving, and she was guilt tripping my youngest brother into going with her. I intervened and took her keys from her and told her she is not driving him while drunk, I told her she could go but my brother is staying and to just leave. This escalated further than any disagreement me and my mother had ever had. She tried to fight me to get her keys back. (throwing punches and trying to pin me against things.) she only was able to scratch me up a little as she was falling all over her self because of how intoxicated she was. 

My mother was never abusive toward any of us prior to this. Long story short this went on for about an hour and she managed to get her keys and my little brother while panicing slipped into the car. She was able to get in and lock the doors. I stood behind the car so she could not reverse. That was stupid I know. It worked though and I called my dad to come help me and he had to leave work. Police were called and a report was filed that never amounted to anything. I had graduated with a 4.0 and was due to head upstate to college in a couple of months and didn’t have any interest in fighting my mother on a domestic abuse case. At this point all that mattered to me was getting out of this shitty town and away from all of these broken people. 

Moving 3 hours away and restarting was a breath of fresh air. I had the time of my life in college and was able to heal from alot of what I came from. I feel like I was able to become a complete stable person and I have so many close friends and support around me now. I graduated with my bachelors last year (the first person in my family to do so) and got a nice starter job in the town my college is in. I have slowly rebuilt relationships with my mother over time after not speaking to her for nearly two years. For all intents and purposes I made it out. I am free I am happy and I am excited for the future. There is some things that I am carrying that still mess with me though. I feel an obligation to try and help what I came from. I see my parents for who they are faults or not and I understand their mistakes. I just feel like I am living a completely different life now and I dont know where I fit in the picture back home. I have been gone except for a few visits for nearly 5 years now. My parents still make mistakes. I mostly just want what is best for my brothers and to be there for them but it is so hard when I am not in that environment anymore, and they are still growing up in it. I want to help my parents too but I don’t know where to start. My father for the most part has done better for himself and he isn’t making the same mistakes. My mother has done some good for herself (she has apparently been sober for a few months now) but she makes such irrational decisions, so much stuff I have heard about that it would take way to long to get into that. I guess I just want to hear what you guys think. If there are any questions let me know!",19Jun2020,1
1014,"My beloved uncle, the best relative in the entire family, died a few years ago. Complications from diabetes and him not willing to make lifestyle changes. He was cremated alone, and sent to my parents (he and my dad are twins). There was no funeral, and the only memorial service was thousands of miles away. Now on to my moral dilemma, my uncle wanted his ashes scattered somewhere (not sure of location, will have to consult the will) my parents are definitely not going to do this. They don’t care to, don’t believe it matters and kinda think it’s silly. I don’t. I want his final wishes fulfilled and I’m happy to be the one to do it. I have a feeling if I ask, my parents will scoff and say no. I’ve been seriously considering just stealing my uncles ashes and replacing them with something else. Should I do this? Should I not?

1015,"(Skip to the bottom for the actual question portion, everything else is just background info) Hey, I should probably use a throwaway but whatever. So I kind of have a few problems, I have a problem with lying to myself about things, a tiny bit of lying to other people (not much, then again I could be lying to myself), attention seeking and  self consciousness. I guess I will start with the part about lying to myself. In the past I have essentially lied to myself and other people that I like something when I in fact did not; due to this I had to keep up my lie about liking thst thing. I understand that that is not such a big deal but I am afraid of that in the future I could lie about something more important and beneficial to my wellbeing. I also lied about liking this girl, I think. So I think I like her (also I’m a teen btw, which could explain my self consciousness) and I told her my feelings. Which surprisingly led to her saying that she also had feelings for me. This also could have stemmed from me saying (to myself) that I liked her which caused me to ask her out because I may have been and or still am self conscious about not having a significant other. So now onto attention seeking, yay. So basically I noticed how I call myself unattractive and ugly and things of that sort, and I began to think about it. I came up with the conclusion that I am fishing for compliments from other people which isn’t a good thing. Thst also ties in with my self consciousness. So the question that hopefully can be answered is, “how do I solve those problems?”",19Jun2020,1
1016,"So this actually isn't for me, this is for my husband.

My husband is a really nice, good person. I often say to his own detriment. An example would be he holds the door open for me when we walk through, the people behind us, and then several other groups of people. That kind of nice.

Anyway, my husband has been stressed out recently with work and I believe it is due to him not saying no to people when they just hand him tasks to do that aren't part of his job function. He doesn't like confrontation and he hates telling people no, but the issue is he is getting very stressed out with work now. He is losing sleep and his mental health is declining.

I've tried talking to him in the past about saying no to people but I'm worried that he is afraid of the confrontation. If anyone has any idea on how he can politely and professionally tell people no I am all ears.

1019,"I (19M) live with my uncle (45M) and I'm heading off to college in August. I get a social security check that I signed into his control years ago, but that's not enough for us to make it through. He works during the summers and that makes us enough money to get through. An important note is that when he works in a different state than the one we live in and where I've grown up.

Well, he's had a problem with me trying to make my own decisions for a while now but it's really coming to a head recently because of college. First it was him trying to force me to wait a year before I go to college. He wasn't even going to pay my college enrollment deposit, which was only $50. I finally got him to do that, after literal weeks of arguing. Something that shouldn't have been up to him wasn't. 

Now, it's about seeing my friends before I'm off to college in August. He's not giving me a choice in whether I want to see them or not. He's essentially telling me I'm not seeing anyone and that's final. He'll still be working in August but I don't go with him to work so there's absolutely no reason why I can't just stay with my father while he stays and works. 

I could go and live with my father right now until I start college, he'd let me and has said he will. Problem is, of I do that my uncle will cut me off completely and my father doesn't work or do much more than my uncle. I know it might seem wrong to stay with someone over money but I genuinely won't have enough to make it through if I don't. My social security check is only about $750 and since I have no work experience the most I could probably find would be a minimum wage job.

What can I do about this?",19Jun2020,1

We are on good terms now, should I bring up the past? I don't know if what I said years ago will ever come up, but would it be better to tell this person I said these things but no longer think these things before that ever happens? I'm considering if I want to tell them these things of what I said to this person just to assuage my own guilt for saying them in the first place",19Jun2020,1
1021,"I'm 18 M, I have been friends with an absolutely amazing lady who is also 18. We talked back in September but it ended up not working out. When it didn't work out the first time, it really messed me up. I've never felt that way about anyone before and I had no idea how to deal with it. It took me months to get over her, and it was even harder because we stayed friends, and I loved seeing her and being her friend, but it just made things harder.  


Then during quarantine, we started texting and calling so much more often, and called almost every night. We got to talking about parties, and long story short - she told me I was attractive but didn't want a relationship since we were both going 10 hours away from each other in the fall for college. So, we agreed to be friends with benefits.  


I was totally okay with this at first, I didn't feel anything for her romantically, and I was down to just have fun with her for our last summer together. This agreement happened 4 weeks ago. We haven't even done anything besides cuddle yet - no kissing or anything. (Which is fine, I don't want to force anything upon her.) But this past week, just seeing her and cuddling even with our other friends around, I'm starting to feel this love for her again. I know that if I tell her it will scare her off and I'll ruin the whole friend group's dynamic with the awkward tension, but it's so hard not to do anything. Yesterday and today have been the worst days yet. All I can do is think about her, I leave my phone face down and tell myself to not overthink but then I always find myself checking snap and my texts. I have no idea what to do. I want her, but I leave for college in 2 months and know I can't have her. I'm not willing to cut her out completely either, I just don't know what to do, she's always on my mind. I can't talk to my friends about any of this because they will tell her, so I'm here asking - open to any advice.",19Jun2020,1

1024,"**How do you write your lecture notes?**

I'm debating between using the laptop I have right now or buying an iPad pro + Apple pencil for notes.

I'm *thinking* of getting an iPad because:
- I feel like I'll retain more information when writing than typing on my laptop
- easier to annotate / draw tables (etc)
- can download your textbooks and annotate
- can sync straight away to your Google drive / back up easily

BUT
- it's really expensive. I have the money, but I'm thinking should I save it OR use it to buy the iPad+Apple pencil.
- is the battery life on the iPad + pencil good? 

What do you think?

Every year Father’s Day puzzles me. I can make him a card, but I never know what to write in it cause it’s difficult to get mushy with him.

1026,"So I have this issue going on with me and I've been figuring out what it is for about 5 years now. It basically comes down to immense amounts of stress about every possible and impossible little thing in the world. It got so bad that my body is canceling it out completely, causing me to block most of my emotions subconsciously, this is out of my control. 

I dislike this a lot cause small things can happen and I can have a complete meltdown/panic attack and I seriously wont know why. I never understand my emotions and most of the time I just feel frustrated and powerless because of it.

I do function, I have a job that I love, finished school for this year with flying colours and am starting college next year. I just feel like I barely experience anything except fear and sometimes relief.  It doesnt feel like I'm living my life cause feeling joy is a pretty rare occasion for me.

I am and have been in therapy for three years almost and it has helped me understand a lot better what's going on. I just have no idea how to go about fixing things and it seems that my therapist doesnt either. I might change therapists but I know that's going to be a new panic attack waiting to happen. 

Any advice at all would be hugely appreciated. This is very much impacting my quality of life and I would like to improve it. Thanks for reading",19Jun2020,1
1027,"tl;dr: My little cousin is 11F and started looking up porn. I'm 24F, we have a significant age gap and I feel like if I confront her she will be traumatized. What should I do?

Last year after my cousin turned eleven, her parents bought her a computer &amp;&amp; internet. This is her own personal computer, she has a larger desktop in the living room that mostly she uses as well. 

I set up the computer and Windows knew she was underaged, however, when I made an e-mail account for her mom to pay the internet bill through; I didn't log out so it created a YouTube account as well. 

Within a month, my cousin was looking up weird shit but I figured she couldn't actually see stuff because of SafeSearch and all. I only found out because I went over her house and she asked me to help her with something and as soon as I started typing in the tool bar ""sexy naked girls dancing"" came up. 

I told my 26M brother and we laughed about it. We figured we were going to just put her computer and browser on SafeSearch and lock it onto the browser. I figured if I changed the age on her YouTube account to 13, it would restrict her from watching inappropriate videos there as well. She looked up a lot of stuff about rape and lesbians, I figured it was curiosity. And I figured she was looking up stuff about rape because she was watching a ton of news videos about women being raped.

We know her parents are very bad with computers and would never find out unless they caught her in the act. My brother and I decided that we wouldn't do anything about it because we didn't want to traumatize her, she has a significant age gap with both of us and although we are much older than her she relies on us a lot. I did not want to tell my parents or her parents either, because I figured it would be taken care of if we just put her stuff on SafeSearch and the age-restriction on YT.

Now, fast forward six months - periodically I check what my cousin is watching or looking up from time to time and I see that she can't find/watch certain videos despite searching it up - so it's fine, right? I also knew she wasn't able to leave comments; I think once I age-restricted her account it made it so she no longer could. And quite honestly, I was glad because she was leaving hate comments on YT videos calling people ""bitch"" and telling them she hated them. I'm not sure what she did, but 2 months ago she's able to leave comments on videos again. And I think whatever she did, she made it so she can look crap up again. I looked at her history last night and it was a lot of porn. She was also clearly able to watch it. 

Not sure what to do now, I don't know how to age restrict her stuff. I don't know if I should tell my parents to tell her parents. I don't know if I should do anything at all, since it technically isn't my responsibility - her parents should be paying closer attention to what their only child is doing online. But I also can't blame them, they aren't tech savvy and she deletes it from the search bar but doesn't know how to delete it from her toolbar / search history / browser history. Whatever she's watching on YT is soft-core, but it's still disturbing. I don't know what she's looking up on google because I don't think I can look at her search history from my computer. 

I didn't watch porn growing up because we had a shared computer (my brother and I) - but my brother did and our parents caught him &amp;&amp; reprimanded him for it. That's my only experience with it. I'm not a mother, I don't have kids, I don't know how to take care of kids but IMO she should not be looking at this shit at such a young age. I think the curiosity is just inevitable though. Not sure what I should do - if anything at all.",19Jun2020,1
1029,"My mom and I (16F) have had issues when it comes to communication for as long as I can remember. We clash a lot (even though we’re really similar) and whenever we try to talk about our issues it ends in yelling and crying. This past November we started seeing a therapist together and it’s been helping but now I feel like we’re stuck and not in a good place. I see a therapist on my own for my mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, adhd) and so does my mom (she also has depression anxiety and adhd). Recently I’ve started medications that work well for me and I’ve been feeling pretty “normal” mentally which has been extremely refreshing and exciting because it’s been a long time since I’ve felt “normal”. I’ve been proud of myself for how far I’ve come and how much effort I put into helping myself, but then my relationship with my mother pops up and i feel like I’m losing all of that progress. At this point I’m at a loss, I don’t know what to do or say and I don’t know where things went wrong and how it got this way. I just wish I could communicate with my mom better and I wish I didn’t feel like she was angry at me all the time. Does anyone have any advice on this matter or similar experiences??",19Jun2020,1
1031,"I [16M] have this online friend [15F] who has been going through some stuff. I’ve been helping with her mental health. About a month ago, she tried to kill herself, and I managed to “Talk” her out of it. I tried everything and failed, I literally had to blackmail her by threatening to call emergency services on her to save her life. 

After her suicide attempt, one of her other online friends left her because of her being too much responsibility. Ever since then, she has become really clingy to me, having literally told me that I’m the only good thing in her life.

I just saw a comment from her on an ask reddit thread, saying that after I talked her out of killing herself, she tried to OD later that night. She told me that she was feeling sick the next day, and now I know why. 

I feel like I can’t trust her anymore. She lied to my face and went behind my back, trying to end her life again. I can’t trust her anymore, I think it would be best for me to just call emergency services now. It will probably ruin our friendship, as she is terrified of her family finding out about her mental health. 

I know where she lives, but she lives in a different country to me, so calling emergency services is all I can really do. I don’t want to do this, but I don’t have a choice anymore. What do I do?",19Jun2020,1
1032,"BACKSTORY: My mother is a textbook narcissist parent (gaslights, manipulates, plays victim, etc). I’ve always fought with her growing up since I was the only girl and the oldest, making me the main victim of her constant harassment. When I went away to college, the second oldest went through the same treatment as me. 

My dad would always be at work, so he never had to deal with her behavior. But since the pandemic has forced everyone home, he’s been the center of her harassment. Constantly berating him, yelling at him, and playing victim when he finally argues back. My dad is a very reserved, non confrontational person, so he rarely argues or raises his voice. He also has diabetes and high blood pressure, so he tries to avoid getting upset. Very mellow guy truly.

LAST NIGHT: My mother had began accusing him of touching her things (could very easily have been a mistake) so she burst in the room while he was sleeping and started yelling at him. She started throwing his things out of the room and trying to instigate him into getting physical with her. 

At that point he begins to have a really bad panic/anxiety attack with his heart racing and he’s trembling. Almost seemed like a heart attack. 

My mother tries to accuse him of lying and exaggerating and tries to instigate him further as I force her out of the room and yell at her to back off Me and my siblings call an ambulance due to his underlying health conditions and they treat him. 

Throughout all of this, I really saw the cruel nature of my mother. She truly couldn’t care less about the health of my father and I hate to see him suffer.

My dad throughout all of this doesn’t want to divorce her for financial reasons, but I feel like his quality of life is suffering because of this. 

How can I help him get through this? I hate to see him a victim to this kind of abuse",19Jun2020,1

No one inside just parked in the road. We sat there for a bit probably 5 minutes and my sister and some old old man come walking out of the woods. My mom tried to stop the guy I tried to help but I was panicked. I called the cops and there taking care of it now I had his plate so I know we should be able to get him. My sister admitted to what she did she willingly met up with this guy and I'm just heartbroken. I thought she was over this but I guess she's not? I know she's the victim and I know I need to forgive her but how can I? Its so hard when you thought she wasn't like this. I guess what I'm asking is how can I get over this and support her when I just feel hate. Will it go away? Should I just suppress it?

Obviously she didnt tell me about him so I don't know how she will manage to go and meet him without me knowing. I am terrified because First I was shocked by some texts,second I dont want her to be heartbroken and third I didn't know she had a desire to have someone else in her life ,I thought me and my dad were everything . I guess that could be selfish to think. So now that you know everything What should I do, what would you do?

1041,"First off: I have really bad social anxiety which makes it REALLY hard for me to talk to me people about my wants and needs. Especially when it comes to these sort of things. Honestly, it's also incredibly hard to ask my boss for days off even. 

Now the backstory: 
I'm renting a private room from my boyfriend's mom. She's really chill, and she never said that I couldn't have overnight guests if I wanted to. However, my last private room landlords were the complete opposite. They were overly strict, and even kicked me out without notice for asking if I could have a service dog for my disability. (I did NOT get a service dog, and I did not attempt to get one. I only asked if it was a possibility). 

I haven't seen my parents in over a year since I moved across the country, and I don't have the time or the money to go back and visit them so they decided they would come visit me. They were originally going to stay with my aunt and uncle who live nearby, but they took back that offer. My parents are also low income and can't afford to stay in a hotel, so I wanted to let them stay in my room for 3 nights. I typically sleep with my boyfriend in a different room so it doesn't usually get used anyways. 

Is it worth asking my landlord if they can stay or do you think that it isn't a good idea? (Her and my parents get along so far that I know of).

So I parked my car legally and not in breach of any highway codes (UK) on the street, but he insists the car goes on the drive, even though I'm perfectly happy where it is, nobody has complained about its presence, he thinks others want to use the space and therefore should be moved incase it causes him trouble. 

My handbrake is a bag of crap and will not hold the car on the steep slope his drive is on unless you rip that sucker up hard and high, but this makes the pads stick and seize to the disc, and then needs a garage to release them, and I don't have the money to fix the car until things pick back up at work because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

My wife says to give in to him and tells me he's booked the car into a garage he knows well to have the car sorted, so I see this as him spending my money.

He's not a 100% grumpy old basket case, just very set in his ways, I think he's got an opinion of ""I'm older so I know better"" attitude, but I could be wrong. If I stand my ground to him he's got every right to tell me to get out of his home, and I have absolutely nowhere else to go, but also he has no right to tell me where I can and cannot park on public highways, just because he ""thinks"" it'll cause an issue.

1047,"Hi(‘:
let me give y’all a quick lil rundown on my situation. - so, i’ve (f19) been living with my sister (26) in another state since the end of august of 2019. I originally came with my mom but she went back home and visited for a month and decided to move back. I stayed bc I sister had just recently given birth which was part of the reason for our move. I help my sister out by cooking, cleaning, just basic stuff around the house and with my nephew. I started actually watching my nephew everyday mon-fri back in january. We’ve had no complications about it whatsoever. I take good care of my nephew, I rarely have trouble with him and he absolutely adores me. Throughout my being here my sister has also had the rockiest relationship with her husband whom she’s repeatedly kicked out for valid reasons and i’ve been there by her side to help. We had been looking back to moving to our home state by the end of this year and then she wanted to move sooner and then even SOONER than that. Well yesterday she talked to me about this video that she watched about what’ll happen if the second round of stimulus checks were to be released and it was end of the world-ish to say the least. With this conversation she decided that it’s be best for us to move out of the city where we’re at and move out in the country here. Meaning we’d be postponing us moving to our home state. She decided that this was best and then when the time is right or that she feels it’s safe then we will move back. With this she added if I wanted to go home or if it made me “uncomfortable” that I could move back home. I told her that I thought she was being reasonable and that I understood where she was coming from and that if it was alright with her i’d like to stay. 
Today the day is going good, literally there’s nothing bad about this day, we  both woke up in relatively good moods. The day was like every other day except I started having so trouble with my nephew I didn’t know why he was being so fussy since he had just ate already and I figured he was sleepy but every time I tried to put him to sleep he’d cry even more and I tried everything that I normally do and nothing was working. I forgot to mention my sister works from home, she has no issue with us popping in while she’s working, she’ll call us over even. We’ve even spent the entire work day with her. Well, I didn’t know what to do so I walked over to her work space and told her that I didn’t know what to do and that I had tried everything. I didn’t say it ugly, annoyed, or anything of that sort, if anything my tone was probably concerning. So she takes him and we talk a bit about him and what it could be and our usual talk. Then her lunch break rolls around and we go back to the living room and she eats and has my nephew the entire time. I washed the dishes real quick while she had him and then when she finished her meal I asked her if she was done with her plate so I could take it and wash it. She said she could wash it on her own that she was fine. I said okay, do you want me to watch him while you do that? she said no she’s got it. I leave bc i’m like why is she being SO silly, why would she even be upset?? I go to sit on the couch and she still has maybe 10 minutes left of her break. She comes back into the living room with my nephew and says they’re going to go to the other room, usually i’d go with them but I sensed she was upset so I stayed in the living room to give her her space. Her lunch is up and she comes back and i’m expecting her to hand over my nephew but she goes to unplug the fire stick and while she’s doing that she’s telling me that she’s taking the fire stick, to use mine and that she’s going to keep him. I say okay and then ask if she’s okay, she tells me she’s just frustrated with a shaky voice and leaves. While she’s leaving I tell her if she needs anything to lmk. I go to my room and start watching tv and i’m like what???? what did I even do to frustrate her???? 

some time passes and she texts me this.
 her: Maybe over the next couple of weeks we can cut to down the time you have to watch him til you don’t have to watch him anymore
me: alright, and if you want me to move back home, i’ll understand it’ll be okay, I won’t be mad or hold anything against you
lol i’m just gonna copy and paste our convo real quick, it’s short. 
her: Not that I want you to, but also if that’s what you want to do you let me know so I can plan around that
me: i’m not saying that’s what I want either but if you want me to let me know as well
her: I feel like asking you to watch him is asking for too much
me: it’s really not but if that’s how you feel
her: That’s all, and I shouldn’t depend on that especially with you not having experience 
her: I want you to know too it doesn’t mean this is a bad thing, you’ll be able to have flexibility to do what you need/want for your future without having to sacrifice so much time a week for so little pay  
I didn’t put my response to those two because I just responded with okay. 

Am I the issue? Am I overlooking this?

ik she said what she said but I feel like she doesn’t want me here that i’m too much for her and that she feels like she has to look after me. I don’t know wether to stay here or go back home. if  y’all have any advice for me it’d be much appreciated. (while typing this she invited me to go to the room with them and she’s most likely going to talk to me about this situation, so i’ll keep y’all updated)

I'm early 20s F and I've been going to different doctors for the past few years because I suddenly started having mild seizures and slurred speech, and no one has been able to give me answers. I had an abnormal eeg but no diagnosis as of yet. A few of the doctors I've seen have said that everything is due to anxiety because during my appointment, I'm a little nervous.

We found a perfect 2 bedroom place that we fell in love with the second we walked in and can't stop thinking about the place! The place was 1225 including everything but electric (even internet?!) . 

We both want a garage for our cars and that's a extra 50$ per month per garage. 

The problem we are having is we both have newer cars that we pay a fair amount for a month with insurance. 

Together for just our cars and insurance we are paying a whopping roughly 1400$ a month(not including gas)I know we are both dumb. 

She drives a 2010 jeep wrangler. 
I drive a 2017 accord coupe.

I make anywhere from 2080-2800$ a month after tax (over time is common during summer).

She makes roughly 1800 a month after tax. 

She also has a small dog we gotta take care of and we both have normal phone bills. 

We both don't have great adult role models in our life and are looking to seek some guidance. 

We did a calculator once and did worst case scenario for everything. I think we gave our self 350$ a month for food and household stuff, 100$ for electrical,100$ for her dog and some other stuff and it came out saying we will have 212$ left over after everything said and done.

1050,"So earlier this year a 3 of my friends went to visit another of ours that lives in New York, and I didn’t know about this trip despite the fact that I talk to all of them every day. They constantly texted me about what they were doing and basically how much fun they were having. After about 2 days I had to tell one of them that I “don’t want to hear about how much fun all of my friends are having when I didn’t get an invite.” They understood and apologized and when they all came back to town they talked about how next time they go up they want me to come and told me I should have been there the first time. They added me to their group chat that they used to plan the trip and apologized profusely. 
Fast forward to this week, I was hanging out with them when I found out 3 of them are going on a beach trip this weekend. I was surprised that it was the first time I heard anything about it, and I was annoyed that they basically did the same thing they said they wouldn’t do. And since I didn’t know anything about it i fear that they might have made another group chat without me. How should I go about talking to them about it? Should I talk to them about it at all? Or would I just come across as jealous?",19Jun2020,2
1051,"I [F19] broke things off with my long term boyfriend of three years recently. We had been in a long distance for about seven months before I decided I couldn't do it anymore. But the relationship had been dead for almost the entirety of our LDR. I asked him to break things off a month into it but he kept telling me our love was stronger so I went with it. This repeated thrice before I told him it was fucking over. He was... strange. Throughout our relationship, we didn't communicate much due to our busy academic lifestyles but there was always a hint of superiority and extreme romanticism on his part. We were our high school's ""will definitely get married and have kids in the next ten years"" kind of couple. I didn't want that but he kept acting like he was so surprised by how I didn't want the greatest pleasure of having a life with him and raising children and eventually I gave into it. Slowly, I just started feeling that maybe my dreams were selfish and stupid and a family was the best thing for me. But it wasn't enough to keep me from moving abroad for my studies. He was manipulative, controlling but still kept the perfect face by getting inside my head.

I could trash talk my ex-boyfriend for hours but long story short- I went to university and met the most wonderful person. He and I became really close and that heightened everything wrong with my boyfriend to an unimaginable level. I had to break things off.

It put so much into perspective for me. He went back to friends that he tore me away from because they were bitchy, and from what I've heard, he has been feeding them stories of how I was the one who trash talked them all when they all treated me like an emotional whoopee cushion. He has also reconnected with male friends who made crude jokes about raping me and gone back to making shitty and edgy  jokes 14-year old boys make. He also made his sister, who was a really close friend of mine, cut all contacts with me.

Now, this would all be okay had he not acted like we would still be friends after the breakup. I understood the lashing out at first. He was angry. He was hurt. It was unexpected because he just took me for granted and never thought his obsessive ways would have an actual outcome. But then he started posting things about how much he hated women and horribly racist things and I'd had it. There's only so much you can excuse.

What hurts is that this whole experience has left a major impact on my personality and just how I view myself. I used to be a very outgoing albeit a little picky person. I used to be able to mingle in crowds and I loved talking to people. He shamed me about how I spoke to ""literally any idiot"" and because of this and other reason I was too shy to make any friends in university except the one singular friend I made. I feel embarrassed talking about things I enjoy because they were base level things. I feel like there are activities that I loved that have been ruined.
Furthermore, I feel like my judgement of character is horribly askew. I used to be proud of being able to guage good from bad, but how good can I be if I stayed with a fake for so many years?

I feel like I've lost my ability to be talkative, social and generally cheerful. He took away the last years of my high school and almost the first year of my university. I didn't go to parties because he felt left out. I didn't stay out late because he waited to talk to me. I ruined my relationship with my parents for two years, and I still hear things from my father because I dated against their permission. I asked him to break up then, too but he didn't listen.

I have nothing left of my old life. He wanted time and I gave all of it to him. Now, as I try to reconnect with my actual friends, they all treat me like an acquaintance. He gets sympathy from people and I am treated like the demon who ruined his life and betrayed him. Meanwhile, he made me this awkward and conscious individual and lives with no shame.

I want to scream and tell every single one of them how much they're hurting me but I also just want to start from the scratch. I don't get the chance anytime soon with all this virus bullshit so I'm stuck wallowing for another bunch of months.

How do I feel better?",19Jun2020,2
1052,"I need some advice regarding someone I know.

She's mid-30s, incredibly irresponsible, and has a long-term bf.  
She's mentioned many many many times that she'd like to have a child and her bf isn't ready. She says her options are either to have a child with him, or leave him for someone who will.  


Today she stated that she was \*going\* to have a child with this bf, regardless of his feelings on the matter. I didn't get details on how she planned to do this, but I presume it looks something like getting off bc and not informing him.  


I think we can all agree that this is wrong. My question is: what do I do with this information? I've never met the bf and don't have a way to directly contact him. But even the knowledge of this situation gives me a real icky feeling. Do I still try to find a way to reach him? How would you handle it?",19Jun2020,1

1055,"Hello everyone!  I'm currently studying music and my music teacher has developed a fun way to practice/study both chess and Music (2 of my passions) at the same time without burning myself out.  So I basically do 2 segments of exercises.  In the first segment, I do 7 minutes of music, and after this, I do a quick 3 minutes of studying chess(through puzzles, advancing my endgame knowledge, etc.. I continue doing this 7 minute 3 minute thing over and over again for at least 6 rounds(1 hour).   The second segment is similar, but the amount of time I spend doing activities/the activities I am actually doing change. I do 20 minutes of chess, and after this, I do 5 minutes of music.  I continually do this until I reach a minimum of 2 more hours.  So my question is:

Does anyone have a good application to run consecutive, constantly changing timers?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",19Jun2020,1

\- I want to become my own boss

\- Decide my time to something that is going to benefit me + my family in future

1058,"So I recentlyish moved in with my girlfriend and her family and it really hasn’t been great since. My anxiety was already not great, just basic stuff like feeling sick before seeing friends, not sleeping, the occasional panic attack and just generally trying to avoid people, but now I’m trapped with people I’m not comfortable with. Due to family circumstances, i can’t really move back in to my parents, and I’m not anywhere near financially stable enough to go elsewhere.

I struggle to do basic things, like I don’t want to leave our room for things like doing my washing, having a shower or eating/drinking, and it’s really taken a toll on my QOL. Especially with quarantine, everyone is always home, so I can’t sneak around and do my bits when they’re out. Also, people are over ALL the time, and it’s not my house so I won’t complain, but I really just feel trapped in my own home. I feel like o don’t have a safe space anywhere, everywhere is uncomfortable for me.

I was thinking of maybe speaking to a doctor, but there’s no in person meetings right now, so I’d have to call. Phone calls are bad enough for me already, and I wouldn’t want to talk about it within ear shot of the people it involves so I’d have to go out, but then I’d have to explain why I’m going out and it’s just stress. I could wait but where I moved is no longer in the catchment area of my last gp, so I’d have to either move or walk about an hour and hope that they don’t somehow find out I don’t know how they would but they could idk.

I don’t really see a good option for me, but I don’t want to go deeper and deeper down this hole, so hopefully someone here knows something about something. I thought as anxiety is such a wide topic that it would be fine to ask about, and it wouldn’t be too specific for the sub rules, as a wide variety of people have dealt with it.

I told her that I love her and I wanted things to workout but I can’t because I know she’ll never believe me, she has a right too and I know I made a mistake to make her feel that way. She told me I didn’t have to start drinking or be depressed and I kept telling her like that’s easy for you to say when I’ve put up with so much of her stuff and trust her over so much stuff but I make on mistake and she leaves me and she’s happy and has friends, she kept saying I was guilt tripping her and that she couldn’t deal with me, when all I was saying is that she seems happy and seems to be happy with her friends and her life and then she shouldn’t waste it on me especially if she doesn’t trust me and stuff.

Once I asked her what she was doing because she was just hurting me, I asked if she was lonely and wanted to swim in my pool, she said she wasn’t lonely and she’s rather swim in a creek and a bath.

1063,"My quarantine has been a bit rough mentally, as I’m sure it’s been for others. I’ve been away from uni, I haven’t seen my friends, and things have felt a little hopeless. It was during quarantine where I learned that I might have OCD, and it’s been a struggle since. It’s been hard to talk to my family about, but I told my mom my story, and she was sympathetic, but it still felt like she didn’t believe it completely.

It wasn’t until I told my brother, who actually has been diagnosed with OCD. He pretty much told me it sounded like I had a straightforward case. So I’ve been looking into getting therapy, and that came up when I was talking to my dad today. He kept pressing for details, and I eventually told him what was going on. The ride home was uncomfortable, and he ended up saying that he also thought he was OCD to sympathize, but he’s never been diagnosed and his understanding of it was “Oh it just makes you check stuff or do stuff a certain way”

He also made a couple rude comments, like wondering out loud if the water supply near where my brother and I grew up was the cause, like wtf? Later at home he made a joke that the way I was eating was “so OCD” and it pissed me off so much. I confronted him and he got defensive saying that he “has it too” and that your family should be able to joke with you.

I love my dad and he’s usually fine, but this has been really upsetting. Me even talking about the idea of OCD is difficult for me, and it feels like he’s not taking it seriously. It makes me not want to open up to my family",19Jun2020,1
1064,"*If you have already seen this post in new, I just took it down and posted it from a throwaway.*

Background:
I recently had a bunch of fights with my best friend of 5 years, which led to us “breaking up.” My former best friend and I had a mutual friend who we will call Josh. I texted josh after shit went down, and asked him if we were still chill. He said we were. I always knew he agreed with my former best friend and not me, but it doesn’t mean that we couldn’t be friends.

A couple of days ago I edited a stupid Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure meme, and sent it to him. He never responded. Today, I sent him another meme I thought he’d like.

His response is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CyZ3-SObIiZIsLlhXcTUJYgbGt3j89nVpY-mdC8fPs/edit). It is censored for personal details, and is horrible. I wouldn’t recommend it for the faint of heart.

Josh has a history of being an asshole, and has been suspended once for “threatening” a kid with a knife. It was just a poorly interpreted joke by a girl who had outraged parents, but nonetheless, he doesn’t have a great record. Showing that to school admins could do some serious damage.

What should I do? Bite my tongue and ignore him, or tell an admin of my school? I’m graduating middle school today. I don’t wanna f**king deal with this now, but I guess I have to.",19Jun2020,1

She treats people she doesn’t know are gay differently by being more hostile and eager to pick fights with them simply because “they’re probably straight”. In the past she had slated people who have come out at bi saying “they’re faking it for attention” or “they’re not fully gay so they’re not worth my time” (her exact words). It’s honestly really bothering me and as far as I’ve known she’s never ever experienced direct homophobia as we live in a very liberal area and her family is super accepting.

1071,"My friend was sharing an apartment with 2 of her friends, and she agreed to pay 1/3 of utilities. In December, after graduation, she left, assuming that she would no longer have to pay for the bill. Her friends left the apartment, as they could no longer afford it. They asked her to close the account on January 10, and that they'd pay. However, January came, and she got a bill. She informed her friends, and they said they'd take care of it (they never did).

June 7, she was emailed that the bill would be sent to collections, and 100 points was taken off of her credit (it was signed in her name, as she had the best credit). They said they'd still only pay 1/3 of it each, since it was still ""her job"" to pay for it. It was $164, so they only had to pay $80, which they didn't even agree to. One could earn that much money in a day, yet they refused to. She didn't get it in writing that they'd take care of the utilities, unfortunately.  She ended up paying 1/3 anyway in the end...Her credit score wasn't as fixable, however. Her friends simply said ""I'm sorry,"" unwilling to understand the importance of credit scores.

Business , CS, or Neuroscience are my three interests and I desperately want to combine them all...
I’m considering a double major at the moment

I’m(19f) conflicted as to what major path I should follow, I am interested in all three subjects to varying degrees. Business seems like a safe, broad option and IF I could be financially successful with this degree, is my first choice. My state school that I’m attending has a good business program But I don’t know what opportunities it will or won’t open up for me and i will most likely go on to get my mba if I go that route. Neuroscience as a subject interests me most and I’ve thought about becoming a psychiatrist/pediatrician or something similar(so med school), I’m also quite good at memorization which I’ve heard is useful for this degree. Lastly, CS interests me and Im sure if I dedicated myself to it I would be successful at it, however I have little to no knowledge of it now. I also have an interest in learning to code but math doesn’t come particularly easily to me. It’s most intriguing to me because of the financial and job security, because being completely honest money security matters a lot to me.

What would be my best bet to major/minor or double major in? Please share any opinions or experiences. I’m genuinely interested in all three subjects and want to make the most out of my time and money spent on college(so rigor of academics isn’t necessarily a deterrent).",19Jun2020,1

Once they were done I went to bring my daughter inside so I could put stuff away. He (40+ish?) grabbed the bowls and followed me back...

We were headed back outside with the other children so my daughter could continue playing. He just straight up grabbed my ass while we were going up the stairs. Made some unwanted comments like ""squishy"" and ""nice."" I looked him dead in the eyes and sternly told him not to do that with what I imagine was a mix between shocked and pissed look on my face. 

Almost immediately after that I brought my daughter back inside because it made me so uncomfortable.

So, the advice I need is on how to best handle this? I am no longer comfortable taking my daughter out. Or being out myself. I don't know if I should tell my SO because I feel like he will be upset that he brought the dishes back to our place in the first place. (Which I didn't think nothing of at the time). And maybe just some TLC could help. This has ruined what was suppose to be a special day for me and my daughter.",19Jun2020,1

1089,"I work in retail, corporate ownership, and we returned for operational work on June 12 which was last Friday. Upon entering our store we noticed the water heater in the bathroom had ruptured while we were closed. There is no vent in our bathroom and the moisture was trapped for the three months the store was locked up. 

The mold infestation was apparent as soon as we looked at the wall. 

The water heater sat on a wooden shelf seven feet off of the floor. The ruptured heater spilled down along the wall and warped the panel off of the wall. Everything under the shelf was mold laden and the wood of the shelf splintered apart and was black. The entire seven ft wall was littered with black mold spores and deposits. 

Our district leader instructed us to leave until the mold was cleaned up. I was told, and not asked, to go in to the store while the mold was removed yesterday, the 18th. It was relayed to me that I could ""piss around the mall"" while the work was being done and just lock up after the workers left. Then, the morning of, I was told I needed to get work done and that I should just not go into the backroom but remain in the store. 

I arrived at 9am and the plumber was there until 11am. The plumber removed the water tank and the shelf and then left. Two hours later the contractor came in and took 45 minutes setting up. After nearly 5 hours of being in the store with no respirator, I was told that I should have had one. 

Once I told my SM and DM that the contractor said I shouldn't have been in the store without a respirator after they ripped the molded shelf and water tank out since the black mold was airborne, they said, ""then why did you stay in the store lol"". 

Now, I am having a lot of symptoms related to inhaling black mold spores and they are blaming the plumber. 

I have it in text the messages about not having to stay, then being given 20+ pages of products to markdown and a 7+ page visual guide for a sale to get done, and then joking about my being sick and why I didn't just leave the store. 

TL;DR
We found mold in our workplace bathroom and my store manager and district manager made me go into the store while a crew cleaned the mold. I was not given a mask or a choice to go in. I was told I didnt have to stay, then told I had to get operational work done, and then berated that I stayed in the store instead of leaving.

Should this be an HR call? I have been sick all day throwing up with an unbearable migraine. My husband is furious.",19Jun2020,1
1090,"Honestly I feel so stupid even writing this, because just talking to other people shouldn’t be this hard. I have really bad anxiety o that could be part of it, but this doesn’t feel normal.

The best way to describe it is that I feel like an alien. It’s like everyone else just gets how to talk to people, how to start a conversation with any random person and it be normal, but I can’t talk to people like, at all. 

I was quiet with most of my co-workers for the longest time until I felt comfortable enough around them. But I have some co-workers who, despite working with them for years, I can’t even get a single word out to because I haven’t worked with them enough to feel comfortable enough to speak.

Even with people I’m comfortable with, even with my best friend, I’ll say something then spend hours or even days beating myself up because I’m convinced it was the wrong thing to say or that I sounded like an idiot, even if it was something insignificant. I can’t even properly express my feelings to others, it takes me days to put my feelings into words and by that time it doesn’t matter because the time to express that has completely passed.

I have two friends; my best friend and her boyfriend (who really, is only friends with me because of my best friend). I’ve lost contact with a lot of my high school friends because of my terrible communication skills. It’s easier when you’re a kid, all you have to do is say “Hey, let’s play!” and within 20 minutes it’s like you’ve been friends forever. It’s not that simple anymore.

This is probably all in my head, and like I said, I feel stupid even writing this. I’ll probably spend the next little while contemplating deleting this in fear of looking like some kind of fool.

1098,"So basically I (20F) woke up to some messages this morning from my ex (22M) who I dated for 3 years where he thought it was okay to post my nudes online and start selling them to people. He is posing as me on social media. He then called me and I just stayed quiet the entire phone call because I was so disgusted. I've sent him literally about 10,000 nude photos and videos of myself over the years and he has them all saved. He revealed to me this morning that he's been doing it for months and that he has a bunch of guys who buy them. 

So this morning he was proposing that I start an onlyfans to make even more money. I still wasn't speaking over the phone and just listening because honestly I was considering getting in on the cash. Later in the phone call I could tell he started feeling bad, and asking if I want him to take the pictures down, when obviously I think the damage is already done because he's sent them to so many people already. I feel deeply violated but at the same time I don't really think it's a big deal because I don't feel like I matter as a human being (but I know that's just my low self worth). I didn't answer any questions and I just said ""Give me a bit"" and then we hung up. 

Now it's the afternoon and he's messaging me updates of how many buyers he has. Really, I would love to make money and he's good at selling stuff. But to work with him, we have to communicate and he never listens to me. If I were to set some boundaries, I know he would ignore them. Then at the same time, the fact that he did this without my permission makes me want to punch him 100 times. I'm so pissed off and confused. And at the SAME time, I've been really wanting to talk to him and missing him, so this gives us an opportunity to communicate at all. 

Then I was trying it and I just told him to send whatever he's sending to others to me first; then I can confirm and give him permission to send it. Then he started asking me for some specific videos, and I was busy but I said ""give me a little bit"" and then he got mad that I wasn't sending them fast enough and said that he lost a couple of buyers due to my slow sending. Since that happened, he said that it's too much of a hassle to get an OK on the videos through me. Then he called me and started yelling at me for taking so long sending him the videos (I was cooking), and I basically just told him how I don't want him sending people my stuff without me seeing it first, and he called me stupid and blocked me.

1099,"I went to get tested for covid today at a immediate care center. I have been presenting some symptoms ( dry cough, low grade fever all day, general feeling of blah, low energy, no runny nose or sore throat). My temp was taken. I was screened by someone once; and then again by the primary on the phone. Before I saw the primary, someone came in and administered a swab test. A rapid test. Then the primary called me to screen me and said she would come out and administer the deep test to send to the lab. I asked her why I was just swabbed a few minutes ago then. She was confused and said she would call me back. She called back and said the tech got confused by which test I was supposed to get but I got a negative on the rapid so I’m fine.... when she came out I asked her why I wasn’t given the test that would yield more accurate results if that was her first judgment. She brushed me off , saying it’s the same test, people prefer the rapid anyway and long story short I’m negative and it’s fine. It was also 2 minutes to closing time, and I had already been waiting 2.5 hours to get a spot. The lest she could have done was been polite.
I came home and have a slight increase in temp. What I’m concerned about it the fact that upon initial screen my symptoms warranted a lab test, but because a tech made a mistake I was only given the rapid one ( which has a ton of false negatives). She even offered me antibiotics before she went to find out why I was given a rapid. 

I know that whether I test positive or negative has no impact on the how the virus will run its course, but I would still like to know if I have it because I don’t want to knowingly spread it if I do. Am I being irrational?",19Jun2020,0
1100,"This advice is UK-specific please (we are not hired at Will here ,I.e we have to have specific,valid reasons for dismissal).
I have an unavoidable appointment this Tuesday which means I will be unavailable from 11am and some unknown time onwards . I told work this yesterday (I only found out then) and the schedule was not up yet. I asked if they absolutely needed me that day, that they schedule me in the evening as I was categorically unavailable. I’m on a 0 hour contract by the way . As we’re in a pandemic, appointments are rare I cannot reschedule.

So the rota/schedule was just posted at 10 pm today . Meaning some shifts have less than 3 days notice . Of course , I’ve been scheduled to start at 10:45 on Tuesday. They ignored my multiple e-mails telling them I was unavailable before the schedule was posted , but have said I could be fired if I ‘no-show’ on Tuesday. I have NEVER done this before , but they have scheduled me when I’ve told them 3 months in advance that I’ll be out of the country . For some reason my management seem to think it’s the employee’s responsibility to get it covered if they make a scheduling error (or just plain ignore our appointments etc ). So what can I do if they try to fire me ? I’m really worried . I did everything I could do , and told them as soon as I knew .

1104,"It all started when I went to college I was the happiest I have ever been. At first I felt like I had plenty of new friends but as the months went on they all started to dwindle out and most never made an effort. I had a girlfriend and mostly confided in her as she was my only friend. After becoming stressed from school and dealing with relationships problems my grade slipped tremendously and I was forced to withdrawal from the school that semester. I was devastated and couldn’t cope with the failure that I wasted wasted time, and thousands of dollars on school for a failed semester. I moved back home with my parents. The plan was to just work until I felt more mentally stable to go back to school but 3 weeks after shamefully coming back home moving back into my parents house my girlfriend  dumped me over a text. Her reasoning for was that  I didn’t give her enough attention. Yeah right.

After 3 months of wallowing in depression and sadness My dad got me a job working a very physically demanding job recycling non ferrous metals in a shit hole of a town where 90% of the customers are drunk or high scrapping 3 lbs of scrap metal for 3$ to go buy their drugs down the street. I absolutely hate this job as it only exists as a money vacuum to re sell scrap metal, and funds terrible people to continue their god awful lifestyle. 

After saving up for 6 months I attempted to go back to college in my home state while working this shit job. As exhausting as it was Id wake up at 6  work from 7–2:30 go to class from 4:30 to 6:45 by the time I got home and had time to do my homework I was exhausted and had no mental or physical energy. I ended up flunking out AGAIN. 

That was last fall. Since I had nothing to fall back on and no experience to get a better job than this shitty 15$ hr I went back to work at the scrap yard where I been physically busting my ass. 

During all this time being busy and working hard to support myself and pay off student loans, ive pushed everyone away and am more alone , unhappy and depressed than Ive ever been. 

I want to be successfully, I want friends but cant seem to make any that stick around. I just don’t want to get stuck in this shithole working a shit job for the rest of my life. I want to go back to school and actually succeed and graduate. But I have absolutely no motivation or money to do the things I want to do. But theres no drive nothing telling me to go out and get it.

Personally I have bad pain problems In my thighs and like everyone else, with mysterious problem that doctors don’t really know anything about, I’m always tired :(

(relationship story on 4th paragraph and below)

Hi, I’m 16 and I need help because I’ve had cfs for about 7 years and it’s something I’m so used to so I don’t really talk to people about it because most of my family do not understand and it’s only a few doctors that have actually helped me in the past. I’ve been in and out of hospitals when I was young because no one knew why I was always unwell and EXHAUSTED!! But after a year or two we found out. Since then it’s been a big part of my life due to the issue I’m 6ft4 and about 14 stone so everyone thinks I’m an emotionless brute of a male and it’s just ‘growing pains’ which i can assure you, ITS NOT!!! It’s worth pointing out that I’m now older and it’s much better but it’s still very hard to deal with because I’m massive and know loads about sports but can’t keep up with my peers at school 

Since I’ve been in a relationship (almost 2 years) my girlfriend has been very supportive but it upsets me a lot living like this. I’ve had mental health issues in the past frequently for just my hatred of myself. My dream is to be a bodybuilder, I want to be massive, I try to workout but as often as my body lets me because I enjoy the feeling, but it’s too much because I can only do so much before my week is ruined. 

I went to London about 3-4 months ago to see my brother and his new wife and we walked 15thousand steps and I was mentally and physically exhausted, I was falling asleep at the pub we were sitting in at the end of the day and it ruined my week because I was just tired but I can’t often get sleep because I just find it really difficult to fall asleep no matter how many things I try. 

But moving on to the main story, my girlfriend and me are very close and I love her to bits but recently we were arguing on and off for a month because we couldn’t see each other because of corona virus. 
She said a few things that were quite hurtful, she basically said that if wouldn’t kill me, everyone gets tired and that we all go through things. For someone who dreads the people I care about turning on me because of what I have, this was hard, and because of my past depression I’ve just overcome. Since then we have made up but whenever I tell her that I need to go to sleep (we FaceTime almost every night) she just gets very frustrated at me and even if she doesn’t say anything I can tell that she is. An additional piece of information, she doesn’t like sports so when I bring up how upset it makes me that I can’t go to the gym and workout all the time even tho I enjoy it so much when I can do it, she purposefully gets distracted or starts playing with her pets. Literally ignoring me and doesn’t have an answer when I point it out. 

It’s a massive part of my life and so is she. Me and her both know I’m not always positive and sometimes I do complain too much but how do I explain to her that this ain’t going anywhere overnight?

Sometimes people ask for video calls and such, and I'll get super evasive or fake excitement because I don't actually care if we call each other or not. 

Another thing is that I feel like I need a lot of time for myself and I literally don't have the time to reply and engage in meaningful conversations with everyone who messages me, *and* do every activity I want to do during my day. It is simply not possible.

However those are all people I care about, and I contact them when I think about them, feel like getting news from them, or when I really feel too terrible for not answering. I don't get offended at all if someone doesn't reply to me because I KNOW that they might be busy, or just not feel in the mood to talk to me in that moment. And that's totally fine !!

I have to admit I can ghost someone for pretty long tho, longest time was a full year.

I feel like a terrible person because I seem to mean a lot to some of them (which I really really appreciate) and I don't want to hurt them, but at the same time I just want to reply when I feel like it. I also feel very guilty when I think about people I ""abandoned"" or ""neglected"" this way.

1112,"Man, this fucking sucks. 

I’ve (23M) loved a woman since high school (23F) but I’ve suppressed those feelings deep, deep down. We’ve maintained our friendship with good communication for almost 9 years. 

In 11th grade she starts dating this guy who was such an asshole to me, and long story short, she’s married to him now.

I’ve pretended I love her as a friend, and tell her that frequently. However, I realized that I might actually have loved her loved her all this time.

Whenever I need someone the most, she’s always there for me. I almost killed myself recently and out of all the people in the world, I called her as my last reach out because I knew she could help me not go through with it if she picked up the phone. She did, and when I said I loved her at the end of the call she said, “Love you too. Bye.” but I took that just as a friend thing. 

She started being distant the next 2 days after that and she was pushing me to get help. She went behind my back (that sounds negative, I say that because I told her I didn’t want my family to know) and messaged my sister everything that happened because she said she was worried being that she remembers I messaged her about this last year as well and she wanted someone else to know what was going on.

She told me she was really glad I am getting help but she is going through her own mental health struggle and she going out of town and not checking her phone “so I wish the best for you.” 

I told her I understood, I’m her friend and care for her, thanked her for everything, and let her know when I’m in a better place I am here to support her, and ended with “We will get through this!”

And yeah; it feels like a break up in friendship. It’s been hard but wow it’s made all of these feelings come out after I’ve been reaaaaaallly honest with myself via introspection. 

It’s always been her. I can’t believe I understand what that means now!! Life experience hurts 😂

There has been so much forgiveness in our relationship throughout all these years, moreso than any other person besides family in my life. 

It’s been one of the hardest things in my life watching the woman I love marry someone who was so cruel to me and having to pretend I didn’t care. I always ask how he’s doing and liking their posts and supporting her in all her marriage stuff, but I’ve realized now that I can’t do it anymore. Seeing her with him hurts my heart, and my soul on a deep level, so I think it’s great that this is happening because I can finally start to let this go after we take time and space from each other for a while and also after being so honest with myself.

What do you guys think of all this lol 

And man it feels good to admit it.

What do you guys think of all this lol

I think when she reaches out again (she always does) I have to be honest with her and tell her I can’t be her friend right now because I love her and seeing her with Boston truly hurts too much, and for my mental health and my heart I just can’t but hope to sometime in the future and I hope that she will have me when I’m ready to do that.
