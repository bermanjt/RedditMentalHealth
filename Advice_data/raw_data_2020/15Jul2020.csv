Throw away account because, well, this is a little embarrassing. I \[21 female\] have realized that I don’t know how to make new friends.

After celebrating my 21st birthday this last month, I realized that the few people I considered friends care for me very little, or are people I don’t feel comfortable with. I constantly feel like I am third wheeling whenever I hang out with some of my friends, like I’m only there to take pictures or something. My other friend makes me uncomfortable because I feel like I constantly have to hide myself from her because she has very strong opinions on certain situations, and sometimes I don’t agree with her on some of those issues. While I’m ok with not always agreeing, after all everyone should have a right to their own opinion, I have heard her tell me that if she ever found out some one thought a certain way on some issue, she would never speak to them again. I just never really share my opinion or thoughts whenever these topics come up, but for me its put a bit of distrust between us that I can’t get over.

I have a best friend from high school, but she moved to a different city three hours from mine. We talk sometimes, and were still pretty close, but I don’t feel like she cares about me as much as I do her. I feel like sometimes I’ll never be as important to her as she is/was to me both in high school in out. Its always been one of those, while she’s my best friend I wasn’t her best friend, if that makes sense. 

And that’s it. I can count the number of people I talk to on one hand. I feel like I’ve given my heart and soul to my friends, and while they care about me back in some way, its with mild interest. I’m not saying these people are bad, I just feel like to them I’m more of a pity friend than anything else.

Which brings me to my question. How can I make new friends? For as long as I can remember I just really wanted one of those ride or die childhood friends. Or just someone who put in equal effort into our friendship would be nice, I guess. I just want to be friends with people who like, actually know me. Who I can actually be genuine with and dorky with.

It’s a lot to ask for, considering I’m very secretive about the fact that I have depression/anxiety and deal with all the shit storm that comes with that, hate my body, and have scars I’m extremely embarrassed of. The only reason I’m even able to admit that is because this is all anonymous. That’s not to mention I’m a closeted nerd for about everything, smoke probably too much, and have a really bad addiction to reading online fiction stories.

I feel so embarrassed to be myself, but part of me really just wants to find someone or some people who would like me despite me being well, me. 

I’m 21 now, so I can’t really make a longtime childhood friends, but how can I make a good, genuine friendship with new people? I’ll be starting school back in the fall, so I know I’ll be meeting new people there, but how do I make myself approachable or I guess a good enough person to be friends with? I don’t know, I’ve never been good at making friends (hence, how I got in this situation) and always feel like maybe it’s my fault my friends aren’t necessarily, friendly.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and been able to get an actual genuine friend group together or even just been able to find one good friend? God I realize how childish and pathetic this all sounds, I’m just really desperate to actually have people in my life who I like and trust, and who like me back.

5,"I’ve (f18) been talking to a “friend” (m22) that I met online and have been talking to for a couple months now. How I met them was through my University group, they’re from a different country but plan on coming over as soon as they’re able to.

Anyways, everything’s been fine up until late last week. I posted a picture on my Instagram (which they follow), and apparently I looked “very tall” to them. They asked me my height and when I gave it to them, I was suddenly ghosted for 5 days. 

Then this morning they started messaging me again, saying how tall I was was abnormal from where they live, and that they’d “politely” like to stop talking to me. Has anyone experienced anything similar? Should I be worried of this constantly happening when meeting people from other countries where women aren’t as tall? 

I’m 5’ 9”, which isn’t a uncommon height where I live.",15Jul2020,1
6,"So a few years back I joined a new friend group and became BFF’s with this person. A few years have passed though, and they’ve kind of become a friend of a friend situation. We invite each other to events but it’s more out of a weird obligation to the friend group. Every year I don’t really want to invite them to stuff, but I end up doing it anyway. When and how should I stop?",15Jul2020,2
7,"I feel unloved by my family because when I was still living with my parents and on days it wasn’t my birthday, they acted like they didn’t want to buy me things and wouldn’t when I would ask. I also hate asking for things in general. I wish I had a job to buy me the things I wanted. I’m a very “I want to provide for myself” type of person but am not able to right now. I just hate the attention because I was kind of ignored a good bit when I lived with them. I’ve never felt unloved before and it’s really bumming me out. My parents also wouldn’t talk to me when something was wrong. They never took the extra step to make sure I was feeling alright. We aren’t the most affectionate family, although that would be nice.",15Jul2020,9

9,My assumption is that my mother is insecure about her marriage with my stepfather and constantly tries to overcompensate by making it seem like she is a good or responsible parent by repeatedly reprimanding my siblings and I for things that normal people wouldn’t even blink twice at as well as tries to get us to do extra things on top of our standard chores/ responsibilities to “impress” my stepfather. I would understand if we did nothing around but my siblings and I are the only ones that actually do things due to the situation. It’s gotten to the point that our mother giving us things to do so that our stepfather can see takes priority over what we should be doing or even would like to do. This also started from a hatred or tension between me and my stepfather due to me being tho only other male in the house even tho I’m just a teenager but when I started lifting weights he really tried to do everything to bring me back down because he always wants to be seen as the “king” or superior person of the house and I only realized this when he would make up lies to my mother so after that she began hating me as well. In my house I’m all alone because when I try to explain myself or tell my mother that it’s a lie or it’s unfair my siblings go against me to get on their good side. I don’t even care to be good with them again but it’s extremely annoying and frustrating being unable to say or do anything you want constantly HOW DO I UNDO THIS????,15Jul2020,2
11,"I’m a 16 year old male and currently I live with my mom and dad they have split parenting time with me and my sister. So dad gets us half the week and then mom the other half.

I tried telling her I didn’t want to. I could move in with my dad but problem is my mom is buying me a car soon so I’m not sure. I think I have access to the money so I can buy my car too.

13,"Hi everyone!! 

Im planning on going back to school and I have a huge passion for medicine! My concern is that my ADD is making me hyper focus and that I won’t be interested in medicine later. 

However, I always knew that I’ve wanted to work in a clinical setting but never thought I could do it ever since my freshman year of college. I graduated 3 years ago and I’m working at a corporate job that I don’t have any passion for. 

Now I feel confident in myself to go after it at 26 years old. The financial commitment and time don’t really scare me but my self-doubt is because I constantly think what if this is another way I’m hyper focusing. I’ve stayed consistent and have made conscious decisions about my career. So far the only things I’ve ever hyper-focused on are hobbies. 

I’d love some feedback! Thanks in advance!",15Jul2020,1
14,"This situation is so frustrating and annoying i don't even know what to do anymore please help D:

OK so first of all my brother (who is like 10 or 11) spends an average of 17 hours a day playing fortnite with his friends everyday. I don't care about what he does with his time, but unfortunately the xbox is located in the living room and he is always screaming. ALWAYS. I can't keep living like this honestly. He's always screaming stuff about how he's going to r*pe someone's mother and a ton of super horrible insults. Funny thing, when my parents are around he never says anything and just plays silently, but as soon as they leave for work and we're home alone he starts doing it again (my parents work in the hospital at night sometimes) and i don't know what to do. My parents won't do anything, i have told them countless times and they tell him to stop, his only argument is ""LeAvE mE aLonE"" and as soon as they leave he just continues with his bs. It's not like I can do something either, if i tried to make him stop he'd probably say something like ""shut up and fck off"" because he has no respect for me and does not see me as an autority at all so... Yeah I don't know how to end this. My parents have taken the xbox away multiple times because of this to punish him, but I'd really prefer it if that didn't happen because my dad bought it for both of us and if they take it then I can't use it even though it's not my fault, and i like to play with my friends when he's not around, especially since we are in quarantine and i get bored easily.

Thanks for reading, i'm looking forward to reading your advice :)

15,"I was in a game of Roblox, not doing anything when someone came up to me asking for help. I assumed they were role-playing as a character or something so I acted AFK. They then said ""PLEASE"" so, feeling a bit bad, I asked them what was up. They said something like their irl friend was going to punch them if they didn't get a boyfriend. I was going to tell them to tell their parents but fear kicked in. I have this fear of giving advice for irl to people on the internet incase the scenario gets worse and/or give them bad advice. I instead started sorta  hyperventilating/breathing quickly and left as they said ""what I need you to do is..."". I feel bad for leaving them because they must be stressed. I could have given them advice or told them to tell their parents but I left in a blind panic. I feel really bad but I was stressed.

18,"We’re both 23 and men for context. 

I met this guy in my senior year of high school. We were both music nerds and would often talk about that, but we were never close outside of school. After we graduated he moved to Florida and then I never heard from him. 

Until now, 5 years later. He added me on Snapchat a while ago, and neither of us said anything. After a couple weeks he messaged me trying to catch up on stuff, which was cool at first. We talked on and off for a few weeks, but then it kinda reached a lull.

Recently tho, he wants to talk all the time. He texts me every day and tries to call me once a week, sometimes more. He alternates between texting and snapping me to see if I’ll respond to either. Which I don’t, because I’m weirded out at this point. 

My question is: is it okay for me to just block him and never think about him again? I mean, we were never close and he lives 2000+ miles away from me, and has for over 5 years. I will never see him or hang out with him again. Do I really owe him an explanation?",15Jul2020,1

20,"I'm 18 and I live with my parents. I was about to enter my third year in the fall of 2020, when corona hit in March, for some reason, I took it as a way to slack off and I just completely abandoned all my classes and made up some bullshit about how they cancelled my online classes and I just did projects to end the year for the easy classes. All of that was untrue, I just didn't ever do any work and started to work full time at my job at a warehouse. I used to work part time but since March I've been full time. Since the classes actually did take place online and I failed all of them, they kicked me out and I can't reapply now. It's too late to apply anywhere else or to do anything for the fall. I'm actually freaking out, I just want to run away instead of facing my parents and telling them I fucked up. Both my older brother and sister are star students and they're doing just fine. I'm looking to become the family fuck up. I think for now what Im planning to do is just keep working full time at the warehouse job, but how the fuck do I tell my parents that I did this and it's completely my fault?? They'll kill me! 

For the last month, I've been thinking of ways to run away. I really wanna just get in my little car and drive. I wanna go across the country and just blow all my money, do what I want with the money I have left while I still have it and then just kill myself after a month. I don't wanna get an apartment and just be stuck at a minimum wage for the rest of my life but that's what it's starting to look like.

It all started 2 years ago when Jess broke up with her abusive bf and started talking to me. i was flattered cause i believe jess was very attractive and like snapping and talking to her. i started to develop and somewhat crush until my best friend at the time Joe started to go with out with her. when i heard about this i backed off, i was legitimately happy Joe found someone. they had a pretty strong relationship for about a year, i would somewhat snapchat jess but not as much as i would before. this all changed about a month ago when Jess started to confide in me the problems she had with Joe. being that I liked both of them I tried to play both sides and give her actual advice. last week she told me that her and Joe broke up, i was a bit sad for Joe but in all honesty i was pumped that Jess was single again. for the last couple of days the snaps became more and more flirty with me finally asking her to hang out yesterday. I picked her up and we went to a local mountain to chill. I experienced the worst sexual tension in her car I had a feeling that we both wanted to do something but we were both scared and shy to ask. so today i asked her to hang out and we had sex. i always had the thought in my head what if Joe and Jess get back together.

I'm now fully registered and I am set to move down there and live independently for the first time of my life this Fall. However, the ongoing and worsening Covid-19 pandemic has filled me with dread and there have been valid outcries against schools reopening in the coming months.

The school I am going to, however have announced that they will take precautions involving mandatory mask wearing, social distancing, frequent cleaning, and students taking turns with attendance in-person and online. Despite all that, however, I still remain very anxious about going to a new school and new apartment during the pandemic and possibly risking my life and others, but not going would mean throwing away everything that I have worked so hard for to start this new chapter in my life, and of all the times that I could get that chance, it had to be during all of this.

It doesn't help that I know my parents won't approve of anime if they ever found out about it. I know they would think it's a waste of time. Not only that, but a lot of romcom animes (which is my favourite genre) sometimes have weird scenes in them and my parents have walked into my room during one of those scenes before, which gives them more of an excuse to not like my hobby.

37,"Good friend = X
Former friend = Y

So recently, X contacted me about how Y is going through a difficult time . Y also wants to have a friendship with both me and X. I don’t know the details as this is very recent. But apparently Y has been emotionally broken. Which has a lot to do with her broken home and past. She has no family right now. She also recently got her own place and i guess she has been lonely and she doesn’t have many friends. 

I haven’t spoken or seen Y in two years or more. So when we were around 15/16 may have been when I saw her last. When I think back to my friendship with Y it may have been seen as toxic, which is why I didn’t maintain a friendship with her. I liked her when she was the best version of herself and she always tried her best to reach out to me. But at times she could be rude to people unwarranted or even lash out. She never treated me like that. But her humour would also be poking fun at my appearance or how I would smell. But it would be said in a jokey way. This was when we 15/16. But I also liked being around her when she was the genuine person I know she could be. I don’t know if this toxic friendship to be honest.

Now that we are 18/19, and Y wants to develop a friendship with me. As she has always viewed me as a close friend and it kind of shocked me that she even thought of me over these years. So I’m just hesitant to reach out to her. As part of me is afraid she is the same girl as when we were younger.

I always had trouble trying to fit in the group and feel like I was one of them. Instead, I kind of just tag along when my cousins go hang out with them and just sit there by myself the whole time. It’s incredibly depressing and isolating, watching everyone else have so much fun around you while you’re miserable and feel like a loser.

53,"So, when I was young my family was poor because of my medical bills. Most of my life I've had to steal food from other kids at school to eat, and I had to eat fast before they'd take it back. I consistently had a BMI of 15, and I know this because I had to go to the doctor a lot because my condition.

My eating habits haven't changed, but the food at my disposal has. I eat fast, hoard food by keeping it close to me (guarding), eat high calorie 'reward' foods, and my attitude towards food has stayed the same - eat as much and as fast as I can so I can live. We have food security, and we can afford (and buy) high calorie foods, so starvation isn't even close to being a risk, and hasn't been for years. I'm overweight, probably by 40-50lbs now, and therapy isn't helping.

I still have the mindset of 'what if this is the last thing I can eat' or 'I have to finish the plate or I'm wasting food' or 'I need to eat even if my stomach hurts so I can survive' among others. My therapist thinks it can be tied with my ptsd, but even so, I've made no progress. Or well, I did have a good year where I did cut back on my eating, then a stressful event last year threw that out the window, and I just can not shake that anxiety regarding food or the comfort it gives me when I do eat.

So what next? I need to stop this so I can get to a normal weight, but I feel like if I don't attack the source cause of it, then it won't just be as easy as 'eat less'. How do I get over this mentality so I can eat normally? I can't even begin to know how to move on from it, especially if it's ptsd related. Any help is appreciated.",15Jul2020,2

I previously made a post on Advice ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f3ywnd/a\_23\_year\_old\_trying\_to\_succeed\_looking\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f3ywnd/a_23_year_old_trying_to_succeed_looking_for/) )

\-------------------------------------------

To follow up, let's being.

I am 5 days away from being actually 23 years old, No college education just a high school diploma. Following up from the last post I have been heavily going to the gym went from 257 to 215 in hopes that I'd build confidence and people would stop looking at me as a fat piece of trash. I am now a more fit piece of trash and although I was attracting the attention of some females at first it has died off and now It seems I really can't find any female that gives a damn about me or wants to be with me during my process of growth.

I was feeling more and more better and hopeful as my weight was going down and noticed changes physically and I feel COVID-19 really did help me because I didnt feel pressured to do anything due to the US shutting down except stay active and eat healthy (get a job/money/go out and see the world).

Now along with going to the gym 4 times a week I feel like I am back to the beginning as if I was 18 again looking to find that ""meaning of life"" It scares me so much that I am literally turning 23 years old when I told myself by 25 i'd be out of the house and I'd be doing big things and although that sounds like a lot for some people it seemed very likely with the things I was accomplishing.

*Taught myself how to build computers / Started, branded, my own dropshipping business making over $1500 in profits my first WEEK. / Doing music and having ALOT of really good feedback not just from friends but random individuals who are still fans to this day.*

*I'm a huge gamer I stream on twitch a lot under the game LungTied in hopes of finding people to chill and talk to while I play my favorite game Runescape which I try to play at a very advanced level.*

So call it narcissistic but I just really felt like I could do something before 25 ESPECIALLY get out of my parents house but it seems like I'm going to fail or I have failed already. I've called the suicide hotline several times and every time they just tell me to go join the military which I have considered but I don't think I could commit 4 years of my life to that kind of thing (and trust me ive REALLY looked into it)

I feel the only option is to do more labor jobs in the burning heat and try to move out or go to college but the stress of living at my parents house is just beating me to a pulp and I don't know how much longer I can take it I am and always have been living in a toxic environment with a sibling and two parents. Maybe one of my questions is where do I go other than a homeless shelter to get away from all this bullshit so I can have somewhere worth to come home to everyday. (note I said toxic not abusive I feel living here constantly beats at my mental health)

I'm slowly losing it I don't know what to do can someone share their stories maybe relate? I posted the last post and it actually gave me a lot of inspiration I just don't know what do anymore man..",15Jul2020,1

I just have so many mixed emotions I've been struggling to put things into words and it's stressing me out.

56,"Hello I am (14M) and I have two moms I’ll call one E and the other one S. In the past year or so things have all of the sudden gotten real tough in my home. I can hear my moms fighting usually at least two or three times a week. I am currently living with them and my grandma mother of E who has stage 4 lung cancer. E has told me maybe 6 months ago that she and S are fighting and that I should not be surprised if there is a divorce and that they when I was 4 almost had a divorce over S being an alcoholic. S is an alcoholic. E is the type of person that tries to do so many things in a small amount of time to the point of anything extra stressing her out. E complains to me that S does not do enough around the house and leaves everything for E to do. E has flipped out and cried in front of me over how stressful her life is and that nobody cares about her. E constantly asks me this question: “Am I your favorite person” E will complain to me about that we don’t spend enough time together but to be honest I don’t really want to spend time with her because within 2 hours she will probably initiate a “deep” conversation about how I feel about her and S or get really upset for some reason. E about 2 weeks ago asked me to rate her and S on a scale of one to ten with how well of a relation ship I had with them. I said you can’t expect me to rate a relationship on a number scale and she basically wouldn’t give in. So rated them around the same area and she said that she was shocked that S could be even nearly close to her because as E. E would say things like I played with you all the time with you when you were younger, I gave birth to op and I was your number one. If S makes me breakfast and I tell E that she will act upset and be all down. Ok I’ve shit talked E for awhile so now S. S has been nice to me and in moments been very close to me. My criticisms to S are sometimes she can be so sarcastic to the point of her kind of just making fun of me.

So because of that my mood is down now. Which it shouldn’t be because I don’t even know her at all other than us going to the same school and living in the same building.

I wasn’t scared when he told me this but I was highly concerned and suggested he go to a doctor to figure this out but he doesn’t want to because he has to tell him mom and he knows/thinks his mom will get mad at him for his mental problems.
I don’t know what to do and we’re both young teens so maybe it’s hormones and I told him this but he and I are both baffled and I’m really concerned for this.

63,"I posted this in another subreddit, but I desperately need advice.

My ex boyfriend and I dated for over a year. I had to sort of live with him for a semester in college because I didn't feel safe with my roommates. It was pretty understood that that's why. I felt guilty for staying all the time, but he felt bad if he told me to spend a while at my place so I stayed at his 99% of the time. We both loved each other and treated each other great. We were closer than me and my best friend of 7 years. We comforted each other and took care of each other all the time. Once quarantine hit, I felt like we weren't close anymore (I realize now that it's just because we couldn't see each other). A lot of the things we sent each other over text were misunderstood because of just text being easy to misunderstand. I felt that he didn't give me enough attention, I didn't know what was going on in his life (I found out recently that this is just because he was extremely stressed from his summer class and didn't know how to deal with it). I ended up writing this 2 page letter to him because I was so frustrated, and the letter was not nice at all. But it didn't feel like we were close anymore and we didn't talk as much as we used to. When he read the letter, he talked to me a week later, broke up with me and then decided we needed to take a break instead of breaking up, because we both wanted to fix things and love each other like before but we just needed to talk it out. He also agreed he needed to give me more attention and spend more time with me. 

Well, we were on a break for about a week or two and talking over text every now and then. I still felt like he wasn't giving me enough attention and sent him a text about that. It was an abrupt text and not nice but not mean, I think he read it in a mean tone. He called me immediately and said how things haven't changed since the break, and I said we just need to talk it out, we both love each other, we both want to make each other happier and fix it, and we agreed for him to come over in the morning and for us to talk it out. He got out of class, and I had chills and felt I had a fever. I took my temperature and had a fever and sent him a picture of the thermometer. He kinda blew up. He called me and yelled. I told him I didn't want him to get sick but we could talk it out later when I'm not sick. He broke up with me on the spot and hung up on me when I was crying and trying to get him to listen to me and talk to me. That happened last week. He hasn't talked to me since then but he immediately blocked me on everything except text. I've been sending him texts, but I stopped for about 3 days to give him space. His mom and I have been texting trying to figure out what's going on in his head or what he's thinking or feeling. He hasn't talked to her about it, and they're very close, and he hasn't responded to anything I've said. His mom told me he's been miserable and won't talk to her. He's still dealing with this stressful summer class. She told me that he's definitely a little better today. 

Meanwhile, I've been crushed, can barely eat, drastically lost weight, and am having nightmares. His mom has been updating me daily as to how he is, and I feel like she thought I was the one for him and that him and I were going to make it. She told me ""Sometimes I swear I could knock that boy upside the head. I'm so sorry."" I wrote another letter that's explaining how I felt, that I was just frustrated when I wrote the first letter, how we were amazing together, how we both agreed to make each other happier, how we're each other's person, and how I know he's acting this way because this class is stressing him out, but I haven't sent it to him. He does not handle stress well, especially stress from his class because the class is so hard. His mom hasn't told me if he's said anything about me in the past week, but I'm planning on asking since she knows more about how he is than I do. She plans to talk to him this weekend and bring me up to him and try to talk about it with him. Him and I both love each other, comfort each other, planned a future together. We were almost perfect together and grew every day.

It's only been a week since the breakup. Should I give him more time, try to talk to him more, send him the letter? What should I do?

64,"When I was 17 I met someone my age who I hit it off with fairly well. The more we talked, though, things got weird. Most relevantly they may have brought up that they were dating a 21 year old. To be fair, I may have totally misunderstood this and they may have been in a polyamorous relationship with a bunch of people where one person was 21 and they weren't mutually involved, but I'm not certain. They were also showing some yellow flags as to being creepy themself. If I was right in remembering what I did, that gives it even more of a concerning tone.

After a while we just stopped talking, never having been close. I'm pretty sure we're both 19 now. I remembered this a while back and I only thought it was a good idea to try and contact them about a week ago. We've been having pretty short text conversations that usually end with one word replies on their end, I'm not sure if it's because they don't want to talk or don't know what to say. I don't talk to anyone, so I don't know how to ask.

Main point is, with all this in mind should I ask if what happened happened and if they're okay? It's a major failing on my part to have not intervened at the time and I was intent on apologizing for that as well. I just don't know how it would come off or if it would mean anything. Like, maybe barging in and bringing up stuff I don't know if they just want to forget or not talk about with some ex barely-friend (me, not them) is going to do worse than has already happened and only benefit me at their expense, and honestly fuck me.

I've never been all that smart, so any advice on if I should and how to talk to them would be highly appreciated. Thank you.

I don't think I can TL;DR this.",15Jul2020,1
65,"So before covid 19 struck in full force and we were all forced into quarantine I started working on a personal project for fun that is multipart arg type thing. That consists of a podcast, twitter, and now a series of SCP inspired documents. This is all part of bringing to light a fiction universe that I've been expanding on since I was in high school in a more digestible way. Now the first two parts of this project were easy to implement on there own. 

The struggle is how to fit the third part (the documents) into this project. I don't have any experience in website building or anything like that and I could post them on social media or something but I'm not sure how to find a way to post them in a way that looks clean. 

Granted the whole thing is still basically in its infancy with only 3 episodes of the podcast out and accompanying tweets and the like for each but I want to know what I could do to streamline the whole thing a little more to include the SCP like documents in a way that looks nice. 

And for those wondering this whole project is called Void Channel 6 and is something I'm proud to make even if it isn't the best.

73,"Weird as anything, but I think my SIL (27) may have started crushing on me(probably not more than crush) and maybe on and off over the past year or so. Let me just first start off by saying,no I’m not interested, not here for advice on how to become a polygamist, I’m in a happy marriage,I just need advice on if I’m wrong or how to deal,if I’m not. Maybe my pattern recognition in my brain is on the fritz.

   So some months ago,pre-COVID,my SiL moved into with me, my wife(28 and her sister by blood) and our cat. Since about month or so into her moving in,I would notice things like her staring a hole through my head when I looked up randomly, what I can only describe as concerned looking glances, and just generally being nicer to me when I’m alone(in public) with her. She never does that thing where she laughs at my bad jokes, but my wife doesn’t do that either, so I chalk it up to most of my jokes actually being funny. And otherwise she isn’t a super awkward person(I am kind of awkward, so that could be part of it).

Some months ago, I went with her to an event that was in a sketchy place,and I only went because I was a taller guy/my sister couldn’t that day, so I can easily see that wouldn’t be a hint at anything. When she spoke there she gave me similar furtive glances throughout occasionally. Ok,I could just write that off as looking for support. Yet later when I drove her back she mentioned she couldn’t focus since I was there, and when I tried to apologize for maybe being distracting in how I reacted in support, she got flustered and told me to stop talking. 

   So,it seems like she figures I know(if that’s the case),but what does she expect from me. that she got angry about it ? And just generally how do I deal with this? The only reason I’m posting it here is I feel like I can’t even tell my friends this in confidence, because then it could get back to wife, and I don’t want to be in the dog house or worse if I’m wrong,or anything to happen between the sisters if I’m right. I do want to get her off the hook somehow(maybe be not myself around her,I dunno) so she can move on and get her own healthy relationship.

However, I am sick and tired of men thinking that something like this is acceptable when it is actually very creepy and probably not allowed (since he ‘got lucky’ and found my last name). I will be returning tomorrow to deposit on my new car. The salesman that worked with me is much older and has a lot of experience in the company. I am debating on whether I should disclose to him what happened, how it made me feel, and ask him to approach the other salesman about why that situation was inappropriate. I would rather not have this go up any higher and have him get in trouble. Is this the right move?",15Jul2020,1
78,"Hey everyone, so I’m gonna be completely real with you all and admit right off the bat, I have a lot to work on with myself, and at the moment, I’m not such a great person. 

Im currently in a relationship, and when I was single, it seemed like I had a pretty firm grip on my emotions. Well, ever since I’ve been in a relationship, my emotional state seems to have been deteriorating over time. Sometimes, pretty insignificant things that my girlfriend says or does can make me feel bad, and sometimes that can lead to a petty argument which I almost always realize how stupid it was after the fact. 

This stuff usually stems from the fact that I get jealous fairly easily, I’m insecure, I have trust issues, and I’m more attached to my girlfriend than what is probably healthy. Recently, I’ve been working on detaching myself from her because from the advice that I have been given, I’ve been told that jealousy and trust issues can possibly stem from being overly-attached. She isn’t very happy with me being emotionally detached, so I’ve been working on reattaching myself. But all that this attachment does is cause pain to me because my weakest traits become so much more worse when I’m more attached. 

I’ve tried so hard to work on myself and to become better, but I just don’t know what to do. I want to be a good person so badly, but every time people have to say anything about me (typically her friends), it always is hateful and disgusting, with no actual constructive criticism about what I can do to be better. I feel trapped, I don’t know where to start, and I’m so desperate to just be an emotionally stable person who is less impulsive. 

Also, I’m 16 if that matters lol.",15Jul2020,1

82,"*Hi, this is my first time posting on Reddit, so forgive me if I mess up. This situation just happened, so my emotions are still high.  This is going to be a long rant.* 

  
 So in early March, when massive quarantine started. I was having some mild depression and severe motivation issues; I was barely keeping up with my online college classes. And since my job was considered essential, dealing with shitty costumers with the risk of sickness was not the best feeling.   I didn't even have the motivation to paint or draw, also though Graphic Design is my major, doing it amid a global pandemic made me feel trivial and useless. 

  
 I'm 21, and I live at home with nine other people, three older brothers, two older sisters, my mom, grandmother, and cousin. As an introvert, being at home sucked more than ever. I decided that I needed a hobby, and to separate myself from my family, so I decided in the spur of the moment to completely revitalize my backyard. It's a medium-sized house, but with close nearly 10 adults in the house, it feels like a shoebox.

  
That includes clearing all the leaves, pulling out weeds, and putting in actual grass. Getting rid of all the garbage and washing the deck by hand and repainting it. The floor itself was covered with mold and dirt since we've had it for 8years and never put sealants on it to protect the wood from the deteriorating. Once my family hears about this, it's nothing but skepticism and teasing.   

  
*""Why are you washing and painting the deck? we can just buy a new one if something happens.""*  

&amp;#x200B;

*""You can only use the back area near the trees; the rest of the yard is our 'party area.' ""*  

  
Even though all our guests never step foot off the deck because it was nothing by dry dirt and weeds. No one wanted to ruin their shoes.  

*""you've never cared about the yard before, why now? Are scared we were going to run out of food? lol""* 

I just ignored them and continued with my plan.  
 I planted my seeds in a small container in my bedroom window sill. While I worked in getting the yard ready, and for the weather to get warmer for planting, and every day for weeks and weeks, I would go out clean up more of the yard by myself. 

  
And honestly, it was the best thing for me to do, I loved the smell of fresh dirt, and that I was getting closer to achieving my vision. It made me feel alive, and the yard became my sanctuary.  A large majority of the funds for the tools, seeds, and soil coming out of my own pocket. My mom eventually forced my siblings to at least contribute money if they weren't going to help clean. We didn't even own a rake to keep the leaves at bay.

Thank god for Lowe's door delivery. 

  
 As I start making the actual process in getting the yard to look beautiful, the teasing stops and the micro-managing begins. 

*""where are you putting the garden? Because we're going to need room for the firepit, if we're going to have grass.""* wtf I hadn't even put down the soil yet. 

my sister had the nerve to say that *""I knew the yard would look nice with grass, I've been saying this for 2 years now""* 

No. she hadn't, they had been talking about putting down cement, which I think is such a copout and unpleasant to look at. NYC is already a concrete jungle I wanted to have my own little paradise. 

*""This area looks patchy; you should buy more grass seeds.""*  


my mom even told me to *""Be careful with the yard; your brother just put grass in.""*

  
My older brother didn't do shit, but half hazard tossed the seeds I bought around the yard without putting down the soil and or even softening the ground. I had to leave my zoom to class to fix his mess before the birds ate all the grass seeds.   I let that issue go, the weeks go by, and I move my plants outside and plant more seeds in the new soil.   
Every morning I'm up at 9 am watering the yard, pulling weeds and making sure the yard stays healthy. 

  
The grass flourishes, but that doesn't last long because my family decides to have a party in the new lovely yard and set off firecrackers in the yard. They ended up burning a third of the grass like what the actual hell? My sister swears it wasn't the firecrackers, but the foot traffic that killed the grass, even though I can see that the grass is burned beyond repair. Also, these idiots thought it would be a good idea to set off fireworks, the same place they spilled tiki gasoline I'm surprised they didn't burn down the whole yard and the house. Guest enjoyed the garden, although some of the plants had been lightly stepped on by drunk guests, even though I bought a border and installed it to keep such a thing from happening. 

  
I let that go too, that was a month ago, and now we have the main issue, the yard has been doing wonderfully, Although there are bald spots from the firecrackers, and the traumatized areas have not recovered. The corn I planted is now taller than me, and my sunflowers have even bloomed.  
I've been maintaining the state of the yard, by keeping the weeds at bay, my older brother did not like how long the grass was and decided that he would handle it, by telling the yard service that we have for our front yard to start cutting in the backyard. 

  
Mind you, these people have never cut into the backyard for years, because of how tall the and wild the weeds were, it was a jungle. We have an infestation of Japanese knotweed, and you can look up just how invasive these things are. 

  
My brother had them cut everything that wasn't behind a border or already blooming. My sunflowers were spared, but sadly my snapdragons, African daisies, and marigolds' did not make it  
I was even willing to let that go, but what broke the camels back was when I found my large pumpkin plant already sporting flowers to grow the vegetable completely destroyed nothing but small stumps left; even the watermelon plants were gone. Completely shredded. I was devastated; half of my hard work for the past four months was now turned to dust. I quickly ran to my room to cry before my sadness turned to anger. 

  
When I approached my brother about it, he just mocked my sadness and said that he didn't know, ""which was which,"" but that's such bullshit because I WAS HOME! I would be more understanding if I had been at work, but it just saddens me that I had been so close bu unaware of the massacre on in my backyard.  I was literally in my room on my phone, and there was nothing stopping him from yelling up the stairs and asking me where garden service should stay away from. 

  
He just laughed at the fact that I was clearly upset, he gave a half-hearted apology and said that the yard had been a mess and it needed to be done. My sister asked how much was the bordering to mark the plants and gave me $20 to buy more garden edgings to protect the plants. But the money only made me feel more hollow, all that time and care were now wasted. 

  
When he laughed, the first, though in my mind, was to destroy. Destroy EVERYTHING.  Chop down the entire plot of corn, cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, eggplant, and peppers.   
 The rest of the garden, uproot all the grass and leave them to die and let the weeds reclaim the land. 

And just pour all my love and energy into the small plants I already have in my bedroom. My siblings all work two jobs or have school. So I was the only one to have enough energy to do all this yard work on the daily. And with it already being July, there would be no way for them to regrow the grass and the plants to what they are now before fall comes in September. 

  
So, should I do it? Should I destroy everything I hold dear?  At least this time it would be at my own hands because I can't look out into the yard without crying and feeling that something is missing. 

  
Or should I just take care of what's left until fall, and then just not plant anything next summer and let the entire yard just be grass, am I being too sensitive? This has really hurt me, especially since gardening was the only thing I had the motivation to do during heavy quarantine.",15Jul2020,1

91,"I am from a middle eastern country. I was diagnosed by inattentive ADHD 5 by 5 different psychiatrists from 4 different countries, but that is besides the point. After graduating highschool, I decided to continue university in Russia. I had absolutely NO idea that all ADHD medications are illegal here under all circumstances. I only learned about this after a year and a half of learning Russian to a good enough level to which I can read, speak, and think in it given that information concerning living in Russia with ADHD is only available in Russian. Before, I thought that I can bring my medications from my home country with a legal prescription as in most European countries, but in Russia there is no such thing. Consuming and buying Ritalin and Vyvanse is as big of a crime as abusing heroine here, which can land a person 7 years in prison. Despite how difficult it was, I managed to pull through and passed the entrance exams for medical school here, but I cant realistically continue like this. This was all a big mistake. Knowing Russian now is nice, but I spent two years of my life for nothing. Before corona hit, I was accepted to study in Spain, but that didnt work out in the end for obvious reasons. After that, I applied to a couple universities within the EU, and it didnt work out in the end. On top of that, I have no idea where my highschool diploma is since I sent it to my home country via a Russian post office to fulfill requirements to apply for EU universities.

94,"Starting around February of this year, my close friend (21M) (my [20F] boyfriend’s [21M] best friend) has delved into the world of anime. I know it doesn’t sound like it correlates much with the title, but trust me when I say that it does. 

Personally, I’m not interested in anime. It’s a personal preference and that’s okay. The problem is that my friend doesn’t respect the fact that it makes my boyfriend and I uncomfortable when he talks about it constantly. When I say constantly, I mean it. He finds any excuse to bring up the current anime’s he’s watching or the mangas he is reading. His life has been completely consumed by anime and manga and he literally doesn’t do anything else other then watch and read this shit. It’s fine and everyone is entitled to have their own interests, but it’s not okay when it becomes so much of an importance in your life that you don’t even care that it’s all you talk about with other people. 

We (boyfriend and I) haven’t spent as much time with our friend since the pandemic began. A lot has to do with the fact that since the Covid outbreak really took over, our friend has been consumed with anime/manga. He finds any way to insert it into conversations. For example, he frequently talks through anime, meaning that he will use certain scenarios within an anime he is currently watching, to describe something he is experiencing in real life, opposed to just telling us what is happening in HIS /real life/. It’s so fucking weird and all it does is confuse my partner and I because we have no fucking idea what the fuck he is talking about because we DON’T LIKE ANIME NOR DO WE INVEST TIME INTO WATCHING IT. 

Aside from anime, my friend has also been spending a lot of time listening to podcasts hosted by entitled white men who are sexist, homo/transphobic, racist, etc. and it really doesn’t make sense to me considering that A) he’s BLACK, b) my partner and I are both non-Black POC (I am half white so I know it’s different for me but my man is BROWN), and c) he usually (not so much recently) has amazingly intellectual conversations with my partner and I about feminism, BLM, gay/trans rights, etc. and he KNOWS right from wrong, yet he continues to listen to these bigoted assholes.

I’m starting to fucking /hate/ spending time with him. It makes me so upset. He is my boyfriend’s very best friend, and him and I were beginning to get close, but now my partner and I don’t even like seeing him some days. This is literally all he talks about. No more talking about film, or politics, or drugs, or anything like we used to. I fucking hate it. 

Why won’t he just shut the fuck up? When I realize that what I’m talking about noticeably makes the people in my life uncomfortable/bored, I stop and move on. Not everything is meant to be discussed with everyone. I try my best to be open minded to everything, and I’m very confident that I am, but when my friend discusses anime, manga, and podcasts he is interested in, my brain shuts off because of how fucking bored/uncomfortable I am. It’s so stupid. Literally so dumb. He doesn’t even make it a conversation where my partner and I are included in it; it’s just him summarizing, in grand, boring detail, what he read, watched, or listened to. 

What should I do? My partner and I have tried talking to him but it has gotten nowhere. He just gets butthurt over it. I don’t feel bad because he constantly makes me feel like I’m boring/dumb for things that I say, and looks disinterested, which is FINE, but I’m grown and I care about him so I know when to stop. 

Why won’t he respect us the way that we respect him?

Any advice is greatly appreciated! I’ve given up on communicating my feelings towards him so now I just keep my mouth shut. It doesn’t feel good at all. I’m lowkey miserable when we hangout all together. 

TL; DR: Mine and my boyfriend’s close friend is heading in a downward spiral of anime/podcast addiction and he’s not even using it at a resource to educate himself. He’s just lazy and unmotivated, and acts sooooo fucking sad whenever we talk about anything other than his current anime/manga/podcast. HELP!!!",15Jul2020,0

Context:  

I'm a 17/Male and she's a 16/female, about to turn 17 in the upcoming weeks. There's  some big distance between us, can't meet. I'm in Sweden and she's in Spain. Me and her have been texting for a bit more than a month. We instantly clicked and we really like each other. We've had some small misunderstandings. We snap each other with cute faces, texts and sometimes hearts. We have talked about many stuff but never got deep (I will explain later) Once she's opened up about her parents being abusive and I WISH I COULD DO MORE THAN JUST SEND HER A TEXT. She told me that her mom always argues with her and that her parents hit her. I asked if she was okay and if she wanted to talk about it and she replied with: I'm okay, don't worry. I want to know about you, how's your day?🥰"" And I got speechless so I told her I was just fine and asked her if she really was okay. In the middle of it she still wants to know about me.

She's really special to me, gives me all her attention, makes me feel happy, cares about me and I try to give it all back as well.

Whenever we text or snap there's a big time gap, 6/12/24 hours. As her mother sometimes takes her phone away. I really couldn't explain how sweet she is. It's also too early to call it love as of we've not even talked on the phone. She's told me she's moving out as soon as possible to avoid her abusive patents.

Now, this wouldn’t matter to me, but when it comes to the food trucks I am one of the only women who works on them. The other 2 women also work the food trucks  always wear shorts and continue to do so without reprimand. I also wore the shorts that I am wearing this year, last year working as well. Previous women on the trucks have also worn shorts without complaints. The owner also continues to wear shorts that would be considered shorter than mine. Recently two other women have joined the staff in the stores and they have been allowed to wear shorts without reprimand. I like my job, but I feel offended. Why was I singled out? I’ve asked my parents and a few friends what they thought and they suggested that they think that it might be a color thing. I’m not super curvy, just slightly and pretty conservative in the way I dress, but the food trucks in the summer can get up to 103 degrees and jeans and capris make it insufferable. Am I wrong for feeling jaded or should I just let it go?",15Jul2020,0

108,"Ok hi r/advice! I'm looking for advice on what to do. So basically, On Google it says some symptoms of covid 19 are as follows : diahorea, discolouration in hands, temperature, and a rash. And I have experienced all those things regularly, even before the coronavirus started. Diahorea because of IBS and discolouration in hands due to starving myself. So I'm just wondering, what should I even do??",15Jul2020,1
109,"Apologies for this post being fairly long, as I also just wanted to get some things off my chest. Thanks for the help.

As the title says, I have been working full time while earning my undergraduate degree. I graduate next year, and have been looking at potentially earning a Masters. Specifically I am considering either an MBA or MS in Organizational Leadership, and many of these programs want management experience before they admit you. I have been working in different management roles since 2016 though. 

When I first graduated from high school, I wanted to go to my local community college and knock out some gen eds on the cheap while I figured out what I wanted to do. Instead, I was pressured not to by my mom who said that community college was ""for people who are dumb"". I know this is a stupid take now, but I ended up caving and going to a well known state school without having any idea what I wanted to do. Well, that didn't go well. I had no idea what I wanted, or even if I wanted to go to college, and eventually dropped out. Not before getting ten thousand extra dollars in debt though.

During high school, I worked part time at a regional grocery store, just cashiering and stocking, that kind of stuff. After I dropped out of college in 2016, I was hired back, but this time as a shift supervisor. I spent a few years doing this, and eventually was moved up to be an assistant manager. I managed to pay off my student debt fairly quickly while doing this, as I like to think I am a fairly frugal person. I decided I wanted to earn my bachelors after and re-enrolled in college, but working full time as well. 

I actually have done fairly well overall while managing both. I have maintained a good GPA while handling both full time work and school.

Eventually I left that retail job mid 2018 and began working at a call center doing technical support. It wasn't management, but it was less stressful and paid a little bit better. I thought I would ride this out until I graduated so I would be less stressed. 

February of this year I learned a position opened up for supervisor at my call center. I decided to apply because I wanted the interview experience. I honestly didn't think I would get the job. I leaned heavily into my prior management experience (and I have been told I am good at interviewing, so i guess that helped).

I got the role. I have been doing fine in managing both the new role and continuing school, but I'm just wondering if I should enroll straight into a management program or if I should spend some time only working before I do it. It has been a ride getting this degree, and I am ready to be done, but I also want to continue learning and getting better opportunities.",15Jul2020,1
110,"I'm in highschool. The more about reality I begin to understand the more I feel that I am going to develop a stronger hatred for living in the world. I'm not saying I'm gonna kill myself, I just want help to enjoy the present and future.

&amp;nbsp;

It just sounds like I'm gonna spend all this money going to school and get some degree. And then when I get out of school I might struggle to get a job related to my degree. I might have to move back home to a state I don't like and work any job I can pickup until someone takes an interest in me. And any job I get I will be working for forever to make sure when I'm old I can sit around and do nothing. It's so aggravating that all I'm supposed to do with my life is work for 90% of it, get some money and exist. No matter how passionate about a field I might be, it's impossible for me not to experience burn out in 20, 30, 40 years whatever. I'm eventually going to abhor waking up to go somewhere that I have to go to in order to survive. 

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe my view is tainted, but I can't see anything that will make that at all better. No hobby will be fulfilling enough for me to accept that, no looming ""vacation"" time will keep me going. My mom spends her evenings drinking or watching netflix; my dad playing video games, watching movies, drinking, etc. I just don't want that. Any day off, even vacation, my dad is on the phone because of his job. Any trip we go on he has to call into work to get on a meeting at least once somehow. Besides the fact that we never actually go anywhere but the same two houses to see family who just want to sit around, drink, watch tv while we spent all our travel money to go do.

&amp;nbsp;

I already find it hard to stay motivated in my work now and it's almost entirely meaningless. I am a high achiever, I excel in school. I am taking challenging work loads, apply myself to all my classes. I definitely understand complex concepts quickly but am not one of the students that automatically understands things. I study for hours when my friends study for minutes. I already am frustrated with the work I do that the rewards for I wont see until im in a college I am excited about. 

&amp;nbsp;

I try and have a normal sleep schedule. I try and finish work in reasonable time to accomplish this, and to minimize stress from all my classes. But at the end of the day, if I finish my work before I would have to go to sleep, theres nothing I can do that will make me feel satisfied at the end of the day, like it was worth getting out of bed for. I have friends, I have a girlfriend. I get my social interaction, I have fun, laugh, make jokes. I try and find meaning.

&amp;nbsp;

Even now I'm looking for a job for some spending money. And of the dozen places I've applied to the one that called me back needed me to work all weekend every weekend and rejected me because I said I couldn't give that commitment. I feel like its already happening that I'll have to go to school, learn about things I don't care about but that will make me look marginally better on paper to a college admissions team, and then drive over to whatever place employs me and work all evening. Then when I get home around 10, I can try and work before I fall asleep. Getting enough sleep between then and 6 am is of course impossible. Then the weekend rolls around and when all my friends make plans to hang out I won't be available because my job needs me there constantly. But if I want to have fun and live a little more I need money from a job. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like theres no break for me in the future. No point where it all becomes worth it. Nothing I can setup now, start doing now that will benefit me and my happiness (not my ""future""). I'm so utterly lost and a mess right now and would just love some perspective.",15Jul2020,1

Niece invited me to her 5-10 people dinner reservation. We live in Michigan, so we had a pretty high case numbers initially, but they're getting better.

My niece works with seniors, so I don't think she would invite people who are not that serious about covid.

On one hand, I turn 21 only once. On the other hand, there's a pandemic. My niece was even willing to drive over an hour to come get me to take me, so I just want to hear some opinions.

112,"I'm sure everyone's probably been feeling a bit of this since covid, but I've really felt a profound sense of emptiness in my life here lately. Not necessarily depression or anything, but I just realized that my life really isn't going anywhere, and I'm 32.

Frankly, I've slowly been coming to the realization that I must not be very good with people; I've been living in this area for five full years now, and of the two friends I have in the area, one I've been butting heads with and is quickly becoming a person I don't like, and the other I'm just not a priority for (nothing against him, he's just got a lot going on with his wife and baby).

It really kind of jumped out at me this past weekend. Someone asked me for help moving, and when I got there, it wound up being a *ton* of people. By contrast, when *I* moved into my very first apartment last year, I had to pay movers because literally nobody would help me, not even my best friend/roommate (the one who I've been butting heads with over the past year).

I just sort of realized what I'd already been feeling all along; I'm genuinely missing *something* in my life. Real friendship, people who *want* to be around you. And, while a slightly different sort of 'need', I genuinely want to be in *some* kind of a relationship, be it serious or super casual.

I can't imagine most single people are doing much better, but I'm finding myself in a pretty sad routine of working from home, and then just browsing the internet until bed, or even just playing a shitton of video games. I try to weave a bit of guitar playing in there from time to time, but it just doesn't hold my attention for long.

I dunno, I really feel like something needs to change, but I don't know what or how.",15Jul2020,1

This doesn't bother me at all, but he still posts on his instagram story, and is online on xbox too pretty much all day. Should i take offense that he isnt messaging me? It wouldn't usually bother me, but it does break my heart that hes completely disappeared w/out warning because he was a great friend ya know, i dont wanna lose him.

Ok so my 30th birthday is on Friday. It should be a time to celebrate with friends and family. Unfortunately I have lost every friend I had due to drugs jail death or just fell apart because I did not choose the life of drugs. Family is also non existent. I have a step daughter and a girlfriend that keep me going mostly. So she wants to do something for my birthday and has said she planned a trip for the weekend but honestly I just don’t feel it. 

We have been struggling with money since COVID, we have had car issues, health issues financial issues with bills and rent. And the kicker, I lost my job on Friday. I have been fighting being depressed for a few months now and just can’t seem to shake it. It seems like every time I pull myself up a little bit another wave comes crashing me down. 

I feel bad because she is trying but all I am thinking about is, hotel for a weekend, money, food for the weekend  money. Going out to do anything. Money. All I’ve been thinking about is how I am going to be 30 and have nothing, pretty much have just been a failure. I have no accomplishments in my life that actually amount to anything. I have no job now. I have severe joint issues already. I am in pain everyday all day. I have no outside crutch to go to. It may sound mean but sometimes I need to talk to someone other then my s/o about things. But I still try my best day in and day out to do what I need to do for my family. I still push my depression aside. I hide my tears (hopefully hiding in the bathroom to cry counts) I push my pain away I pretend to be ok when I am far from it because I don’t want to put that burden on the only people I have left. Because what if it’s just to much. I hate to think that but it is what it is. 

Idk how i got off subject but either way. I am pretty sad/depressed constantly with thoughts of being a failure thus far in my life while at the same time acting like I have it together and know what I am doing for my family. So what this boils down to is... help!? Any advice on how to help shake this, any advice on how to not ruin this weekend being depressed. Every time I try and push through it and act fine I end up boiling over into a mess of mixed emotions and self hatred. Any advice on how to not worry about the financial aspect of this while just enjoying our time together which we never get. I know people i am a fucking mess. Thanks",15Jul2020,1
116,"I’m entering my 3rd year of nursing and absolutely love what I do. We will be online this year, so it will be a challenge, but I feel ready and motivated to tackle it. I’ve made some great friends in school and couldn’t picture life without them, but there’s two girls that I question if they will make me lose my mind again like they did last year. 

Emily and Sarah were one of the first people I talked to in first year and we always hung out just the three of us. We all got along well up until the end of second year (so this past March/April). Emily doesn’t study well at all and depends on Sarah &amp; I to give her the answers and help her out. I’ve genuinely given her my best effort at helping her study &amp; suggested she practices flashcards, but she’d laugh and tell me it was stupid. She was so close to failing after finals and would ask me how I’m doing well and I always tell her, “I’m not joking when I say to use flashcards”. Once we were told to go home due to covid-19, we finished our studies online. Emily severely struggled with this. Sometimes she wouldn’t show up to zoom sessions for scheduled lectures, she fell asleep during zoom sessions, &amp; she was late handing in assignments. I started to make it more known to her that I am not helping her until she can help herself, &amp; Sarah did the same. She ended up asking another girl for help and left us alone for the most part. Once we completed the year, I stopped talking to her entirely with no explanation (which I know was shitty on my part) but she brings me down. She doesn’t motivate me. She’s a complainer and talks shit about anyone and everyone. Sarah is becoming the same way. She doesn’t talk to me anymore unless it’s school related or her bf is upsetting her. She’s smart, but she also doesn’t motivate me or do me any good. 

I feel conflicted on what to do for school this upcoming year. Do I just ignore them and pretend they don’t exist? We have a group chat that we used 24/7 for school, and I’ve been wanting to leave that for a while now, but I know I shouldn’t leave it incase we actually need to talk to each other during school this year about projects, exams, etc. Any advice on what to do?",15Jul2020,1
118,"TL;DR: I'm burnt out and want to go home; my bosses think I'm making a bad decision and didn't accept my resignation. Looking for some unbiased advice. 

Happy to answer questions (maybe vaguely).  Also happy to post elsewhere if anyone recommends a more career-focused advice sub. 



In the meeting where I quit, I mainly talked about the lack of work-life balance (which was not a surprise to them; everyone on our team works like a maniac) and about wanting to move back to my home city (also not a surprise; I moved to current city when I was recruited to work at my current job).

I mentioned that covid and quarantine had given me time to reflect on work &amp; life &amp; etc. but that these were not new issues - quarantine may have exacerbated them, but definitely didn't cause them. 

However, my bosses think I'm making a bad decision - not the wrong decision necessarily, but perhaps an unwise one - and that quarantine has me in the wrong frame of mind to make such a big decision. So they haven't accepted my resignation. 

Instead, they've suggested that I book a flight home, take a few days of vacation, and then work remotely for 4-6 weeks and see if I feel differently in a different environment. (I'm already working remotely, but this would be extra-remote!) They've said this is a no-strings deal - I can work from my hometown per our agreement and still decide to resign. 

Not as easy as it sounds, unfortunately. My hometown area is under strict quarantine orders - I'd have to be completely isolated for two weeks before interacting with family, friends, anyone at all. Not ideal if the goal is to improve my mindset! Plus if I still decide to quit, I'll have to come back to current city, pack up, and move back again. 

I also don't think it's going to help anyway. I don't see myself changing my mind about leaving this role. My bosses mentioned things that are important to consider, but I've already considered them - the fact that I don't have another job lined up, I'd be moving to a worse job market (both in terms of opportunities for growth and income potential), we're in the middle of a freaking PANDEMIC and who knows what's going to happen. 

I know my bosses really want to keep me, and I believe they care about me as a person and want to make sure I'm making the right decision for the right reasons. But I'm burnt out, and I miss home.

My younger cousin (Jenny, 14F) called one of our relatives to pick her up from her house because she couldn’t handle the stress at home; she was crying and decided to stay the night at my relative’s house. Because of this, we found out that her mom (my aunt), told her husband last January that she wanted to separate. She then informed Jenny about the separation and the reason for it being that “they fell out of love” and that she wasn’t happy anymore with her marriage. My cousin has been handling it okay since January since bother her parents have ben living in the same roof and are in good terms but broke down when she saw text messages of her mom and her old college boyfriend, who lives in Texas and is also divorced. The content of the messages were related to how the arrangement would be if her mom and the boyfriend would be together with my cousins. Just yesterday, my cousin informed us that in one occasion in May and in another occasion in June, her mom asked if she wanted to go to Texas to go fishing and visit her uncle. It just occurred to Jenny that her mom was referring to her old college boyfriend.

This is new news to us, and so my mom and other relatives have been messaging and trying to call my aunt, getting mad at her and telling her that my cousin has been psychologically affected by this. My aunt does not return their calls or messages. Her college boyfriend got in touch with my mom and assured her that his intentions were good for my aunt, but some of my relatives dont buy it. Other relatives have brought up the possibility of my aunt being clinically depressed, and may be in danger since it seems like she is dropping her stable life for someone she does not know. My mom has been crying almost everyday because of this possibility.

Now, on my side, I know a few people who are clinically depressed. Some have unstable family backgrounds while others have good family support. However, one thing I have realized is that getting professional help and medication is what seems to work for them, and for me, no amount of listening or advice has helped most of them. Some people I know try to ask for help frim my friends and seek advice, but later on just never listen to the advice they’ve been given. I don’t blame my aunt if ever she is really clinically depressed, but I just hate that my mom has been crying over this especially during this pandemic. I tell me my mom that sure, she can listen and be open to my aunt, but that won’t “fix” her or her problems. I tell my mom that if we think she is depressed, maybe she should seek therapy and professional help, but my mom seems to be hesitant and tells us that we should observe first. I really care and want to help my aunt, but I don’t want to wait and seek help when she has done something drastic already like self-harm etc.

I love him so much, and he's an incredible man. I do want to spend my life with him. Everyone is so happy for us.  


I feel like I've changed, and I hate it. I keep having these sort of imposter syndrome issues. A part of me is so excited for our home, our future, and this step into adulthood.

I want to see the world, be impulsive and crazy, and I have no idea why. I've worked so hard to build this life- I know so few people my age can even think about buying a home while working in a field that they love. By all accounts, I should be thrilled. I should be so happy and excited. I can't tell anyone in my life this- they'll be disappointed in me, angry, even.  


I don't know if it's just the stress of the home buying process that's gotten to me. I have no idea. But I want to go missing in some foreign land.

My fiance works nights and the past few nights I've just spent crying my eyes out in our bed wondering why I can't be happy when everyone is calling this 'the happiest time' of my life.

STILL THINK ITS A CONSPIRACY THEORY??? 👁
Some things that make you go...HMM👀👀😳
I did not write this....but thought it was Very Interesting...

▪️Prince Harry and Megan leave the royal family.
(I would too if I found out my own family had my mother killed, and were satan worshipping, child traffickers)

▪️Prince Andrew is accused for pedophilia and was extremely close with Jeffrey Epstein.
(A convicted pedophile)
Research Epstein Island, Lolita express
(if you have a strong stomach)

▪️Research Pizzagate
(if you can handle it)

▪️Wiki leaks exposed Hillary Clinton for being a child sex trafficker (along with Obama, Podesta and many other people in power) and she conveniently deletes over 300,000 emails, and destroys a laptop and mobile phone she used while in office... and gets away with it??

▪️Trump gets elected.

▪️Harvey Weinstein, Hollywood’s biggest germ was finally arrested for sex crimes (another elite pedo) .. all of a sudden he gets the “virus”...?

▪️Prince Charles &amp; now also the Queen conveniently have the “virus”, yet the queen fled the palace to self isolate weeks ago...?

▪️All of your Hollywood favourites have the virus. Adrenochrome is your topic here, research it.

▪️Bill gates is pushing vaccines and global depopulation, and he conveniently owns 15% of the WHO (World Health Organisation). Yes, the WHO is a business, go figure. Which is also owned by George Soros and the Rockerfellers. Don’t know them? Research them. (This information alone should make your stomach churn).

▪️Google is currently uncensored and you can access this information. (Why now?)
Whilst you’re there, keep googling “Adrenochrome” and start to follow the trail...

▪️An Adrenochrome batch was made in Wuhan... how fitting...?
(Connecting the dots yet?)

▪️US has deployed 30,000 troops to Europe. “for training”. Without masks or any hand sanitizer...
Interesting..

▪️600 Mexican drug cartels have recently been arrested, one of the biggest busts in history by the U.S... why didn’t we hear about that?
Trump openly speaks about this more and more in his daily press releases as the days roll on, speaking about winning the ‘war, and barely mentioning the actual virus in his ‘Coronavirus’ briefings.

▪️ 298 Saudi’s royals, billionaires, lawyers and judges were recently arrested for crimes and corruption.

▪️3 Chinese including 1 Harvard professor were prosecuted for economic espionage a few weeks ago.. which is all extremely relevant to Wuhan, Covid-19 and everything that’s going on right now. Research this.

▪️Trump crashed the Fed bank, they bought all of the gold and now hold the keys to creating a gold back currency, removing the fiat. The fed and treasury were basically merged meaning that Trump is now the Chairman for the global banking system with the people’s money. Not the rothschilds, Rockerfellers, Soros, Goldman the list goes on.. this is HISTORIC.

▪️For this to be possible, the economy must be crashed. All corrupt coin needs to be drained. A 14-28 day lock down is the best way to do this and even better way to re-distribute the money back to people on government grants, payg refunds for business and ato offsets.. making sense yet? No longer will 99% of the worlds wealth be owned by an evil, greedy and corrupt 1%.

Believe what you want. Take what I say with a grain of salt... but open your eyes beyond the virus... and gosh.. just do some research! It’s all happening.

▪️Dozens of the worlds most powerful CEO’s have stood down.. why? Disney, Microsoft, Groupon and over 1300 of the top CEO’s.. gone. This was before the crash mind you... what are they running from???

▪️ Thousands of arrests have been made for child trafficking, human trafficking and sex abuse.. but the media is not telling you that... what are they hiding? Nurses are coming forward speaking publicly about the fact they’re treating hundreds of children in hospitals right now.. not for Coronavirus but for malnutrition, some extremely deformed, and all with extreme psychiatric damage due to trauma.

▪️ It’s widely known there are underground tunnel systems (research D.U.M.B ) that have been used for decades to traffick people for sex slaves and organ harvesting, across the globe. There is currently a monumental military operation going down, lead by POTUS to uncover these children, arrest those involved, and stop this evil once and for all.

What you are seeing is a war. An invisible war that Trump keeps taking about...

It’s a war between Trump “The Alliance” and the elites, bankers and mainstream media.

The alliance is a compilation of ppl who have been wirhing the government and slate sick of the bullshit

What your seeing is a war between good and evil.

Pay attention to the bigger picture. Trump has arrested and caught more pedophile and child trafficking rings in the world... but I bet you didn’t know that because the mainstream (George Soros funded media) make out that he’s a moron...

Trump will go down in history in the coming weeks.

There is no need to panic or have fear. This whole thing is working out as it needs to for Trump and his team to remove the corruption and power that has taxed your hard earned dollars, loaded your loans and credit cards with interest and pulled wool over your eyes.. we have been living as slaves to the system for long enough.

You’re going to see some big names get called out, to the point where you don’t want to believe it.

Oprah.
Ellen.
Obama.
Gates.
Clintons.
Podesta.
Hanks.
Madonna.
Gaga.

The list goes on and on and on.

If you still believe that 9/11 was a terrorist attack from Osama Bin Ladin who trained donkeys to fly cessnas, which then magically upskilled into Boeing’s and flew aluminium planes into 580m steel reinforced towers that collapsed like a deck of cards, not to mention tower 7 which was a block away but folded. (Let’s not forget the 6 seals who took Osama down that were killed in a mysterious chopper crash. RIP fellas).... you’re in for a wake up call...

Some of the big banks WILL go bankrupt, they are already on their knees, Income tax WILL go away and the elites will no longer rule you or the world.

Welcome to the New World Order....

🙏🏼

Don’t believe me? Do the research for yourself.

Personally I would read the Clinton emails on Wikileaks. Once you read that you’ll believe the rest. Many of the most powerful people are more sick and evil than you could ever imagine.

Start listening to Trump’s daily press briefings. This is not about politics. Read between the lines.

132,"I recently got my new jersey probationary license, and as per the law I'm only allowed one other passenger outside of my family in the car. however, this is loosely followed and I'd be very inclined to have more friends. I understand the law to minimize the distractions of an inexperienced driver, and I understand my parents interest in my safety, and avoiding the fine/increase in insurance if I were to be pulled over with too many people. for those reasons I will respect their decision (and I guess the government's) to only have 1 non-family passenger.

the question here is how to proceed in being parentally allowed. like I said I will abide by the rules currently, but would like to move past this to basically convince my parents to be ok with me taking more people. sorry if this question might not be allowed since it is essentially asking how to break the law, I checked out the rules and I believe it's ok

Edit - also I'm 17m and for what it's worth should add that my compliance is mostly out of preserving the trust in my parents and my relationship",15Jul2020,1
133,"
So we have been hooking up for a three months but know each other for years. We are both in late 30s.
This guy liked and even asked once if I’d go out with him , me but never had the courage to ask me out directly  as he thought I’m way out of his league and way too hot for him. Honestly I’ve never even considered dating him .So one day after a few years of knowing each other  I initiated a hook up. 

The sex is good , we always have great and fun times together , he even cooked dinners for me.  A month ago he even suggested to watch a movie together , he said he’d love to watch a movie in my charming company , I never followed through. 
We have a crazy sexual chemistry .

I truly fell for him,but lately he’s been pulling away , suddenly became distant , He was always in touch, texted me, shared his day with me asked how’s mine going . 
He doesn’t text anymore. 

It happened kind of after we had a general conversation and I told him that he doesn’t know what he wants in life and that I want to find love but with the right guy , kinda implying that he’s not the right guy. He even told me not to worry because I’ll find someone .
( he kinda said it himself in past that he’s not a committing type) but before he  cancelled a few times and rescheduled . 

The last time we met was two weeks ago. We went out and had a great time , he introduced me to everyone . I badly wanted to hold his hand but was holding back . I could feel so did he. We had a very intimate sex that night and did it without a condominium for the first time.
He text me three days after that day saying that all his buddies were so impressed by me and his gorgeous I am . And that’s it. 

A few days after I reached out and texted him that I’d love to spend  time with him, he resounded by saying he’d love too but he has to work .
Few day after I texted him again him to get together for drinks and watch a sunset.
He texted me back like after six hours saying that he would with pleasure but once he’s back as he is travelling for work and suggested to try to plan something this weekend. I said - sounds good.
He responded hours later: 
I apologize for the delayed reply, I’m busy with work, can’t even check my phone and reception here is bad,btw great pics.
Sounds like he’s brushing me off nicely ..

Haven’t heard from him since ..This was the last time we talked.
I don’t  know what happened to him And what changed ?Should I ask him on a real date and tell him how I feel ? or it’s a lost case and a bad idea?",15Jul2020,0

135,"Hello (f,23yrs old) I was in a car accident a year ago which resulted in multiple bulging disk and pain. I have had multiple injections in my back to help with the pain. The injections hurt but werent too bad and helped with my pain , unfortunately for only a short period of time. Due to that my Dr decided I should do a nerve ablation, which burns a nerve to not send pain signals. She recommended during this procedure I go into what she calls ""twilight sleep"" and some anesthesia will be used. Now, I grew up with drug addicted parents and seem to have developed a aversion to ""drugs"", really anything where I can be out of control. I have even in the past turned down removing my wisdom teeth because I feared using ""laughing gas"". I dont think I will become addicted to the medication. I just cant stand feeling funny and not knowing whats going on with me. I felt I was being silly with my control issues and agreed to the procedure and felt its time to grow up. However with this procedure happening in 10 hours.  I am really anxious about it. I want to cancel it but know its important if I want to live a a normal/healthy life again.

139,"Hey all. I’ll (19m) keep things brief. I’ve always liked some facets of women fashion, and thought that men’s fashion was incredibly restrictive. But that never really affected me until recently. My ex-girlfriend gave me a pair of her panties awhile ago, and when we broke up said I could keep them (like she kept my hoodie). They stayed in my underwear drawer for awhile, until a little while ago. I don’t know why the idea popped into my head, but I decided to put them on. I put them on, and I was shocked by how comfortable they were and how confident I felt in them. However, when the reality that I was wearing my ex-girlfriend’s panties dawned on me, I felt weird and a little creepy so I took them off and put them away, and haven’t touched them since. I thought this was a weird one-off event of my brain messing with me, but no.

I was in target only an hour ago, and while I was shopping, I realized I couldn’t take my eyes off of many of the dresses and outfits in the women’s sections. They looked so beautiful and freeing, and I started thinking about some dresses and such to buy. But I had a little thought in the back of my head like “dude you’re looking at women’s clothes, that’s gross”. So, I felt ashamed and left the store. I don’t think wearing women’s clothes is bad or gross (wear whatever you wanna wear), but I personally feel a lot of insecurity around it, since I had a dad who pushed a lot of toxic masculine ideas into my head before he died that I’ve been trying to undo.

This, along with the underwear thing, feel like my thoughts about women’s clothing (which ive always liked) are getting more extreme and closer to crossdressing. But I personally feel gross and pathetic for thinking about doing it, despite the fact that I have no problem with people who do it. I also don’t think I’d look good, since I’m more traditionally masculine looking and a broad guy (6’0 and 250 pounds) and I don’t know how I’d look in women’s clothes. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do, any advice is welcome",15Jul2020,8

Wearing the wrong slippers (wearing outdoor slippers indoors and vice versa)

Leaving things behind 

Being awkward and losing speech when people ask me questions, sometimes even when ordering food.

I just saw my therapist yesterday but last night I did something that triggered my anxiety so much worse today. I've never been on medication and honestly I just want to chill and not struggle with this anymore because days feel eternal, and I already know any problem has a solution, do why do I still feel like this?
So, I have clonazepam, and I'm contemplating taking 1/4 of a pill, just  once and just today in case it could actually make me feel better.

150,"Recently I met this guy through my sister (I'll call him""P"") and it was cool because he was closer to my age than my sisters so we got along well, and I really liked him. We would hang out and drink together at her apartment but we never really got super close or anything. Every time we got together we would always be the last two up. He would usually only stay up with me for half an hour then he would go to bed and I would be the last person up. I would usually sit on the spare bed with him until he kicked me out so he could go to bed. I always assumed it was just because he didn't want to start anything if my sister woke up and saw us in the same bed but he never actually said anything about it.

 I went over not to long ago, and as usual we were the last two up. I felt like I was pushing my boundaries, and getting a bit too physically close to him, and I thought I might be making him uncomfortable. So instead of sitting on the bed with him like usual I sat in the chair. Then after about 20 min he was like ""you know you can come sit with me"". Naturally since I like him I got super excited and hoped right on the bed. We sat and talked and I played with his hair a bit, nothing much just chilling on our phones and listening to music. Then he started to lay down so I thought he might kick me out, but instead he wrapped his arm around mine and just went to sleep. I was a little confused but I wasn't gonna start complaining so I just went with it.

 After a bit I started to get uncomfortable and I went to shift my body a bit so I could get comfy. But I guess he thought I was getting up because he put his hand on my leg to stop me from moving, and I was so shocked I didn't even try to stop him. After a minute he just rolled over and stared cuddling me. He is a very physical person and loves hugs and such but the most contact I had ever had with him was play fighting so I was speechless. I knew we were both intoxicated and he would probably freak in the morning but I was so comfortable, and so tired I went to sleep. 

When I woke up in the morning I was scared he was going to be mad. I had gotten up to go to the bathroom and he woke up, so I stopped for a second and then kept walking and he asked ""where are you going"" which I thought was so cute because he looked like a lost puppy the way he was looking at me when he said it. I told him I was just going to the bathroom and that I 'd be back in a minute. Now at this point we're both sober, so I knew it was just how he was acting anyways, and when I came back he had made more room for me on the bed and was waiting for me to come cuddle him. I went along with it because I absolutely loved the idea of it.

 We dozed off a bit and nothing else really happened that day. I went back home and that was that. Fast forward a few days and I found out through my sisters boyfriend that ""P"" had a new girlfriend. Now I was pretty upset and I didn't really know how to feel so I just kinda brushed it off but it still really hurt. But then he moved to a different state for work and I didn't find out until he was already gone plus he blocked my number which I didn't understand.

To an extent I understand that maybe after he realized it was wrong because I'm 3 years younger than him, or maybe because I'm his best friends little sister or something but it still really hurt and I'm having trouble getting over him:(  If anyone has any advice on how do deal with this or any suggestions on how to bring it up to him without bothering him please let me know. I also haven't told my sister yet and I'm not sure if i should yet. Please give me some advice:/",15Jul2020,1

157,"Basically, sometime in the afternoon my brother got home and told me I had some Amazon packages waiting for me outside. When I went outside and checked, I noticed there were two sealed boxes from Amazon. On the package info stickers there was my home address and my first name, neglecting my last name. In the first box, there was a dog gate, the kind that stops a dog from entering a certain part of your house. In the second, there was a box of neck cream and one of those ergonomic tilted mice. It was quite the random assortment of items and I didn't really know what to do with them. The items were obvious knock-offs and off-brands. When I told my parents about it, they were pretty concerned since I'm a kid after all and receiving unsolicited packages is definitely a cause for alarm. My dad tried calling Amazon to find out who sent the packages to no avail, and my mom asked around on Facebook. I'm 100% sure we didn't order the stuff. I checked my own personal Amazon account and there were no orders made in the last 6 months and I don't even have a method of payment. On our shared Amazon account there were no traces of us ordering such random items. Even if the order was made on our shared account, which is under my father's name, why would the packages be addressed to me personally? To be honest, I feel very uneasy right now. It seems entirely possible that my private information, such as my name and home address, have been leaked, and as a minor, that is extremely dangerous.

158,"Hi, my dad lives quite a long distance from where I live with my mom (6 hours by car) and that's the way it's been for as long as I can remember and I really miss him. I can only meet him once or twice a year for a little above a week each time, some times if I'm lucky even two weeks.

He doesn't have a job and relies on money from the government, lives in a one bedroom apartment. He's got some mental health issues and has been told (by his therapist) that he should move closer to me to help with this as he obviously misses me as well.

The problem is that since he can't afford the rent for an apartment by himself he has to send in an application for a ""raise"". Which he has done and he's been given a raise. But it's not enough for a two bedroom apartment where I live. He could ask for another raise (and probably get it) but considering everything with covid he tells me that he can't contact the people who help with this, but everything here is open now and I believe he just doesn't have the energy to do so. 

I've sent links to apartments that fit within the economy and have enough rooms for almost two years now but still nothing, is the government just this slow or is my dad holding back because he actually doesn't want to move even if he says he does?

He only wants a two bedroom apartment so I could get a room for when I stay with him but I'm 18 now (19 in just two months) and in just a year I'll be moving to another city for my studies unless I choose to study in this city.

After my studies I will most likely get a job and an apartment here myself and won't be needing a room at my dad's anyways. 

I don't know what to do, either I move away to study in a city two hours from here for a year. Or I stay here and study for three years (and get the same job either way) but I get to stay with dad sometimes and actually live with him for once. 

Do I move and tell him to get a one bedroom apartment or do I stay and risk the chance of him not even getting to move here until 1-2 years from now? 

I obviously want him to move here, but really he should have done so years ago.

My mom doesn't help with the situation either even though they're friends, she tells me not to hope for anything. And she seems irritated everytime I mention helping dad find an apartment or helping him get in contact with social services. I've lived with mom all my life surely she could let me stay with him on the weekends at least if he does move here. Everything around this moving cities stuff just keeps me awake at night with so many questions, especially as I'm writing this since it's 04:40 in the morning right now.

So I play soccer and I weigh 202 at 5’6” (16). (Lost 60 pounds)I play soccer and I usually set a high standard for myself today I played against great opponents who were above the age of 18 and they had hella skills. I did not perform how I wanted to and of course felt disappointed. After I was ready to leave everything just hit me I started comparing myself to all those players who had better bodies than me and played better than me. It got to a point where I felt that I couldn’t get a gf in comparison to them. I am usually confident but everything just hit me. Any advice?..",15Jul2020,1
165,"I need help. I'm having a lot of issues right now, I'll try to sum it all up but somehow I make every situation into even more of a clusterfuck. It'd be nice just to hear any kind of advice right now. I'll try to go through this in chronological order.

I'm trans, FTM. I was just outed *again* to my parents. I know, how does that happen more than once? Well, they were kind of in denial the first time and now it got thrown into their face again so that's a thing. Parents aside, I'm going back to school soon. Which sucks. At school, I tend to be a target of harassment, threats, stuff that really doesn't help my mental state. And I just had a pregnancy scare, which is exacerbating the dysphoria, which SUCKS. As you can imagine, I'm sure.

I was cheated on, then broken up with. For more context, you can check my post history; I'm pretty sure I came to this subreddit just a few days ago on that subreddit. Long story short, my partner cheated on me with their roommate, broke up with me, THEN told me about it. Yes, extreme dick move. I still want to be friends with them though. I love them, and I want to be in their life and for them to be in mine. I don't mind the not being romantic bit too much anymore - it's the surrounding situation that makes everything suck.

I want to be friends. We need space. I get that. But I also need love and support. Friend love! Woo. I have zero other sources for this. All I want is some convo man. I don't want to bother them. If they tell me they don't want to be friends, I respect them enough to leave them alone. All the same, I have never been closer to anyone and we've been through a lot together so I'm really not willing to give up on the friends bit unless I'm told specifically by them not to pursue it. Plus, I don't think they're dealing with stuff well either and I want to help them out... I believe I'm capable of that.

Yesterday I fucked up. After work, I drove to their place. I wasn't doing too great, no one was talking to me (including the other people I tried to contact aside from them), and I wanted to drive regardless and had nowhere else to go. And it wasn't bad, really, once I got there. We had pizza. It was cool. I mean, the issues only tend to come up when I have no communication with anyone, cuz I work myself up n stuff. 

I think their friend (the one they cheated on me with; they aren't in a relationship) had issues because I was there. Honestly, if I can deal with the person I just got out of a year-long relationship with living with the same person they cheated on me with and still be friends, I think they can deal with me existing. And the other friend they live with is weirdly protective and takes their side on everything. Ugh. Weird situation.

Okay! Moving on. As punishment for that, I got no phone for a week, no car till my birthday (30th, I turn 17). Also, I got busted for smoking weed. And outed as trans again. Whoops. Well, that sucked.

Two days ago, the same day I drove over, I'm embarrassed to say I relapsed. Not with drugs or anything. Self harm. Got found out immediately after... whoops. Anyway I'm not really dealing with that, it was kinda a heat of the moment thing. It's been a year since I last had an issue with that, and I don't think I will again. 

Point is: I have no solid relationships outside of this, which I do want to continue, but I recognize I need other outlets. I need to be able to talk to people. It's a major part of how I cope with past trauma, current mental health issues, etc. I don't know how to find more relationships. Now without a car for a minute and no phone for the next week, I am extremely limited in how I can go out and who I can talk to.

How can I find more people to talk to? Especially people that accept me?",15Jul2020,2

The issue is that I’m feeling depressed, probably as a result of being isolated for so long, and  fear of missing out has taken hold.

168,"Hey everyone,

This is a difficult post to make, but I am running out of alternatives. A year ago my father had passed away and two years prior to that my mother lost her father. Since I am a first generation American, almost all of our family is outside the United States. My Mom has only two friends but since they have families seeing each other only once or twice a month is hard on her. I am in my early twenties (male) and just finished college and trying to start a job and build a life for myself while at the same time take care of my Mom. After getting a job, I want to help her find a translator position since she did not work when she was raising me. My mom is a kind woman, but the recent losses of both my father and my grandfather have taken their toll on her and she needs companionship outside of me. Although I love her, spending time with her every day and listening to her speculate how lonely she is has been affecting my mental health. She also is looking to go on dating sites so that she can find a companion to spend time with. I was hoping if you guys had any suggestions or websites/Facebook forums that people like her 55+ can join so that she can make some friends. Thank You.",15Jul2020,2
170,"My (F18) mother is pretty against anybody participating in the military. I, however, have known since middle school that I wanted it to play a part in my life in some form. First I wanted to join the Marines but, as I got older, I became more interested in the Air Force and decided that that’s the branch that I want to go into. 

My grandfather has been supportive of this. He was in the army, started in ROTC as well, and was supportive of my interest in it. He’s the one who actually TOLD me that ROTC was a thing, brought up as an idea when I was determining how to pay for college. I instantly thought it was a great plan. I can get my college degree while participating in AFROTC, and then join the Air Force afterward. In addition, I might get some help with college too.

The moment I brought this idea up to my mother, she freaked out. How dare I consider joining the military, what am I thinking, it’s a dumb idea, we’ll figure out how to pay for college. What she doesn’t seem to understand is that paying for college is only a small reason of why I actually wanted to do it. I’ve thought of joining the military since I was 12. It’s been something I wanted to do for a long time, not just a spur of the moment “I need college money” decision.

Well I’m 18. So I put through the paperwork and contacted the people at my college, and I’ve figured out how everything will work in the fall. I’ve all but officially joined, as that comes later after the orientation and fitness tests and all of that fun stuff.

Normally I’d hide it from my mother, but there’s an orientation in August before college starts (yes, as of right now, it’s still on despite COVID-19, but that’s subject to change) that I’d need to attend. That would mean going there about 1 or 2 weeks early, which means that I need to tell my mother.

Yes, there’s the option of just leaving without saying anything until I’m at school early, but I have to get specific things I wouldn’t usually get (khakis for example), and she’s nosy enough that she’d notice and figure it out. Plus, I need to get a physical from a physician, which I can’t/don’t know how to access without my mother.

She has a tendency to flip out over things pretty easily, and I’m not sure how to approach this. She can’t stop me from going, I can easily pay my own plane ticket if she refuses to, so that’s not the problem. I just really don’t want to deal with the comments and nagging and crap from her about it, and then the attempts to guilt trip me out of it. It’s happening, it’s final.

So, Reddit, what do I do?",15Jul2020,4
171,"I'd like to think I am a pretty well behaved 14 year old girl. I make all A's in school, I am involved in after school programs, I stay out of trouble, I have never snuck out of the house, etc. I follow every rule in my house, except one, that rule being the bedtime one.

My dad has had a stick up his ass about bedtimes every since I could remember. My dad once sold all of my brothers electronics after he caught him up passed 1am. Recently my father came back from a military college type thing after being gone for almost a year (he's active military). The same day he grounded me because I hadn't done the dishes that morning. He also grounded me when I forgot to tell him happy fathers day. Simple things that I forgot to do, my dad flips shit.

My dad recently downloaded this app that tracks data usage and what time the internet is being used. So everytime he sees an electronic that is being used passed 10pm, he yells at me and grounds me. Yesterday he saw that I was up at 1am (to fucking check the time) and he decided to confront me about it. Now, when you are being yelled at its not like you are there to have a meaningful conversation, you sit your ass down and say things like ""yeah, okay, right"" while whoever is yelling at you asks you questions or tells me something. While I was doing that my dad got up in my face and starting saying that I was being disrespectful. He then grabbed me by the neck, hard enough to where I wouldn't breathe or swallow my food I was trying to enjoy with my cousins, and commanded me to stop being a ""little disrespectful brat."" He then loosened his grip after a very long 4 seconds.

I started yelling at him saying that in no situation should he ever put his hands on me or even think about doing something like that. He kept saying ""Oh I didn't leave a mark on you, you are fine."" But I'm not, I still think about that situation and its been a whole day. I asked him if he thinks its fine and acceptable to lay a hand on your kids and he kept answering yes, mind you this isn't the first time he's hit his kids. While we were yelling at each other back and forth he kept saying that I was overreacting and that I am being ungrateful. Am I? 

I mean my parents give me pretty much anything and everything I ask for, not that I ask for much. I have a roof over my head and food on the table every night, so am I actually being ungrateful? I know that my situation could be a lot worse, and I know my father isn't as abusive and as bad as other parents. I just don't know. I'm confused. All I do to break the rules is to not go to bed at my bedtime. I need some help. 

I forgot to add, I have a mom that is very awesome. She's always there for me and always yells at my dad after he does stuff like this, but she never \*does\* anything about the groundings. Usually its his word against mine, and all she hears is that I broke and a rule and that I need to be punished.",15Jul2020,3

174,"I see so many posts of people who couldn't move out until their 20s/30s, and that sounds fucking terrifying. However, I also see a lot of videos of people who moved out at like 16-18, and I wonder, ""how the hell do they do it?""

I don't want to go into too much detail here, but my family life is incredibly less than ideal. Being quarantined with them has been hell on earth and it's making me question and worry about my future.
I don't have close friends or family I could move in with. I'll live in the back of a car if I have too, but I need to get out. I just don't know how.

As of now, I don't have a driver's permit. I'm supposed to take this online test to get my learner's permit, but I emailed the place and I was supposed to get a response in like 5-10 business days and it's been a few months.

I was job searching before quarantine, but I highly doubt anyone would have hired me then anyway. I'm too young, I don't know how to write a resume. I'm not a part of any after school activities (Unless band counts?) or clubs, and I've never volunteered anywhere.
Before I can get an actual job job, I want to sell all of my old stuff online, and sell my art through Redbubble. But I'm still concerned.

If by some miracle of God I were to get a good starter job and a car, don't my parents have complete control of them? What's preventing them from stealing all of my money and then telling me that I just need to ""learn how to share""? They've done that kind of shit before. They say that when I'm 18 they'll just give me control over those things, but I don't know what to think.

They've never kept a single promise they've made. Is this that kind of situation? Do they have the option to continue to have complete control of my life when I'm 18? Do I just get the title to my hypocthetical car and control of my bank account when I turn 18 or is that something that they have to decide to give me? Is that how it works; How does it work?

I'm confused. What do I do and where should I start?",15Jul2020,1

A proposal), but I’ve told people close to me, such as my sister who is like my second half, and one of my other very close friend. My parent’s and I don’t have an amazing relationship so I am waiting to tell them until theres a ring (they won’t believe me otherwise and will insinuate that I am lying). 

This morning I woke up to a text from my best friend(20F) that her boyfriend of about a year just dumped her. She is heartbroken, even though they have been together a short time, they lived together and she repeatedly talked about how he was the one. She was financially dependent on him, and is now having to move back to our home town (two states from where she is now), and live with her dad. Basically her whole life has been turned upside down. She has to quit her job, drop out of school, and then find a new job and re-enroll at the Uni in our hometown. 

 I have been with my fiancé for over three years now and she has always been jealous of our relationship, as her relationships usually only last a few months.

181,"i’m in my twenties now, and with the corona shutdown i’ve been spending some time naval gazing and thinking about my life. 

i’m in a good relationship, i have some friends, and a dog that i love. i have a job—my boss is terrible and the pay isn’t great, but i feel like i’ve been luckier than some of my friends who have lost their jobs recently.

thing is, my life just feels so small. i think about spending the next year or five years or decade like this and i feel trapped. 

i spent the first 18 or so years of my life not being particularly interested in existing. now i want to live so much it almost feels like i’m trying to make up for last time.

i got exited before corona hit because i was unionizing my workplace, but now that things are reopened my coworkers no longer want to organize, and frankly i don’t have the energy for it either. i feel like a traitor- i make luxury items for a studio to sell to the 1% while people are dying from covid or marching in the street trying to change the world. here i am, too worn out from trying to deal with my boss to make an ounce of difference. i’m looking for a new job and i have a pretty decent resume/skill set, but the market it tough at the moment. i want to have the energy to volunteer with a mutual aid or go to protests.

the thing is, none of my friends seem to have the same priorities. i love them, but i feel like i need to find new people to share these feelings with. but i also worry like i might not be accepted into groups who’ve been doing activist work or the work i want to do because i’d be so new to it, and wouldn’t know anyone.

i want to start therapy again, but won’t be able to afford to until i get a better paying job.

189,"I’ve never posted anything of importance on this site, but today was a strange day for me and I feel like I have nobody to talk too. It’s between my mom and my dad and me and I just don’t know what to do anymore ( I also want to say that my parents are not perfect people but I love them both the same and it’s very hard to choose between them, and I also got to say that I live with my mom for the year and go out to my dads in the summer and on Christmas holidays)

My mom and my dad have been apart since I was 4 years old. I’m 16 now and I was going to visit my dad who lives across the country I live in for about a month. Long story short my mom and dad signed a court document or order that stated that it was me and my brothers choice not to go or when to go or not, that’s not the point though. It states some other stuff like when we aren’t aloud to go and when we are aloud to or the minimum days and stuff but regardless the main point of it is to not let stuff like this happen

So a few days ago I called my dad to let him know I was going out and stuff and he mentions that I should choose when to go home when I’m out there. I agree with a simple “ok” and carried on with my day, not knowing that in the order it states that my mother needs to see a return ticket before I go out. My mom gets home from work and says that in the court order I need a ticket back, that’s when I learn about the court order. I ask my dad the next day before my flight if he can book a return flight and he sends me a long paragraph about how we shouldn’t need to book one to see each other and to just forget about it, and that he thoughtless agreed to book them after I get there (it was a lot more then that but that was what it said shortened). 

Then, the next day, my mom calls me to tell me that she contacted her lawyer and they contacted my dads lawyer about return tickets and they have not gotten back to them. We wait all day till they get back to us to say that I agreed to my dad booking them after I get out there and there shouldn’t be a problem. 

After a while of arguing I finally get the return tickets 7 hours before my flight but I just feel so dissatisfied with it all. This all could have not happened if I just said we should book it before but I didn’t because I didn’t know we had too. It just all feels like I’m the one to blame for this happening. It’s already stressful enough getting on a plane to go across the country during a pandemic but it’s even more when none of my family can agree on something that we should have agreed on 2 weeks prior.

I guess what I’m trying to get advice on is what I should do, or how I should feel. I feel so angry and just disappointed in myself for not doing more about the situation even thought I probably shouldn’t feel this way. And I’m scared to confront my dad about it when I go out. Sometimes I feel that I might be better off just not going out at all but then I think how that will make my dad feel. It’s just so hard but then again it’s not. I just don’t know what to feel anymore. Should I feel angry or sad or disappointed, I don’t know.

I've been talking to this guy at work for a month or so. We've gone on a couple dates. He play-punches me at work and pokes me when he walks by. He texts me that he misses me when I leave, asks about my day. He seems to like me, but we had a conversation about what we both want and we both said we didn't want a relationship. I said that thinking I could handle a fling, but I can't. I now know I want a relationship, that's the kind of girl I am, and he has made it clear that he is not ready for one: 

(He was cheated on in his last one and ""isn't ready to trust again."" He says ""hang out"" instead of date because he says he saves that for a relationship. I called him ""babe"" once offhandedly and he says he saves that for a relationship too.)

Thing is, all I've ever been to guys is some kind of toy until something they really want comes along. Then I'm cast aside and forgotten. I feel like this is what this guy is using me for too, but I like the attention. All I've ever gotten as far as texts go are booty calls, and being teased at work and told I'm missed feels great to me. I had only one single friend, but she is seeing someone now who sends her poems he wrote himself about her. He calls their things ""dates."" When I heard about this all I could think was ""Damn it, that's what I ***deserve***. That's what I ***want***.""

I won't give the guy I'm seeing an ultimatum. I know that the right thing to do would be to tell him I'm not interested in a fling and I just want to be friends, but damn it is so ***hard.*** He makes work so much more fun and lighthearted and I don't want to lose that.

200,"Are there any courses, classes, meeting, I can take to improve confidence? I'm complicated actually. 

I used to be shy to the point where I basically only responded to yes and no questions. I worked on myself and now can look people in the eye and hold a conversation. But I'm not fully myself. It's like I still hold back because my tone dosen't change, I don't generally laugh, I force answers and questions. I do this because I guess im not comfortable with the person and because I don't know what to say. I act fake a lot of the times but that fake is boring. 

Also,  I cant be confrontational or assertive. Every time I try, I fumble with words and my voice goes soft. To this day, as an 18 year old, I still tear up when getting yelled at. Well, that is only if I speak up. If I stay quiet and take the yelling, I dont tear up. 

I feel like I'm incapable of things. Even after doing a big job, I'm still afraid to do that job again because I think I can't. Think im going to mess up or be too slow and get fussed at. 

I don't like disagreeing with people or sharing my ideas. Disagreeing usually means explain and in the heat of the moment I will stutter and not explain my reasoning very well. Same goes for an idea because compared to others my idea is stupid.

Is there anything I can do? Any classes that can help improve my confidence?",15Jul2020,2

203,"Hello, so a bit of back story here is that I lived in my current apartment for the last year and I resigned my lease with them. I was placed with a random roommate assignment because it’s a 2B/2B apartment and I have a cat that I know I am not allowed to have, however I made my new roommate aware that I had a cat and that if there were any problems for her to let me know. She told me she loves cats so much and can’t wait because she’s always had a cat. A week later my apartment building sends me an email saying they’re going to fine me and call animal control. Her lease hasn’t even started yet and she already is almost getting me kicked out... I know I am not allowed to have a cat, but idk I am pretty irritated that there couldn’t be open communication with me about the issue. Not sure where to proceed with this situation.

I’m going to use a relationship situation as an example.

i.e. Referenced the song “Freak on a Leash” in a context non-related to my sexuality (for background, I like very light BDSM)

My boyfriend said something along the lines of “I bet you’d like to be on a leash” and followed it up with an quote I’d said once, in a mocking voice “I want to suck your soul out through your d*ck”

These jokes made me feel really bad and weird and insecure about my sexuality. I can’t stop feeling gross about myself. I feel like a freak show for liking stuff like that. And feel gross that I like to give oral 

I sort of went quiet because my mind was swimming, and when he asked what was wrong, I admitted his joke hurt my feelings. And he has been really peeved about that, and won’t even sleep close to me. I feel like I fucked up so badly. 

We just had a small argument about it, and I feel so fucking stupid

208,"My girlfriend is a foreign exchange student who went back home to China for the summer to visit her family. Recently there was a policy introduced in the US that would keep any foreign exchange students with an online only class schedule from coming back to the country. She has hybrid classes so this wouldn’t have affected her and although it seems this was overturned anyway, there is a travel ban in place that keeps anyone who’s been in China in the past 14 days from coming back to the states. I’m wondering now how this applies to foreign exchange students, seeing how Chinese foreign exchange students makes up the majority of foreign exchange students in the US. 

It might seem obvious, go to another country that isn’t part of the travel ban for 14 days then come back to the states, however that isn’t financially viable for her.

211,"We live in the 2nd floor apartment and since May we have complained about the daily dropping noises and the furniture dragging noises from the 3rd floor. Two weeks ago, we had neighbors bang on the walls. The noises are so bad, the apartment shakes. We have made multiple contacts with the landlady to resolve this. She told us the unit who was doing it and we realized after the police reports we reviewed that she gave us the wrong unit. The final email we received from her states she cannot take any action because she cannot find the unit that is doing this, despite the 30 police calls we made on about the issue as well as recordings of the noise incident where the dropping sounds as well as the banging sounds occurred throughout the clip.

216,"I had no prior experience with romantic relationships prior to this one. It was a long distance relationship that lasted 8 months and we never met in person. 

Things were fine for the first few months until I began to throw fits over extremely petty things. Some examples: she said she'd call me but forgot, she watched a movie with a friend that I had wanted to watch with her, she didn't reply to me as quickly as I'd like, she chose to hang out with someone else on my day off from work instead of devoting the day to me, she was happy that a guy she played games with called her personality cute, she was making new friends while I was really struggling socially. Generally, I'd be at work and I'd get anxious about something petty and I'd ruminate on that thought until I'd end up crying because her actions made me feel like she didn't love me and I don't really have many friends or a good family. I'm just explaining what was going on in my head, not trying to justify it.

She was really patient and gave me more chances than I probably deserved. Eventually, she got fed up and suggested I start therapy. I promised her that I would, but I procrastinated on it for 2 months and I continued throwing fits and she ended things. 

I think part of my issue is related to codependency. My life at home with my dad who is narcissistic and abusive is stressful and hanging out on voice chat with her 24/7 made me forget about all my problems. I was so afraid that she would abandon me. 

I've since started therapy and medication and I feel like I'm making progress. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, CPTSD, and ADHD. I've been reading self-help books independently and at request of my therapist usually for 2 hours each night. 

I was wondering if anyone else has been through a similar situation and has advice or tips about how to stop my toxic behavior.

I posted this on another subreddit and received a lot of helpful advice so I thought I'd post it here as well.

My family family has a lot of financial problems and can't support me so I was going to find a  job and study hard when summer comes because I was going to give exams for university around September in the other hand my friends don't care at all for job or studying my friend A is going to go in a college in England her father gonna buy her a house and pay for her college so she didn't have to worry about that, friends B doesn't really know what she wants to do so she doesn't think about it. The real problem started 3 months before high school ended that's when quarantine started for my country first day of quarantine my friends friends sent me a message to tell me how excited they were bc now that school is closed and I don't  have to study we can't go out every day but I didn't like the idea my mom old and have a lot of health problems and I didn't want to risk it so I told them that I don't like their idea and the reason but they got angry at me after they calmed down they trying to change my mind by telling me that we only live once and we have to have all the fun we can get but that didn't change my mind next day they texted me to go out we them and I  told them that we already talked about it but they got angry for not coming with them and ignored everything that I told them the day before after 4 more times of asking I started telling that I had things to do and can't go out because I was tired with them calling me all day bc they were angry at me for not going out i somehow made did in the end of quarantine I don't know how.  So it now the start of summer and I had just find a job I also started going out with my friends when I had free time and didn't work everything was going well until my friends decided that we should go vocations the 3 of us together I wasn't really excited for the idea so I told them that if I had enough money and I was free I go with them 2 weeks later friends A told us that she has found the perfect place to go and showed up the hotel and it was like a palace and it also was really really expensive friend B loved it but I was like where are we going to find the money to stay there why not look for some more hotel's that are a little cheaper and talk again about it next week, so next week me and friend B showed friend A some hotel but she didn't like any of them and told us that it's not good enough for her to stay in at that point at started giving up the idea of vocations and started getting a little annoyed 3 days later they told  me that they decided to go with the first hotel and that they would wait for me until the end of the week to tell them if I'm gonna come with them, they day comes and I tell them that I can't go with them because I don't have enough money ( at that  time I had save some money for my work for university but I didn't want to use it for the hotel and even if I want they weren't enough) so then friend A asked me why not use the money I saved for university I told them the reason and she got angry and started telling me that it's not even that expensive and it's just money and ask me to just tell my family that I need money and end of the story and yes my friends knows that my family has financial problems so i told them that my family doesn't have enough money to give me and that she knows about that at that point she said that if we have enough money to eat how can we not have enough to go vocations just eat less meals and save the money it's not so hard or is that your family doesn't give you money because they don't want you to have fun I'm sure of it at this point she just started going on and on telling that my family is bad for me and while she was talking my mom called me and friend A was like don't you dare pick up the phone I won't let you I pick up the phone told them that I have to go and I don't feel like talking about the vocations idea anymore and I go home after that they texted me telling how they wanted to go vocations and they don't want to go without me and how I should come at this point I was angry because I told them I won't go and they just ignore me every time I'm saying it and ask again and again and again I didn't know what to tell them anymore so I stopped answering I also started going out with them less and texting them less in the beginning they would come to my house and wouldn't leave till I go out with them but after some time I told them I had work and I started talking to them even less and now it's been about a month from the  last time we talked in the beginning I was fine because I didn't have anything to worry any more and I was feeling free but after some time I started feeling but for avoiding them and now I don't know what to do i feel really guilty for not talking to them to the point where I can't sleep the night and some time it hurts so much that I feel like I can't breathe I don't know what to do I feel really anxious should I talk to them again but what do I tell them, I don't know what to do anymore.",15Jul2020,1

I (20 F) am roughly 5' 7"" and 180 lbs, and I have struggled with my weight for a long time. In middle/high school, I was always involved activities such as swim team and water polo. However, even when I was at my fittest, I was still considerably larger than the rest of my family. My two sisters (17 &amp; 23) have always been beautifully tall and thin. Their metabolisms are much higher than mine, and even when I eat healthier than they do, I gain weight while they stay small. I adore my sisters, but seeing myself next to them for years has left me deeply upset. Whenever my sisters and I leave the house, guys always pay attention to them. I feel like such a disgusting pile of fat next to them. This has caused me to stop trying to be healthy, and I hate leaving the house. I am ashamed to admit this, but when I look in the mirror, I despise what I see because I know that I will never be as thin as my sisters. When I meet other women of my body type or larger, I can see how beautiful they are, but as soon as I look back at myself, I'm crushed by hatred and self-loathing.

237,"Okay so I’m going to tell you about things that happen very very often to me and lol okay I know it sounds silly but I’m looking for some kind of scientific explanation for why I get this? I definitely don’t imagine it ive tested it. Anyway here goes:

I’m a 18F living in Australia if that makes any difference. As long as I can remember I’ve always had some sort of spooky string intuitive ability or something. I know. Just hear me out. 
So I constantly have very bad nightmares, 98% have obviously not come true but some of them have. (Trigger warning: r*pe) I have been sexually assaulted several times in my life, and I knew it was going to happen before it did. Like I didn’t let it happen obviously but a day or two before each of my attacks, I dreamt about it. To the exact detail of the person and of where we were and what exactly happened. As it was happening, I’d get a deja vu feeling and I’d remember the dream suddenly and as everything was happening in my head I was like “this is going to happen next” and it did, this happened will all my assaults (5+). Anyway, I won’t go into detail because it’s such a sensitive topic but I have more examples. 

When I was in my last relationship, I was able to “foresee” my partner cheating on me 3 times. All the 3 times I found out to be true. 

Someone has picked a random card out of a deck and I’ve been able to guess what it was several times in a row without possibly knowing which card it could’ve been. Although there has been instances where I’ve been wrong, but it is usually when I think about it too much and change my decision when it turns out wrong. 

I’ve done some intuition test videos and 8/10 I’ve been right as to what the person did (picked up a certain cristal out of a stack, what item is in a bag, a number underneath a rock, etc). Same was watching a movie I have never seen before (not having seen the trailer or anything) and I can “guess” what happens next from memory as if I had, even if the movie has never been aired before. 

Also stuff as simple as knowing what someone is going to say throughout a conversation because I’ve dreamt about it or what an animal will do because the same exact situation was in a dream.

It all seems to be tied to my dreams somehow and I really don’t know how to explain it. I have several more examples that I can share if you want. 

Does anyone know what this is. I’ve always thought it’s just a silly intuition I have but it’s right 8/10 times and it’s freaky. Any scientific explanation?",15Jul2020,3
238,"So my husband works construction and apparently the foreman on the job took the week off suddenly. Since my husband is an apprentice and can’t work without a foreman, the General Foreman of the company called and told him he had to go home. 

He works out of town, pays for his own travel and lodging and has already drove the 3.5 hours there and payed for the week of hotel. 

I don’t think they should be able to send him home in the beginning of the week and not pay him or let him know in advance that he shouldn’t come to work. It’s not his fault that the foreman took the week off. Shouldn’t the company figure something out for him so he can still get a paycheck? 

We just had a baby so he used up all his sick leave already for that, so they said he just won’t get paid this week. 

Is this legal to do?",15Jul2020,6
239,"I’m at my wit’s end and really need some advice in this situation. I manage a team that works very closely with one other team at the company. The manager of this team and I need to frequently align on projects that require shared resources. The manager of this team, lets call him P, tends to talk over people in meetings, often repeating what others and him have said over and over again. I have to meet with him frequently one on one and in other small groups, where he dominates the conversation. One complicating factor is that though we are in different departments, he is technically “higher” on the org chart. This is relevant because when I try to discuss strategic priorities for our teams, he will ask me to share my team’s priorities and then share nothing with me about his team, saying “I’ll discuss this at the company leadership level and get back to you, I need to get input from other leaders at the company.”

Among other behaviors that have become toxic to me are that when I share team decisions that impact his team, he’ll say “that would have been useful for me to know before, you need to communicate things with me more proactively.” But the I’m usually communicating these decisions within 24 hours of them happening. I don’t understand what he expects, and he never communicates anything to me other than rambling for 27 minutes of a thirty minute meeting and then interrupting me when I try to say something at the 27th minute. 

Honestly, I’m a pretty assertive person and have tried to both subtly and directly address this issue, often leading to tense and passive aggressive conversations. I’m afraid I’ve reached a point where I can no longer tolerate this behavior without breaking/ leaving the company but I really love my job and am good at what I do. So, how do I handle this rude coworker professionally? How do I stop this hostile dynamic from affecting me?

TL;DR coworker is very (professionally) disrespectful to me and is creating a hostile environment. Working with him is an important part of my job, how do I address this situation professionally?",15Jul2020,1

244,"So, i’m moving into my college house with 3 other roommates (one of which already lives there, one that’s moving in before me, and another that shows up at some point) and i’m already freaking out about COVID because I attend a large university and my roommates haven’t been taking many precautions. I’ve only seen them once this summer as I don’t like risking it. I’m a lowkey germaphobe and get incredibly anxious over this kind of thing (the whole pandemic is kinda my worst nightmare). 

Anyway, a bigger problem has showed up and it’s that the roommate who already lives at the house is having her boyfriend stay there during the week that the rest of us move in. Her boyfriend lives in California and is flying in to attend his brothers graduation. I REALLY hate the idea of this but there’s nothing I can do to change it. I’ve been told that he’s going to try to distance as much as possible but like. It’s a college house. Not much space. I know planes are really high risk and I am so anxious over this whole situation because even though I know I’m probably not going to die from COVID (i’m 19, don’t have any heath conditions except I vape [im hopefully about to quit this week lol]) I hate the idea of getting sick from all of them and having to quarantine. I have a boyfriend who’s also moving the week I am and i’ve only seen him twice this summer and I want to be able to see him. And also getting sick fucking sucks. And also also i’m a fucking mild germaphobe lol. 

I don’t really know how to go about moving in cautiously and how to set up boundaries for the rest of the year. I don’t want to be an asshole to my roommates as they are all my friends. I just really would prefer if I didn’t have to interact with them at all except at a distance and I just don’t want to be a piece of shit. I want them to just wear masks but I can’t demand that they wear masks in their own home. I honestly am pissed at this entire situation because I don’t understand why the fuck he isn’t just staying in a hotel or with his family? Him and his girlfriend/my roommate are putting us all at a major risk. Also, my mom and her boyfriend are helping me move in and I truly do not want them to get sick for a myriad of reasons. 

Any advice? 

TLDR: moving in with roommates, one of roommates boyfriend is coming to visit from California and is flying in on a plane. Very worried about COVID. Also would prefer to not interact with any of them very much for most of the year. Don’t know how to deal with this without coming across as an asshole.",15Jul2020,1
245,"We initially met while we were travelling Australia, separately, and although we didn’t get together there, she did express her feelings for me and I reciprocated the feelings as well.

We have always had a great communication, despite the distance and the time difference, which, I am genuinely thankful for, and despite her busy study schedule, she would always message me as often as she could and would call on a regular basis.

In the last month or two, however, there has been rarely any messages, takes days (literally) for her to even read the messages I send out to her. The worst part for my pity self is... that she constantly changes her profile photos, but still doesn’t read the message.

I know that she has a lot on her plate right now, and I am trying to be as understanding as I can be, and maybe it’s my own insecurity and my rather unhealthy brain of mine, pretty fucking pessimistic, doing the usual “oh yeah... you gonna fuck this up, you piece of shit!” Talk, but, I can’t help but to feel neglected.

Am I overthinking this? Should I have “the talk” with her? Any advice on how to approach this?

250,"It is my son’s first year playing baseball and he loves it.  He is 7, in a 7-8 year old league.  We were given the option of opting out of the league after the pandemic became apparent.  A lot of parents in our community pulled their children out, but we read the leagues plans and guidelines and we felt it was properly planned and it could be a safe way to keep our son from being stuck in the house.  Problem is, the rules have not been followed by anyone, including coaches.  No masks, no social distancing.  I now realize that the people who actually believe that COVID is real pulled their kids out of the league.  

A kid’s baseball league could be safely done, but my son’s league is failing.  I don’t want my son to be remembered as the kid who’s Dad made a big stink.

I’m not the type to go out and meet people for relationships. My concern is I don’t really feel like I’m catching any eyes or attention. I don’t know where I land on the attractive scale but I’d like to know if I’m high or low on a 1-10 scale.

I am pretty introverted but I sometimes go to bars and sit alone thinking that’s an attempt but just end up talking to strangers and the bartenders. Sometimes I do make random friends but it doesn’t really last in the long run.

I’ve tried to get a hold of old high school friends but they’ve either straight up said they weren’t looking for a relationship or none stay in touch.

Maybe you guys need a reference off my last real first relationship of how we met. I met her through an old school friend and we would eventually go out for drinks at the bar once in a while. We hooked up a few more times and things got more serious so we started dating.After about 5-6 months I broke up with her because I did not see having a future with her.

262,"First post, I’m really at a crossroads and I don’t know what to do here. 
I’m 22, just graduated college and unfortunately due to the pandemic I had to move back home. My home is taking quarantine extremely seriously. Since March when I returned I haven’t seen anyone my age and have barely left the house. I can’t go anywhere, see anyone, or do anything because of this and i’m starting to go insane. 
I live in a rather toxic household. I have a narcissistic parent, and being here for long periods of time is bad for my mental health. My mother and I stay home with our dog while my dad (nparent) goes to work. I’ve been collecting unemployment so I have a decent savings. 
We’re getting a puppy next week. This is very important. 
My best friend and former college roommate decided that we’d move out of our homes in February after getting jobs and saving some cash. However, one of our friends who lives in our college town (where a lot of our friends are) has announced a vacancy for two in his apartment in the middle of town for $300 a month. (To put this into perspective, a single studio apartment the next street over is around $1500/mo) This is an incredible opportunity, one that I don’t think i’ll ever get again quite frankly. He needs an answer by the end of July. 
Despite my feelings of unhappiness and this incredible deal, I can’t shake this feeling of guilt or reluctance to actually make it happen. I feel bad springing this on my family with the move in date being literally a month away. Not to mention that i’d be leaving my mother to take care of this puppy by herself, and I’m responsible for most of the dog care in the house.

264,"Some backstory. In 8th (I was 14) grade I dated a guy. He was my first ever boyfriend and I really truly loved him for the few months we were together. At the end of the school year he broke up with me because he moved to a different school and things just wouldn’t work but we stayed friends.

It took me 2 years to get over him. During those years I would still think of how we could get back together or maybe when we’re older we could date again. I would get butterflies in my stomach when he texted me and we even hooked up a few times but just as a friends with benefits sort of deal. Then I slowly fell out of love with him. Sure, I still loved him as a friend but I lost all romantic feelings for him and it was nice really. I felt that I could now go out and date other people with no guilt. Only occasionally hooking up with my ex. I don’t even want to call him an ex because we have been friends longer than we dated all those years ago. Plus, I feel closer to him now than I ever did while dating him because I’ve grown and matured. We’ve been friends for 4 years now. (I’m now 18)

But recently, things have changed.

He got a girlfriend. I found out because he posted it to his Snapchat and said he was in love. Honestly, I was so happy for him! If anything a little jealous because a possible tinder relationship for me just fell through. Neither of us has dated anyone since that 8th grade relationship so I’m just so happy that my friend found new love. But, I feel like we can’t be friends anymore. Most of the conversations we had were sexual in nature. He would mention wanting me to come over to hook up (it was quite a difficult task for me to do as I had to sneak out of the house) or he would ask for nudes or I would jokingly say sexual things and act innocent to rile him up. Sure, we also had regular conversations about memes and life and struggles we were going through, but I’d say about 65% of our conversations were sexual or led to being sexual. Also, what if his new girlfriend doesn’t want him being friends with an ex? What if he only wanted me for sex and now that he has someone else he won’t want to talk to me? Honestly, I don’t think he was just using me but what if it was all just a façade?

I’m so scared to lose him because I only have 3 friends (him being one of them and the other 2 being my brothers). He’s the only friend I have outside of my family. We don’t talk that often, maybe a few times a month but I cherish the times that we do message each other and I really don’t want to lose him. I really want to message him casually soon. Just like send a normal meme and see how he responds but I’m so so so scared that he’ll say he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore and that our friendship is over. I feel like if I just don’t message him and we never talk that he will never have the chance to say we can’t be friends so we’ll still be friends. I don’t know what to do. I’m crying right now at the prospect of losing one of the best friends I’ve ever had. I’m just so scared to lose him.

269,"I’m a 22yo male that recently finished undergrad from a great school. Despite the pandemic, I’ve been able to find a good job and I start work in 2 weeks. I’m dating a very independent, cute, trendy, and determined girl (also 22).

My girlfriend and I met over a year ago while we were both studying abroad. We liked each other so much that we brought our relationship back to the U.S., and dated long distance for the rest of our undergrads (different colleges in different states). She was able to land a job first, thereby focusing our options in the city where she was located. Although I was getting higher paying offers in separate cities, and although I asked her to consider relocating with her employer (which was possible for her to do), we settled in the city she was placed because I want her to be able to pursue what she wants. I felt a little resentment for leaving a lot of my operating network behind, but I was determined to make it work.

Flash forward to now: 
We’ve made the pandemic work for us...
Even though we spent the last couple of months apart in quarantine, we were able to find our own places to live in our new city (we’re not living together because we’re not married; she and her family are more traditional). 
BUT...
I don’t know if it’s because of her new job, or because of the cognitive dissonance of the modern young woman (work v. family life), or because of not being with me for a while because of the pandemic, but she just isn’t as sweet as I remember. She just doesn’t treat me the way I want to be treated. 

She puts photos of me on the bottom shelf, and when I say I didn’t expect her to make breakfast for me she replies “if I’m going to make it for myself I might as well just make it for two.”

I think she’s reverted to some sort of standoffish/independent mode because she hasn’t been around me a whole lot over the last couple of months. I know this because she admits she begins to feel more caring when around me over time...

But I just feel lost right now... I don’t have any family in my new city. No friends. No clubs/organizations. It’s just myself. Because of the virus, it’s dangerous to be going out around strangers. I’m just here, alone. My only real support system at the moment is my girlfriend. Given that I’ve spent such a long time committing myself to this new city (applying to over 50 jobs over the course of the past 8 months), and given that my girlfriend has been a little individualistic, I don’t really know what to do.

I’ve tried working out, running, painting, playing instruments, playing games, targeting my chakras, praying, etc. But nothing is fulfilling. I’ve found myself drinking on and off sometimes, which I know doesn’t help. I just feel alone, and I wish my partner made me feel a little more whole again.

I fear turning her away because of my insecurities, but is this something I should bring up with her? I don’t want to upset her... If I can just keep my head down and power through it, maybe she doesn’t have to know... But I just don’t want to go through this alone.",15Jul2020,1

279,my dad is extremely emotionally abusive and has been my whole life. he got full custody of me nearly 3 years ago and i have hated it the whole time. cps has been called numerous times by many different people and they never helped. he knows i want to leave and won’t let me and i can’t get legally emancipated until i’m 16 in 10 months. he wants to move far away and have me switch schools which is going to be awful. i’m bad at making friends and all of my friends and my girlfriend are at my school. i love the area i live in. he wants to move for a number of unfounded reasons but wants me to switch schools because my school supports BLM (i do too) and hes basically a white supremacist. because of his disruptive behavior we are most likely going to be evicted soon. the place id go if i wasn’t with him would be with my grandpa. what can i do and how can i get out as soon as possible? i’m a girl and in washington state btw,15Jul2020,7
280,"Hi, I need some advice on this sticky situation that’s currently going down with a black friend. 

It started off when she said something confusing “okay but do y'all friends not be delaying their school's plans to y'all and you just be like ""😔"" bc we have nOTHING”

And I replied with “U write confusing” bc I didn’t understand it. 

This was her message after: i'll put it in white ppl language ""do your friends ever tell you guys about their school plans and because you have none you're like 😔"" 

And then she made some jokes about me being illiterate. 

Then I told her not to be condescending towards me bc I interpreted her messages as such. 

She went on to say that I was being microaggressive towards her and calls me tone deaf for not understanding. 

I wrote an apology (honestly I should’ve just said “ok” and ignored everything) and she replied with this: 

i feel like you care more about the fact that you were called out on micro aggressions you have rather than address the microaggression that happened. your “hurt” of being called out will never equal the hurt of experiencing it repeatedly, that’s just it. if you find it so hurtful to be called out on a micro aggression, then imagine having to constantly go to black friends bc you feel like you said something wrong. there is no argument here because the two will never be equal and that’s just how i feel. i feel that both are issues are are valid, they’re just not equal. and i find it really funny that im supposed to take what you said as a joke, but my joke was taken as you genuinely thinking i would call you illiterate. it’s a double standard. you can mean it as a joke, but there micro aggressions come from, they’re not jokes. jokes can be misconstrued but microaggressions aren't something to be misinterpreted, they're just said. like you clearly know you’re not illiterate when you got into college and made all a’s. like im fine with you not understanding how i speak bc thats exactly it, we come from different places, but im not about to have you out here continuing behavior. i understand i was wrong for joking about something that apparently crosses a line with you and i apologized and said i would stop. i think of you as a friend so of course i felt like i should joke with you the way i joke with all my friends. like i understand you dont mean any bad intent, but i want you to understand the implications of what you say. 

I LITERALLY said that her words were confusing and that because were from different places and cultures that these misunderstandings are ok, we should just respectfully explain things to each other next time. 

I just feel like she’s taking this out of proportion BUT I am not black so I can’t say whether or not what I said was a micro aggression. If it is, then I would like an explanation to open my eyes and my mind so that I don’t do this again. 

I would include my apology but I don’t want to make the post longer than it already is. If u want to see it, I can post it in the comments.",15Jul2020,1
281,"Apologies in advance if this post is all over the place, I'm still upset

My mom's boyfriend, who I'll refer to as Chad, is kinda an asshole but I tolerate him for the sake of my mom. He treats her fine most of the time.

Chad is notorious for being unbearable when he gets drunk, about once a week. Think of the most obnoxious drunk you've ever dealt with, then multiply that by 10. That's Chad. 

Chad bullies my mother when he's drunk. He teases her, calls her names, and will even poke and prod at her until they end up in a screaming match. It doesn't matter how many times my mom tells Chad to leave her alone. He refuses to see what he's doing wrong.

Tonight was particularly bad. My mom injured her leg and Chad, who knew about the injury, poked at it until my mom was sobbing in pain and screaming at him to leave her alone. It got to the point where I had to enter their bedroom and physically drag Chad out of the house while screaming at him. Chad is the only person I've ever raised my voice at in my life. I then comforted my mom while she sobbed in my arms.

This type of episode isn't uncommon in our household. My mom and Chad fight every time he drinks. My mom and I have discussed what a POS Chad is when drunk, but she always excuses his behavior because ""he doesn't remember what he does when he's drunk"" and ""he's just not himself"". 

I guess my question is, how can I get Chad to finally reflect on his behavior?",15Jul2020,1

284,"I’m sure this has been posted thousands of times before, but I just really don’t know what to do. It’s not exactly the best time to start a new relationship/friendship with someone during Covid, but I feel like so many other people are in the same boat as me and I’m curious as to what I should do. 

I should start off by saying that I have struggled with terrible social anxiety my entire life and it wasn’t until this February when I was finally put on medication. The medication has helped me realized that it was the anxiety itself that has caused me to be single my entire life. I have never been intimate with another girl either, but I know now that I am very much capable of that. My confidence is no longer an issue.

It took me about a month on medication to really see the differences in my mood, and to really learn how to love myself. I have grown so much when it comes to my own self-confidence and self-love the past few months. I am extremely comfortable in my own skin now.

The issue though is that as soon as I started to become more comfortable with myself, the Quarantine began. Any hopes I’ve had of dating new people or anything like that has pretty much gone out the door. I really need intimacy with somebody. I feel like it’s way past due for me at 22 years old. I can feel myself getting more and more frustrated by the day and I really don’t have any idea what I should do. 

I’ve tried dating apps like Tinder/Bumble, but to be completely honest I really don’t think it’s for me. I’ve been on it for the majority of the pandemic and it’s frustrating to me that I don’t get matched with too many girls that I’m attracted to. It’s rare when I do and I think it’s just very frustrating hahaha.

I’m not a bad looking guy by any means, and I do think I’m a joy to be around. I have a full time teaching job, I coach baseball at a high school and I have a good sense of humor. Sometimes my anxiety does still come to give me second thoughts on things but I think that’s just who I am. It would help if I had another female to talk to about it with to make me feel totally comfortable. It’s really the only thing I’m missing right now, and I really do believe I deserve someone like that. Everyone does.

I guess my question is how do I cope with this right now? I don’t think things are going to open back up any time soon here in Southern California. Governor Newsome has closed all indoor facilities indefinitely. I try my hardest to keep busy and I’ve actually been doing a great job of that throughout quarantine but at the end of the day, it’s the loneliness that kicks in and it makes me realize that everything would be better if I could at least speak to someone who might be interested in me romantically.

290,"My ex was holding on to some of my things while I was in LA for school. Once we broke up I sent her things she had left here because even though she told me she didnt want them, they were hers to do with as she pleased. She had about $50 of things here. She was holding 200-300 records I had spent years collecting for my music career. About $400. She was also holding a $700 TV of mine. I sent her an email that the package was coming so she could keep an eye out for it. In that email I said I didnt expect her to have those things still because the house she was keeping them at she didnt live in anymore. Without replying or updating me at all she read the email and gave the TV away and let her friends pick through all of my records including an autographed Kendrick Lamar vinyl and a few 1 of 1 presses.

291,"Alright, here we go. 
Back story:
I plan on moving out of state soon, probably within the next 6 months, hopefully less. Hoping by late September to mid October I’ll be out. I know, coronavirus, but, the area I’m moving to has pretty decent jobs and...things are also cheaper now b/c of COVID 19, so I’m using it to my advantage(although I planned on moving around this time even before the coronavirus was really serious)
I’m turning 21 soon and I still live with my parents, my bills won’t go down any further, I’ve refinanced my car, credit is decent, I have some money saved etc.
Where I live now more than 50% of the people I know have been, or are currently in the military, and then if they aren’t at least 35% of the rest are doing hard labor jobs, b/c that’s the job market around here, militarily or hard labor, every other job especially any type of customer service work pays $13/hr max, and even that’s hard to find. I’m never joining the military and I’ve done hard labor, turned down about $50k a year(start out) nope, not for me. I don’t like how my surroundings are affecting and could affect my future career/life, like I’m destined for the military or working in a sweaty warehouse, which is one reason I’m moving, or want to anyway.
Which brings me to my issue.
I absolutely hate my current job, every week something changes and it gets even worse. 
I work in sales. 
If I don’t end up walking out I might get fired soonish b/c although the coronavirus has affected our customer traffic they expect us to get MORE sales than pre-pandemic.
However, I’m trying to save as much as I can so I can move out. 
I can probably get passed getting fired if I offer to go part time before they try to fire me, and am planning on going part time b/c I can’t stand the place anymore. I’ll probably end up only losing $300 a month going part time .
But...I have some dental work that’s going to be done at the end of this month and it will be costing me about $1,700 :(
So I’d like to make up for that lost money, at least $1000.
So the question is, what would you do, job-wise with all this in mind?
1)stay full time at my job that I absolutely hate and that may consider firing me soon, and hope it all aligns with my move out plans.
2)Go part time at my current job and find another part time job for a few months or so
3)Find another full time job completely and stay there for a few months or so.",15Jul2020,1

298,"My disease is a real problem! What am I supposed to do?


Ok, so this has been running through my head for awhile now and I just have to ask advice about it.

My soon to ex husband believes I use my disease as an excuse to stay home all day.

Mind you, I have a rare disease called behcet's syndrome (basically I can get more than 10 canker sores in my mouth to where I struggle to talk or eat, and quarter sized canker sores in my lower regions) and yes, it burns like hell to walk, let alone sit down or even lay down.

I have suffered with this ever since I was 4 years old, now I am 27.

But when ever I get bad flares my soon to be ex husband thinks I'm faking the pain or just milking it for attention which really infuriates me where I just start crying.

He says if I was really in pain why wasn't I staying in bed or not showing how much pain I'm in (so me, waddling with my legs spread out just to walk so I don't accidentally brush against my sores) isn't me in pain?

My sores will literally tear open and bleed and sting to where I'm just a complete mess.

I live with my folks because of this disease with my kids and when I get flare ups they help with the kids so I can soak in a cold bath to numb the pain down there, but each time soon to be ex comes to visit he just HAS to say something along the line of ""Go to the doctor"" (I can't because I'm still married to him (he makes too much and I can't get on disability to get insurance to GO to a doctor and then there's covid19 to deal with), demanding why I don't just ""get it fixed already"" If I could get this fixed I WOULD have but this is a life long disease there is no cure.

Meds can help, so can some numbing spray, but it only a minor fix.

The other thing with behcet's syndrome is I have an extremely low white blood cell count, meaning I have a very low immune system, so when my soon to be ex pushes for him to take the kids somewhere I'm stuck going because he's extremely irresponsible with the kids (lets them run around walmart with no supervision, let's their hand go in a public parking lot (all these times I had to catch them and berate him which he replies with ""They're fine. If anyone tries to take them or hit them they'll have me to deal with"" to which I'm like ""if they are too far away you can't stop someone if someone DID try and take the kids or accidentally hit them"" he just calls me paranoid. I have a right to. I'm their mom and am trying to keep them safe by keeping them in cart or holding hands in the store and holding their hand in a crowded parking lot. It's the responsible thing to do as a parent.

But anyway he tries to take them to his mother's which stinks of cat and dog feces and urine and is infested with roaches and bed bugs.

Our daughter has lung problems after being born with fluid under her lung (she's 6 now.) Our son is 3, but just the thought of going out in public with my weak immune system scares me because I can get sick easily and I worry about covid19 ALOT.

Sorry if I went off track but I have no idea what to do here. I've tried everything with my soon to be ex husband.",15Jul2020,1

He has counseling, group sessions and help. Over lockdown. He met several people, not come back in days and come back home.

Employees here aren't super tight-knit but outings to the bar or going to lunch are pretty regular and I want to make sure that she isn't being excluded and that my team will be cooperative and work smoothly in the future. How can I make her feel comfortable in our workplace without making her feel called out?

I mean I was always quiet but at this point I feel like I don’t want to talk to anyone and I kinda already “cut off” some ppl. There was this one situation that happened gave me so much pressure and it made me want to cut everyone off because it affected the way I feel and my mood for a while. And it’s not that serious. 

I’m also always frustrated at myself because I don’t like the way I am. A big part of this is my eczema. I’ve always had it, and I feel like it’s getting better but then suddenly one day it turns all dry and red. This happens so many times it frustrates me and ruins my whole day. I also have mixed feeling when it comes to how I look at myself. Sometimes I love my body and say it’s ok, but then other times I want to change it by exercising but I never end up doing it so it leads to more disappointment. 

I never really realized how emotional i am. Right now, I feel like anything that bothers me can make me bring out one tear. 


My parents are telling me and encouraging me to be strong and start being more active and exposed to ppl bc of this one time I refused to leave the house because of an event with tons of ppl in it. My mom is probably thinking I might form social anxiety and is trying to prevent me from it. I don’t blame them especially since I don’t really talk to much ppl and i might be more prone to it. I didn’t even know what I was thinking during that time

I know this is all messy and things, but I just don’t know how to feel. I’m not going to say I have depression because I’m not that upset yet. Although I just don’t know what to think. I don’t know if I even have a good enough reason to now wanna talk to any of my friends. Is “oh sorry I didn’t feel like talking or replying back” a good enough excuse for me who hasn’t really been in contact for maybe a month or over that? Is it also a good excuse for me when I refuse to hang out with them, after not seeing each other after school closed? I don’t wanna sound rude. Even though I don’t hate them, what would be my reason for not talking to them and staring a conversation?
 
Ugh I feel like this is not as serious but I just don’t understand my feelings. Maybe I’m just stressed and upset with myself.",15Jul2020,1

In April of this year my school held a blood drive for some scholarship thing (I guess) and I wanted to donate for a chance to win the scholarship for 2021. I went in and got my blood taken and that was going to be my only time doing so since I was really dizzy afterwards and I don’t want that feeling again. After a few weeks I got a letter from the hospital saying that there was a trace of Hep C antibody my blood and that I was on a deferred list of donors for my blood. I didn’t really think much about it since that was the only time I every wanted to donate but, Now thinking about it I’m scared that I might have done something wrong. Am I just over reacting or did I break some kind of law? I didn’t know I had that in my body and the donations were only for two days so I wouldn’t have time to see my doctor. Should I just ignore it? What do they do with the blood they can’t use? I’m really freaking out and I don’t know what to think of this situation. Please any advice will help.

314,"Before you start thinking I'm talking about drugs and alcohol, I'm not, but this post might get some good advice for the future when I might actually become addicted to that stuff.

So I love anime and manga. Watching anime really calms me down and puts me in my comfort zone. Same with manga. 

The problem I'm having is that I am becoming way too addicted to anime and manga. Today, I was on chapter 6 of a manga called Kanojo Okarishimasu and I've been reading all the way from 9 in the morning till now which is close to 12 am (obviously I haven't been reading ALL that time). I'm on chapter 76 now. So far, the manga only has 120 chapters or so. My problem is that every time, the moment I stop watching an anime or reading manga, I start feeling really depressed and have a lack of motivation to do anything. The only cure? Manga and anime. You can see how this is a problem. I just start to watch/read too much and if this keeps going on, I don't know what to do with my life. Not only that but if a manga or anime that I really like ends, I don't know how I'm going to get over it. I don't even know if I want to get over it. It's literally been one day and I'm already more than halfway through my favourite manga. I really don't want to finish it this quick because I want to be able to enjoy it for a long time, but I can't help it.

I have the same problem with games. Whenever I'm supposed to be doing homework at home, I procrastinate and start playing games. I start thinking that it's okay to do this, and then I play way too much.

I'm not sure if what I said up there \^\^\^ is confusing or whatever, if its confusing and you can't understand, please tell me and I'll try to make it easier to understand.

So what I need help on are: How do I stop becoming so addicted to what I like doing and stop procrastinating? How do I not feel such a lack of motivation after reading manga? How do I get over things like my favourite show ending?

They're aggressive, make me incredibly uncomfortable, and completely random. Shouting slurs, saying ""they're"" taking over. That it's like the ""planet of the apes"" now. It's bad.   


 I feel ashamed for not saying anything. I'm not typically a shy person, but this man is twice my age and gets visibly angry when he's starting one of these rants. It just happens so fast. I hate it and every time I drive home I ask myself why I didn't tell him to stop.

I really think that there’s nothing about me to love. The most recent discussion we had about this ended up with me telling my mother that every time she says this it truly hurts my feelings and makes me feel even worse.

Today I was playing Minecraft about an hour ago on the hypixel server and one guy I killed started messaging me and being all toxic. He eventually says that he was going to find my IP and was going to make me go offline and at first I thought nothing of it. Two hours go by and suddenly my WiFi shuts down and I was super confused as I had thought there was no possible way a guy in Minecraft was able to dox me. Pretty soon my brother and dad were asking what happened to the WiFi since it was so late at night. I said I had no idea (which I really didn’t as I kept denying that the incident in Minecraft were connected) then pretty soon my dad was trying all sorts of stuff to fix the WiFi because he needed to work. I eventually told what happened to my brother and he started telling my dad it was me who caused the WiFi to turn off. This made me all angry sad and confused because I knew what was about to happen and I couldn’t believe that my brother really thought a simple game like Minecraft could’ve cause it. My dad said that I can never play video games on any computer and saying that he could’ve lost all of his information and that shouldn’t be talking to strangers. My parents don’t really understand how Minecraft works (and video games) and so they believe some hacker could’ve stolen everything.

Now all I’m asking is to see if my Minecraft incident and WiFi turning off could be connected and maybe some advice to regain my parents trust to let me play video games as it is the only way I am able to do stuff with friends due to the pandemic.

324,"As you might discern by my username, I made a bungle and chose to break quarantine to spend some time with some friends. I went over to a Patient Zero's house with some instruments and equipment and left them there expecting to return the next day. Instead, I woke up to a group text saying that PZ felt sick and that nobody should come over until they give the all clear. This was 8 days ago.

They received a confirmed diagnosis two days ago. Of the items that I left there were a bag of Flamin' Hot Limón Cheetos (they're already gone, rip in peace), two guitars, cello rosin, and my pedal board.

At the moment, I feel fine and show no symptoms, though may be asymptomatic. I am unfortunately without insurance, so all I can do is quarantine (a brilliant idea, no?). While at my friends, I wore my mask a majority of the time (due to allergies, rather than the global pandemic of a respiratory virus), though nobody else did. Two members of the party have already notified the group and said that they're clear.

327,"My little brother asked me to trip sit for him and his friends today- of course I said okay. However, one of his friends who was with him, let's call him Ray, has a history of sketchy driving. A few weeks ago he pulled his car into our driveway, blocking another car, and was unable to get back in and move it right away because of how drunk he was (he had just been driving for 30 minutes with my brother in the car.) 
I confronted my brother about it the next day but he did not seem to care and told me that I was overreacting. To further my suspicions of Ray's character, earlier today they all went into his car to trip without my parents hearing. I went in with them to make sure that he didnt drive the car, but he kept trying to turn it on, where I had to physically reach over and turn off the engine. He refused to give me his keys.
Half an hour ago, they had come back from a walk, and I heard the car engine turn on. I ran out the door and stopped the car before it left the driveway. All of the kids were in the car and my brother was in the back seat out of his head. This put me in an incredibly awkward position. I did not want to be a buzzkill or annoying or anything. However, I was not sure if Ray was sober or not. Everyone (they were all tripping so they were not credible) was saying that he was sober. However, if I remember correctly, he said that he had taken the stuff earlier. Albeit it had been six hour, but I know for a fact that what he potentially took impairs you for more than that. I kept trying to reason with them not to go, which was so uncomfortable, but they kept maintaining that he was sober and that I was overrreacotng and being annoying. Eventually, I gave in, and just let them drive. There was not much I could do.
If I was right that he is not sober, he could kill my brother, all of those kids, himself, or someone else. If I tell my parents they will literally throw out my brother due to the circumstances. I dont even know the consequences for Ray. Despite him being an idiot right now, he is a nice guy. Thus, if I am wrong, i think the repercussions of that are pretty self explanatory. I dont want to call the cops for the same reasons.
I honestly dont know what to do. This is not the first time that this situation has come up. 
If it was someone I didnt know and the consequences would not be so dire for every single person in that car I would tell someone.

EDIT: They got home safe but I still feel that I could do something to prevent this in the future, but I'm in such a bad position, because I've known him since we were little and he is not a bad guy. I know the severity of this situation and what he is doing, but certain routes have the capability to destroy his life.",15Jul2020,1

330,"We are all 17-18, I am F and the friend is M. Let's call him M for reference.

M had a crush on me for apparently the 4 years we had been friends (I personally doubt it was more than anytime during the last year). He knew I had a crush on his best friend before he confessed his feelings to me. The best friend and I made out on New Year's Eve 2020, which understandably damaged both mine and M's relation and his relation with his best friend, although theirs recovered for a while.

Cut to the April of 2020, M decided to block all his friends from all social media. And due to the pandemic, that wa obviously the only way to contact him. This wasn't the first time he had done something like this. In October of 2019, we had school camps where he expressed his insecurity of losing us as friends. This time when he did this, he eventually unblocked us and he told me that he did that because he wanted to secure himself before we all move onto college and forget about him anyway. He is also very insecure of our mutual friends and is generally jealous of largely pretty much anyone who can maintain friendships.

Anyhow, the most recent problem is that him and my cousin (13M) decided to play video games together - I didn't know about this or I would have not allowed my brother to play with him even though M and I were technically on good terms. When I found out about this through my brother, he told me about M saying that I hate M. I don't know why he would say that as everything between us was completely civil and I considered him a friend.

At this point, unrelated but probably insightful, was a situation that happened with another group of friends. He decided to make his Houseparty (the videocalling app) display picture and name the picture of a girl from our school with a pen*s on her face with the name *her name*+is a d*ck. Due to that, he was no longer even on talking terms or neutral with a vast majority of the people from our school, although I didn't act any differently with him due to this (we were barley talking, I maintained the barely once a week convo).

Back to the playing video games with my brother... [I'm narrating how I saw the events, () are asides with previous references or info]. He texted me saying my brother is asking for gifts on Fortnite and that I should tell him to stop (probably true, but no I don't blame him, he is young). He also said like sister like brother even though I never asked for any gifts (on my birthday--November 2019, he gave me approximately $200, and a lot of teddies, which I tried returning on several occasions but he refused to take back). He proceeded to make comments on my family, how we are all gold diggers, how he wishes my parents cared more about my parenting. He claims his friend wrote these messages but that he stands with everything that was said in them. In the messages, he asks for money equivalent to $500 back (SIGNIFICANTLY more than the amount he gave me as a gift) 

Despite there having been no conversation of real friends, he seems offended over some real friends comment I made and constantly, now is telling me to see what real friends are like/ever try being one. This comment offends me greatly. In Feb 2019, he had a phase where he was extremely depressed and suicidal. This was very close to an important set of exams and during a time where I was going through a lot myself, yet, I have call recordjngs from a conversation with me consoling him. At this point, he was also planning something /illegal/against a mutual friend - a plan I just found out I have on call recordings.

Now, I have 4 options as to how to proceed with this situation. The first is, as my friends have told me, to ignore. This option seems safe but the kind of cheap comments he has made keep me thinking about this. If nothing else, I need a few more people to engrain to me that I need to ignore it! The second option is, I send him portions of the call recordjngs where I am consoling him. This is very petty, I am trying to prove that I had been a real friend, however since I am doing this for my own ego, this would make sense. The third option is that I talk to his mom saying that I cannot give back that amount of money and maybe even show her the recording of his illegal plan (although his friends say he is not as scared of his mother). Lastly, I can use social media to voice his toxic behaviour and his misogyny towards women (he has apparently tried to touch one of my friend's ass too). I have proof to substantiate all my claims so this option would make sense BUT comes with a high risk.

To give a background, he is extremely wealthy and due to the high corruption where we are from, it is possible that he harms my family somehow (after his plan on my friend, I am scared of that). Additionally, I need to add that I am glad I am no longer his friend and that he is extremely toxic in all regards. His father has also been accused of molestation, and spent jail time for the same, although got out of it easily - as far as I know.",15Jul2020,1

About a month ago, they met a 16 year old female while out boarding in the middle of the night. She started skating with them, and it quickly progressed to them hanging out at one of the friend's apartment. They all enjoy doing psychadelics, and very soon they began tripping together, with my partner's friend being the one to supply the drugs. 
I've spoken to the young girl before to get a better feel for who she is and what's driving her actions. She does not have a good home life, and her mother just passed. She doesn't have many friends, and she feels as though these three men have ""taken her under their wing"" and provide her with a sense of belonging and community. At one point, my partner's friends even went to her aunt's house to introduce themselves (her aunt adopted her after her mother's passing).
I don't necessarily have any evidence or reason to believe there's anything sinister going on between any of them.

I come from a construction background with my dad owning and running his own company, but so far after working alongside him for 3 summers he hasn’t taught me anything about physically or financially running the business even though he expected me to take over once I end my studies. I take a lot of passion in the business however he doesn’t anymore and chooses not to teach me what he knows, despite my determination to learn. Now, after being stressed out while dealing with health complications, he wants to get rid of the business even though I’ve been dedicating most of my life from high school and college studies towards making it better in the future. I’m really at a turning point because he’s the master at the craft yet refuses to teach me or get hands on experience in the field: I’ve been offered out of state jobs with competitors and have thought about leaving then coming back as well to go learn on my own as i’ve heard working with parents isn’t the best way to learn. I still have two to three more years in university, and want to actualize my goals of making the best company possible in my lifetime. Any advice on such a hefty topic? Any constructive ideas/criticisms would be appreciated.",15Jul2020,1

So he’s been in a bad way for a while, the last 6 years have been really hard on him, from his parents having a pretty bad divorce (this resulting in barely seeing his own dad and his mum not letting him see him) to having an all round shit time in secondary/high school  where he got mocked a lot and struggled academically.

The only good thing (at the time) that came out of his time at school was the relationship he ended up in with my best friend. We’ve all been close friends since primary but fell out for most of secondary school til the last year where we re kindled our friendship but they took it further. They were super happy until he went off to uni and she stayed in college. During that time he was extremely lonely, everyone in his course much older and never really took off with any of them, has to get a several hour train ride there and back every week etc. Despite him coming back every weekend their relationship struggled. He eventually gave up his course after a year to attend the same college as his gf. However during his time away girlfriend starting getting more and more attention in college and cheated on him. They broke it off not long after he’d come back. 

Now he’s finished in college and is forced into lockdown and it’s really bringing him down. I fell out with my formerly best friend over it and continued to support and be friends with him. He doesn’t really have many friends anymore due to spending so much time with now ex gf, so the only people he speaks to beside family are myself and one of his neighbours who went to school with us. 

He confessed to me a month ago that he was doing really badly and that he was trying to look into therapy for himself but was struggling as they are barely getting by financially as it is, I offered support and advised him to try and be put through with a doctor as they don’t charge/ charge less (live in Uk) . He was super thankful and all seemed fine, the rest of the week he’d come to me whenever he felt off or just wanted to chat about normal stuff. Then he’d left me on read for a couple of days, no big deal probably forgot then he came back and apologised. Talked normally again for a bit and I was telling him a story but that story hasn’t been opened since. I know that sounds bad but it was an entirely normal if not boring convo so I don’t think anything upset him. It’s been three weeks and I haven’t heard a single thing, he hasn’t been on any social media. I feel like he’s avoided me since he viewed a Snapchat story but hasn’t opened my messages so he’s active but not saying anything. His mum comments on my posts now and again on fb and would tell me if anything was wrong (so he hasn’t disappeared or anything). I know it seems like I’m worrying too much and he probably needs some space and that’s perfectly fine. I’m just worried for him though since when he last messaged he really wasn’t in a good state at all so I do think he needs the support but I don’t want to push. Should I try and communicate more? Ask his mum? Or just leave it and let him work things out for himself. Thanks",15Jul2020,1
348,"**Trigger Warning**: Manipulation, emotional abuse, suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m new here, so sorry if I did anything wrong. 

Also sorry for the long post

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: I stood up to my manipulative father after years of putting up with him and now he is cutting me off financially. I have no idea what I should do to deal with this. Any advice is appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I am 18, my little sister is 15. My parents have been divorced for 6-7 years. My father is extremely wealthy (has three boats)  while my mother has struggled to make ends meet for quite some time (bad divorce lawyer and a part time job). My mother has us 90% of the time, my dad only sees us a bit but manages to terrorize us all from a distance. I believe he may be a sociopath.

For years, my father has emotionally abused and manipulated me, my mother, and my little sister.  It resulted in me having multiple mental illnesses that I have struggled with for YEARS. I was even considering suicide for a while because he made me feel so terrible about myself (I'm okay now). I was so scared of his wrath that I never told him how he made me feel and pretended like everything was okay.

Recently, my little sister has been the target of his hatred. She is very ill and he has been refusing to pay her medical bills even though it says he has to in the divorce agreement. 

My sister wanted to talk to my dad to tell him how he makes her feel. He brushed the whole conversation off. I was terribly upset with his casual reaction as I always told myself that he could hurt me, but never my little sister. I asked him to talk alone and told him what I was thinking for the first time in my life. 

Basically, I told him that he screwed up his relationship with me, and that he should try not to do the same with my sister. I told him how I do not plan on visiting him after I go to college, and that I have been planning to change my last name (it’s his and I hate that). I want him to be able to have a stable relationship with my sister as that would make her happy (she is always crying about it). I made it clear that I am done with him, and I begged him to please listen to my sister. I managed to say all of this in a calm tone. He told me that I broke his heart and that I would live to regret it. 

An hour ago, my father sent me an email saying that I was EXTREMELY disrespectful and that I need to apologize to him immediately. He told me that I broke the Ten Commandments and disrespected GOD (honor thy mother and thy father) and that he has always been an amazing father. 

Because of our five minute conversation, I will no longer have anything that he pays for. This includes my phone carrier and car insurance (in my state you legally must have car insurance to drive). 

I do have a chunk of money saved up, but I needed that for college expenses.  

I have no job as I am a student. I still do not know what I’m doing next year for college because of Corona (online VS defer my acceptance and go to community college), and now I have to start paying for expenses I did not prepare for. 

Honestly, I’m just writing this because I’m lonely. I have no father, and I haven’t had one in a long time. I just have no idea what to do. Any advice is appreciated.",15Jul2020,2
349,"I know this sounds stupid, but every time I lose in any multiplayer games (in this specific situation, competitive Pokémon... The children's game) I get upset, without fail. I suddenly want to quit the game altogether and I wonder why I even try in the first place.

There's no hate towards the other player, just myself. They won with their skill, and it's just a game. I guess it's also worth noting I'm not much of a sore winner? I hate shoving my wins in people's faces, it's not nice lol

I have been trying to stop letting it bother me and changing my mindset, but it's a lot harder than it sounds. I also try not to let it show, but I think some of my salt ends up slipping through the cracks anyway, making me not so fun to play with, or even talk to.

How can I change this sore loser deal for good? It makes me avoidant of multiplayer in many games where I could be having fun, and I think it makes people avoidant of me. Should I be going into games with a winning mindset, like, ""I'm going to win this no matter what""? I'm always a little doubtful of my ability, and whenever I lose it's like a minor punch to the face.

354,"So I (21f) found out about a year ago that my boyfriend (21m) of 5 years uses Instagram to jerk off to girls. Recent searches always consisting of girls that we both follow and know and his coworkers. I found out by going through his phone (which I never thought it would be something i would do) but I chose to because at the time when Instagram had that feature where you can see what someone likes I saw that he liked his old coworkers old photo at 3am of her flaunting her body. (Not even what I would consider provocative, just a woman feeling bomb like all women and myself do). This caused me to look through his Instagram one day and see that his searches were just filled with women. I shortly remembered that he told me a password to something else and I was curious and tried it for his Instagram and accidentally logged in. I found out that he does this if a lot because I checked a lot (I know it’s NOT healthy at all because it fucked up my mental health and made me so insecure now). He even has had some alarming things like one of the women searched up being my sister sometimes which was my main concern to break up with him. Along with 2 different coworkers that he said one thing to each that seemed off to me. All of the conversations were innocent but one of them he told a coworker that she doesn’t have to work out because she’s hot when she was complaining to him that that was her New Years resolution. Also a different coworker (she follows me on IG too and are mutuals) we saw at a party that he texted the party address to later texted her that night to get home safe but then said that “she looked good tonight.” (The same one he liked an old photo of). 

My heart breaks typing this out that I had to go through this. I’m fully aware that what I did was toxic too by going through his constantly Instagram like that and totally invaded his privacy. It feels so out of character. But then again, what if I never knew? All of this was unknown about him. 
But anyways I know I type all of this traumatic shit casually, but long story short I almost broke up with him back in December 2019. I actually admitted what I’ve done and we talked and talked it and cried about it at random times for months and I STILL talk about it sometimes now. He ended up thinking that it was best for our relationship that he should just stop using Instagram. Which I told him he didn’t have to but it was his decision and he said it be best in order for our relationship to be better. None of the women affiliated by the way even tried to match the energy both women brushed it off probably and kept the friendship. Though I have a feeling they just probably feel bad for me for both know I’m his girlfriend because he posted me a lot. (Simp time ahaaa) 

Anyways the good thing of communication we have is he reassured me that WHENEVER it’s on my mind or something reminded me of it we can talk about it. And he’s lived up to that til now. A lot of things have reminded me of what happened and he can just feel and tell right away and we would talk it out for hours because I’d get bothered again. We’ve been good for months now but it’s always in the back of my mind. It takes a toll on how I feel about my body. Ever since we met in high school he’s been aware that I’m pretty insecure about my petite body. I tend to compare myself because when we first met I was 5’3 and 85 pounds gradually gaining weight by the end of high school I was 100 pounds and last year I was consistently 105. During quarantine I’ve gained good weight for me and I am now 120 pounds. 

Point is I’ve been feeling the sexiest I ever have felt in my life because now I feel like my ass, thighs and breasts grew and he notices that and has been hyping me up about it. (He even did this when I was skinny too just as much as he does now by the way) But anyways, the problem is, I feel more confident (not 100%) but this new weight gain high is nice. But- I STILL can’t stop comparing myself to the women he always looked up. Most were always consistently women that are curvy and as we say “thick.” And well yeah! I feel insecure cause I’m still insecure of shit I wish I wasn’t like having narrow hips. 

It’s really messing with my mind because through everything we been through I still of course know my worth. I forgave him and we both really love each other and are willing to grow past everything because we’re both serious about each other and we know it. But I can’t stop comparing. Which finally brings me to the title too, my current issue. It took a huge hit on our sex life for me. It’s always been hard for him to make me cum because we usually have sex in his car or rushed in my room when people are in our houses because we don’t live together. So, for me I personally think it’s hard to cum because I’m probably not completely comfortable most of the time being in a car or secretly having sex having to be quiet and sneaky. So usually when we’re having sex he still tries to make me cum and it feels amazing but I can’t cum unless I do it to myself while he’s still trying. My current problem is that I have to imagine that he’s jerking off to another girl or doing what he’s doing to me to another girl in order for me to cum. Because it always brings me back to try and understand why he looked up those girls specifically. I always think what do they have that I don’t. Crazy that I think that way I wish I didn’t but alas. But every time I make myself cum I have to think of that. And always I feel just guilty, dirty and angry at myself and him that my mind has to go there to cum. Can anyone relate or is it just not normal? Honestly any commentary would be comforting cause I don’t even know what I want to hear. I guess I just want an opinion on my whole relationship situation.

Thanks for reading.",15Jul2020,2
355,"I don’t know how to go about reporting my school therapist

Okay, recently being back at school people have been acting cold towards me, calling me fake and a two faced bitch (also making nasty comments to me and vandalising my locker eg: covering it ink, throwing mouldy food on it and in it, spilling spoiled coffee on it ect) I know one reason for that, was because someone went through my personal messages with someone when I was upset
. But I found out that my school therapist had been saying to other students that she “is over me and I’m the cause for drama” and also saying to students I basically couldn’t be trusted, letting out personal information about me. 
The  last couple years I’ve been at this school, this girl had been harassing me and nearly got my boyfriend thrown in jail and has turned everyone against me, this was apparently me causing drama when I went to get help.
I don’t know how to go about this, I don’t know where to go to report her seeming I can’t trust my advocates nor team leader.

359,"I'm still in cuarentine so I can't stop of think about myself, believes and future. I'm certainty wishing this shit comes to an end to go out there and live life as its supposed to be again just to stop questioning all.
In any case here's the thing.
Right now I'm 19 and I'm realising the fact that I'm questioning all my choices, what's next after this? So let me tell you a little bit of my background. The thing is

Since I was 12 years old I want to be a songwriter, have a prolific career, I dream with my songs rolling all around the world, make interviews, sing for a lot of people, that kind of stuff but because I love music and most of all I love share with peole. I can't emphasize enough how I start myself to cry sometimes when I'm singing a song that means a lot to me or when i perform a song that I like. Unfortunately the songs doesn't came out of my brain so often right now I feel it's because I don't have too many experiences yet, so that's it. I feel like I have a deeply connection with music because of my dad, he passed away 5 years ago now but it's like i been listening to music before I was born, that's the summary.

On the other hand recently I became too interested about coaching, social psychology, psychology, counselling and stuff but because I want to help people. I mean, I really want to help people who is struggling with suicide thoughts, discouraged about life, love troubles. However it feels like if I follow this path I'll be attempting with self against my desire to being a musician. 

Now that I'm thinking a middle point between these two thing would be to help people through music, no?. 

I don't know it feels like I have too much to try yet, and live that I can't even make a choice now. I don't even have a girlfriend yet, there's so much about life and the world that I don't now... There are so much mechanics on this life xD. I personally think that life it's the best videogame, so videogames are a great metaphor about life.

Let me know your thoughts about my life hahahaha. I don't want to do this more extensive with more background about it. I'll read you and let me know about my writing process here because English it's not my main language.

362,"I (16F) am in my last year of highschool and the time has finally come to choose what I wanna do in life. I love art and have fallen in love with the idea of going to an art school to get a duel major in illustrator( which is more of what I like to do) and architecture( which what my dad encourages me to persue). However, right now I’m taking a college class on Psychology,( something that has always interested me) and it feels like I could really have potential, and I really like learning about the human mind. I would love to help people get through their problems as a clinical Psychologist, but the career seems to be too long( 10 years in total to be qualified). 

It feels like I’d waste my parents’ money putting them in debt just to become a Psych student( have to get student loans). Yet, I don’t want to disappoint my parents if I go to an art school and end up not liking architecture as much as I should and end up just taking Illustration( which is something we haven’t really talked about)...

Then there’s the fact that I don’t want my career to completely consume my whole life( which I heard architecture does). I want to have a job that doesn’t consume my social life. As a young person, I still want to travel and explore places, and it feels like my education( along with my job) is going to take up my whole life until I die with unpaid student loans and not having done anything for myself my whole life.

I haven’t talked to anyone about this because I want to ask others what their opinion is first.

In the beginning it was supposed to be just two weeks over there, but now my mom wants us to come back every time this family member works bc she doesn’t want us there by ourselves.

And I’m a junior in college and never got the dorm experience, I was endlessly made fun by my parents and discouraged for wanting to move out with friends, and I just have very controlling parents. Anyways, I’m super annoyed at my parents, and kind of annoyed at my family member since they just kind of went along with it, when my mom brought it up that we should comeback everyday, and I’m just so frustrated with my mom just trying to ruin things like always.

I mean some of my cousins don’t even like coming over bc they have a tendency to just constantly start giving advice, making judgmental comments, and they’re always talking trash about how so and so is living like this, or doing that. I honestly think it’s a mixture if narcism and close mindedness (some other shit as well) that causes them to be so judge-mental and controlling. 

And so my point is that my parents don’t really see me as a person and I’m more just like a robot that they would want to program me. I have this one cousin with sort of similar parents, super strict, equally judgmental, and just on the same level as my parents. I hate to say this but this cousin is extremely obese, she’s anxious all the time,  and she grew up with mental health issues. 

From what I can tell she doesn’t even want to drive a car while being in her early twenties (and not bc she doesn’t have access to one or cant afford it), and she’s a pretty sweet person but I guess just kind of troubled. And the thing is I was obese, I’m anxious all the time, my parents were the type of parents to lose their shit when I started driving, and I’m sort of troubled as well. To this day I refuse to drive when my parents are in the car bc it was my birthday one day and I wanted to practice driving and they ended up just teaming up on me and yelling and screaming to where I scared.

And this is all to say that I feel like I need to loosen the chains off of me, and I fight tooth and nail for every ounce of freedom, and sometimes I think if I wasn’t so stubborn I would’ve have just turned out like my cousin.

So how do I gain more I’d independence and have them start seeing me as a person, and for that matter have me seeing them as a person bc right now I just see them as a guards that give me a place to stay and feed me. 

Also slight note, they’ve always provided financially but I can confidently say that I don’t feel like I have a close relationship at all with them.",15Jul2020,1

-it doesn't have accounting, politics, and organization which I want to learn before I go to college
-a lot of people say it's STEM is such a hard strand and has a lot of requirements

pros:
-it has accounting, politics, and organization which i said i want to learn
-it also has non fiction writing which I know will help with college essays so i want to learn it
-also this strand is more chill than STEM 

cons:
-no pre calculus or calculus which is sad cause i want to learn calc
-while it has non fiction writing it has creative writing which is really not my thing
-and the best of them all if that GAS isn't a competitive strand and i am afraid I'll lose my motivation to do better since it's not competitive

I’m afraid she’s going to develop liver issues and I know she probably already has them but bc she doesn’t take care of herself she never goes to the doctors and gets checked up. On top of that she does smoke a lot too. How do I help her? Also how long does she have to drunk this heavily for it to permanently damage her body? I’m afraid she’s going to kill her liver and I need to know how long that will take? She’s been like this for like 2 years but it’s definitely getting worse. Please help!!",15Jul2020,2

380,"So I (M 21) have been single basically all of my life trying to find the one person for me.
Well because I was searching for the one, I had a process that I would do. Start by making friends with the girl, see what she was like, if I liked her after I seen her personality then I just liked her. I would do nothing else, just be friends and hope she would eventually like me back which I never knew if she would so I would just stay friends. I now realize that that is not how things really work and that I really need to figure out how dating and stuff really work. 

However, I am not a social person. I don’t even really know how to text people besides if I had a  question about something they knew about or just small talk about random things. 

Because of my lack of social skills I don’t really know how to talk to people. So I figure I need to start meeting people and start truly dating to get practice in.
The problem, because I have been single all my life, I don’t know how to date. All I know is to go to dinner and a movie (paid by me of course). But I don’t know what people talk about, or even what people do when they are not on a date (like if we are in the lobby of my college dorm). So I can completely see us sitting in awkward silence, which I am pretty sure ruins a date.
My questions are, 
What do people who date do together?
What do they talk about?
How do you properly ask for a date if you barely know them, but what to get to know them more?
I like meeting people in person so I would prefer to not get a dating app like tinder or anything, so how should I approach people?
Also, do girls really prefer confident guys, if so, how do I gain confidence?

Also I don’t want to come across as a sexist or anything, I’m sorry if I did. I just have no social skills and only know what I have seen on TV or the very very little bit my dad has told me (which I figure his advice is a joke because his advice was, if she can cook, clean, and scratch my back. And if there are multiple girls are like this, I should choose the prettiest one).",15Jul2020,1
381,"Background: 
Me: 24f
BF: 24m, 6 years dating (2~ LDR)
Country A: Citizen, Place or birth, met BF there, BF is here, some where around Europe 
Country B: Citizen, currently I am here, land down under

After graduating from university my parents sent me to Country B, I did not want to go at the beginning as I wanted to build a life with BF (parents know I talk with BF but don't like him + parents don't let me go see him when we were in the same city, there reasoningis qre traditional reasons..). Anyway, my mother had already moved to country B and I was having a bit though time, staying at home all they (our city didn't have jobs for my profession) and BF still had a year at school which was in a different city. So I thought I would go to Country B, see job opportunities and probably turn back in 6 months.. well that didn't happen. 

Tldr at bottom,

See, i couldn't find a job but my parents were forcing me to get a masters as its a major thing back in country B, I took this as an opportunity to learn about a field in my profession that I had partial interest in and BF also supported this idea so I started school. He said that I can come back once i finish school and we can get married. Well during studying i also found a full time job  on what i actually wanted to do. I do not want to work in the field i am doing masters but i am 5 classes away from graduating.. I thought of quitting at one point but BF said that if i dont get a degree, what was the point in staying away for 1.5 years? + covid happened and the classes for this semester are online now so i will be continuing. 

The problem is BF and I are in a rough place as we haven't seen each other and I cant give him a certain date of return. Country B gives exemptions and he wants me to apply, I do want to go but not yet as I don't have vacation days at work yet and school is starting soon + health situation. Here there is nearly no cases where as Country A is a high risk area for covid. I want to tell him i want to apply in December or January, after semester is over and i will have filled one year at my job but I cant bare to tell him wait for 5 months more as even if I plan to I don't know how I am going to say this to my parents as when i tried talking to them before it always went like ""so you are dropping school just for a kid"" or ""you are pushing everything just for him"" and when ever I talk about him my mother shuts me down or avoids me. 

Additionally, if we do end up with BF, we will end up living in country A where the currency is 0.2 of Country B and the economy is not going to good and BF will have a hard time getting a working visa for country B and I will be having a hard time finding a nice paying job in Country A.

My heart says drop everything and go, time to live your own life the way you want but I dont want to cut of my family bonds as well.. 

What do you guys think I should do?

Tldr: in LDR, have traditional family that doesn't like BF, BF is getting tired of waiting and uncertainty from me, if don't know how to break it to my parents that I want to get married and leave the country or if there is another path to take",15Jul2020,2

Now, the thing about my parents is that they want me to be that ‘perfect child’ which I am farrr from. They want me to get straight A’s, don’t get in trouble, and they have VERY high expectations for me. So whenever I get anything less than an A, they get mad. Like, MAD mad. The previous exam, I got a B for literature, and they literally went crazy. My parents went as far as calling my ENGLISH teacher to ask her what I could do to improve. I know they just want the best for me but it’s putting a lot of pressure on me. So when I found out that I straight up failed, I nearly started crying in class. Once I got home, I just got more stressed when thinking about how to tell them and I started getting suicidal thoughts. Yes, that’s how scared I am. I know it sounds pretty pathetic that I cry about my marks, but it’s really important to my parents and I don’t want to upset them.

I'm sorry that this became too personal. I just wanted to share this too because I can't ever talk bad things about my family to someone close to me.

397," 

This isn't about politics or any conspiracies. I have to fly home to Pennsylvania and I love my family and want as little risk as possible from this shitty virus. I have been able to experience a view point of this whole pandemic with no American politics involved, only science - while here in New Zealand. I loved this country a lot and wish I could stay but unfortunately I am unable to. I don't want to keep this mask on me.. It's extremely claustrophobic and anxiety inducing but when I think about one of my family members having a tube shoved down their throat possibly or myself.. That outweighs everything. No eating for 35 hours, no drinking.

I have previous experiences with long dry fasts so I'm not too concerned about that aspect but I don't want to take any chances whatsoever. I have to ask if there is any risk with wearing a 3M 6900 Full Face Respirator for 35 hours? It's not the hardest to breathe through but does using the mask for that long come with any risk of suffocation or too much CO2 buildup? I hate the fact that I am forcing myself to do this but like I said, I'm too scared of bringing the virus back to my family to care about being uncomfortable for 35 hours.

398,"First the obligatory: English is not my first language, so this will probably not be written perfectly. I'll do my best to explain myself clearly.


This will get rather long I think. I hope this is still the right subreddit for this, as I am looking for advice.

Last year I started at a new job...I was there for half a year, and let me tell you it was hell on earth. I won't go into detail, it would be too much. 

After one month there, I was assigned in a new project and was seated with 3 new colleagues in a new office room. (Let's call them Anna, Sara and John) I thought everything would get better now, with the new project just starting and everyone being ""new"" to this.

So off to the mainstory:
As I was studying part-time at an afternoon college I used my work breakes to study. So I was just sitting at my desk, and eating something while taking notes or looking at flash cards. (Break times could be arranged by oneself, but it had to be half an hour between general lunchtime)

So on this specific day thats exactly what I was doing. Close to the end of my break Sara asked me, if I wanted to grab some chocolate from the canteen quickly before breaktime is ending. I said sure and off we went.
We were back 5 minutes later and started working again. Anna was not in the room anymore, but as everyone tends do wander around during the day I didn't think anything about it.

Another 5 minutes later my teamleader stomps in and, without a warning, started screaming at me. I was absolutely stunned. She spewed the meanest things... ""What the hell do you think you are doing"", ""We don't need people like you here who just sit around"", ""Is that all you did today? (While pointing at one of my stack of documents) this is NOTHING."" and so on and so on, and much more stuff that was just too much and very out of line. Keep in mind that the whole office could hear this and two of my colleagues were in the room with me. I stayed calm (holding back tears) and tried to find out what the problem is but she stormed off angrily and that was it. 

Sara and John were also shocked and asked me what I did wrong, but I honestly could not tell them, as I did not know it myself. As we were talking Anna came into the room and asked what the discussion was about. We told her and she nicely calmed me and told me that the teamleader is stressed and sometimes just gets outbursts like these. That I had nothing to worry about and my work is good and I am not too slow. I was very thankful hearing that from her, as she was the oldest of us and also the one who was the longest in this department.

No one in the whole department talked directly with me about the incident, but I heard from Sara and John that a lot of people came in and asked about it when I was not there...they told them what Anna told me and that was it - Or so I thought. 

Fast forward 5 Months. I have a new job and am finally quitting. It's not nice how they took it and everyhting was handled very badly but that was not important for me, as I knew I would be gone soon. In the meantime John, Sara and I have developed a good work-friendship. I was aware that Anna was greatly into office-gossip and such, so I tended to go on a friendly distance with her, and that was apparently ok for the both of us.

Now fast forward again, a few weeks later:
Sara told me, now that I am gone and at a new job, Anna is talking the WORST about me. Telling everyone how I abandoned them in these hard times (Corona lock-down), but I was working too slow anyway and I didn't even work that much, and everything I did was wrong anyway and she had to check everything without telling me... and so on. But that she is also so nice, to be in touch with me and asking me via messages if everything is allright with me.

And then the worst: On that specific day that I was shouted at - Anna was the one responsible for it. When I went away with Sara, she got up, went to my desk and took photos of my study stuff with her phone. She then went to the teamleader, showed her the phots and told her that I am not working but ""just doing personal stuff all day, while everyone else is working so hard to catch the workload."" Then she just stood there, hidden in the office next door and listened to the shouting triad that I got. Only to come in after it was over, and pretending she did not know what happened.

I am absolutely shocked and angry about such behaviour. Not only did she show it to the teamleader and got me in real trouble, she even told everyone else, showed the photos in the breakroom and told everyone how lazy/selfish I was. Everything with me being one room away. No one felt the need to ask me directly or tell me something about this. In the whole 5 months not even the colleagues I was friendly with told me anything.
And Sara got only told about this now because I was gone, and everyone thought we would not be in contact anymore.

I am beyond angry and would like to have a word with Anna. But I don't know if it would do more harm than good. But I want her to be ashamed of herself, of such behaviour and that I know about it. But Sara would be harmed too, because then Anna will know she told me about this. 
Sara told me she is trying to ""make things right"" by telling everyone that the whole story is a lie, but this is not whats bothering me. I don't care what these people think of me, but I want Anna to feel bad because that was the most devious thing anyone ever did to with no reason. She could have just asked me what I was doing, I would have explained and everything would have been okay.

So. That is my question. How do I let go of that anger, or better - how can I get petty revenge. (I know that's not mature, but I endured so much stuff there, and after all this time I now know that she was behind most of my hardships there. - There are many more stories...It's hard to stay mature.)

401,"Theres some e-girl selling porn of herself made when she was a minor. Idk if she's doing it willfully or if some abusive person in her life like a bf is forcing her to do it but the point is when she was still legally a child, she was producing porn and selling it. She's been banned from several big websites that she was selling it on earlier this year, my only pet peeve is Patreon. Patreon hasn't removed her account even though there's proof that she sold her underaged stuff there. And it really bothers me because when this sort of behavior goes unpunished, when our own police refuse to do anything because ""16 is pretty close to 18,"" it sends a message to children that this sort of thing is okay. Idk it really bothers me and I'm paying too much thought to it but ffs its not right.

I also have anxiety and depression, obviously. I'm medicated for them too, but my life is genuinely terrible, I also have a chronic illness that causes me fatigue and pain all the time. The fatigue is mostly gone with Strattera... But the pain is still there.

My resume is utter trash because not only I failed university but it took me more time than other people to get my HS diploma.

I hate my self, my personality and everything about me. When I say that ""my life is terrible"" I mean it. When people ask me ""tell me something good about yourself"" I don't know what to answers and it happened multiple times that they rephrased. I accomplished nothing in my life and I'm stuck.

405,"SOS. I (28 F) finally cut off ties with a friend who has been an extremely toxic person for the past 6 months. I am relieved but now I’m stumped as to how I stick with my decision to end this friendship and avoid the possibility of her weaseling her way back in my life. 

Here’s the backstory: 

I’ve been living in the city that I grew up in for the past 5 years since I graduated from college. Upon moving back, my high school sweetheart and I rekindled the fire after taking a hiatus while we both attended different universities. We are newly engaged and I couldn’t be happier. When I moved back 5 years ago, I had trouble making “post-college” friends and fell into my now fiancé’s group of friends by default. I love all of his friends, and their significant others, but I’ve never really had my *own* friend group during my adulthood. Last Halloween (2019), I reconnected with a mutual friend from my college who has welcomed me into her group of girl friends. It’s been so refreshing to have a new social outlet through these girls. I went into the situation of joining this crew very open-minded, optimistic, and excited. 

Fast-forward to February 2020 and things with the group we’re going great. One of the girls in the group (let’s call her “Christy”) and I bonded off the bat and we began to form a friendship. It started out fine, we were getting to know each other and enjoying each other’s company. But once quarantine-life kicked in, things started to get weird between Christy and me. It began with constant texting and frequent check-in’s. Christy started to constantly ask to WFH with me at my studio space or invite me over for a glass of wine. I don’t mean once a week, I mean every. single. day. At first, I was very whatever about it. I was flattered that she wanted to spend time with me and I was taking the whole quarantine situation into consideration assuming she must have just been lonely. I was also excited to have found a group of friends who I really liked so I was eager to pursue these new friendships. I very quickly realized that she valued my friendship more than I valued hers. I had/have the perk of having a very solid support system near me, with my then boyfriend (now fiancé) along with my parents and sisters living close by. She was/is single and is an only child with parents that live in a different city. Very quickly, she started to refer to me as her sister and her best friend. I did not feel the same way but I didn’t really think too much about it at the time. Before going to bed, she’d text me “LYLAS” and if I didn’t respond she’d bombard me with more follow-up texts until I answered. If I forgot to answer any text, which isn’t abnormal for me - I’m not a very consistent texter - she’d ask me if I was mad at her. When I said that I wasn’t, she’d ask several more times to make sure which I found to be extremely annoying. 

Christy began to adopt my habits and style. She started to drink the same craft IPAs that I love. She picked up smoking and started to buy the same cigarettes that I smoke - Virginia slims - which by the way is not a vice I’m particularly proud of and I’d never advocate for someone to pick up that habit because it’s super addicting and unhealthy (I’m workin’ on it!). She redecorated her home to look more like mine and bought clothes super similar to what I wear. She started to text my family, boyfriend, and childhood friends to try to establish a bond with them as my “new self-appointed best friend.” I soon became very uncomfortable with the whole thing and tried to back off by dropping subtle hints without hurting her feelings. When Christy didn’t take the social cues from my non-responsiveness/shortness, I decided to pointblank ask her for some space in the kindest way I knew how to. Again, she didn’t really receive that request seriously and continued to smother me and bombard me.

Ultimately, I snapped and I told her firmly that I did not want to talk to her for a while because I was feeling super uncomfortable by the turn the friendship had taken. Instantly after I snapped, Christy texted our friend group’s text thread and essentially said “I’m going through a really hard time right now so I’m leaving the city to be with my parents for a few weeks.” I felt bad that I possibly might be the cause of her going through a hard time but was glad she would be around people who love her most. When she returned a few weeks later, she asked if we could talk. I had cooled off by this point and agreed to meet. We talked about why I needed space from her and cleared the air. 

Shortly after resolving the “bump in the road” in Christy’s and my friendship, my boyfriend proposed to me. It was a wonderful day and we spent the evening with both of our families to celebrate. She showed up at our home and it was extremely awkward. My mom (who is the most laid back person I know) ultimately asked her to leave since this was a day meant to be spent with just family. Ever since our engagement, she’s been on a mission to become one of my bridesmaids. From the get go, I decided to let her know that I was only going to have my sisters and closest friends in my wedding party, hoping that by being honest upfront that she wouldn’t get her hopes up. Regardless, she cycled back into her obsessive tendencies in an even more intense way than ever. She has gone out of her way to try to help my fiancé and I get our new home in order. She has started to copy nearly everything that I do or say on a whole ‘nother level... from things as stupid as copying my Instagram captions/posts to using the same - very unique words that we made up - nicknames to refer to her dog that my fiancé and I use to call our dog. She has picked up tennis and constantly wants to play with me. She stopped by our house when we were out of town and picked up packages from our doorstep because she “didn’t want it to appear that we were out of town to potential burglars.” (By the way, she doesn’t live anywhere near our new home, so stopping by was very much out of the way.) She decided to get a new car and *not kidding* is only looking at cars with the same exterior/interior color / size &amp; shape as my car. Those are just a few examples among others. 

I decided to confront her again and ask for space after the constant texting, bizarre copying, and obsessiveness started to get out of hand to the point where my family, friends, and fiancé told me that I needed to run for the hills. I simply asked for some space (again) and reiterated that we had different friendship styles. I explained that I was feeling overwhelmed (again) by her in the nicest way I could. She did not respect my request for space. Christy has been non-stop texting me prefacing her messages with “I know you want space but [insert XYZ]”. I haven’t responded to any of them. Our entire thread from the past week is long block messages from her with no response from me. The other girls in our group are very aware of her obsession with me as well, without me even needing to tell them about it. She constantly asks them if they’ve talked to me or have seen me. They, too, are weirded out by this situation. 

On Monday evening another instance of obsessiveness occurred, which was the straw that broke the camels back. I broke my silence and unleashed my irritation by brashly laying my thoughts/feelings out to her. No matter what I said, or how harshly I expressed myself, she’d respond by saying things along the lines of “ok I understand but you’re still my dearest and best friend forever!!!!” Or “this is just one of those types of fights that siblings have! I’m not going anywhere!” I had enough and told her that I didn’t think she was a bad person but that I did not want to continue the friendship and then I blocked her number. When I went to block her number, it occurred to me that my location was being shared with her which I can assure I never did myself (so I’m even more creeped out, wondering if she had snuck onto my phone and toggled the “share location” option while I wasn’t looking so that she could stalk my whereabouts...) 

I feel bad about what went down but I’m at peace with wiping my hands clean and walking away from an unnecessary stressor in my life. I hate the thought of hurting someone’s feelings or isolating myself from our group of friends as a result of me isolating myself from Christy. So now that I’ve freed myself from this toxic friendship, where do I go from here? I’m so nervous that she’ll try to contact me somehow or that she’ll try to shower my with gifts (which is also something she has tended to do in the past.)

406,"Im a girl, 18 and have dealt with pretty severe confidence issues my entire life. I got a haircut today. Before the cut, my hair was about 2 inches past my shoulders. I asked the stylist to give me a layered shoulder length hair cut and to frame my face at the front. I now have what looks like a mullet. I dont know how this happened. I feel terrible. I was just starting to feel a bit better about myself but this look is not something I know how to connect with. This happened about 10 hours ago now and I have not been able to stop crying about it. 

it is so short. I cant hold it? I feel very disconnected with myself when I look in the mirror. I can barely stand to do so without having another breakdown. 

To a degree I understand that I may be overreacting. To be honest i dont really know why it feels like this is shaking my entire world but i feel extremely disoriented about it and like I cant move on? I have been able to understand that it is partly because I tied a lot of my femininity to my hair and now its just gone. I am not a masculine or androgynous person, I like to be feminine. Objectively I understand that I can do that with the short hair but I truly dont feel it I think. 

Ive tried to distract myself but then i run a hand through my head and it sends a surge of anxiety through me and I fall apart again. 

I know its just hair. I know it will grow back. But it is going to take me years to get to where I was. I know this is a superficial issue, I truly am shocked by how affected I am. 

How do I actually get over this? Anyone have any experience having their identity kind of shaken by this type of thing?",15Jul2020,3

408,"I'm 27 years old and male.

This is going to be disjointed and rambling because I don't really know how to organize my thoughts.

This time last year, I was drinking at least a 6-pack of beer every day, and I was 100 pounds overweight, and addicted to porn.

8 months ago I was dumped in the middle of the night after 10 years together.  I was half-drunk at my ex's house, sleeping on the couch and she woke me up.  ""Get out of my house.  I don't want you here anymore.""

She had gone through my phone after I had fallen asleep and saw that I was in some porn-sharing and roleplaying discord servers, and that I had a lot of porn saved on my phone (the porn wasn't excessively weird, but it did reveal some parts of my sexuality that I'm not open about and wasn't ready to share with anyone).  We had been going through problems for probably 2 years but I didn't think that it would last forever.

I walked home and texted her that I wanted a chance to talk about it, but she said she didn't, and that I should get help and leave her alone.  That was the last time we talked at all.  10 years ended with her telling me I needed to leave her house and that was that.

After that, over the holidays, I had basically no friends (as they were all mutuals, and she was telling them that I was unfaithful to her).  She knew that I was always pretty insecure about how much/little my friends liked me, so I was kind of resentful that I had to pick up the pieces alone.

I sent her an e-mail a couple weeks after that, asking gently and plainly if she'd be open to some kind of proper goodbye (we were together a long time, I didn't want it to end like that) and she responded by having the police do a wellness check on me.  I decided to not contact her at all following that.

One specific ""friend"" did kind of hang around and humor me, but was a pretty bad friend (to both of us) in a lot of ways.  I'd ask him to hang out, and I'd get brushed off, or we'd have a quick 1 hour drive around and that was it.  He sort of admitted to me that the choice between her and I was obvious, if only because everyone had already taken her side, and he'd be denying himself his social circle to hang out with me.  Made sense, I guess.

I had told him my side of the story in extraordinary detail and he told me it sounded like a really shitty situation.  I told him that if she ever seemed to have cold feet that I was willing to talk.

Anyway, months go by and I'm doing all the things I'm supposed to be doing.  I've lost 94 pounds (weighed in this morning), I drink socially and go weeks without drinking, and I masturbate occasionally.  I'm objectively in a better position than I was before (she wasn't actually a great partner, but I loved her despite her flaws).  My performance at work has increased markedly and I bought a car (something I had wanted to do for a long time but couldn't because I drank my paychecks).

I work with one of the mutual friends who bailed on me, but had been avoiding talking to him because I didn't know what kinds of things he'd been hearing about me.  People say horrible things about their exes sometimes, and I wasn't interested in setting the record straight, so I left him alone.  

But one day he approaches me and asks me how I'm doing.  I tell him that it's been really hard, but all I can do is make the best of bad situation.  He said it's plain as day that I'm figuring my shit out, and that he's really happy to see it.  He said he's not worried about me at all.

He and I start talking, and I address the elephant in the room:  ""How is she doing?""

He says that she's essentially in the same position as before, but worse.  She's still living at home (one of the points of tension during our relationship was that she felt I was holding her back from moving forward in life, which I probably was), she's working less, if at all (she did freelance work-for-hire stuff from home).  She never acted like anything was wrong following the breakup.  She didn't seem too sad, or like her life changed.  

Anyway, I didn't try and dig too deep.  It didn't make me feel good, but I guess I would have felt a lot worse if I heard that she was doing MUCH better after the breakup.  

She never asked about me once (at least as far as coworker was concerned).  Not how I was doing, not if I was alive, nothing.  Fair enough, maybe she found a wellspring of inner-strength that helped her resist the temptation.

Coworker complains that the friend who had stuck around and heard me out was telling some people that he was going to pursue my ex (a month after the breakup) so that was pretty fucked up.  I called him out on it and told him that I knew.

Anyway, a month or two later, I'm not sure how to proceed.  Coronavirus has put a lot of my plans on hold (new hobbies I wanted to try, travel, etc) so I'm limited with what I can do to distract myself from the loneliness.

I miss her immensely.  I'm doing alright, but I don't know if that's just because I'm in denial like I imagine she is.  We both had mental health issues, and one of hers was to deny her feelings until she inevitably exploded on me after months of bottling it up.

I half expect her to bang on my window at 3am demanding to talk to me.  But I guess she could just as easily never talk to me ever again. 

Is closure bullshit?  Shouldn't I have a little bit by now?",15Jul2020,2

(My first language is not english)

Me(21F) and my boyfriend(22M) met on tinder a year ago. We have been dating for 10 months.  
A friend of mine(23F), which uses the app, saw my boyfriend on tinder a few hours ago and sent me the screenshots of him being on there. I was like ok, maybe he deleted tinder, but did not deactivate the app. But then I saw that his starting picture is different.

The picture I'm talking about was taken a week before we officially started dating. (Tinder cannot update your pictures without your consent.) I thought that was weird but ok.

Then decided I will download tinder and try and see if he is on there. I saw that our chat was missing aka I could not find him in my matches. I saw on google that there are 2 options of him not being in my matches:

1. he unmatched me(but then we would never match again, ever)
2. He deactivated his profile.

I am still confused at this point, and I am in full detective mode.

As I am using tinder I decide to change my picture and bio and start swiping. After 2-3 minutes of swiping, I found his profile, which means that he was currently active.

I know that if I ask him about it he will deny, so I think I will just ask for his phone and go through it in front of him. And if he refuses - we break up. If I see the app I will look for current convos, was he still using it. So, my question is, what do you guys think, am I batshit crazy, or do I have a reason for asking to see his phone later today. Any advice on what I should do?",15Jul2020,1
410,"Throwaway time!

I (24F) live with my mother and father. My older sister does not live here anymore. My mom and dad both physically and emotionally abused us constantly until a few years ago. When my dad wasn't around, my mom sexually abused and molested us, my sister especially. My mom pretended to be my sister online, chatting with my sister's friends/internet strangers for explicit photo exchanges and sex talk. She would force my sister to perform for and even have sex with various (sometimes completely random) men throughout her early teen and late teen years. My mother lived through her every single day, going to clubs and bars to force her to entice anyone she could get. Basically, my sister's life became the hell of a living sex doll, and I was either beaten, ignored, or included when mom got bored.

Years later, I have found backups my mom kept of her old PC during that time. It's full of explicit photos of my sister and chat logs of my mother pretending to be her, both with my sister's then-high school friends and with the various random men my mom had liked online.

I knew these existed, but now that I actually have them I have no idea what to do with this. Police have always been unhelpful, if not detrimental. I don't even know if it would be beneficial to turn any of this in. My mother will not ever admit to having done anything, and I've come to terms with that. I don't think my sister would want to know I have these after she escaped and is doing her damnedest to recover. I'm not sure if I should tell anyone about what I've found, but I don't feel right getting rid of them. Reddit, what the hell should I do?",15Jul2020,2
411,"TL;DR at the bottom

My older brother (21) is very, very religious (Christian) and I believe that he’s no longer eating solid food as a part of his religious beliefs. Whenever I ask him questions such as “when was the last time you ate?” he’ll immediately get defensive and huddle in his room. He works full time as a package handler which is a very labor intensive job. Furthermore, he’s already quite slim before he began fasting as he does. I only ever see him drink tea or apple juice (almost never pure water). He also spends borderline all his free time watching (I’m 99% sure to be) a christian preacher on youtube. When he was trying to convince me that solid food isn’t necessary for survival and hunger is a myth, he said the longest he’s been without food is 9 days. He’s also convinced that “research shows that people can survive 40 days without food”. Most of my family is loosely religious but I believe my older brothers devotion has become quite dangerous. I don’t want him to collapse at work or fall asleep driving because he’s not properly nourishing himself. In addition, I don’t want him to face any of the irreplaceable effects of malnutrition. :(

**TL;DR** - My older brother is taking his religious fasting to the extremes and i’m worried for his health. What is the best course of action to ensure he regains healthy eating habits?",15Jul2020,3

I never had any money problems when I was a kid, so whenever I wanted something my mother would buy it for me, but I don't know she always seemed so emotionless independently what is was.

Because of all that I always had a problem connecting to people, it's not that I'm a anti social but I can't get any close friends or I can't keep a serious relationship with someone just because I don't know how to show love or how to love someone, friend or not.

Whenever he picked me up he would just leave me at my great grandmothers (who couldnt speak english) it wasnt until he had a girlfriend that he actually took me out to do things and actually celebrated my birthday. Now my mum was a young single mother and it wasnt easy but he never helped pay child support. He never payed yet he was able to have a large wedding, go on holidays, build a house and have another child (who is 1 in present time).

 I never complained yet the thing that hurt most was that I was always hidden, his wife's family dont know about me..any big event I wasnt invited. This hurt, he got married when I was 10/11. Whenever his wife's calls her mum I'm always forced to have a shower or go into the media room :( On top of this whenever I'd get money from family members he would forcefully take it from me and never give it back...I feel so unwanted.

 To make matters worse he always dismisses my concerns and gets angry if I'm not happy so for approx half a year I stopped answering his calls. I was only seeing him on the holidays because of my brother but even before he was born he was always telling me to catch a train to his place ...he cant even be bothered coming to get me 5 times a year (the house he built is approx 2-4 hours away by car)
 Now he cant even pick me up on time and he doesnt want my mum to know his address because hes afraid she will ""do something"" I addressed these problems with him and he dismissed it saying that I didnt understand and his reasoning was because my mums crazy :/ 

My mum doesnt have the best mental health but she sacrificed everything for me back when I was 10 she couldnt handle all the pressure and ended up going to a mental hospital. He dismissed my issues and said I was being brainwashed by my mum however I had never told her my concerns until recently and these problems have stayed with me for years.

 Help I need advice the letters that are about me that are for him go to my great grandmothers house doesnt it make more sense that hes just trying to get out of paying child support than because my mums crazy.

For some context, I'm an artist starting to network and build an online audience with plans on getting prints made once lockdown ends. I'm using this time to build up followers that are invested in my work, and as is usually the case for artists, a good chunk of my following is currently family.

I know to some extent, it is normal to feel smothered when family comment and react to everything on social media, but I really don't know where to draw the line between reasonable interaction, and overbearing behaviours. I don't know if I should even be bothered at all, but for some reason it really gets under my skin.

It's the same on my personal accounts too. Every update to every story, every single post, every comment - like, like, love, respond, respond, respond. It's exhausting, but I know -realistically- it's coming from a place of love and support. Any advice on how to approach this from a more positive perspective, and if that fails, how to have the awkward conversation that I feel like I'm being constantly watched?

I feel like blocking them is a bit much, and they'll know because they keep checking up on my profiles. Likewise, I'm worried about muting them/hiding my stories as I don't want them to talk to mutual friends and find out that they've been excluded from my social media.

He was venting to me earlier via text, and honestly, I froze I didn't know how to respond. All I could say was, "" I'm sure the procedure will be fine "" and ""If there's any way I can help, I got your back, bro."" 

I don't know how to give advice. I feel like I didn't help at all. I'm not a very good communicator.  


He always says, ""I'm alright,  I've gone through shit my entire life. I'm good.""

I can't imagine what he's going through. I'm sure he's in pain. 

What else could've I have said. How can I help?",15Jul2020,0

I (18m) am still uncircumcised and it affects me as to how will girls react to it. Its a bit scary. My previous girlfriend never made any comments about it and was chill. But how will other women react as it makes me very conscious and i won't really send dick pics or anything?",15Jul2020,0
433,"I don’t know if I want to become more cute and fem for vanity’s sake or if I could possibly be transgender. I’ve been doin some serious pondering and I’m still struggling to come to a conclusion. 

For a long time I wanted to be cuter rather than manlier. These past couple of years I’ve been trying to do little things to appear less masculine and more feminine. I then delved into trying to be girly and “cuter” with varying degrees of success. I’ve been experimenting with certain aspects of my life like feminine-ish outfits, different mannerisms, shaving EVERYWHERE, etc. Little stuff but still noticeable to those who were already familiar with my prior lifestyle behavior. Some people approved some didn’t. I’ve found myself being extremely jealous of pretty girls. The same holds true for cute femboys you see on Twitter and Reddit. 

About a year ago, I started posting lewd photos of myself on other subreddits for others to see and comment on. Why have I been doing that? I suppose it was some vain attempt at boosting my confidence and/or ego. Or perhaps it was a deep seeded desire for positive attention pertaining to this aspect of my life as I’m not receiving it from my peers. Regardless, whether or not it was a good idea is a different discussion. I keep switching between liking the attention and getting super embarrassed by it. It’s a vicious cycle. I’ll delete my posts, then reupload them, only to delete them again after that, and so on, so forth. At the time of writing this I definitely have some naked pics on my profile but I might take them off later. Who knows? The thing is that I still enjoy people commenting, complimenting me, and calling me cute. So what’s the harm?

I did a little reading around on other people’s experiences and I found a list of similarities between their stories and my own. So much so that I feel as though I’m at the point where I may just be going through those very same stages of confusion and acceptance as them. 

It’s all a big mess. This question has been tugging my mind back and forth forever. On one hand being a cuter more fem me sounds great and I love the idea of that. On the other hand I don’t necessarily hate myself. I’m occasionally disgusted with my own body but isn’t everybody from time to time? What am I supposed to think? All I know for sure is that if I had the magic power to choose how I looked and sounded, it would be that of a cute anime girl. Now I’m just trying to figure out if that’s out of aesthetic desire or if it’s because I was born in the wrong body.",15Jul2020,0
434,"Just to explain the situation a little it’s a small apartment building. Only four apartments in the building. My husband and I live upstairs and there’s a couple that lives below us. 

Also a little backstory. Right after they moved in they started playing music really loud. Like my walls and floor were rattling at 2 am during the week. After like the 5th day in a row we sent an email to the rental company and they got a letter in the mail about the music. I felt really bad because I’m not trying to cause any trouble for anyone but that’s just ridiculous. I’m pretty sure they know it’s us because one afternoon one of the ladies was literally yelling in the hallway at us. I’m very non confrontational and I don’t like causing problems for anyone so it’s just awkward. The other lady is polite. 

So a different issue. They like to smoke weed, which I don’t care about at all. Do what you want in your own home. I have no issue with weed. But some nights the smell is literally overwhelming my apartment. And it doesn’t go away easily. So I need advice on how to address it. I swear I’m not trying to be a jerk. I just don’t want my apartment to smell like weed. I was thinking maybe I could put a note on their door with my phone number and ask them to text me. Neither my husband or I really ever see them and we also want to be discreet since weed is still illegal in my state. I’m not trying to get them in trouble. Does anyone have any better suggestions?",15Jul2020,1
436,"There’s one thing in my looks which I’ve always hated and I think it makes me ugly, when in reality it probably just makes me v average. But I’m so hung up on it that in a lot of ways it actually ruins my life (at least I think; but perhaps my problems really do just stem from me?! (as in maybe I’m just naturally shy and fixing my looks won’t make that go away? IDK). I feel not being good looking holds me back from achieving almost everything I want in life; that it makes me socially a bit shy, makes me think no one would want to date me unless I keep it hidden – which in turn means I’m *never* fully relaxed with someone I’m dating (I’m able to kind of hide it by always making sure people only see me at particular angles), or with social interaction in general tbh, makes me think no one will want to hire me as much as a good looking person, makes me feel really average in life in general, makes me think this is the whole reason I’m shy and self-conscious and so why I can struggle to make friends and prevents me being myself and totally natural in social interactions like some people are. I’d love to be confident and care free; I feel I could achieve so much more. I can’t work out if it is because of this issue with my looks, or if in fact I’m just a shy person and fixing this won’t change that afterall.
 
Anyway, I’m having a cosmetic procedure next week which may slightly improve it, and after about 2 months I can have another ‘dose’ of treatment and potentially look better (here’s hoping, but seems a bit too good to be true).
 
I *hate* being so hung up on physical attractiveness but I feel like being attractive is the key to happiness and that attractive people can be carefree and confident and get almost everything they want in life; and *this* is why my life is a failure in many ways and why I’m kind of socially awkward and shy.
 
What do you think? Does anyone else feel this way? Do you think my looks really are my whole issue?",15Jul2020,1
437,"Hey guys! This is my first ever Reddit post so sorry if I ramble! 

Basically my question is - would you move country and disrupt your whole life to be with someone you love? 

Background: I’m a 19 year old from WA and accidentally fell in love with an exchange student from my university. We were together for about 4 months before he had to go home (back to the US) half way through last month. We spent every waking moment together while he was here, and every since he went home I’ve felt like a part of me was missing. I have never experienced a love and connection like it, we would spend all our time laughing and would quite literally finish each other’s sentences. Obviously I couldn’t fly home with him when he left because of Coronavirus and just found out I wouldn’t be able to go exchange to his Uni until 2nd semester next year. We agreed that we don’t want to do long distance for more than a year, so the only option we have is me deferring Uni for a Sem and living with him. I am 100% in support of the idea but my friends are not. So I’m just wondering - is this too far to go for love? Has anyone done anything similar and what were your experiences? 

Thank you in advance!",15Jul2020,1
438,"I am a 20 year old female who is looking to potentially move to America. The thing is whenever America is mentioned I automatically think negatively of it. Since I am a Korean I've always heard of stories growing up (America misusing land in Korea, US soldiers raping girl etc). And now since I watch and read about the news all I get is negative information on the US. 

I really try to be open minded in every aspect of life and this negativity is bothering me. I want to come to terms with a country that has always been portrayed as a ""bad country"" in my head. So I did a lot of research as well on the laws, history etc but even then the info I read just made it worse, as in I just don't understand the country is run. For example, why on earth are people complaining about people being shot but guns are still legal? Why isn't tax added to the price of things? 

I really suck at explaining myself but I hope you understand what I mean by it. I don't mean to cause any harm or upset anyone as I am asking for advice to change my thoughts and beliefs of the country.",15Jul2020,1
439,"Okay, so I finally decided to go see a therapist to deal with my worsening anxiety and apathy. I've never done this before. 

I live in a country where solving personal/family issues with a therapist is not a thing, unlike in the U.S. I guess. (the small amount of psychotherapists we have mainly work with alcoholics, gamblers, and drug addicts). 

I'm now looking at ads of therapists in my town who do specialize in anxiety disorders, and their sessions are quite expensive to me. And they write on their ads that you probably need around 10 sessions to achieve some results.

Look, I'm cheap, I know that. I've been cheap all my life. And paying for a therapy is going to add to my already worsening anxiety. 

So my question is: if/when I finally go to the therapy, should I bring it up, when I list things that are causing my anxiety? 

Does this paying thing bother any of you? Is it appropriate to discuss with the therapist? 

P.S. I do not expect to get some kind of discount after I bring it up. And I understand that they have their own expenses and have to earn some money for a living too, of course. But the fact is that it's still expensive to me.",15Jul2020,1

442,"**Sorry for bad English, TL;DR at the bottom.**

Due to COVID-19, I couldn't get a job anywhere so I started freelancing. I've done a few design projects already and showed my portfolio to the new client. He liked my work and hired me. We decided 50% pay before work and 50% after work.

When he told me the details of the project (multiple designs), I gave him an estimate of 7 days. While working it took longer than I expected and the work was done in 10 days, instead of 7. He reviewed it and told me some major and minor changes. I started working on them which took another 2 days. I showed him and he gave me more changes. I did them again and a few times more and in some changes, I changed the entire design too.

All changes take more than a day but he always messages me daily asking for changes. I even told him that it can take time and I am more than happy to make as many changes as he wants. I don't even charge him extra for changes.

It's still going on and I have no idea what to do. He doesn't like anything I create and gives me more changes every time. I asked him for the remaining payment, not extra, but the remaining 50% because the work is done and only changes are left. He told me that he won't give me the remaining money yet because I'm unreliable.

I have no idea why he thinks that I'm unreliable. I make as many changes as he wants. I get that the project is taking longer than the expected time but is that enough to be unreliable? I'm new to freelancing and offer changes until the client is satisfied. Previously, a few clients asked for changes and they were done with it. One of them didn't liked my work and that was it. But it's not the case here. This is going on for over 2 weeks now. I don't know what to do.

Should I wait until all changes are done and then ask for the remaining money? What would you do?

TL;DR: Someone hired me. Gave me 50% of the amount decided. I started working. He's asking for changes again and again. I don't charge for changes. I asked for the remaining 50% because only changes are left. He said I'm unreliable and won't give me the remaining 50% until the work is completely done.",15Jul2020,1

So ever since I was a child (now 28M) I have been physically attracted to women with big bellies both BBW but mostly Pregnant women..

Something I have been ashamed for my whole life but am slowly coming around to accepting this as my life as its something that hadn't disapated as the years have gone on.

So, i have been with my partner of now 10 years and as of about 6 months ago revealed this to her, she was accepting appreciating my unique attraction and wasn't negative at all.

She does not share this fetish whatsoever but is open to it in a sense that she sometimes during sex and/or foreplay will push her belly out and tell me to touch it.

Do any other women out there share this attraction? Or some men who have this attraction and have told their significant other? Looking for advice on the attraction as well as some other aspects that we can use to encoroprate it into our lives?

I must prefus that she is open and no way I would force anything upon her that she wasn't comfortable doing.

Depression hit hard after my first relationship ended (29 male), and despite seeking help from multiple counsellors/therapists, I was unable to pull myself out and ended up fired from my job for bad reasons. Apathy had taken over and I struggled to do small tasks (for example, filling out timesheets consistently).

I managed to go on Employment Insurance, but my time on that is down to 6 months remaining and I have no idea what im going to do at the end.

I've always worked in the same field doing consumer computer repairs, but in the small town I live in there aren't really any relevant places hiring. Reluctantly I managed to get hired by a big box store, but lost that job after 2 days because of Coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus im currently stuck with the following issues:

\-Unemployed with no job prospects

\-$4k in debt leftover from relationship

\-Struggling to save any money, delivery food being a huge problem as im now finding it a huge struggle to leave my apartment for any reason, especially as Coronavirus was/is going on and depression still hitting hard

&amp;#x200B;

Employment insurance covers the bills, but i am still essentially living paycheck to paycheck and end up in overdraft quite often.

I feel like if a company can not give you an answer on your job security it's a red flag. If I am at risk of losing my job for any reason at any moment, i feel like that should be made apparent. If I am not at risk and am a vital part of the department I work in, it should be communicated just that.

449,"I got over my first and only crush a few months ago. I’m glad for this. I worry, though, that I’m likely to become infatuated with someone new any day now; being “free” is just unfamiliar territory, and being a clingy person, I’d rather stay out of that area for a while. I’m not ready for romantic relationships, so I don’t want to want one yet, if that makes sense. For personal focus, and for other reasons I don’t know how to explain.
On top of this, I worry that if I start crushing again, I may end up liking a close friend, and I don’t want something like that to get in the way of the wonderful platonic feelings we already have. 
I do believe that if something happens, it’ll happen, and that maybe it’s meant to be that way, but if I can help it, how can I swat down any feelings that may begin approaching? I don’t think I’m starting to crush yet, but I want to be prepared if my mind wanders too far in the direction.

Couple things:
1. I would prefer to not distance myself from people completely, but I’m willing to if I find it comes to that
2. I’m not worried about a particular person, rather that I could start liking anyone at any moment
3. Looking for prevention, not a cure.
4. General advice is optimal, but I’m 18F if that helps.
5. Most of the friends I’m most worried about are online friends, the distance being further reason to avoid relationships. (We’ve all spent a lot more time “together” throughout the quarantines, and I think it’s getting to my head a bit.)
6. Separating from a “preferred gender” (like just avoiding dudes) won’t do much for me, as I am bi and hang out with people of multiple genders frequently.

I’ve just been ridiculously paranoid for several weeks, so anything is helpful, even if it just gets me to stop worrying about it so much. Your advice and experiences would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

She snuck out at 2 AM tonight and was caught by police at a park with a boy. They brought her home and we argued about consequences and rules but she wasn’t receptive to any of it and didn’t even consider what she did was wrong, calling the cops “pigs” and saying all she did was try to be happy because she felt like she was gonna explode and needed to leave just to “draw the stars.” She’s got it in her head apparently that none of us care about her and hate her and basically want to use her like a punching bag. I guess this so far is a bad case of teenage angst. At first I thought we’d just call it a night and talk in the morning.

But this is what is keeping up me up all night when I have class tomorrow:

She’s hurt herself physically in the past, threatened suicide, grabbed sharp objects, and more. As soon as we started talking to her tonight she started screaming and ran in the kitchen and grabbed a knife. We yanked it away from her and had our argument where she repeatedly threatened to kill herself if my mom finds out or she has to move in with my dad. My mom has a Ring doorbell so she will most likely find out even though I’m not currently inclined to tell her (she’s on antidepressants I believe and tends to make problems much worse.)

So what should I do? I’m now sitting outside her room with an open door worried that if I go back to bed she’ll harm herself or leave again. The police here have a rule that once a person threatens suicide they automatically get dragged to a psych facility for a 72 hour intervention. I can’t help but think this may be my only option.

-He's a super playful person and has playfully asked me to cuddle with him, but only me as far as i know.
-he's just got that feel when ever we're together. Like you can feel the connection.
- at one party he hinted at how he likes white boys while in a group convo
Reasons I think he doesn't:
-chance he may still be hooked on his ex/they got back together but u don't think they did.
- we don't hang or talk alot as much now in quarantine, but before we would always hang out at church. Hes always at my parties and me his.

I have asked my best friends for advice as well. I always gain up the confidence at night, hes awake as well usually but I just never do. I want to so bad but i just don't. I always usually gain the confidence boost after watching either proposal videos, those crush tiktok compilations on YouTube, or just being left alone with my thoughts at night. I always fall asleep to the thought of him/imagining him in bed with me. I can't get over how fucking cute he is. Oh God is he hot.

468,"I'm having an existential crisis. I'm somehow having some scary thoughts about how our world is going to end. It's been 13 billion years since all that has existed began. And human history has been around for 100 thousand years plus. Then all of a sudden, it's a million years since humanity has been around. It scares me that many many generations from now, we have consumed all of that time, and for what, the enjoyment of life? It scares me even more that I won't be around to see it come to an end. We could be wiped out by a pandemic, or continental drift, or a disaster, or wait until the sun drains out of its energy.

These are my thoughts going through my head right now, and I don't know what to do to get my mind off of it. I feel like I'm doing all of my time in life, only for it to not matter because life will end one day.

And this just came out of nowhere. I typically have a happy life with a great family, a great hobby in video games, a plethora of life experiences, I'm satisfied.

I think it has something to do with me coming back to Coldplay songs, but I'm not blaming that.",15Jul2020,1
469,"Hello! 

I am an international student with an MA degree in arts (and a BA from my home country). I am certain I want to do a PhD but I feel quite unprepared for it and have decided to take some time off for learning more. This means that presently I have no idea what to do. I am 22 and have no experience outside of school and university, I am doing some volunteer work rn but its a six months thing. I would very much like to find a job but *I have no idea where to begin or what things I would be good at. I know very little outside of my subject area, and I do love research, but it's always been related to my subject so.*

(Extra info: As much as I understand, how difficult it is to get a job right now, I would v much like to stay here (I wouldn't mind moving cities). Mostly because being here I can be still be connected to my subject's scene because back home, it's absent (we've our own stuff so there's no need for it), also back home is very triggering for me but this year has been the most healthy I have been and I believe I can do better (considering I know what to do) so long I stay away from home and my parents have already told me that if I come back they would not support me\* and lastly, because of financial reasons. 

\*I don't exactly have a good relationship with my parents and I understand how that sounds considering, they sent me to a different country to study something that I love, and I am very, very grateful for that but also knowing them, I wouldn't survive a month if I go back without a job offer.)

I apologize for how helpless and stupid this sounds and I thought I had a plan, the PhD was the plan but I just. I feel so unprepared for it (I am writing my MA diss. right now and I am glad I have decided to give it a lil time before the PhD because this is...hard). Anyway, I am wondering if anyone has any advice or ideas about job hunting. How do I figure out what I should do or what I can do?

I've played soccer all my life, have practiced a lot and found it fun, but it doesn't include a ton of teamwork. The ace of the team gets all the attention. Volleyball, on the other hand, requires an insane amount of teamwork to score even one point. It's not a sport where only one person gets the attention. I *really* want to have teammates who will be awesome friends and who will support me in games, but I don't know which sport will get me the level of teamwork that I want.

474,"My dad seriously drives me nuts. I can't stand him anymore. He is super embarrassing, and he doesn't even apologize or feel guilty for embarrassing me. He always mispronounces my friends' names. And they're not even anything hipster or exotic, just classical English names. Yet my dad (who learned English when he came to America) constantly mispronounces their names. I don't know if it's on purpose or if he really has a speech problem, but it's really obnoxious. My friends are pretty pissed about it, and I'm really embarrassed about this.

Also, my dad dresses weird. He walks around the house shirtless, wearing just his boxer shorts. I know it's scorching hot where we live, but can he at least put on a T-shirt? Can he at least drink some ice water? I've suggested these things to my dad because I'm tired of him walking around shirtless, but he doesn't seem to care. He even goes shirtless when he goes out to get the mail, and I'm pretty sure the neighbors want to shoot him because of this.

My dad is 55, but acts like he's 15. He always uses slang that only teens are allowed to use, and he thinks he's being cool but his behavior is approximately that of a creep when he does that. He says stuff like ""lit"", ""bruh"", and even VSCO girl talk. He uses slang all the time in public, and people just give him weird looks. I don't even use slang; nor do my siblings. I'm not sure why he feels the urge to use slang and why he can't talk in proper English.

He sings really weird songs at all. He sings Old McDonald all the time. That's why I get scared every time we pass by a farm or a McDonald's because I know that's going to trigger my dad. When he's driving, he sings really loud, as if he's Lady Gaga or Stevie Wonder. I swear he'll be arrested one day for disturbing the peace.

My dad also sweats uncontrollably. This is partially because he's overweight. The ironic thing is that he is always shirtless, but still sweats more than everyone else in the house. The sweat drips everywhere; it's really disgusting when he sweats on the table or something. He doesn't bother to clean it up, because ""it will evaporate"". Yeah, it will, but then the table will stink like rotten eggs for the next 50 years!",15Jul2020,0
475,"Secretary to an attorney who is a Partner and basically runs our company. No advice on reporting him.

Had a bullying situation where i was being called autistic, bipolar, a bitch with a shit personality who just has to have a mental illness. The aggressor admitted to HR that i had done nothing. She was just angry that i don’t chat with her more. The whole thing was super humiliating and done in a way to isolate me from others

I told my boss, who shrugged it off and tried to dodge me. went to HR several times, who did nothing.

Finally texted my boss irritated complaining this can’t continue.

He took the texts and showed them around to everyone like what a loony? She’s crazy!!
Is she having a mental breakdown?!

Anytime i express anger or frustration to him, howsoever rightful he talks out the side of his mouth- in his office with others or the office of the person next to me- and i can hear it, like i have emotional problems/ a mood disorder and need to be watched and carefully managed. He even privately talked it around to Big HR who when i called, had the nerve to suggest private therapy sessions instead of a real plan of action. 

He framed it like my secretary is going hysterical. See if you can help manage her/ get her under control. Instead of focusing on the primary problem. This isn’t the first time I’ve complained to him about valid real problems only for him to have a convo with Big HR kind of going on record with how mentally unstable i am.

Yet he can rage and express inappropriate anger all the time over small things. Called me 6-7 times in a row yelling and raging so fucking hard over me booking him an economy ticket for travel when he didn’t specify class. But his anger is never unbalanced or “mentally unstable”.


These attorneys are so ego driven any disrespect to them is slammed into the ground onsite. And i’m talking vague microaggressions. But i’m crazy if i don’t want to be called a bitch and a retard daily for months on end?

He’s tried to call me a loony on other issues too. When my past history at the firm came up and a false narrative was being pushed and i corrected it with the truth, which wasn’t all roses. I was slammed as a loony, yelled at and dressed down as negative and threatened to be thrown out.

Nothing i said was untrue and he later admitted that. And none of it related to/ put him in a bad light. But it’s like as his assistant i must just smile and be happy 24/7

I’m expressing anger on things that are genuinely wrong and that they would *never* accept for themselves, but the focus always becomes “she needs mental help. I suspect a mood disorder”. Whereas their anger is them being real men/leaders and handling things.

What is your take on his behavior? He otherwise treats me well/generously. IDK what to make of it.

tl;dr- Rightfully complained to boss about a bad bullying situation that I was ignored on. He went to big HR and whispered about me with others on the team like i was hysterical or a loony, with unstable mental state who needs to be monitored and watched. No advice on reporting him. He’s top of the food chain as an equity owner. What do you all make of this behavior?",15Jul2020,3

But once I hit 12 years old, she got into drugs. She threw her life away and lost her job. She started becoming paranoid about everything. She would accuse me of abusing my little sister, who I love dearly. 
My mother was abused and raped by her father as a kid, so I understand why she has so many worries. She would say I was poking holes in her clothes, putting stuff in her face wash to create acne, and would say I worked with the police to try to get her to lose her kids.

She never took my sister to the hospital to prove she was never sexually or physically abused. She would never listen to my side of the story, and would always talk to her drug addict friends about how much of a monster I was. And they would all agree with her because they wanted to have sex with her, and get drugs from her. This made her continue to blame me of more things that I never did. There are so many things she said I don’t have the time to type them out. I always had a really strong mindset, and even as a kid I used to talk to myself, almost have conversations with myself.

480,"Throwaway because yeah.

So, I am a teenager, 18 to be exact and I suppose you could say I can be considered a bit of a socialite in my College. So because of this, a friend of a friend told me about this top secret ""club"" that he sometimes goes too if he wants to bang anonymous chicks, I was down to do this so I asked him to hit me up with an invite. 

The first night that I went was incredible, about 15 men and women of varying ages, You sort of just waltz up to a girl (or guy, whatever way you swing) and just...get it on. Sometimes their partners will want to join and that is okay I guess. However this ""club"" liked to put on themes once a month, the night in question was ""Masquerade"". You must come with a face mask of sorts, something that cannot make you identifyable, to add to the ""mysticism"" I think. 

So, I buy a mask, head over that night and the venue had been transformed for this theme, it was dark, there were stobe lights of all colors of the rainbow, there was a room dedicated to BDSM..? It was crazy, anyway across the room I spot a stunner, at least what I could make out through the strobe lights and smoke machine fog. She was currently being...uhm, ""seen too"" by some other dude so once that was over I walked over and effectively gestured to give it a go. She complied and we had a wild time, I did my thing and left to find another girl.

A few days had past since then and I was getting out of the shower and as I crossed the landing my 20yr old sister came out of her room. She looked at me, my body, then her eyes widened and she returned to her room with a slam. I thought it was a weird moment but I figured she was just embarraased for catching her younger bro getting out the shower, and thought nothing of it. 

Later on, I heard her on the phone to a friend mentioning this ""guy"" she met at a ""party"" (Apparantly the same night I was out) who she had sex with who looked a lot like...me.

Now that I think back, and this is really horrific to say, her moans sounded a lot like my sister when she sighs or makes a grunt just normally at home but I was intoxicated and not thinking about my sis at the time.

Should I confront it or leave it? I am afraid that we might've attended the same ""party"" and ended up with each other through random chance.

I if do mention it and it turns out to be true, then I don't think I could ever look myself in the mirror again, if it ISN'T true then the relationship between me and my sis with be super awkward. 

If I leave it it will eat at me with a ""what if"". What should I do?",15Jul2020,0

I am having difficulty breathing and it's due to the air. Sometimes it smells like a strong sewerage smell, sometimes it's chimney smoke and right now it's a strong chlorine type smell mixed with burning smell that makes me sick to my stomach.

I can't walk outside for air because it's not breathable, and inside is just as bad.

Also, some days, there's a high frequency noise coming from outside and other days it's a low frequency rumble that is there all night.

At times, I get a feeling of doom from all these things combined. Especially when I'm about to fall asleep sometimes I get spasms.

There was a period where my heart was hurting for a long time, and my left arm felt numb or just weird, but I tried to go somewhere with clean air, which is near impossible right now.

My body can't take it anymore.

I also have tinnitus.

What do I do?

I usually resort to sleeping away from home and I don't get any of these feelings or problems.

488,"Hey everyone,
My brother does nothing all day everyday,
I’ve always downplayed it on depression because he always stayed in his room when he lived with my parents and just never really wanted to talk or enjoyed conversation with any of us.
I’m 27 and decided to rent out a bigger house so he could come live with me to see if it could help him grow as a person and find hobbies just because my mom never pushed him and my dad would push him too much that it seemed to upset him. 
I’ve suggest so many fun things we could do together to try spark something in him but nothing ever really works. He just says “yeah sounds good” but really doesn’t want to be there. 
Any time I try to push him to try fix his sleeping pattern or even attempt to clean anything in the house he just gets mad with me and goes from being nice to really snappy. 
He’s lived here for almost a year and has never cleaned once..
I don’t want to be a nagging sister but at this point I feel like a 22 year old should have these qualities to want to try help themselves out.
Last time I mentioned he hadn’t cleaned anything and he got really mad and yelled about how he has a right to live here and do what he wants.

He’s been lying to me about trying to find work because my partner is also looking for work thanks to covid and mentioned the jobs my brother said he had applied for didn’t exist. 
He stays home all day and only goes out to get groceries and it’s literally destroying our power bill currently during winter having someone home all day. He does pay rent but not a lot as he is on a benefit so I can’t increase it either. 
I study and work and I have really bad insomnia so I get to sleep around 11pm but I’m being woken up on a daily basis because he’s yelling into his headset over a game even though he knows I have to get up at 6am. 
I understand having fun but I just really want a good nights sleep if I’m honest without having to feel like a bad person for telling him to be quiet constantly.
I’ve spoken to him nicely about all of these things so many times I’ve lost count and I don’t really know how to ask anymore..

It’s exhausting because I want to help him so much but it’s eating away at my happiness. 
I know what it’s like being depressed and stuck in life but I’ve always wanted to try fight my way out of it at least.
I left home at 17 and learned how to pay bills, fill out forms, apply for jobs etc.

I’ve offered to help him with his CV and job applications and he just says “that will be good” but never follows through.
I’ve also offered to help him sort out study he said he was interested in and the same situation happens.
Is there anything I can do to get him in a better headspace? 
Or anything I can do to spark some interest in something? 
I feel so helpless watching him just waste away his life..",15Jul2020,1
489," 

I ended my junior year of high school. 6-7 months ago, some asshole embarrassed me through an embarrassing photo. I confronted him about it, and we had a talk and he apologized after realizing that what he did pissed me off. He said that all he saw was nothing but a funny pic, and never intended to hurt me and cause me problems.

Some other kid put up some stupid video on his youtube channel making fun of me, and I did the same thing, where I basically confronted him about it and forced him to delete it. Unlike the photo situation tho, he never saw anything wrong with what he did, and kept insisting that the video was making fun of someone else. I'm not stupid, because the lyrics sounded like they were ridiculing me. And so I basically forced him to take it down.

I can name other situations in my past where someone has done me wrong, whether they meant to or not. Despite standing up for myself and being confrontational about these things, I still feel like a victim.

Part of this is because there was this book I like called American Kingpin, which was basically about a guy named Ross Ulbricht who made the Silk Road. I admire him, and look up to him. However, it was never said in his biography about someone else being mean to him, or him being victimized in some sort of way. Any problem he ever had was because of his own actions, not others. But in my case, I've had situations where others were mean to me.

So I guess my question is, how can I stop caring about shit like this? I always feel that some people do have situations like mine, and others are lucky enough to live for years without ever being victimized. I was victimized, but I feel that a lot of other people, like Ross Ulbricht, are lucky enough to never have anyone in their school years or elsewhere ever be mean to them.

Is that thinking true? Is it true that some people are lucky enough to live out their whole lives without ever getting victimized by someone else? Or does everyone encounter situations like these?

I think ever since my mind has kind of gotten foggy (I had this problem before hand). As for feeling weak I have not gone thorough it. I know it takes time for a defenincy to accumulate over time. The reason I cut off dairy was to get rid of my acne which was causing my skin to break out and noticed that it made a difference. I cut off red meat because of the cancer links and I did not really like it to begin with (hot dogs smack though). Anyways last night I was watching a couple videos of vegans and they talked about how they have got sunken eyes or something which spooked me out. I am scared of adding eggs and red meat back into my diet as I heard there is link to breast cancer. Such I take b12 or take the risk? I am scared of b12 possibly having bad chemicals and cancer causing. I heard people with b12 get neurgical problems which tbh I did not give two fucks about. But then I read about heart failure if left untreated and now I’m scared as FUCK. Is it too late to fix this ? Advice please😭😭😭😭,15Jul2020,0

Then Monday, theres pieces of wood right on the other side of my door from my dad tearing up the carpet to put tiles down, and right when I was about to dose off Monday, I got started by the sound of wood getting like rubbed together.

500,"Sorry long post, felt the need to include background. 
Tl;dr at bottom..

Growing up I was the smallest and thinnest of the children, my mother was very thin, and I think that is why I became her favorite child. I have always taken great pride in being ""small"" which, with massive stress, in my early 20s, led me to essentially starving myself (counselor said I did not qualify for diagnosis because my weight was not extreme enough). That switched over a few years later to binging, then binging and purging. I got to what I considered a ""good weight"" through that method and stopped the bad behaviors and maintained that weight. In 2 years since beginning a relationship I have gained 10 to 15 lbs depending on the day and I am disgusted when looking in the mirror. My boyfriend find me ""honestly even better looking"" now, and freud brain likes to point out his mother is obese. Anyways, I am not counting calories- feeling excessive pride when I am under 500 before final meal of the day. I dont track dinner or evening snacks as I cook and know too much tracking would be bad for me. I like tennis but I have no one to play with- bf is kinda lazy unless I harrass him. So I get no support from bf, my siblings don't support me- ignoring when I mention it looking for support as does all of my family. I feel like I could do it in a healthier way if someone supported me but I can't get that from the few people I interact with.

Tl;dr trying to lose weight, no one supports me as more are all bigger which is leading me back into unhealthy eating habits. Don't know where to find healthy supports, any ideas?",15Jul2020,2

TW for abuse, very long but there’s a lot of context. (English isn’t my first language so excuse any mistakes) originally a AITA post but they don’t like any post about violence so I’m here :) 

TLDR:
My brother is abusive to my mother and I and i want to tell my mom that i won’t speak to her if she doesn’t do something about him.

 So I, (21f), have always had a very rocky relationship with my family, especially my brother (28 year old). We are all immigrants migrating from the Middle East to the US. We came here when i was younger so my brother and I are ~assimilated~ and we went to high school in America. 

 Now my father wasn’t in the picture, and my mom had a hard time making ends meet and struggled quite a bit. My brother has only furthered and exasperated her struggle since day 1. He was physically and emotionally abusive to me since I was a kid, but in middle eastern culture it’s just “a man thing”. To this day my mother won’t acknowledge it as abuse, and says he was doing what siblings do. For context when i was 7 he had a BB gun and would shoot my at point blank range to “make me tougher”, he would make me sit in a chair and literally throw a giant basketball at my face and would yell at me if i cried, and was just generally an asshole lmao. He would hit me constantly and I’m seven years younger than him so it wasn’t really a fair fight, I’m also SUPER non-confrontational, so if he got mad at me I’d never hold my own and my mom never backed me up. When i was in my emo stage at 13 i had problems with coping mechanisms. He saw my scars and went psycho. He held a knife to my throat and literally hit me for that. My mom denies that happened but she was WATCHING. I have a million stories. He hit me so bad it bruised my arm and my teacher saw and i said it was a bug bite. My teacher obviously called my mom and said take your sick kid and her weird ass bug bite to the hospital, and when i told my mom it was actually from my brother she literally laughed. I know she’s a product of her environment, since my uncle is an exact copy of my brother and was just as abusive. 

 This behavior hasn’t changed. To me, it’s obviously cause my mom never held him accountable for ANYTHING and he knows if he gets mad he gets what he wants. Right when i turned 18 i moved out and all the way to a different state, for very obvious reasons. My mom has still never forgiven me for moving and constantly holds it over my head and begs me to move back, when i visit every 2 months or so. I go to college and work and have paid for my own everything since i moved out and it’s generally hard for me to make the trip but she doesn’t really appreciate the effort. 

The abuse didn’t stop when i was 13 or when i moved out. He had a “mental break” and i put quotes for reasons I’ll clarify. He went crazier than normal. He was “having delusions” and hearing people. At one point he locked him and my little sister in the bathroom with a kitchen knife cause he “thought” people were in the house to “get him”. We called the cops and they wouldn’t take him and said he wasn’t a threat to anyone (thanks cops). This went on for MONTHS. This was when i was 18 and what triggered me to move out because my mom was doing everything for him and even got a fucking priest to come and exorcise him. She always says “he’s my boy” when confronted about anything and says a mom will do anything for her kid. Well it came to light that he admitted that he was faking and his OWN WORDS were that he wanted to give my mom a heart attack so she would die. Literally a quote. He has always lived at the house and is 28. He didn’t graduate high school and it took him 6 years to graduate university and he’s NEVER had a job. My mom pays for EVERYTHING of his and only in the last two months has she “kicked him out” aka, he’s living in her guest house. When i was 19 he’d text me 30 texts a day about how i should k— myself and it was good that i was cut**ng when i was young and that I’m a whore etc. he routinely calls my mom a prostitute and has done it infront of her friends. 

 Also, my grandparents and uncle ALSO enable his behavior by making excuses for him. They say he’s “crazy” mentally, but don’t acknowledge that he isn’t, they say it’s because of his drug use but they don’t ever fix it. The worse part is my sister is 7years younger than me and has seen him overdose and she literally saved his life, and he called her a snitch for calling the ambulance since it came to light he was doing heroin. She’s literally traumatized cause he was passed out and wouldn’t wake up until the ambulance injected him with enough whatever to wake him up. She was the only one home and was trying to shake his lifeless body for 1+ hour before help came. My sister also confided in me that he touches her butt  and areas that make her uncomfortable and he says “I’m your brother i can do that” and my mom knows. And does nothing. 

  It makes me furious but my mom is the type to when she is critiqued she takes it as a personal attack. Well fast forward to this visit, I’ve been here five days. On my very first day here my brother was yelling at both my mom and sister, calling them stupid, etc. well I’m the only one in the family who doesn’t take his shit and called him out. He said “do you have a problem with me? We can go outside?” So i said fuck yeah i do lets go. I tried to calmly confront him out his behavior and his general horribleness but he says “I’m playing the victim” and that he’s “a good brother”. Well he obviously was not listening and it got heated, to where i almost had to punch a bitch, but to not stress my mom i just told him to get the fuck out of the house (remember he has his own home :) my moms guest house). 

   My mom, sister, and i finally had a conversation about him and his unacceptable behavior. She said that she would change the locks and that she is just a mother and that’s her boy and whatever. Well she didn’t change the locks, but he hasn’t been welcomed home for the past five days. She said that she just wants him to get a job and move out on his own when “he’s ready” and that she’s gonna give him a “time limit” as to when he needs to have a job &amp;amp; house lined up to move out. Obviously that’s BS and my mom won’t keep her word. Today, she said she hasn’t seen her son in 5 days and misses him. I’m just livid. I love my mom and know that she might not know better as men in the Middle East are generally abusive (her father and brother were) but she’s also throwing her two daughters under the bus to save her son who does NOTHING. i told her that if my brother sets foot in the house while i am here i will leave, and she got mad at me for “threatening her”. My grandparents and uncle came over the day after the fight to beg me to forgive him and that “girls are just smarter than boys so forgive him since he’s obviously just a dumb boy”. Well i don’t stand for that. My mom is constantly saying how my sister and i are “special” for being girls because we are emotionally stronger and that we need to make allowances for men. It’s hurting my sister but i can’t even do anything about it. She also keeps telling me the hate i have in my heart isn’t normal &amp;amp; has said that I’m worse than my brother for moving out and making a few mistakes in my past (dating a toxic man they didn’t like). Her excuse is that while he lives in the guest house he “doesn’t bother us anymore” and just wants to wait till her gets a job and moves out. She thinks if she kicks him out he’ll be a druggie or die (which he already is a druggie?) 

I forgave my mother for a lot of stuff but she still has a grudge with me. I want a relationship with my mom and sister but i think i have to give my family (not my sister) some kind of consequence for never keeping their word or giving my brother any fucking punishments for his actions. 

I love my mom but WIBTA If i tell her if she doesn’t kick him out in three months i won’t talk to her again? 
  
  TLDR:
My brother is abusive to my mother and I and i want to tell my mom that i won’t speak to her if she doesn’t do something about him.

513,"cant believe how fucked and messed up i am,eventhough i act on the outside like a 7 years old immature teenager(Im 17)who still hasnt grown up and loves superheroes and want to be one.I cant believe how fucked i am on inside or how i have become,i cant make any choices anymore and i blindly whatever someome told me ever since i was a kid like if u told me to slap someone sarcastically i would have actually done that(and i have actually did that),i dont even think before making an opinion and believe whatever is told to me,like if someone told a movie is bad,eventhough i would love it from the inside,i would hate it,this render me incapable of making decisons,i dont know if it is because my parents literally did everything for me,so i am like that or something else.I cant even decide which college to go to,which subject to take or which job i want and i dont deal with situations by my mind but by how i saw them in movies(bad...right...never works).I also feel like people are judging my every avtion(literally)which could co tribut tovmy overthinking.
Aside from the porn addiction along with sexcomics,stories,dirtywordtrolls,has made me a pervert and peeping tom,i have tried to quit but couldnt and has rendered me incapable of talking to girls in a normal conversation,only seeing them as sexual objects of conquest,even led me to break of friendship with a very good girl who i really liked,i also flashed the maid like in porn which caused me to nearly kill myself(my parents dont know as i was too much of a coward anf bailed).
I have also became incredibly anti-social,introvert with zero social skills,zero friends,friends who hate me,even when i manage too talk i end up ranting and blabbing a lot which makes them get irritated along with my inability to act like a 17 year old teenager and grownup.
I have also been emotionless,not even crying in death scenes in movies,shows(kind of knew they would happen cos old series rewatch but still),i also went to a funeral of a cousin's grandmother and couldnt cry and kinda laughed at seeing her dead body face which shamed me and also i havemt told anyone but i once went to darknet to loook for illegal stuff and porn and went to a child porn site(i am not a paedophile,i fear of being one but i am not)and then immediately quit,it was so bad to see kids like that being sold like sex-slaves,it made me incredibly ashamed of myself amd i still feel ashamed,i also sometimes ashamed when i dont react to stuff like a celebrity dying,or shooting of someone on TV.
I also feel like i cried to get put of trouble as a kid and hence made me hate crying as for me it became manipulative and since i was grownup wuth good morales i couldnt do amything when made fun of and start hitting people and became very angry and whuch made me think like just hoow i was bullied throughout school i was myself a bully.
I have zero self confidence and esteem and hate what i have become and fant even fix myself as i think i have slight ocd as i get obsessive and addicted with games,tv and was obsessed with angel numbers and then rebooting when i did anything wrong like formatting phone,changing wallpaper,app order and switching between dark and light mode,i also am highly overthinker,who is impuslibe when talking to people but rest else cant stop thinking amd hence cant sleep at night properly.
O have no goals,motives,intersts and i am not good at anything,i only got 78% in 12th grade and is not gling to a good college but a community college because my parents have lots lf debt,The only thing i am good at is reading,i can read a 1000 page in 4 days(not full 24 hours but less) and i was good at drawing once not by mind or imagination but copying artwork,i was highly creative as a kid but i am not.
Ibalso feel sad for feeling sad as i do t think i deserve to be sad as oeople gave it worse than me.
I am going to be in college and 18 in 3 months and i dont want to be this Guy,i want to not be such a loser as they have no future but cant do anything as i lice with my parents and hence cant make any chamge that wouldnt make them think that something was wrong and i also dpnt know how to drive(even a bicycle),i feel lije i have no control of life which i hate,i have perfectionism,i just need HELP but i dont think i will get it here but i still wrote in HOPE that someone from reddit can pity me(which i hate as it makes me feel like a baby incapable of doing anything)or have sympathy for me and HELP me.I also am fat and ugly.

I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, in middle school I started self harming. She knew about it and when she got to middle school she started doing it too. I don't know why, she watched me suffer for years. In high school near the end, I basically gave up. I barely went to school, but I told her specifically that I wanted her to finish school. She started skipping constantly, and now she's finishing online just like me. And now, more recently: yesterday I had a big freak out. I was crying and I yelled at our dad and punched a wall. I won't say why but she talked to me and I calmed down. Now this morning she asked my dad if her (extremely toxic) boyfriend could come over, and he said no. She screamed and him and now she's sobbing as loudly as possible. She said the same exact sentence that I told her yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't help blaming myself for her becoming the brat she is today. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, every decision I make also effects my sister's life.

516,"For context, I used to go to daycare up until the age of 9 and I had a friend named.... Let's call her Shelly. Shelly and I were basically inseparable. We played Pokemon together. We hung out at the playground. We hung out in class and talked about silly video games and cartoons that we liked. We collected Pokemon cards and I would always be envious of her mom who would buy her packs of cards regularly. I also had a gigantic crush on her and everyone knew about it.

I stopped going to that daycare when I turned 9 and moved to a different city, and I haven't spoken with her since. Though, ever since then, I have wondered how she was. She was my childhood best friend up until that point. Currently I'm in a relationship with someone and am fine with that - this isn't about rekindling an old flame or anything. I'm just getting older, and this whole covid 19 stuff has me thinking about a lot of people in the past. Shelly was very special to me back then, and I think it'd be pretty neat to catch up, y'know?

I'm wondering if I should contact her out of the blue or not. My gut has told me to for years. Hell, even my own mom has wanted me to for years lol, but I've been hesitant. Now I have a very rational fear of it possibly being too late.

The other question is, would it be weird? She has no social media that I can find, but just by googling her name I found her work contact number (public info). Not exactly the most optimal thing to go off of, but that'd be my only lead aside doing some digging with her family members whose names I somehow remember. :\

Anyway, I'm torn. Has anyone around my age experienced this, or been on the other end (being contacted by an old friend)? Would it be too strange to do? Any perspective would be welcome. Thanks.

522,"Sorry if the title sounds a bit clickbaity but it’s a pretty accurate summary of my concerns! I have a friend, H, who I’m worried about.

She’s always had problems with impulse control - for instance, she’s in debt, her room is often messy, she has left tasks ignored until they’re overdue. That sort of thing. She went to a doctor because she figured she probably had ADHD. She was given meds for this (I’m not sure what type). I’m not one of those people who are against meds at all, but honestly I was concerned, and everything that’s happened since has proved me right.

She has been telling me how she’s so happy these meds eliminate her appetite so she can finally lose weight, and rants constantly about them not being “enough”. She seems to focus on how they put her in a slightly good mood or make her less likely to want to binge eat, without mentioning any of the actual effects they’re SUPPOSED to have. She’s casually mentioned not being able to sleep for 24 hours and feeling kind of numb, and how she takes maybe one more than prescribed if she’s feeling particularly tired. 

All of this is super alarming to me. I’m not very close with anyone else in her friend group but I’m sure they’re concerned too, I can’t really talk openly about it with them though. She gets super defensive about things some times and I worry she’ll just drop me if I say anything. I have anxiety and I’m risk averse so maybe I’m exaggerating this in my head but I don’t know what to do.

Going into high school I fell into a large friend group that I now love unconditionally who consistently shower me with compliments on my looks, personality and talents (I’m a straight A student and a talented-for-my-age artist). My best friend says I’m her ‘favourite subject to talk about’, another close friend said ‘I don’t know what’s with you, you just seem really nice’ and I’ve received videos of people talking about me and saying nothing but insanely nice things such as ‘I have the perfect symmetrical face’ and I would ‘make a great wife’ (which is kinda weird??) Anyway, obviously I’m extremely flattered but now I’m starting to think of myself really highly and I’ve noticed myself staring at myself in the mirror constantly for long periods of time and admiring myself in literally any reflective surface. I feel like I’m becoming really full of myself, especially in comparison to how I felt about myself just a few years ago.

It’s worth noting that I don’t voice my how I feel about myself around others and I definitely don’t put others down to bring myself up.

So how do I stop being so obsessed with myself and my looks?",15Jul2020,2
528,"Good morning so let me get started by saying I (19m) left my mother's back in 2017 for a stupid reason and broke my relationship with that family. Then I moved to Florida with my dad and everything was amazing and great until he was kicked out of the house he was renting and was forced to move 6 people into a one bedroom apartment. In which I didn't like because back then I was stuck up and wanted my own space, so I moved out of the state and moved into my friends house in Pennsylvania which is where I was from originally. I've been with them for 2 years now except the problem is I started dating my friends sister when I first moved in with him and it hasn't went well. Essentially although my friend's mom and family accepted me with open arms and I owe then the world for that. It is a toxic environment with screaming battles and unnecessary money spending. I do mean every paycheck I've had has gone to them for sometimes random shit that we don't need. I want to move back into my dads, who Will take me in with open arms but the issue is that I go to school and I don't want that to go to waste. I also don't want to leave my friends house and destroy my friends mental health (cause he already has depression), but I can't keep living in a toxic situation where I don't even want to go home most days.

531,"Okay, so I'm a 19 year old college student who is going to be entering their sophomore year this fall. A while ago, around the height of the Covid unemployment streak, I was really desperate to find a job so I applied to a bunch of different places. I actually ended up getting remote work for a call center job, and I've been doing it ever since June.

My dilemma is that I'm going back to school in the Fall, and this job only offers full time positions. Due to both schedules conflicting and my work schedule constantly changing, I don't think that I'll be able to do both. So I've decided to leave this job once school starts again. 

Now this wouldn't be so bad if I was able to actually work during the Summer, but the vast majority of what I've done and am going to be doing is just training. I've been making pretty good money from going to the online classes and participating every day. I just feel bad because I know that I'm not going to be able to stay.

 So I guess my question would be: ""since I really need the money and it's kind of difficult to find a job right now, should I continue going through paid training to squeeze out as much money as I possibly can before school starts? Or should I do the ethical thing and find a job that I can actually contribute something towards, at the risk of missing out on a lot of money that I could really use?

 Even though this is a massive corporation who probably wouldn't bat an eye at the amount of money that they would be losing to me, I still feel quite guilty about all this. I mean it's pretty clear that what I'm doing currently is entirely self-serving.",15Jul2020,2

I cannot shed the shame that is associated with being a virgin. It has taken over my soul and I feel like it is the only significant aspect of my identity. Not a day goes by when I'm tortured by this. I've tried so much to convince myself I can live like this- but no matter how much I read about how 20-year old virgins are normal- every time I think ""I am a 20-year old virgin"" shivers of disgust run down my spine. I cannot forget that male value is intrinsically tied to sex. I wish I could somehow condition my brain to not think that being a virgin is the most pathetic state of being in the world. Then if I could live my life without obsessing over sex 24-7 perhaps I wouldn't be an incel. I feel like these beliefs are deeply marked on my soul: for men life is all about sex, men need sex, men without sex are failures, and ergo I am a failure.

538,"Hello Everyone,

To give a bit of context, my company (aerospace sector) internally relocated me in April 2019 for a new position (lateral movement). Given that this offer was a lateral move, I wanted to ensure organizational development was both available and supported within this new group. The hiring director had informed me that while nothing could be formalized via writing at that time, if I performed well and impressed the team/customers, a promotional review would occur at 6 months. October 2019 was my 6-month post-hire month. No formal promotional review occurred – all while continuously being held to the same standard as my immediate peers who were two grade levels above me.

Naturally, I felt that I had fallen short of expectations. I called a meeting in November 2019 to discuss the areas I could focus on for improvement, given that I had assumed I did not do well enough in their eyes. In this conversation, I was coached to not change anything and that I was doing very well, exceeding expectations, and that they were very impressed with my work. I was informed that there were several promotional request within the organization currently on my group executives desk, my name included. Nothing manifested.

I called another meeting in February 2020 because nothing happened. My group director told me that my best interests were in his hands. In the conversation, he recommended to hold off on the promotion for now, wait until annual merit in April/May, and then put me up for promotion in June. Financially, this actually made sense because merit would be a 5% increase, promotion would then be a 10% increase on top of that.

Then the pandemic hit. Merit was eventually cancelled, salary pay was decreased 10%, and I am now being told that all promotions are on hold. 

On top of this, my workload has effectively increased 4x due to several folks leaving my immediate group. I have assumed leadership over a very important project, assumed the full job responsibilities for a former peer, and am still responsible for my legacy responsibilities. Never saying no, always saying yes to ""be that team player!""

I don't know how to navigate this - yes, the pandemic changes a lot but it doesn't change promises made to me. It doesn't change the fact that my workload has more that tripled yet my pay has decreased 10%. This pandemic doesn't get to erase past promises. 

I am finding myself with the feeling of being taken advantage of, and wanting to affect something positive. I also appreciate my job and don't want to find myself unemployed, with the simultaneous realization that no one in my sector is hiring right now. I also realize that I am walking a very fine line. 

How would you handle this? 

Thanks!",15Jul2020,1
539,"Sorry if the formatting is off I’m on mobile. I’m 21F and  one of my ex-friends has been appearing in my dreams off and on for the past 4 years.


Here’s a backstory we’ll call them friend A and B. I’ve known friend A since kindergarten and I met friend B in high school. In elementary to middle school I wouldn’t say I was the nicest person to friend A, I wanted to fit in with the popular crowd badly so i treated friend A poorly (this was also mostly because friend A was really rude but I didn’t know her attitude was because of what was going with her at home.) However, I can own up to my actions doesn’t matter how young I was at the time.

Then high school came along I completely learned my lesson and became a better trust worthy person however, friend A did a complete 180 she started becoming even more rude to me saying things like “oh we only invited you because we needed an even number nobody really cares if you’re here or not”, she would always put me down and make fun of me. She would always tell me to shut up. 

Anytime she had a secret to tell friend B she would tell me to leave the room. They would always hangout without me outside of school.

Although our friendship was a trio I felt like the odd person out when I was with the two of them. Friend B still included me in things at school but she would bully me as well from time to time telling me that I would look prettier with make up on etc

So one day friend A and B had a fight over a guy. Friend A expected me to cut ties with friend B because I known her longer. However, it wasn’t my fight so I continued to talk to friend B because friend B treated me better than friend A did which eventually made friend A cut us both off. 

So when my mom asked what was going on I told her. Little did I know my mom would tell friend As mom and of course she mixed up what I said. Friend A then confronted me in school the next day in front of everyone and screamed “this is why nobody tells you anything because you always spread it and tell other people you know our parents our friends so what makes you thing your mom wouldn’t say anything??” (she’s referring to how I was in elementary school. High school me knew how to keep secrets, I never spread any gossip in high school and I have the right to tell my mom if I’m involved in any drama)

Anyways I tried to apologize to friend A but she wasn’t having it, she blocked me on all social media and the only time she wanted to talk to me was when other people were around to cause a scene. 

Anyways because of me telling my mom friend A and B became friends again and cut me out. Friend B forgave me the next day for telling my mom but friend A didnt talk to me for the whole semester and then finally she came up to me and acted like nothing happened she didn’t apologize or anything because apparently I’m the one in the wrong.


Then all of sudden her and friend B had another fight that I wasn’t even aware of. And friend A cut me off again by association. I was going to reach out to her on social media but I don’t want her to make a YouTube video about me like she did about friend B calling her a fake friend (they were very close)

I graduated high school 4 years ago and friend A is still haunting me. My mom and her mom are still friends so my mom mentions friend A from time to time. I still have people from high school on social media so sometimes I will see friend A in their posts. 


I don’t know what to do any tips?

543,"So I (26M) have a friend (30sF, I'll call her *M* for now) who lives fairly nearby and I'm interested in her romantically. I have been for a while and I think there was a time when she was interested in me as well, but I kind of think that that's in the past...but I'm not sure.

I'm the kind of person who needs to talk to people to process my thoughts. I share perhaps more than people ordinarily would with my friend (a different friend, not *M*), because I find that if I say something that's on my mind and it sounds stupid, I hear myself and even without my friends response, see the situation from a more objective viewpoint.

I'm starting at uni in September, so I've always been  hesitant to pursue anything with *M* because I'll be moving to a different city for uni and it wouldn't be fair for me to do that when I know I won't be sticking around. Normally, I wouldn't think that way so much, but she has a kid (7) who I love and I'm worried that it wouldn't be very fair on him if I was around for a few months and then disappeared. 

I spoke to my friend about how I've felt like *M* has seemed a little uninterested in me recently. I'd say that *M* and I are good friends and speak to each other at least once a week for a catch up over the phone and more often than not, we'll meet up and hang out for a couple hours. The last couple weeks, although we have spoken on the phone and everything was awesome, over text, she's seemed more blunt and unresponsive than usual. I'm sure there are other things going on in her life that is making her come across like that, but my friend suggested that she could be coming off as uninterested because she actually is into me and in a strange sort of way wants me to make a move.

This thinking seems really backwards to me and I don't want to end up making a move and putting her off talking to and hanging out with me because she doesn't want to end up leading me on, but he seemed pretty adamant that I should at least try.

I'm kind of torn because while I don't want to get into anything with *M* for the reasons I already stated, I don't want to go off to uni and later realise that I missed my chance completely and we could actually have worked something out. I would like to see if anything could happen romantically but I don't want it to happen at the expense of our friendship.

So could it be that she is actually putting on an air of being uninterested because she actually is interested? Or could she just be busy and maybe actually even uninterested in me? Should I tell her how I feel before I go off to uni? 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Much love.

TL;DR My friend suggested that someone I'm interested in seeming uninterested in me could be because she's actually interested in me and wants me to make a move. Unsure what to do because I don't want to jeopardise our friendship.",15Jul2020,2

546,"My younger brother (16M) was having an awful time during the quarantine, since a lot of his friends were back home, so I (21M) invited him to a hang out with a really close friend (20F) of mine. We all got along swell, and hung out a bunch of times after. I started feeling a bit weird when they added each other on snapchat and talked nonstop, until my brother confessed he was in love with her. He had confessed to her, but she refused, saying our friendship was more important. I assumed that was an excuse, to reject him, but turns out I was very wrong. 

A month later, she asks to meet, and to talk. Of course she tells me it was true and felt the same way, but didn't want to do anything to jeopardize our friendship. I felt extremely uncomfortable with the whole thing, because she is a close friend of mine, I introduced them and it made me feel like the outsider, and because of the monster age difference. I was put on the spot and said it was ok, and I haven't heard from her since. We usually text quite a bit, but have received nothing from her. To be honest I'm relieved, since I dont think I could hang out, or see her again, as I'd feel too weird, knowing I am now her boyfriends brother, instead of her friend. Do I have a right to feel weird, and even angry at the situation? How do I deal with this, considering I feel anger towards both of them? I don't think I can see her anymore, and I my brother assumes everything is ok, even though I still harbor resentment for what happened. We live outside the US, and she's going back to college soon, which makes it even weirder.

547,"So the title kinda sums it up well. I'm 21 M I've lurked on here for like a year or two so I'm not used to how things work on here but heres my story. For some context my mom had me at 15, my father was a real piece of shit he would disappear on month long coke binges. But when I think back I guess my hatred/distrust towards all humans started when I was 6 one of my first memories was waking up late at night hearing my father and mom fighting. I got out of bed and tried not to wake my younger brother up I snuck out and watched what was happening. He actually got physical with her pushed her into the wall and such luckly we left that morning.

 A year goes by and my mom found my stepdad things got worse (to be clear he never did anything physical to me my older step brother wasn't so lucky). He was what I'd describe as an emotionally weak idiot very insecure and like I've just said incredibly stupid. We went through two bankruptcies with him he ran his own business I dont know his whole life story but I know his dad fucked him up. I remember he would shout at all of us for 5-8 hours long about the stupidest shit. One I find very amusing was me and my brothers had just got home from school he shows up as we are putting our stuff away, he shouts at us for about the usual amount of time because we hadn't crushed cans and picked up dog shit yet. But one that really made me contemplate hurting him was before and during a friend of the families wedding. My mom is one of the people I have nothing but respect for other than a little resentment of staying with him for so long. She was always kind of a loner tomboy type(loner because he had kept her away from everyone) at the time she had started going out and making friends so the wedding was really important for her she was so excited she spent like twoish hours getting ready. He was not okay with this obviously his insecure monkey brain thought she is only getting dolled up to flirt with other dudes. So he yelled at her the whole car ride (like a 3 hour drive) crushed her spirit everyone at the wedding could tell what had happened but did nothing. That's why I hate humans such emotional weakness these were ""family friends"" they could've done something.

 It only got worse and worse one time I remember vividly was we were all driving to Oklahoma the whole ride was just shouting like usual. At this point my youngest brother was born 3ish my mom had kinda snapped and threatened to leave him. I remember he yelled  irrationally ""if you take my kid from me I'm gonna run us all off the road and kill us"". By this point I was terrified of what he could do to my family the only people at this point I loved. I had considered taking a bat I had and beating him to death in his sleep,luckily my mom had called his bluff and we left about 5 months after him saying that. But the damage had already been done the way I saw people was forever changed. I have people i love and will protect with my life but its definitely a 95% percent are awful,selfish and evil and 5%good. What made me confront these feelings is I've always loved combat sports I do BJJ,kickboxing,muaythai and I wrestled in high school before I dropped out. It's not something I'd ever wanna pursue a career in but I've had 4 amateur fights. The last one really scared me I feel like I dont know how to describe it I blacked out I guess I feel like if the 6'5  big ref didnt pull me off I wouldn't have stopped. I never see an opponent I see all the horrible aspects of humanity in one shell. I probably will stop fighting.. sparring/training I'm completely fine but I think it's the adrenaline and emotions during an actual fight I cant handle.

 I'm too scared to talk to a therapist or a friend because I'm scared when they hear how I think I'll be sent to a mental ward or something.  I guess that distrust in people fucking things up again. I want to change like I've said in the title this has ruined my life. I lost so many friendships,relationships and opportunitys because of these issues. There was obviously way more things to contribute to my mentality but I've already wrote a book for yall lol. Even if no one sees this or no one cares I hope just letting it out will help me just a little bit. And on a final note just to be clear I dont think I'm any better than anyone else. I think I'm just as worthless and disgusting as the rest.",15Jul2020,1

549,"Hi, my first post here, also I am not a native English speaker so sorry for any mistakes.

I have a friend (m23) I've known for 17 years. His parents didn't seem to care about him, he was bullied and his girlfriend left him for someone else. He has depression and had one suicide attempt half a year ago, but we managed to save him and he unwillingly had to spend 2 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. He's feeling better after that, his triggers calmed down a bit but he still doesn't have the energy to do anything and thinks life is pointless. He was taking meds for a month after release but he gave up on them. He feels like there is no point in seeking help and thinks he doesn't even deserve it. I managed to convince him recently to see a psychologist with the hope that he would consider therapy but he didn't (I wasn't really surprised). I don't want to wait for another suicide attempt and I don't know what to do. Time at the hospital helped him a bit so I know there is a chance for him but I don't know how to convince him that there is hope.

His reasons for not seeking help include:

\- He says that he despises positive peoples that despite the hardships of life are happy and he doesn't want to be one of them

\- He says that he can't stand that he lost his gf to someone else. They broke up 4 years ago.

\- He watches a lot of public psychological sessions on the internet and thinks that he knows everything about his issues and there is nothing a psychologist could tell him that he doesn't know so there is no point going to therapy

\- He knows about cases about someone who after 15 years of therapy still had depression so there is no point

\- He says that even if he fixed his issues, he still would not be fulfilled so there is no point

\- He feels that he's behind people his age and he would never catch up so there is no point

So how to help him or encourage him to get help?",15Jul2020,2

I'm offered to change my workplace to a different city (almost 800 km away) for a few months. 
I've weighted pros and cons for a week now but my thinking is stuck and idk what I want. I'll be glad to hear from anyone with or without prior experience on the matter.

Pros

- I'll move in an apartment of my own (no parents) without rent

- more personal time

- Fresher air bc it's a coastal city

- it's only for a few months

Cons

- much less activities in the new city

- i surely miss inscriptions for classes i want to take next year

- no relatives or friends in the new city

- workspace mood will be duller for sure since I'm currently working with a very good friend.

I'm kind of excited to change my way of life but at the same time I feel like nothing is waiting for me there and it's just a waste...

Thank you in advance for any insights you want to share.

See you around ;)",15Jul2020,1
559,"I’m a 4th generation American of Italian heritage.  My family is very proud, and our last name is very long, hard to pronounce, and makes it easy for people to come up with crude Nicknames.  It’s the most obnoxious name of all time.  It sucks.  I was basically tortured in high school by my nickname, crushed my self esteem just hearing it.  Just typing this gives me shrills.  

In college, that particular nickname didn’t follow, but a new nickname was born based off my last name which also gave people wrong first impressions of me when introduced.  

Even now, in my professional career, my colleagues refer to me as a nickname from some connotation of my last name.  Kinda just wish I had a normal last name, or people just called me by my first name.  

I always introduce myself by my first name ALWAYS. But when they learn my last name, it’s over.  It even makes my actual job more difficult as a consultant for a large financial firm... having to explain my last name to every client I have.

I do not embody my last name whatsoever.  People are shocked when they learn what my last name is.  As I resemble an all American man, with not much ethnic background.  I’m a mix of German, Italian, Irish and Northern European decent.  Though my last name is the most obnoxious Italian last name ever conceived.

The problem is that my family would shun me for a name change.  They would completely take it the wrong way.  What I would give to just have “Smith” as my last name.  I feel like I’d be on a totally different trajectory in life.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do to change my name without pissing off my family?",15Jul2020,1
561,"Im 19 and am capable of having a drivers license. I live in south africa. I went for my license last year but failed due to bumping a cone. Everything in my scoresheet was unmarked meaning I had no points deducted. I went for thorough driving lessons and am pretty much a really good driver. My parents however do not let me drive the car around although I am definitely a much better driver than them. Mainly my mother. My dad drives like a professional race car driver so I doubt I'll ever get to his level.

I only drive around for practice and thats only with a driver in the front seat. I just want to see my friends and do my own thing without being treated as a child having to ask my rents to pick me up the whole time. 

How can I convince my parents to let me drive the car around town to see my mates?

Tl;dr: Im a good driver but my rents won't let me drive the car , how do I convince them to let me drive around town to see friends?

Edit: btw we have 2 cars, the car im talking about is already mine, just need to grab my drivers license which is a bit of a hassle at the moment as the traffic dept. is in a rona hotspot.",15Jul2020,1

563,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 
I have two beautiful babies. One male and the other female. Almost a year old. I love them but I also hate them and I don't know why. I find myself hurting them or mentally tormenting them when we're alone and my spouse will not let me give them away because they adore. I have told my SO I am abusing our babies when they're not around and they will not listen. I havs asked and pleaded to give them away but my SO has threatened our relationship so they're still here. 
The thing is that I'll hurt them, nothing obvious, and then be sorry and regretful hours later but as soon as they do the slightest thing - eating, making a sound, jumping on furniture - I go ballistic and it's really worrying me why. I do not want to hurt my cats, they're a bit afraid now and won't come as close anymore unless I have something they want. It breaks my heart because I raised them on my own. Truth be told, I've had the tendency to hurt animals since I was younger but it's always something I repressed. I think deep inside I'm more worried about my relationship with my SO than my pets. 
I want to add that the abuse isn't conscious. It just...happens and then I come out of whatever state I'm in and feel horrible about it.

Edit: I've called someone to take them from me for a while. It's not a permanent solution, I want to keep them. I just want some help on how now to hurt them. I do love them, just not as much as my SO. I cannot seek the psychiatric help I need because of COVID but I have been looking since Feburary.",15Jul2020,2

565,"I dislocated my shoulder, got a doc's recommendation for PT. PT said with my doc's rec. That I'd be covered. Went there for over a month and a half.
Yesterday the PT receptionists told me that corporate noticed I hadn't been paying. I said I thought my insurance covered it. They said they had me as single payer or copayment, not sure which.
I went through PT again and asked about it at the end.
They called my insurance up and said it only covered the first evaluation appointment but physical therapy appointments aren't covered in that plan.
This entire time I've been paying for insurance, receiving no bill from PT, having given no money from PT and having never been asked for money for PT and now they want me to pay.
What can I do? I can barely afford rent.

I asked 3 times if my plan would be covered before ever setting an appt. and they kept telling me yes, making no distinction between evaluation and regular visits. I feel like I was lied to. 
What can I do to make this affordable?",15Jul2020,1
566,"I don't even know how to start.
I have been in this group of 3 others guys (20-21M) for 3~4 years now, and I just can't make my mind up if they are toxic for my wellbeing or am I just too scared of losing something?

I guess the first red flag that popped out was when the ""alpha"" of the group ( the 2 others act like his henchmen) guilt tripped me into cutting off my then best friend (Female), he said sh*t like "" we can't be friends if you are friends with her "" and "" you should leave us, if you like her so much"". And I left her cause I was too scared of losing them, I thought I had something good with them, I regret this decision so much .
This behavior has gone far enough where they shun me for spending time with the friends I made in College.

The collective red flags:
-2 other guys enabling the ""alpha""
-Racist behavior towards me and poc in general ( FYI themselves are poc but in their words they are ""light skinned"" so they see themselves as superior)
- Shaming me for my height , looks and my support for feminism ( mainstream, I believe women should be    treated equally as men)
- one of the henchmen showing pedophilic behavior and just outright confesses his love for it. 
- misogynistic and radical Islamic views from the ""alpha""
- I dread opening up the group chat as im constantly attacked 
- Gaming sessions with them is hell, I make one wrong move and they all just pile on and its not even the normal kind u expect, it turns toxic to the point I get depressed. (Eg: I got shit on for walling a certain area on the map, while one of the henchmen never uses his scope)

I try to defend myself from their attacks but it can be exhausting and just emotionally draining when there are 3 of them.

It has gone to a point where, I do accept that I am not good looking and that being the color I am is a curse.

Am I just being a snowflake?",15Jul2020,2

568,"So yeah, the title says it all. I bought some coke to drink, She flipped out and scolded me. I thought she couldn't do anything because the money I used is mine. I got the money through a job I did before the quarantine happened, along with art commissions I did during this time. That day, I have about RM1200(around $300).

Well, I was wrong to assume she wouldn't do anything, she forced me to transfer almost all of my money, leaving only RM60($15) in my account. Seriously, I'm not kidding, she did that all over a few bottles of Coke, even lectured me about my spending habits. Even though I didn't spend that much and I was only spending about RM12($2.82) on the drinks I bought. For some reason, she wasn't happy that I have more electronic devices than before. I have a phone I currently use, a phone I don't use anymore, an Amazon Tab I bought used, and a Galaxy Tab A6 I bought back in 2018. For some reason, she decides to assume that I bought all these things not long ago(amazing logic am I right?). That, along with the reason I ""couldn't manage my money properly"", she promptly forced me to transfer almost all of my savings to her account and only take some of it out from HER when I need it. It might as well not be able to get it back.

This is ridiculous! Does she even have the right to confiscate my money? MY money?! I tried very hard to save that money in order to get a gaming PC, but she ruined it! What the hell am I supposed to do now? She has no right to take my money away, let alone tell me how to spend MY money!

I also have a paypal donation link, but I am not sure if that'll help much.

569,"A large portion of my family doesn't believe in the virus or thinks it's just a hyped up version of the flu. My dad is under the impression that everyone just needs to get it and get it over with, but even though he says it's like the flu, he always knew it would probably kill him if he got it. My dad is in the Army Corps of Engineers out of Savannah Georgia, and he was exposed at work while in Florida. He's not allowed to come home, he's under strict quarantine. My dad also has COPD amd emphysema. If he has it there's a good chance it will kill him and I won't be able to see him again. He's never been the type to answer phone calls or text messages, he's just not the talking type in general. I always knew my dad would pass when I was young due to his illness but now that it's a very real threat and I don't know how to feel. I just feel numb to it. Like it's impossible that anything will really happen to him. I still feel like he'll come home this weekend and raise hell at my siblings and I for just about everything again.

573,"I’ve been living with my parents since the pandemic began... we haven’t been going anywhere besides our to do essential activities and we disinfect everything we bring into the house. 

I am about to leave and move back in with my roommate at university (in the United States which is currently the epicentre for the virus) who is not taking any precautions for covid. She wears a masked when forced to in public but besides that she is not social distancing in the slightest. Her and her boyfriend simply don’t care and have been going into peoples homes, going into work, going to parties, bars, restaurants, salons etc. On top of this her boyfriend is moving away next month and they plan to fly back and forth and visit each other regularly, with him staying at my place when he’s in town. He is being even less careful than her.

I’ve been incredibly anxious about the virus and am really worried about moving back in with her. I don’t think moving out is necessarily a good option and seems a bit harsh. I’ve tried speaking to her about it and while she tries to be a bit empathetic she has no intentions in changing her ways. We both have asthma so when I try to plea with her about the risks of asthma and the virus she just says “yes I don’t want to get it either but I’m not going to stop living my life”

577,"Before I start I just wanna apologise for bad wording, Im writing this late at night and with emotions running high.

There has been a argument in my family in years but only now my mum said something that made me really think about my dad.

Some background to help you understand, my parents have been divorced for 4 years with me in the middle of the argument, and before that there was a lot of abuse from my dad towards to my mum, my brothers and me.

My mum says that my aunt (dad’s side) his filling dad’s brains with lies and making him a worse person, that he didn’t spend a lot of money on me and my brothers but spend a lot of money on my aunt and her family, that aunt is spreading lies about mum to the whole community that we used to live in and that they helped them leave Afghanistan and come to Australia also says that she paid for their first car and is under her name but they never showed appreciation or even payed her back.

Meanwhile my dad and aunt is saying my mum and her sisters, brothers and mum are trying to lie to me to try make them seem like bad people and seem like a big and happy family. (Even though I’ve seen them multiple times argue, hit and scream at each other) 

Now we’re in the present, last week when my mum was driving me to dad’s house to stay for the weekend and I said “is it bad that I kinda want dad to die? Because I don’t wanna visit him or my aunt and her family” and she responded with “ if you want to visit dad but visit them just tell him, you are a man now you can legally get a car in 1 year, and your dad buying you AirPods was the least he could do, he doesn’t understand that his family should come first not his sister’s. He didn’t spend a lot of money for me actually no, he didn’t spend money for your brothers at all! I remember we went to GameStop and your brothers we’re really excited to buy a game, when they chose a game your dad just walked out of store and that made me so angry watching my sons ask me to buy the game for them and putting the games back after I said no I don’t have any money, be grateful that your dad bought you AirPods because he didn’t buy your brothers games. And now his asking you to ask your brothers to visit him”

580,"My wife recently bought a certified pre-owned car from a dealership. We ended up having the car for a few days on dealer plates until the title arrived and the car could be registered to us. We have photo proof that when the dealer plates were on there was no dent, but after my wife got home from getting the car registered and have our plates put on (by the salesman) I noticed that there are 2 large dents on the trunk where the bolts were overtightened and the plate is sucked into the car a little. The salesperson that put the plate on used an electric drill to attach the dealer plate and my wife confirmed he did for our plates as well.

582,"Hi,
I’m a 24 year old guy from India,
My girlfriend is also 24, soon to turn 25, we have been in a relationship since the last 4 years, from our college days (she was my classmate).
Suffice to say, I love her, she is an extremely nice person and we go very well together,
Have had a few fights through the relationship but nothing that could change the fact that we both are very compatible.
The problem is, in lieu of the Indian society’s mass hysteria regarding marriage, her parents are constantly nagging her about it, and she too thinks its the right thing to do.
She also has made up her mind and decided she wants to get married, they are so pushy about it that they wanted to get it done this year itself but couldn’t because of the lockdown.
Now, they are saying that they can wait till the next year mid at max.
My perspective on this is different, I feel that I’m way too young to take on the responsibilities of a married life yet, my older sister is yet to get married and to be honest, I want to explore the world with the freedom of an independent guy seeking new experiences and boundaries in this age of globalisation and technology.
I feel that marriage will somehow sabotage a lot of this, I maybe wrong.
I really love her and see my future with her, but I’m not at all ready to get married right now.
I’m asking her to wait for 2-3 years more, till the age we are 27 at least.
But she thinks that that would be pretty late and all the good rishtas for an arranged marriage (if things don’t work out with us) will stop coming.
Is it too much for me to ask or is there something that can be done in a better way?
Has anyone else ever been in my shoes?
What did you do and how did it turn out?
All advice is appreciated, I really don’t want to take the wrong decision.

Right now, I have a lot of freedom when it comes to the kind of work I wanna do, the kind of risks I can take, and a lot many hidden aspects.
These things will surely change after marriage.

583,"So I asked to of my best friends (have known them since high school) to be my maid of honour/s for my wedding. The wedding is in 7 months and super exciting, however my MOH are not helping with the process. When I asked them to be my MOH I told them I was going to need some help picking the dresses for them as well as the shoes and jewellery as they were the ones wearing it I wanted to them to feel comfortable. However I asked them to both agree on one and that dress will also be used for the other bridesmaids who I was going to add to the group after all the major decisions have been made. I asked them to have picked a dress by Friday because I am planning on getting the dresses custom made and the website said it may take 4-5 months for them to be made and adjusted as well as shipped (COVID has slowed things down).

All I wanted was for my MOH to pick the dresses but I was going to pay for them. However when I would want to talk about the progress of the dress findings, my MOH/s were not responding for days and just leaving me on seen, so I decided to leave it until Friday (the day we had agreed on) and they still hadn’t found a dress. I sent a message to them in which I explained my disappointment because there is a lot of things that I needed to do and they said they would help me with this, I then proceeded to leave the group because I felt as though they were just not helping (yes an overreaction here) and I offered them a way out if this was not the right time for them to be this involved in the wedding with no hard feelings but they said they could do it. So I gave them until Tuesday to come up with a dress, they apologised and seemed really keen on helping me out and they were somewhat responding. 

One of my MOH/s made an effort we spoke on the phone for a few hours and she said she would 100% get onto the dresses and she gave me some ideas for party favours which was awesome and I appreciated that. I thought things were on track. Come Tuesday, still no dress has been chosen and there were barely responding to any messages on Tuesday and this really bothered me and to add icing to the cake the MOH who had called me accidentally sent me a message that was meant for someone else complaining about the fact that she has to pick a dress when that’s the last thing she wants to do. My other MOH was barely responding to any messages during this whole process and i got really upset at this.
 I don’t have any family close to where I live and they are literally my family so whenever they had birthdays or any celebrations I would go out of my way to make sure that we celebrate it effectively and I would 100% be there for them and go to moon and back for them if it was their turn to get married or even celebrate, which I have done before and I kind of just expected that in return. I have always been the friend that is always there whenever they needed them because they were pretty much my sisters and this just devastated me. Whilst they were trying to pick dresses they were just focused on themselves but not actually considering each other and the other bridesmaids’ body shapes which I had to constantly remind them and it just hurt me because I am running out of time to get the dresses. 

I have gotten to the point were I just want to ask them to be just guest at the wedding because it’s stressing me out having to deal with friends who say they are there for me but does not really seem like it. After them not being able to pick a dress last night, I sent a message to one of my MOH (the one who called) and said that I am running out of time and the last thing I want is to be worrying about them because if they can’t handle picking dresses for themselves how are they going to make effective decisions and lead the bridesmaids if things go wrong and I can’t be there per say to sort it out and she got really upset at me saying that she has been trying (in which I thought that she only really tried for a day after I complained the first time) but I will say she did post on the the group more often than my other MOH and she replied more than my other MOH. 

I then sent a message to my other MOH and she said she wasn’t going to respond to my message because it would just make her angry in which I just did not respond because here response I felt was rude and uncalled for as I had just poured out my whole heart to them. 
This was the message is sent in the group:
“Listen you guys ( I honestly don’t know where this is gonna go) but I honestly can not do this anymore. I am stressed to the brim, I am in the middle of doing 4 assignments and meeting with people everyday and having late nights just trying to sort things out and I’m honestly tired and don’t have the energy to do this. I was always someone you could come and talk to if you were busy or tired or had work or something had come up. If you were busy you could have responded, shown that you are still thinking about it but yeah it is what it it is. 
But none of you did that and I had to chase you guys up to see how the dress search was going. I get the fact that it’s not your wedding so you obligation to care it 0. That’s were we are different because my obligation to care is 100%. Why did I need the dresses by Friday, it’s because we had the money then but now something has come up and that money has gone for a deposit elsewhere. 
So your next question is can’t you just replace that money, no I can not, it’s not that simple and easy to replace $2000 because with a wedding a lot of things have to be paid for and your dresses were a priority that needed to be taken care of. I have cried and broken so much over the last week because I couldn’t understand where I was going wrong and if I was asking too much and that’s honestly the worst feeling to have on top of everything else that I need to do and plan as well as the 4 assignments I have due in 1 week before I start prac. 
I just honestly have a lot going on right now that I can not mentally handle anymore pain or heartache especially when I can see that this decision of a dress, you guys have taken so lightly. So yeah I’m just kind of done and yeah.  It sucks a whole lot seeing Groom’s friends step up and go all out for him and they were the least of people who I expected to. After 12 hour days they still managed to even make 20 minutes just to talk over with what he needed. He didn’t need to chase up, or be worried because they were on to it. Listen I’m not mad but I just don’t want to put myself in this position, where I have to do this.”

My MOH ( the one who doesn’t respond) said this
“ I’m not going to respond to that cause I will just get angry. Is there are other bridesmaids or no. Is it me the other maid of honour and your sister. I have liked all the dresses I like on the padlet and I think your sister should have a say in what we wear” 

This really upset me as I had previously sent a long message to both my MOH/s and my sister saying that there will be 3 more bridesmaids and whenever my MOH/s choose a dress they should go and let my sister know so that she feels involved (my sister doesn’t live in the same city as us).

588,"Ok so here we go. So I've been dealing with foot problems for the past couple of years and I've recently just gotten back into the job market (will explain in more detail if people are really interested). I recently was offered a really good job opportunity, but within the past couple of weeks I've strongly considered getting a special surgery on my foot that would probably keep me down and out for at least 8 weeks, and I probably wouldn't be able to return to a physical job for about 3 to 4 months.

591,"X-Posting from relationship advice. Maybe there is someone here who knows more.

Hi,

The title is not very clear but essentially I have a very real problem initiating or having sex with anyone that is not a prostitute.

Before you judge me my past for context:

Grew up in a place where street prostitution is legal (think Amsterdam windows but far less regulated).

It was relatively cheap, and when I was 12 I came into possession of, what was for a 12 year old, a lot of money by way of a present from my oblivious grandmother. Hid the money and then being a overly horny kid with no sexual education I went and had my first time with a prostitute. 

Never realised how much it fucked my understanding of sex and intimacy up until I realised by the age of 18 that I never had sex with any “normal girl”. I just kept having sex with prostitutes ( got tested a lot after 18 so that is not an issue miraculously).

So that brings us to now-older than 18 and cut myself off at 19 because I understood how fucked up it all was:

I have had 2 girlfriends and with both I could not initiate sex, enjoy it or cum, it’s like I see sex as a dirty thing that I do to somebody not with them. Also, I don’t understand how it all works wit someone I actually have a personal connection with, spent years going, paying, having sex and leaving immediately. I think maybe a good analogy is that it’s like eating to for nutrition but not for enjoyment, just cramming the blandest meal in.

I’m scared that I’m damaged beyond repair and I’m not sure what I should do, but it’s always what ends any relationship I attempt to have.

Anyone here have any ideas? Is there some sort of therapy that can help with this?

P.S.: I feel guilty about all the prostitutes that I had sex with but I was a stupid kid and the moral implications were not anything I understood at that point. Once I did I stopped.",15Jul2020,1
592,"First of all sorry for my inglish.

I work as a gardener and also we are forced to do a lot of other stuff that is not related to our profession and everyone knows this and nobody cares so we can do nothing about it. Keep in mind that country where i live don't give a ..... about things like this so i'm not the only one. Year ago there was 9 gardeners now left only me and two others and we literally run like horses to get job done +as i mentioned other stuffs that is not our job +we are forced to work in other places too for free and we can't say a word because we will lost our job... 

Only i work in my family +this job gives me only 350$ month... with this amount of money per month you can buy food and sometimes some cloth... and keep in mind that 350$ in my country means middle-class(this is the worst).

So let's get to the point. I'm very very very very tired because of crazy overworking everyday. I can't learn something new. I can't see my friends. I can't do what i want and i can't even .......... leave my job because i can't ........ stay without money even one week. Trust me 350$ is nothing....

Plus my friends can't understand why i can't see them when i'm very tired and i'm tired all the time. They say come on man the best way to rest is to see your friends and yep they are right because they are good friends we know each-other from the first class but they never had job like mine.. they will never understand me.

This is the final part i don't want you to waste your time a lot. So my country is almost occupied by RUS , my government is the worst, my job sucks, i feel tired every minute of the day, only my co-workers understand me, i can't learn something new because i can't leave my job, i'm stuck in a loop, + one of my friend got arrested and he will live in prison for 8 years and trust me he did nothing bad to others he's entire life. He's a very good person but he's in prison because he wanted to have some fun and caught on drugs. 8 years imagine rapists and murderers in my country gets 6 years and my friend will live there for 8 years because of what... every my f...... day gets worse and worse.. every other day i feel worse... everyone saying to me that my face looks very sad... and i don't know what to do...

&amp;#x200B;

YES I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE MUCH WORSE THAN ME BUT THAT JUST GIVES +1 DEPRESSION TO ME.

Dear Mrs. \[teacher\],

My name is \[me\] and I was in your Spanish class about ten years ago. I am writing this letter to thank you for inspiring my love of foreign languages. During high school, I was unhappy and struggled with many things, especially with academics at the time. Throughout my entire time at \[high school\], your class was the one class I truly enjoyed and felt I did well in. In the years following high school, I continued learning Spanish out of enjoyment as well as French, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Dutch. I am not fluent in any of these languages (yet!), though it will be a lifelong goal that your Spanish class was the catalyst of. I am now a reading teacher for an elementary school in \[my city\] with certification to teach English as a second language. The inspiration for obtaining my license to teach English and for teaching reading was, again, inspired by my love of language that stemmed from your class. Thank you for being a wonderful, inspirational teacher!

Sincerely,

\[me\]

Cousin 19M

My parents left me when I was younger and I’m quite sure I have abandonment issues from that. I spent so long blaming myself for it and hating myself for being the reason my parents weren’t in my life, (even though I wasn’t at fault.) 

Recently, “my older sibling” (they’re not really my sibling but we’re so close and we’ve bonded so we feel like we are siblings, they’re actually my cousin) moved out of the house yesterday. I have an anxiety disorder and he was the only one who I’d tell if I was struggling or having a bad time. I also used to self harm, he was the one to get me to stop and talk me down from it. I’ve been clean for four months and 19 days. Now he’s gone. I thought back to some snappy comments I’ve made in the past and I brought all that stuff up for myself to over analyze and I came to the conclusion that it was my fault he’s moving out. Everyone else in our family agreed that it has nothing to do with me, it’s just that he’s 19 and needs to branch out and grow up some more. 

I kept telling myself that he’s going to never talk to me again even though he said himself he would. I know I most likely sound dumb but I really have a hard time believing what people say and trusting their promises they made to me. 

I need some advice on how to get over it and stop blaming myself for everything even though I have no part in this. He only lives ~20 minutes away and he told me I could call, text, and hang out with him. He told me he’d still stop by to see me and the rest of our family and stuff so that in itself was really reassuring but I’m still worried about being alone. It’s just me at the house now. (With the exception of my aunt, my uncle works out of town so he rarely comes down to see us.)

I need advice on learning how to talk when I need to talk. I’m scared to text him and say “hey, I had a bad day, can I talk it over with you?” Because I’m terrified of being a bother or burden to anyone. 

I just want to know how to get over this and stop being so sad about it all. Thank you for reading this! I appreciate it a lot!",15Jul2020,1

Throwaway to try and uphold anonymity.

A little back story - 
I became a parent at a young age. My sons father (we'll call him bob) is ten years older than me. The age gap isn't the problem, its just how young I was at the time. 

When my son was 18 months old, we split up. Bob disappeared for a year or so, until certain circumstances forced him to answer the phone to me eventually. 
After that, contact between him and our son was perfect. Until 5/6 years ago. 

Bob had sold his ipad to a local pawn shop, on a buy back scheme, and hadn't bought it back. When prepping for sale, the shop found indecent images of children. Prepubescent girls to be exact. Finding the tiny positive in that, my son wasn't the subject of his perversion. 

Fast forward to now. 

My son is much older. He's pre teen. He knows what sex is, as I've always been open when his curiosity calls. 
He knows he isn't allowed to be around his dad, without another adult. Not that his dad applied himself to supervised contact. We haven't had contact with him for about 4/5 years. 
He knows his dad was in trouble with the police, because stupid shit head Bob, told him. 

Now my son is getting older, he asks about his dad more and more. He asks why he was in trouble. He loves his dad. I don't say a bad word against him to my son, because I want to preserve the love he has for him as long as possible. There's no way I'm ready to tell him yet, or thats he's ready hear it. 

My questions are; when would you consider a good age to disclose the nature of Bobs crime, to my son? 
How should I word it, so he doesn't get a tainted view of his father? 

Any advice would be appreciated. This is a place I never thought we'd be. 
We've not been supported by social services, in regards to Bobs crime. Its a situation I've been left to manage, pretty much alone.",15Jul2020,1

608,"A little in-depth of what I’m trying to get at ;

Do you remember any of your significant break ups with anyone? Some that were too hard, some that got a little crazy, or even the good ones where you get to talk everything out so you part on good terms? 

I’m assuming some people like closure. So, when all the feathers aren’t ruffled with the ex anymore and you’re both agreeing to meet up for some type of closure. And you talk out all the shit where it went right, and all the shit that was just shit, accept your responsibilities within that relationship, etc. Basically formally closing the relationship without any bad blood or things you both needed to tell each other to move on. 

Is that possible for me if my ex has passed on? 

I remember us two being so nasty to each other the months before he past. I was so angry and hurt at everything. I thought I had time to be angry at them still. I thought I had time to be angry for longer than I got. I didn’t want to be angry at you when you died I just wanted to be angry at you for a minute. I just needed to get out all the bad blood within me. When I felt like we shook it all out. I still wanted to talk. There was just so much shit and then so much good and then just so much mess. I thought I had time to be mad for a little while longer before we could get to that closure stage. I just wanted to be angry for a little and get it all out. But then they died before I could finish being mad at them for being so shitty to me. And now all I feel is guilt guilt guilt guilt.

I then tried again a few minutes later after googling if i can sleep with the light on because i think i have a mild fear of the dark (i know i’m pathetic) but when it happened this time i could see like hands along with the pulsing motion, sat up and for obvious reason i couldn’t try again right away so i went on instagram for a little bit.

My parents, they don't get along really well The main reason for that is mostly because my dad is in charge of all the money and he is the one who give my mom life expenses money every month. My dad however, is stingy as fuck. Since my mom keep complaining to me about my dad not ""sparing"" her enough money and that she is poor. It also makes me think that I am also super poor, since I rarely get to talk to my dad(about twice a year because he lived in Canada and I lived in USA). I don't want to go too in depth with why my dad is stingy but it has to do with my mom loaning money to her sister(both my mom and dad are fully aware that they won't get the money back from my aunt) However, I think is because my mom had loaned my uncle a lot of money without asking for my dad's permission which make my dad really mad and just cut my mom out of the bank account(not confirmed though, just my dad side of the story)  Yesterday, after a 3 hour conversation with him, when I asked him whether or not this family is poor or rich. He finally opened up to me. He said that we are consider poor at the moment, but we owned like 5 properties in Canada. Those property are worth a fuck ton but he doesn't want to sell it because he thinks 1) now is not the right time and 2) my aunt will beg my mom asking for a portion of that transaction made, and my mom will not refuse my aunt so she will use divorce as a tool to get money so she can loan it to my aunt. No joke, this has happened before. So now onto my question about financing.

Since I always thought my family is poor, I saved up most of the money that I have. I always thought if my mom and brother ran out of money I would have to step up and provide food. However, that is not the case anymore. Since my dad can just sell one of the house and it will be sufficient to feed a entire for 5-10 years with no problem. Now since my dad told me using money wisely is better then saving up for it. I am thinking spending 1/3 of it on getting new glasses, upgrading my computer, building up my own wardrobe, laptop, any useful and essentials items I thought I didn't need but would be really useful if I have them(sunscreen, moisture, and etc) What do you guys think? Should I keep the money or buy the things I want and like?

I am a virgin, albeit im under 20, above 16, but I have no traumatic past that would be what caused it, so I'm not sure why, I guess I just am. I've never been into hookups, nothing like that.

631,"The title mostly says it, my 7 month old is the first grandchild in the family, so I understand the excitement and desire to “spoil” him with gifts. For the most part we truly love and appreciate the gifts we receive, however my mother seems to completely lose her head and buy non-sensical clothing items that cost way too much for what they are. 

I do not know what 7 month old needs complete raincoat set (coat with overalls) from a high end outdoor clothing store that cost roughly $90CAD with taxes and shipping. He can’t even crawl yet, what is he possibly going to need a full rain suit for?? What do I do with this? It might only fit him for another week and it’s in the middle of our summer! It’s so wasteful, and impractical and I feel bad that she’s flushing money like that down the drain. It’s cute for pictures I guess but it’s not like we go backpacking in the wilderness with our infant. If he truly needed a raincoat I could have probably found one elsewhere for no more than $25

That’s just the latest example. Another would be a pair of real leather and fur lined moccasin style booties and matching mittens that she bought back in February when he was 3 months old. Perhaps they would have been useful for that season had they not been sized for 6 months, so she had to know he wouldn’t fit in them until the middle of summer. The booties alone cost another 60ish dollars. Now they just sit in a closet, have never been worn and don’t fit. (Also I’m not a fur/leather supporter anyway.)

When she asks if he needs anything I’m very specific and I’ll send links of examples of things he needs. We’re a pretty average middle class canadian family, it’s not that she can’t “afford” these things, I just think she’s blind to the cost of things in the spur of the moment when she sees somethings “cute” and she just surprises me randomly with these things for her grandson. I look at these useless items and think of all the things she could have spent that money on that we could actually have used.

Any advice on how to curb this? I hope I don’t sound ungrateful because I am so happy that she loves him and she’s just excited, I just feel badly that she’s frankly wasting so much money on things we really have no use for. 
Should I ask for receipts so we can at least exchange things?
Should I just keep accepting these things and giving them away or donating them without telling her?

639,"Hi. I'm a 15 year old and I have a dad who's a gambling addict.  
Problems started already when I was a little child; he didn't see my mom give birth to me, he went to Spain and basically abandoned me and my then two year old sister.   
He returned very soon, and my parents eventually decided to not divorce just for me and my sister.  
Unfortunately, our parents were fighting constantly (dad's fault mostly) and I developed a sort of hate towards my father at a young age.  
Everything has been spiraling out of control, especially in the last 3 years. He's been spending ALL of his income on gambling. We barely manage to pay bills and rent and sometimes we have to go days without food in the house.  
It doesn't help that he's mentally manipulative; I know his mind games and he's very well aware of (that I know). I've developed this sort of anger against him - I feel like someday I'm gonna explode and yell at him. He's been ruining everything for all these years, especially now that I'm in my teens. I have been suffering with derealization and depression for many years.   
How can I confront him about this? He doesn't even care or feel embarassed for the problems he causes (lack of food, etc).   
PS: Anything that involves legal stuff, unfortunately I can't. He's the only source of income, my mom doesn't work and finding even a summer job is hard (also because of corona).

642,"Just a disclosure i was not present for this fight i heard it on the phone.

Last night my fiance (F, 25) got in a fight with her dad about our wedding plans we are changing due to covid 19. While she was discussing the plans with her mom and dad, and how we are going to have a small wedding this year and a vow renewal the next year, she got a little heated with her mom and raised her voice. She yelled at her saying that she was focusing too much on our bigger wedding next year and not our small one coming up. Instead of her mom yelling back at her, her dad stood up and pushed a chair out of the way and got in her face and said ""f\*\*k you to her multiple times"" In response my fiance got up and went to her room and for another hour her dad was yelling to the family saying things like ""no im not going to let her be mean to us again, ive kept my mouth shut for a full year.."" ""Shes not treating me like shit again""

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, my fiance did not swear, she did not say anything disrespectful directly to him. The only disrespectful thing she did was raise her voice. Her dad said to both of us ""whatever you need we will make it work ,money is not an issue"" which we both really appreciate. But then when my fiance brings up that she wants 25-30 people at this smaller wedding, her dad blows up and starts yelling saying ""we cannot inconvenience your uncle!"" when we havent even asked him yet if 25-30 people is too many for him (since we are having our small wedding at his house)

&amp;#x200B;

Then, she went and apologized to her dad, and she says ""please dont swear at me like that again"" after she apologizes for yelling and her dad says ""well thank you for the apology but i cannot gurantee i will try though, it takes a lot to get me that mad.."" He doesn't apologize either to her for swearing like that to her.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this really upsets me alot and he is making me uncomfortable treating her this way. What I want to do is talk to him one on one and set up some boundaries so he doesnt cross the line again, but my fiance is telling me not to contact him. She says that if i contact him it will make it worse for her and hes only going to get mad at her and put her in the middle of things.

644,"Hey guys so I need some advice. I (28F) feel completely and utterly lost right now in my career and it is starting to effect me mentally. Just to give you guys a little background on myself:

-I have a bachelors degree and I am licensed to do hair 

-I moved to Houston about 2 years ago, just to get out of my small town. There are not many career options where I am from, so I moved for better opportunities. 

-I started working for an outside sales position that took up a majority of my life for a year. I was working 70+ hours a week, I had no social life, and I was broke. I was holding on to the promise of success and money. 

-This job put me into a hole, it drove wedges between me and my family/friends, and had a very negative effect on my mental health. It put a lot into perspective, and made me realize what is important. 

-I finally realized that what I was doing wasn’t getting me anywhere, so I finally quit after almost a year. 

-Currently, I work for a larger company in the healthcare sector and I am miserable. I was looking for jobs before the pandemic, and now I feel stuck. Don’t get me wrong, I am very very grateful to have a job right now as I know a lot of people are struggling right now. 

-I don’t have any significant passions or any skills that makes me stand out. I enjoy to write, but that’s really it. 

I tell you all of this so you can understand where I am coming from. The pandemic really put things into perspective for me as well. I have been working from home, and it’s all I really do now. Because of this, I now know what it is important for me to feel like I have fulfillment in my life, and that is not in my career. Life for me is about experiences and human connection. I could give two shits if I have a flashy career and a lot of money. 

I don’t want to spend my life working for a company and only having 15 days of pto every year. That is not living to me. I am stuck in this vicious cycle of the American dream and I have no idea where to go from here. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

651,"Hello, so I’ve been at home for quite a while now (2,5 years) with depression and somatic problems. If they are linked we do not know. Anyhow, I have a hard time concentrating and have inconsistent energy levels during the day. 

Today, I went out shooting a basketball, as I always did when I was younger (28M now), and I noticed _I felt the same_. I don’t mean I felt better. No, I mean I noticed again that I’ve been having these issues for far longer than I have admitted - I felt the same as I was younger but apparently it didn’t bother me that much then. I noticed how well the activity fitted my “wandering” state, because the basketball moves and shots I did went on automatic and my thoughts could just wander. It is quite a good way to spend some hours actually. After a couple of years, I started consistently making shots etc., making it even more fun. 

So I started thinking: what could be a useful skill or activity that I can do actively but rather mindlessly (like shooting a basketball), and slowly grind myself into something akin to “mastery” or “competence” or whatever you want to call it. Maybe it will help me get out of this situation.",15Jul2020,1
652,"**TL;DR**: I feel my older sister doesn't seem to have too much of a future outside working/living at home. A lot has to do with growing up w/ older brother who has a lot of special needs who she gave more attention to then herself.

I (26F) grew up the youngest of three. Oldest brother (35M) has a variety of medical needs/developmental hinderances since birth where he needs another person for the rest of his life for medical assistance, emotional regulation, drives around town, etc.

Growing up the sibling of an individual with ""special needs"" (for lack of a better phrase) has made me at times bitter at the amount of emotional, financial, and mental energy I along with others have had to dedicate to his livelihood yet..in awe of how mercilessly dependent we all are on one another at the end of the day in some way or another.

I have been fortunate to leave Midwest hometown for college, travel, live in different places and pursue a career/lifestyle path focused on social justice/related issues.

Sister (29F) has been living at home in Midwest hometown for most of her life with older brother (35M) and mother (70F). Sister has had a brief experience away from hometown for 2 years for college but returned home when father (62M) passed away 10 years ago.

Sister always grew up in shadow of older brother's needs, was not given as much attention, was and still is very shy. Currently lives in house with mother and brother and I (am planning on moving out in the fall). She is willing to dedicate a lot of time, energy to helping him out (been doing this since she was young) and take on a lot of responsibility (much of it not asked for from elderly mother).

Sister has no real social life outside of work, spends most time not working in an internet/scrolling phone haze. Will work out, pick up groceries for self, etc. but rarely goes out unless prompted by others in our immediate family (but when is prompted to hike, travel, etc by myself is usually eager and willing). Has no close friends outside an older co-worker, I would say I am likely her closest friend.

I worry--how can I encourage sister to live a life of her own, move out (been very vague discussions around this idea, I think it's something that interests yet scares her), make friends of her own (again, slightly foreign concept to her as she has lived most of her life without too many connections), and gain some confidence?

I mentioned social anxiety in the title as I think a lot of the staying-close-to-home and not too many connections outside of immediate family/co-worker makes her more anxious then not (i.e.-spends a lot of time (days) thinking about how to respond to text messages, will take photos of doors in the morning to quiet fears later in day that she ""maybe forgot to lock them,"" doesn't really speak up for self/needs too often). And, in particular, related to anxiety, I don't think it's necessarily the worst thing it's frustrating, though, her lack of openly acknowledging it/her lack of overall healthy self-awareness makes me worried about a full future for her.",15Jul2020,2

After calming down I made the mistake (is it?) of admitting my recent diagnosis, and since that day, I believe he is using this against me. 
Making sure that what I plan out for the day all goes wrong, pushing the right buttons to send me spiralling in my thoughts that then gives me very bad attacks, forcing me to do things how he wants it and brings me to very crowded places even if i am terrified and when i even slightly complain and explain to him this is the worst thing he could do, he tells me that I'm using my mental health issues to get my way and calling autism being stupid..
This is now making me hide everything and it gets worse and worse every day that goes by to the point that I am sadly hurting myself when I'm alone...

659,"I (29F) was with someone (32M) for 8 years who I still love very much. He’s my favorite person in the world but his communication skills and inability to understand complex emotions eventually drove us apart. 

He’s expressed that he feels stupid and like he doesn’t understand anyone. It’s something that torments him, not understanding why he doesn’t understand what everyone else understands. He’s very black and white in his thinking about people and has a hard time understanding the nuances of emotions and relationships. 

He’s extremely talented musically and can play anything he picks up, and can figure out complex musical problems in his head without much effort. He’s very smart, super quick witted and has a very unique perspective on basically everything. He notices small details about things that I would never notice but doesn’t notice small details in people. 

Over the last few years I’ve wonder if he might be on the autism spectrum. It wouldn’t make me love him any less and If anything I think it could help him understand why he has trouble with people and give him tools to be happier. The problem is he’s extremely resistant to therapy and mental health. I come from a family where people talk freely about therapy and having issues, but his family treats it like taboo. There was a period where I was trying to get him to seek treatment for severe depression and he was unwilling and offended by the implication. 

I don’t think the autism spectrum has ever crossed his mind and I feel like he would never forgive me or look at our relationship the same if I tried to tell him that I think he might have autism, but I so badly want him to get tools to help him get resources for something that has tormented him his whole like (the feeling of being dumb/not understanding anyone).

663,"I am a M17, and my parents have been divorced since 2014. It was messy, and long, and expensive, but now me and my two younger siblings are with our dad after he won custody.

I love my dad, and my new mom(they got married in 2016 with our permission, we love her), And my siblings share the same view. Obviously dad badmouths ex wife now and then, but aside from that, he seems happy enough to not pay attention to her, and get on with their lives.

Now, recently, I've had a falling out with my mom. Over the last years, due to us moving and not seeing each other for a while, it's just become awkward to meet and talk, the tension is weird, and all that.

But now, I want to get back in touch with my mom, but my dad thinks it's a bad idea. Here's why.

My mom was the one who wanted the divorce, and my dad accepted, probably knowing there was no way around it. The case for who got the kids dragged on for a while, the two families straight up having a war with each other, over this.

My mom has caused a lot of pain for me and my siblings, ranging from kicking us out of her house, emotional blackmail, and other. Recently, I realised that I was furious at her for it. So, when she wanted to meet us three, I didn't go. I outright declared I didn't want to see her, nor forgive her. She emails me, and I don't reply, except when I first emailed her to not reach me, but me to reach her.

But now, I wonder if I was being hypocritical. She left us, and it really hurt. It was a world shattering event for me(in a place where divorce ain't common), and I have no intention of letting something like that happen again. But wouldn't I be doing the same thing here? Turning my back on my family?

My siblings want nothing to do with her. My youngest sibling barely remembers her(they were a baby when she left) and my other sibling completely blocks all contact. If I talk to her, it may affect them in a bad way, as my dad told me.

In the end, here's my question. 

Should I forgive my manipulative abusive mother for events over 5 years ago, one my siblings don't want to see, my father doesn't want to see, because I don't want to be her? Should I block all contact?

At his house with his friends, we were talking about 6ix9ine being arrested,that disgusting excuse for a human being, and my boyfriend didn't know what he had done. I said  ""he had sex with a 14 year old"" and my boyfriend said ""oh I thought it was worse than that"". I freak out that he thought what he did was ok. At no point did he say it was ok, he just said he thought it was a 7 or 8 year old so in a way he thought not as bad and also at that moment he hadn't really thought about just how young 14 really is and said it gets grosser and grosser the more he thinks about that

I was furious and accused him of being a pedo sympathiser. This is despite him commenting on his boss for being a creep for hitting on our 19 year old friend and making fun of a guy we know for dating a 17 year old. Since then I've been so terrified he is a pedo or sympathiser, I've accused him of being one for liking my pubic hair shaved and for finding a skinny 30 year old actress attractive. I'm driving myself crazy and he is so sick of being accused. My therapist thinks I have OCD and this is my main obsession. I have literally NO reason to suspect anything, he is the kinda dude that won't even kill bugs/spiders and is a total pushover, but still my anxiety comes up with ways to twist things like the above to make him into a pedo/creep in my head.

672,"I need some advice on something and I decided to come here and ask. first I will tell you all my story I will ask what I should do. some of it may sound sketchy but I assure you all that nothing illegal ever happened.

Me: 37 year old male. Her: 19 year old female.

So a few years ago I was on a dating app. And I found this one woman who I swiped right on and her and return on me. unfortunately unknown to me she was lying about her age and she was really 16. I did not actually meet her in person until this year of 2020 when she was 18 and turns 19 in a few days. Over the last few years me and her were texting and talking. We grew pretty close on my end at least. she actually was scamming me pretty hard. Most people told me to block her, actually everyone told me to block about her. She never actually intended on meeting me and just using me for money at first. But then one day last year I confronted her and she came clean about the scamming and everything. She told me that she actually enjoyed talking to me that was the first person who actually continue to talk into her even knowing about the scams. So we started our relationship over honest terms. Eventually we actually met in person she is a very beautiful young woman who has a lot of issues I understand why she did what she did and although I don't condone it I understand it she came from a very broken home her mother is a meth head and her father is addicted to cocaine she's had a very very abusive family. She has been abused she has been neglected and she has been very mistreated. Because I grew close to her I decided to move my entire life to be closer to her so I left my home and moved to another state. We recently had a very long talk she said that she views me as a father figure that she wishes she had someone like me growing up who would be there for her treat her with respect that I give her and not do the things her father did to her. She wants to move in with me and help her get her life ontrac. she wants me to be a father for her. she wants me to take her to therapy. She wants me to be her sponsor for sobriety to make sure she doesn't go back to alcohol. She wants me to help her stay away from drugs. I care a lot for both as a person and as an individual. I believe she has a lot of potential. her life could get way better if she had the proper role model and attention and quite honestly I wouldn't mind being a father to her. 

So my question is. Is there a way because of her age to be a legal guardian am I making the right choices is there some sort of gesture that I can make to show her that I would fully embrace being a father figure for her. I have never had a family and she might be the closest thing I ever get to a daughter. Am I being dumb? Should I take this young woman under my wing who I care deeply for, who I believe could really use the help. I feel that if I turned her down she might relapse and never recover. she has told me that I am the only stable thing in her life and she desperately wants help.",15Jul2020,1

The whole compilation ended up being 80% cam girls which really makes me think someone recorded them all and made the video w/o any consent.

680,"So I've been working as an intern for over a year now, and while I love the actual work itself, the political BS in the department has been absolutely exhausting. I recently graduated, and will be returning this coming semester as a graduate student.

As part of my grad program acceptance I was granted a GTA position (covers tuition, health insurance, and gives a stipend). Of course the GTA position is far higher in my priority list than the internship, however I do have the option to continue the internship working 3-4 hours a week (down from 20). One of my supervisors also suggested I discuss a pay raise with their supervisor given that I now have a degree and have been working there over a year (although I'm pretty sure they think I've been there longer).

In the event that I do not continue I would only be working with the department for about one more month. I have learned quite a bit from the position, but of my own initiative rather than mentorship. I'm not sure if the opportunities afforded by the internship are worth the trouble.

As an intern I am essentially the ""bottom rung,"" as most interns are, but have the most technical training in the department. I know more about the technical side of the work than any of my supervisors, and even my direct supervisor will consistently come to me with questions before discussing with higher ups or other faculty. Not to mention they have been hinting at a full time position for one of my coworkers for over a year now, just to continually change their mind and ""explore other options."" Due to this I will be the only staff member still around, excluding higher up supervisor positions, by the end of the week.

I guess to quote The Clash ""Should I stay or should I go?"" Given that there aren't really financial reasons to continue and most, if not all of my growth, has been self initiated during the course of the internship, and the lack of respect or competence from leadership.

TLDR: Not sure if continuing internship at 3-4 hours a week is worth it.",15Jul2020,1

Meanwhile, A’s mom has shown no real concern, or understanding, about this virus.

686,"I’ve been going back and forth on this feeling and I really just need an unbiased third party opinion on it. This is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance.


Me and my girlfriend of two and a half years are planning on moving states in a month. We are moving for her to go to her first year of college in another state. We’ve been planning on this move for about a year now. In my head, it was always a tentative plan, as how it is when planning anything a year ahead of time. Anyways, in late April of this year, I got a really good job that will literally allow me to skip the first 3-5 years of entry level bs in my career field.


A month after getting this job, I decided to talk to my girlfriend about the fact that I’ll be giving up a great opportunity if I quit this job and move states. She got upset, it turned into a long argument, and it ended with the compromise that if I’m not able to find a job in the new state that is a decent entry level job in my career field, we will reconsider the plans.


Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, July 1, I’ve applied to a lot of jobs. I’ve been focusing on entry level jobs in this career field that I’m in. I’ve only managed to get two phone interviews, and I didn’t get chosen for either of them. At this point it’s looking like if I’m lucky, I’ll have to settle for either very low entry level job in my career, or go to a minimum wage job that’s not even in my career, either of which would set me back 3-5 years compared to my current job. On top of all of that, the unemployment rate has sky rocketed due to corona virus, and the economy is on the edge right now. At this point, I decide to bring this up and say we should consider a plan B. This conversation went terribly, she shot down any consideration for a plan B, it turned into a fight and went no where. Not only does she say that a plan B is stupid, but she also thinks that I’m just flaking out. I ask her if she thinks if I’m putting off my career for her if I quit this job and move, and she says she doesn’t see that at all. This conversation is when I start to feel like she’s not trying to see it from my side at all. Neither of us bring it up again and another week and a half goes by.


Last week, I bring it up again. I say that we should consider either staying here for a semester or two, not only for my job, but also because of covid, the unemployment rate, and the fact that the education the college will provide probably won’t be as good this semester and not worth the money. Or, the other option is she goes and lives in the dorms(it isn’t too late to sign up for them). After saying this she claims that I’m asking her to either, give up her career for me if she stays, or that I’m asking her to break up if she goes alone because she couldn’t handle the long distance. She also claims that I am valuing money and my career over our relationship. She also cried for most of it and said that I’ve already committed to going, and that I’m being flaky. The conversation ends with me caving and us continuing with our current plan.


Now, her mentioning breaking up surprised me. Mainly because we’ve both talked about getting married in the future and she’s already planned out roughly when I should propose for the ideal marriage(in her eyes). I also felt it unfair to say I’m asking her to give up her career and how that’s unfair, when in my eyes I’m doing that for her if I move, and I’m only asking her to stay because I think that It’s just a bad year to go to college and to move to another state. If covid wasn’t happening, I would never ask her to stay for me to further my career.


Within an hour of finishing the argument I have regret about caving, so I bring it up again the next day. This time she says she is more irritated than anything because I’m bringing it up again and, again, being flaky. I try to explain that I more or less caved in the conversation the day before because I had felt bad for upsetting her so much. But she tells me I committed to this over a year ago and that this isn’t fair to her and I’m making her look stupid. She wouldn’t tell me how that made her look stupid though. She then started telling me how every time I bring it up I make her want to die. Then after I didn’t back down right away, she starts saying, “fine, if you want me to so bad, I’ll get on my computer right now and drop out of college and just stay here. Because I don’t care about my career I just care about you and I’m willing throw away my whole career for you”. She also said that she doesn’t give a damn about her own well-being and that she’ll throw away her life for me. At this point I feel like the manipulation was at it’s highest. I don’t believe any of that, I don’t think she was being sincere in the slightest. But again, after a while, I caved and said whatever, I’ll just work hard and start my career over.


Ever since that argument I’ve still felt regret and stress. I really don’t think moving another state at this time is the move at all. I am starting to feel manipulated but I also feel bad about bringing this up to her because I previously committed to it. My family is telling me that she’s manipulating, but I think they also have personal biases, that’s why I really want a third party opinion on it because I’m at a loss here. I’m sure I missed things in my summary of the situation, and I’m sure my own biases were in it, but any advice on this is greatly appreciated. Am I wrong for trying to back out of a year long plan? Do you think she is manipulating me or am I being flaky? Thank you for taking the time to read this, and sorry for any typos.


TL;DR: After agreeing to move states with my girlfriend a year ago, I got a good job where I live now and don’t want to leave it to move backwards in my career. Every time I bring this up with my girlfriend she accuses me of many things and starts crying to the point where I end up agreeing to stick to the moving plan. And now I feel stressed and manipulated.",15Jul2020,3

688,"This has gone on for years. I recently moved back in with my parents and now I have to deal with the neighbor's German Shepherd barking non-stop. 

It's literally. Non. Fucking. Stop.

This dog will bark in the morning, in the evening, it gives no shits. And it will do this for HOURS. You might forget for a little bit that he was barking and it'll be silent for a short while. But trust me. Majority of the time? He's barking. Full fucking volume.

Apparently this area had a large amount of people lurking about, stealing from cars etc., so they got a dog to keep them away. Well, it worked, but now he's just a nuisance. If fireworks go off, he barks. If someone slams a door too loud, he barks. If my dad's cat runs onto his catio and makes just slightly too much noise, he barks. If my window is open because it's hot as hell in the house and I do so much as fold up a paper bag too loudly, HE FUCKING BARKS.

Complaints do nothing. Neighbors all around have complained for years. Any time he's given a fine to pay, he just pays it and nothing else comes of it. Over time the neighbors have just... given up trying and deal with it.

I've dealt with it for about a month and a half now and I can't anymore. Even if I close my window and deal with the heat, he's still loud as hell because he's RIGHT next door, and the cat door in my window still let's in plenty of noise. I can't keep going like this. It's stressing me out, it's affecting my sleep, I've been late to work more in this past month than I have in years and it's been BAD. 

Dad says he used to toss him a bone to gnaw on and that'd shut him up for a bit, but the neighbors built a shed recently and dad doesn't have access to the same area anymore. But I'm also not about to invest in a large supply of bones to get him to stop barking. I'm not freaking made of money and giving him a bone every day to maybe multiple times a day is just not worth it. And for a large dog like him that would be expensive as heck over time.

689,"I have Aspergers.  

Prior to my wife and I getting married 25 years ago, I struggled with the feeling she called “love”. She asked me if I loved her. I genuinely didn’t know, but I felt very good with her and I did/do all the things that men traditionally do when they say they are in love with someone. I named that feeling “love”. 

Of course there are no precise parameters to that exact feeling I felt in that first moment that I named it. The feeling changes every minute and is never exactly the same nor is precisely definable by me. (However I do know that my attachment and devotion, as demonstrated by my behaviors, to my wife has increased over the years.)

My wife recently asked me if during our marriage I have ever felt “love” for another woman. I paused and thought about it (big mistake pausing), and I told her that “I don’t think so.”

I could have lied to protect her feelings and told her “no”, but as I think about it, I have had affection for other women that felt similar to how I felt for my wife when I first met her.

Since I’m the only one who can perceive my feelings, and I don’t know how to precisely measure them, I don’t know how to confirm to myself if I subjectivity do or don’t “love” someone. It all just feels like gradations and variations of the emotion called kindness/fondness/attraction/desire/love. 

If I define “love” as “the kindness/fondness/attraction/desire I have for my wife”, then by definition, if the kindness/fondness/attraction/desire aren’t for my wife, then it’s not official “love”. 

But if love is defined as a point along the slope of kindness/fondness/attraction/desire (let’s say &gt;6.0 on a scale of 0 to 10), then maybe I did feel love for one of my co-workers. But if the threshold is 7.0, then I didn’t feel “love”. And how do I even create a scale when I don’t know where the “10” is? (I love my wife more than anyone, and it increases every year we’re married. So do I modify the scale as a ratio? If my love for my wife is always a 10, then my love for the secretary at the time was a 7.1 but now in retrospect I deem it as a 6.2, I would say that “I thought it was love, but now I realize that it’s not”. 

In addition to my own internal challenges, I have an obvious incentive to game the system because my wife doesn’t want me to love anyone else, so I may be prone to move the threshold point on the scale to accommodate the situation. She says “don’t fall in love with anyone else,” so I just move the threshold to 9.9.

It’s like having situational ethics for my own emotional state while using an imaginary measuring stick.",15Jul2020,2

He said that I should move into the house with them.

693," 

I transferred to my college (California) this year gone for my senior year to play basketball (NAIA level) after I was promised I'd be able to graduate in 2 semesters + 2 online courses totalling $2,400. I am an international student (UK) and so being quoted an affordable price is why I attended. Towards the end of the Spring semester, I spoke to the Registrar's office and they communicated to me that I actually need to take 4 classes this summer to graduate. I have it in texts from the basketball coaches how I was promised only two classes, but they're saying they merely passed on what the college was saying at the time (they weren't, the coach himself texted me the promise), and now there has been a big hold up and struggle about getting the college to take financial responsibility for the extra classes. One of the extra 2 classes is cheap so I have offered to cover that and have already paid as I was worried I'd get kicked off the courses, so it's just the remaining course I need to be financially taken care of. So far, I have paid over $3500 with half being towards the three online classes, and the other half going towards 'Other fees' that sneakily weren't covered in my full ride scholarship. This remaining course I am taking online is at the actual college I attended (the other three are from other institutions). The letter of intent I signed to attend the college states that my tuition for the 2019/20 academic year will be $0, but I am not familiar if that is only for fall/spring semesters or if it covers any courses at the college over the summer too - it doesn't specify.

My question is would that letter of intent cover the summer course I am taking at the college? If so, should I contact the NAIA and raise the issue their about being charged $2,000 for a course I wasn't told I'd need? Or do I not really have a legal ground to stand on and should just point out how they promised me etc. and were being unethical? The basketball/athletics department lied to me about the credit transferring situation and me all year they'd sort it out but here I am. Any help would be much appreciated!

695,"Details of the wedding:

1. 190 guests, many of them work in a hospital

2. Most will not be wearing masks or distancing

3. Bride has requested that I don't wear a mask for parts of the wedding

4. My SO and I are driving from out of state to get there and must quarantine for 2 weeks after (we're losing a paycheck and a half doing this).

5. I'm the maid of honor


Today I requested that I attend the rehearsal ceremony but skip the dinner as it's being held in a small restaurant with 20-30 people (again, masks are unlikely). My sister and mother both went ballistic. I apologized to my sister and told her I want to do what we can to be there but we can't afford to get sick. She said ""do you think anyone can afford to get sick?"" No, but no one else is facing a 2 week quarantine by default.
 My mom even suggested that we don't come because I've been ""iffy"" about everything throughout the planning process (she won't elaborate how, but I assume it's about asking covid-related questions). They'll probably cool down, but I am expecting a fight every time I try to wear a mask or keep away from a family member.

696,"I’m at home and I rarely go out so the loneliness is starting to creep in on me because we just wrapped up the semester and now I have much less to do. I was okay with hardly talking to friends because I had work to fill my time. 

I miss some good friends from high school but it’s been almost 2 years since I talked to them properly. These feelings were present prior to COVID and schoolwork helped me to forget them for a bit. Now that it’s the semester break I thought maybe it would be a good time to get back in touch with my old friends.

I feel like the friends I’ve made in uni are very surface level. I can’t picture coming to them for help with a problem and vice versa.
 I also managed to convince myself that my friends (old and new) didn’t really like me anymore because I do not check in enough or sometimes I miss birthdays and they do the same to me. It’s not tit for tat but sometimes I absentmindedly keep track. I understand that sometimes friendships expire but I think some of mine died due to neglect.

I write this hoping that someone could give me some advice in how to talk to an old friend again via messaging without being annoying. Or what I could possibly say without making it awkward.

697,"I \[19M\] have been tutoring a kid \[13M\] in Maths, Science, and English during my summer break from university. He’s proven to be quite difficult to work with, but I understand that it’s not his fault because he has suffered brain damage due to a car accident that nearly killed him about a year ago. Despite the challenge he presents, I decided to continue tutoring him because I think it’s unfair that a car accident could ruin his future prospects. He just needs a little more help than most to get back on track.

His parents were kind enough to let me read his neurological report from when he was discharged from hospital and it gave me a better idea of how I might be able to better tutor him specifically. The most relevant detail to this incident though is that a part of his brain which controls emotional regulation was significantly damaged and this means that he experiences regular emotions but to extreme and sometimes debilitating extents. I’ve seen this in how he deals with mild set-backs, boredom, and minor frustrations.

Today he really wasn’t interested in doing his work. The approach I’ve decided to take in light of reading his neurological approach is specifically centred on repetition and verbal recall, both short and long term. This means he’s having to get used to writing down more notes, often more than once, and has to try and do the exercises without my immediate help. I’ll only help him once he’s tried. There’s no pressure for him to get the answer right, he just has to remember or find the right information from his notes and use it to answer a series of questions.

He was fine with this at first but was soon to start rebelling. Since his accident, he hasn’t handled authority very well. Furthermore, his parents have (understandably) been very soft with him since the accident and regularly give him what he wants. When I refused to help him with some chemistry questions that he very clearly didn’t want to do, he started pushing me. I told him that that was no way to get what he wanted and I wasn’t going to budge. Eventually, he took my hand and started trying to bend my fingers back. I still said I wasn’t going to help until he tried it for himself. This continued with progressively more violent measures until he pulled a knife on me from his kitchen draw and then tried to suffocate me with a cushion. I told him to stop and that the attempted suffocation genuinely hurt. He lifted the cushion up, asked if I’d do his work, and when I said no he put it back down over my face. Thankfully, I managed to get him off of me.

He doesn't seem to understand why this is an issue and was laughing most of the time. I can't tell whether or not he was joking around. All I know for certain is that it genuinely hurt me and I was a bit frightened at the time.

I'm only tutoring him for another three days and his parents are family friends. I don't know whether I should tell anyone. I couldn't bring myself to tell my friends earlier because I feel ashamed. I don't want to tell my parents because it might make things awkward between our families. I don't want to tell his parents because I know they'll punish him severely and once it gets to that point he'll refuse to cooperate with me entirely. Instead, I've kept it quiet and said I won't tell his parents. I sort of used it as leverage to get him to finish his work. It's a handy threat to have up my sleeve.

I don't know what to do. I really don't. Any ideas?",15Jul2020,3

I just wanted someone to chat to about video games and stuff not someone who i feel like keeps trying to flirt with me and makes me feel uncomfortable with the constant not stop pressure of “being there for eachother”. 

As nice as he is I just find it unsettling how he talks with me. Don’t mean this in a nasty way at all though.

Is it weird to tell someone online you care about them so much, constantly reminding them you want the relationship to develop. It just feels so unnatural and I don’t know how to say this.

I don’t want to hurt his feelings because he doesn’t seem to have anybody. Something else I found odd was that he told me he was playing one of my favorite video games which he wouldn’t know unless he really searched my profile which is odd.

703,"Hello I am 18F currently studying a diploma in aeronautical engineering. I came into this diploma not intending on pursuing higher studies (university) and planned on going into the workforce right after.

I have never had proper goals and back in secondary school I never really had to work hard to get grades I was satisfied with and maybe at most, only with last minute mugging the day before.

However now that I am in the second year of my diploma, I suddenly have a career goal that I intend to achieve and it would require a university degree. Other factors had also then contributed to my desire to go to uni such as my sudden interest in business.

The problem is that since I came to my tertiary diploma education without the intention of going to uni, I had no motivation and drive to do well in school during my first year and combined with complacency from my secondary school where I thought didn't have to work hard to do well, my semester GPA dropped from 3.8 to 2.75 and my current overall is a 3.3.

Having this sudden goal of wanting and having to go to uni requires me at least a 3.65 GPA to enter the course that I want. 

Currently with covid and e-learning, I am struggling with the overwhelming load of projects and assignments that the lecturers have thrown at us and I did not do well in the first term. I am very worried about my GPA for this sem that it may go down to a 2.something and it would be extremely hard to bring it up again.

The main problem now may be the current situation where I have so many new concepts to understand for all my modules but my brain refuses to cooperate and I have been putting off doing my assignments, e-learning and projects for a while because I had just completed a really tough project a few days ago and I am very burnt out. 

I try to encourage myself everytime that if I don't study my grades are just going to plummet and everything I want would be out of reach. But I just can't seem to get my brain to start working. Ever since I came to this school my brain just refuses to understand concepts and I just refuse to put in any effort to study. I have tried to but it just doesn't work. Now that I finished my first year with almost no knowledge (first year was just fundamentals math and physics etc which is everything i hate, probably why i refuse to take in information) my second yearr is just a complete mess and I do not know how to act or what to do now that I want to go to university where I never thought I would ever want to.

It started with my relationships. I used to jump from one girl to the next, never building a bond. Never opening up about myself.  Any relationship I Have been in, it’s been extremely difficult to get into, I needed help from family and friends to get into the relationship. Once the relationship got going and we hit a difficult point my solution would always be to leave. When I was younger I thought it was just a phase and that’s what everyone else told me. 


Now that I’m older and wiser, I’ve come to realize it’s not okay and it is a problem. The commitment issues have spread to other faucets of my life now. I can’t commit to a religion, I’m struggling to commit to a career path (although I am forcing myself) etc.  



It’s also worsened in my relationships. All I do now is approach the girl, meet her, get her number and then the number sits. I somehow convince myself there’s a problem with her, then I move on and the cycle repeats.

I did message one person on Facebook marketplace shortly after when I saw a listing for a moving sale, asking if by chance they had any video games for sale. She quickly responded back, saying yes and no, that her husband had some but were still in the process of moving so it would not be at the moving sale. However, she inquired if I was interested and didn’t mind waiting and she would get back to me when her husband came across his collection of games.

708,"I’m  not usually one to ask the Internet for advice, but I thought I should give it a shot. I’m also on mobile so sorry if my formating is wonky. 

Onto a little backstory. 

I had my first child at 17 years old. I’m no longer with her birth father, but I am happily married to someone who treats my daughter like she is his own and my daughter thinks of him as her father. Well of course, when I had my daughter I was very young. I was never the type to go out and party or sneak out, I got average grades, I graduated high school. The only thing I did that was “bad” was get pregnant in high school. I did rely on my mom and the rest of my family about how to be a mom and how to raise a child because I was a child myself. 

Fast forward 5 years, I’m 22, I have a stable job with benefits, I live on my own, I’m married, etc. I still am not the one to go out and party every weekend and I doubt I ever will be. I’m definitely a homebody. My husband and I are trying to have another baby and have told family that we are trying. His family is very excited and can’t wait for us to have a baby. My family on the other hand, are not very supportive at all. Everytime I mention wanting another baby, my family gives me the look of disappointment followed with “oh are you sure? You can’t handle another baby. You don’t know what you’re getting yourself into.” My mom even tells me “you better not be having another kid” 

I’m not pregnant yet, but we are trying. I’m worried that when I do get pregnant and it’s time to tell everyone, my family is not going to be happy. I’m scared they aren’t gonna have anything positive to say  and they are just going to be giving off negative and passive aggressive energy the whole time and that’s not what I want or need. I’m not asking that they support me 100% because everyone is entitled to their opinion and I’m not expecting them to have baby clothes already picked out or my baby shower planned. I’m just asking that they have some faith in me. I really don’t know what I’m going to do, I’m not even pregnant and I’m so stressed about this already, I don’t know how stressed I’m going to be when I’m actually pregnant. 

*sidenote* my family’s opinion has nothing to do with the state of the world right now. They have told me they don’t want me having anymore kids, before anyone ever thought a pandemic was going to happen in this century. 

*sidenote to the sidenote* before anyone says I shouldn’t have a kid because a pandemic is happening, just stop before you start. I’m only getting older and so is my daughter and I don’t want my kids to have a massive age gap. Also, I’m not an idiot.

Seeing as he’s not from the area the spot we were heading to he missed as he took a wrong turn and we ended up in the middle of no where and just parked up. I expected a huge makeout session but it was a lot more than that...

Before we even met up I said to him if he’s looking for a hookup or anything sexual I’m not that type of girl as everyone knows me where I’m from and unfortunately see’s me as some sort of “sex symbol” which no matter how many boys I turn down I can’t shake the label (I wish I was making that up), he said it’s okay and of course met me anyway. While we were kissing he was trying to put his hand down my underwear and I moved his hand away and after some talking and persisting I eventually obliged. Then it moved onto him not letting me pull my leggings back up and he climbed on top of me and kept trying to put his penis inside of me. I kept saying no and grabbing him down there to get him away from my private area, I even explained I’m not on birth control but his answer was that he would pay for the morning after pill... sigh. He tried to put it in me a few times and I kept saying no again and again, now of course being in the middle of no where with an army boy who can very obviously power me, even though I didn’t want to, I offered to perform oral sex on him. I in no way wanted to, but as I said being as we were alone with no one around for probably miles I felt like it was my only way of not having him inside me and risking getting pregnant as the morning after pill isn’t 100% and he could of just got angry and done anything to me.

I’m appreciative of this, but we really didn’t know each other well enough at the time (I know, so stupid). Basically, I now have two options. 

1. Move back in with my mom. 
2. Move in with a stranger roommate. 

I have about 32k saved up and I really want to purchase a small house or condo. The issue is that I only make about 2k per month so I would be living paycheque to paycheque, maybe even going into debt if something breaks.  This just isn’t that smart. 

I also know that if I move in with a roommate it will cost me minimum $1000 per month in living expenses, leaving me with nothing left over to buy a house for a longggg time. 

I know the obvious answer would be to move in with my mom, but I don’t know if she will let me. And I just don’t know how I will be able to handle that psychologically. She’s horrible.

717,"My childhood had always been very rough due to the toxic and abusive relationship my mom and dad have together. I’m without a doubt, 100% will be cutting all contact with my father when I finally am able to leave home but that leaves my mother.

I would describe my mother as the lesser of two evils between my mom and dad but there are still several things she’s done to me that I’m unable to move past. The earliest memory that I have is when I was younger than 12 years old, I was sexually abused by a family member that was a few years older than me.

Instead of her defending me or doing anything to try and comfort me, my mother hit me and basically blamed me for what happened instead. I don’t remember her ever saying anything at all to my abuser. Even years after it had happened I overheard my mother saying she still doesn’t believe I was punished enough for it.

There have been several instances before and after that where my mother would be very rough and violent with me whenever I made mistakes when I was younger. She’d yell at me and would tell me she didn’t care that she made me cry.

She’d tell me that I acted like my father, who is a very abusive and mean person, and wouldn’t care that it hurt my feelings when she said that. I have an older brother and I’ve never seen her react the same ways she’s had to me when he did something wrong so I believe it’s obvious who her favorite is.

In recent years, she doesn’t hit me anymore but she still continues to say mean things to me with no regard for my feelings. If I were to talk to her about racial issues, she’d go on tangents about people of other races and say very racists things. I feel like she might even be proud of being racist and for the things she says that are highly offensive.

She always belittles me when we have disagreements by using her age as a way to prove her point, i.e. saying things like “well I’ve been alive way longer than you have” and she has a very entitled parent mindset, for example, she believes parents have the right to see their grandchildren regardless of the relationship between them and their children.

I won’t ignore the fact that there have been good times and moments we’ve shared together. She was always there for me when my father wasn’t, which is most of the time, but it’s becoming harder and harder to overlook the bad that comes with being around her.

I’m going off to college this year and am unable to move out for a multitude of reasons but so far my plan is to maintain a relationship the best way I can with my mother since I’m still dependant on her but once I’m able to leave, I want to cut all ties with her and never have anything to do with her ever again.

Is this the right decision?

**TL;DR:** The relationship my mother and I have is less than ideal and I’m getting tired of putting up with her. Once I’m able to leave I think it would be best for me to cut off all contact with her but I’m unsure if it’s the right decision.",15Jul2020,1

720,"So, I (20F) am currently in college and living with my father(49M) and sister (24F). I was supposed to move out of state to live with my partner(27M) a couple months ago, but due to how crazy the world has been, my boyfriend getting COVID, and my own health issues, it just didn’t work out. I signed up for another semester at my current college and am now setting up to go to his state in the spring. 

The plan was for me to stay at my dad’s for the semester to save up money. Unfortunately, I just can’t do it. I can’t. My car broke down, and my dad tried to bully me into buying a new car, but not putting my name on it. His name would be the only one on it, he would keep it when I left, and I would just give him all the money I have to buy it. When I said no, he freaked out, threw threats about making me pay rent (which we have talked about before, but I told him that if I paid rent he would have to treat me like an adult; I wouldn’t pay to live there AND be forced to follow his rules) and things of that nature. He then backed off, just to get the car and tell me that he would take the keys if I “didn’t do everything he told me to” or “went anywhere he didn’t approve of”. It was the final straw. A lot has been building up, but I cracked. I called my friend (19F) sobbing, just needing to let it out, and she offered to let me move in. She has a small guest house behind her family’s home, and I’ve been a “part of the family” since forth grade, so her and her whole family not only are OK with, but WANT me to move in. Since then, I’ve set up to move in. All that’s needed now is to pack everything, take care of some small renovations in the house, and move in. It’s normal for me, a grown woman, to move in with a friend. So many people have. But I’m terrified.

Before I proceed with talking about why I’m scared, let me explain some of the things my dad has done to me that are both pushing me to leave as fast as possible as well as making me terrified to tell him:

-He makes me feel like an object. From telling me what a “woman’s place is” within his religion (strict baptist preacher) to making comments about my clothes either being too revealing or not “showing off my figure” enough, I just feel... Dirty. I feel dirty, small, and dehumanized. I get mad at him, and I have fought back over it many times, but I’m a survivor of sexual assault (family friend, then a classmate). Just being around him pushes me back into a horrible headspace, especially since he has always been the “well what was the woman wearing” type when the topic of sexual assault came up. He is so over sexualized, and I’ve caught him checking me out before. He freaked out when he came in contact with my bare skin, he’s commented on my breasts, and he’s been overly fixated on whether or not I’m a “pure virgin” (spoiler: I’m not, but I sure as hell cant tell him that. He doesn’t even know I was assaulted; due to his attitude on things, I blamed myself for what happened for years and now I don’t trust him enough to confide in him). 

-He controls my every move. I wanna see a friend? Ask before. Wanna spend the night somewhere? Hell no. Use bad language/ substitute words, wear “edgy clothes”, or go out out in a crop top? That’s against the rules. Wanna go to the store? I have to sit there and rehearse a good reason to go. I memorize what I bought, or prices of things, so that if I have to buy a “luxury item” (like razors or hair conditioner) I can claim I spent the money on something else so that he won’t badger me about “wasting money”. (I don’t spend my own money on this because if I do and he finds out he freaks out because I’m not spending my money on things to help the family with or he will use my little purchases to have a fit about how I should pay for more things myself, when I’m only not doing it so that I can save up to leave). He told me that he didn’t “accept” my boyfriend because he wasn’t a Christian, and flat out told me that my partner and I aren’t dating, despite us having been together for over a year. He gets mad when I talk to my mom. I got pet rats, and he told me that I could have them “for now” but made me swear that I could bring them somewhere if I needed to “in case he thought I was wasting too much time/money on them”. (If he has an issue, I’m just bringing them to my friend’s place early.)

-He belittles my health issues. I have fibromyalgia, tachycardia, and a stomach condition. Because of that, I don’t feel my best all the time. There are a lot of times that, aside from things that are absolutely mandatory, I just need to stay in bed and rest. There are times when I can’t just go out and be social and act like everything is fine. Yet, every time my conditions flare up, he acts as though I’m being dramatic. I didn’t want to go to a family outing because my body hurt really really badly, and I needed to take it easy. He softly and “lovingly” told me how much everyone would be offended, how selfish it would make me look, how rude I was being, and how I just needed to “suck it up”. When I refused to go to his Masonic meeting because I was throwing up, he accused me of forcing myself to puke so I could stay home. He even neglects my medicine at times. When my car was broken down, he just didn’t pick up my heart medicine for several days; he didn’t pick it up until I almost passed out when helping my grandmother. Even then, he accused me of “playing it up for attention”. With my mental health conditions (bipolar depression and PTSD), he just claims that I don’t actually have them.

-Forces me to go to church and shames me for my sexuality. I’m a Buddhist. I am also pansexual, and very open about being more liberal. He forces me to go to sermons where he talks about how “CHRISTIAN lives matter” and things of that nature, and then he berates me for getting upset about it. 

-Any time I try to mention one day moving out, he immediately does all he can to cut me down. “I’m lazy, I’m weak, I’m immature, I can’t make it without him.” He even told me that he “wouldn’t be okay with me moving out until I was getting married to a man he chose”. It makes me sick.

And all of these things should just solidify me going, and they do. They should just make me mad, which they also do. But they also make me terrified. He doesn’t usually scream and shout, he’s too clever for that. He uses his kindest voice and tone to tell me how others might think I’m a whore, how I’m inept, how I’m willfully weak. I know logically I can function on my own, but I’m also terrified. Part of me is so scared that I’ve written him off as crazy, cruel, and manipulative when really he was right all along. I know what he doesn’t isn’t normal. I’ve asked my closest friends, my partner, and my mom about it too many times to count to ensure I’m not just crazy. He’s just so good at planting seeds of doubt. 

Not only that, I’m scared of what he’ll do. When my mom divorced him, he told everyone she was a serial cheater, a whore, and an abusive mother. He made her own family hate her. Most of her friends hated her. She wasn’t even invited to her grandfather’s funeral. I love my grandmother (his mother) and my cousins, and I’m so scared he’ll paint me as an evil monster and that they’ll hate me. Not only that, he acts irrational when he thinks he has nothing to lose. When I moved to my mom’s for a time, he almost slapped me, but backed off when he realized he wouldn’t ever see me again if he did. Now he doesn’t have to worry about a custody battle. The most he has to worry about is his reputation. 

I’ve planned it thoroughly, over and over and over again. My plan is to slowly move my things into the guest house, move my rats there the morning I plan to leave (when he’s at work), and then my best friend (the one I’m moving in with) will come with me to talk to my dad. I’ll leave with her. I already have 4,000$ saved up, and in the fall, I’ll be getting another $1,900 from my college. My boyfriend already has a car for me, he just needs to give it to me. I won’t tell my dad the address of the house, and I’ll be leaving everything that he is actively paying for (my phone) behind. I don’t want anything to tie me to him. I know I’ve got a solid plan, but when I think about the talk with him, I feel like I can’t breath. How can I manage this anxiety? Do I sound crazy, or is this a solid plan? What should I work on? If you have any questions, ask away. 

TL;DR: I’m scared to leave my abusive father’s home, and I grapple with wondering if he really is abusive or if I’m just too sensitive and he’s right about everything. I want some tips on how to manage my anxiety over leaving, as well as some outsider perspective.",15Jul2020,1
721,"English is not my first language, so first of all, I’m sorry for any confusing sentences I might write.

724," It's a long one bois so you might wanna sit back. 

Some background information: We are all in the same year of university and I live with Charles, Brian, and Emma. Kevin dates Brian's brother.

Tldr: I didn't like Charles's personality and started distancing myself from him (which also meant distancing myself from Brian and Emma as they were pretty much together all the time), Charles and Brian thought other people in friend group were being off with them as well. Kevin and Diana have a talk with Charles and decide to move on and no hard feelings. Brian finds out his brother and the other people in friend group had played a game together and since he was still angry that he didn't get an apology tells his brother that he didn't like him interacting with his ""past friends"". His brother is on Brian's side and tells Kevin to choose him over his friends and Kevin breaks up with him.

It began with me starting to feel uncomfortable around Charles, not because he did anything wrong per say but because I began to personally find him annoying. Since him, Brian and me were good friends the year before it was understandable that he would try and make conversations and such and try to hang out but I didn't want to do that with him and I knew saying that outright would hurt his feelings so I just said I wanted to study more (which wasn't even a lie technically) and other excuses like that. I did try and keep the conversations they started going and hangout with them now and then. He did ask me at one point if something had happened and if anything was wrong and that he wished we could all hang out like old times. But at this point I didn't want drama and I had coursework and exams to study for so I gave him the same excuse (too much work, which was true). A thing to note is that never tried to stop being friends with them, just tried to distance myself. Also a thing to note is that Charles didn't do anything wrong, it's just that everything he did annoyed me, and I knew that was my problem but that was also the reason why I didn't say anything when he asked if anything was wrong, I felt he wouldn't have taken it well.

There is also ""Kevin"" and ""Diana"" and friend A. to keep things short I will refer to them as group 2 and the people I live with as group 1. Group 1 and 2 was initially the same friend group, but started falling apart throughout the year until it became essentially 2 separate groups. I later found out the reason (or one of the reasons at least) Brian and Charles started to separate themselves was because they thought group 2 (mainly Kevin and Diana) had ""just started being off"" with them for no reason. Like not saying hi when they passed each other in class and corridors (just a side note, this is about Kevin and he quite literally often did that to everyone) and thinking that group 2 had been hanging out without them and trying to exclude them. My being off with Charles didn't help in this, in fact all this happened after I tried to distance myself from him. I also found out that Charles thought Kevin had ""stolen (me) from him"" because I became closer to Kevin. During this period Charles would try his best ignore us (even when one of us did call out to him or say hi), until he physically couldn't and would force out a smile.

Kevin and Diana had invited group 1 to a new year's dinner/get together, and none of them went. Kevin decided to confront Charles about it after because at this point group 2 knew that Charles had a problem with us. He did it over text and Charles told him there wasn't anything between them, when Kevin tried again, but with a bit more force Charles replied angrily then blocked him (also later found out that it was probably because Charles didn't like Kevin's tone, the way he said things and the specific words he used (e.g. ""this is childish"")). Kevin tried to confront Charles in person after this asking if they could talk and Charles reply was ""do we have to"". long story short they did talk and decided to move on with no hard feelings but not stay friends. An important thing to note is that Charles didn't particularly like Kevin from the beginning and had thought Kevin had revealed a personal secret to Emma when he told him not to. Charles found this out from Emma and Kevin had told him during the talk that he didn't know how Emma found out this secret but he wasn't the one who told her. I take Kevin's side on this as I know of one other lie Emma has told group 1 and it involves me.

Diana went through as similar thing as Kevin with Charles and it ended in a similar way. Only big difference is that she was actively not saying hi to Charles as she said he had a habit of doing the same even when he knew they were there (which is true as far as I know, although he mainly did this when he was in a bad mood which he was in somewhat often).

After all this, I thought the drama was over. Well, fast forward a couple months, Kevin and Brian's brother had broken up and got back together during this time. When Brian found out that his brother and group 2 had played an online game together, he told him that he ""wasn't comfortable with (his brother) hanging out with people (he) wasn't on speaking terms with"" and that he can't be around Kevin while he's around group 2 (I'm included in this). He was basically angry that nobody had given him an apology, Kevin told him he didn't know that he had been angry (nobody in group 2 did) and sorry. But Brian thought this apology came too late and didn't accept it. So his brother tells Kevin that he needs to stop hanging out with his friends because Brian didn't want him interacting with group 2, Kevin asks for how long and Brian says something along the lines of a couple weeks or months, and that he would talk with Charles about it when that time came and see if he was still angry and basically decide if Kevin could talk to his friends or not. His brother was completely on Brian's side. Needless to say Kevin broke up with him.

Thoughts on this whole situation? I feel like all this was kinda my fault and it could have been avoided if I just told Charles from the start out right that I was being more distant because I didn't like him I don't know. I would also like advice on what I could have done better or what I've done wrong because I keep thinking that all this could have been avoided and everyone could have grown further apart normally without it turning into this train wreck.",15Jul2020,0
725,"We both went to a weekend school so we knew each other from the ages of around 8-12 I think? I have a pretty bad memory so those years might not be completely accurate. Anyway, we got along pretty well since we were both on the quieter side. At the end of the last year that we were in contact she left the school and that's pretty much the last I saw of her.

During lockdown I randomly wondered what she was up to so I looked her up on Facebook and decided to friend her. I'm gonna say upfront that I'm not looking for a relationship with her; I just thought it'd be cool to have someone to chat and game with. I messaged her, she seemed pretty stoked to talk, and we arranged a meetup during summer.

Then, lockdown came into effect. I had a few drinking video calls with people from uni, and once they started getting stale we did one where I added a friend I still talk to. I messaged the original friend if she wanted to join and she yes, and again seemed enthusiastic. In the end, she didn't turn up, but messaged me to tell me that she got caught up gaming with other friends so I wasn't fussed. A few more video calls happened with uni friends and I did message her a few more times whilst drunk just to chat but not much happened, we just talked about uni and lockdown.

Ok, this is where the ghosting happens. I messaged her and asked if she wanted just to have a voice call some time to catch up, especially since it looked like it'd be hard to meet up over the summer. She sent me her discord and we scheduled a time. On the day, I sent the request on discord and I remember that she basically accepted instantly. I had chores around the house though, so I didn't immediately call. Once I was done, I messaged her to ask if she was free and I've been ghosted since, haven't even been getting read receipts or anything. I messaged one more time a few days later to ask if she was good but since that also got ignored I figured I'd take the hint.

I'm just really confused about what's happened, and if I've done anything weird or come on too strong? For context, I've got depression (diagnosed) and I'm pretty sure I've got anxiety as well, so this was all super nerve-wracking for me. I showed a few friends the messages just for advice and to psyche myself up and they all said that everything was good. The whole situation's just messing with my anxiety and self esteem, especially since I'll often see her online on discord since I don't have that many people on there which just reminds me of the whole thing.

TL;DR - Messaged childhood friend, stuff seemed to be going well, suddenly got ghosted, want to know what I did wrong since it's affecting my mental health",15Jul2020,1

728,"To preface this I’m going to say that I have severe anxiety and haven’t had treatment for it since March of 2019. I was on meds in 2018 that completely hindered my judgement, and everything in 2018 is now a blur. I can only get a feel for the kinda stuff I said from screenshots I took that I am looking back at now. 

So basically, the title says it all. In 2018 I was 14 years old, and absolutely completely reckless with what I did online, specifically Snapchat. I would say racial slurs, weird sexual stuff, and basically anything offensive, just because I wanted to get a reaction out of people. I’m looking back at it now and it is truly awful, life-ruining stuff. Most of this would take place in group chats I made filled with a mix of people (people from school, people I met online, at amusement parks, etc). I don’t believe I was actually racist back then and definitely am not now. Of course, all of these messages have been saved in the chats, either by myself or others. A big problem is that I deleted my account in June of 2018 and made a new one. So all the stuff I said before June I can definitely never take back and it will be saved on all these other peoples devices forever. (If you don’t know, when you delete a Snapchat account, saved messages do not delete.) I continued to say offensive stuff until about October of 2018. I’ve left most of the group chats by now anyway, so I cant get back into them and delete offensive stuff that I said, and once again, that stuff will be on other people devices forever. There is 2 group chats probably out of dozens from that time that I’m still in, and I can go back and delete offensive stuff, but everyone in that chat will be notified of it and I don’t really want to bring it to their attention. Also I can add some people back from this time period and unsave offensive stuff I said to them privately, but again, that will raise their attention. 

I just feel super trapped, and I know this will hang over my head for the rest of my life. I can’t escape who I used to be, as it is now entirely in the hands of others, most of whom I haven’t contacted in over a year. I would give my life just to go back and not do all that stuff.

730,"So a couple of years ago, in my French class, I learned that they were planning a trip, to Paris and other places, for this year. I asked my parents if I could go and after a little bit they decided I could go. I really wanted my mom to go as I didn’t really know anyone on the trip and I just feel better around her. Unfortunately because of the virus the trip was moved back a year. Now I really want to convince her to go. Beforehand when I asked her to go for the scheduled trip she said it cost too much and she doesn’t want to be on a plane for that amount of hours. I thought about it and really think she should go, she deserves a trip like this, it would be worth the time and money. Lately I have been having these thoughts that can do more with my life. I’ve lived in Louisiana my whole life and never got to experience other cultures out of vacation. I’ve never been out of the US. I feel with my mom she could be like this too. She’s been to Canada, and will be going within a few years for my mom and dads anniversary, along with Hawaii but never to Europe. She sits at her desk on her laptop on calls all day. I feel she could do more with her life too. I’m just asking for advice on how to approach me asking her.

739,"Hi subreddit Advice!

I've been having an issue lately and my friend suggested I go on this subreddit to ask for advice.

So Advice, how do I reduce or stop my husband's snoring?

Kinda long explanation but I feel it will help.

**For those who don't wanna read,**  **TLDR: My husband's snoring keeps waking me up in the middle of the night and because of this im only sleeping 2-3 hours each night. Advice?**

My husband and I have been together for 4 years and living together for 3 years. When my husband and I first moved in together after 6 months of dating (2017) I found out he snores pretty loudly. I mean like screamo death metal band snoring. However, I am a pretty heavy sleeper so it was never an issue. We would go to bed, as my husband jokes I go into a coma, and don't wake up once. Fast forward to 2019 I found out I was pregnant and we had our amazing son who is now one. During my pregnancy, I started becoming a light sleeper and my husband's snoring used to wake me up. However, I would wake him and tell him to roll on his stomach. My husband would, snoring stopped enough for me to go into REM sleep, and then I would fall into a deep sleep. We had my son and we followed the same wake up routine and everything would be fine. This wasn't every night it would happen one night in a frequency of 3 weeks. I finally started getting my heavy sleeper tendencies back with the exception of waking from my son's cries from the monitor and all was right in the sleep world. 

Fast forward again to now and we found out on Jan 2020 that we are pregnant with our second child who is a girl. Of course we are over the moon and can't wait for our new addition. However, this second pregnancy has been a lot tougher on me which results in me being pretty much exhausted 90% of the time.  I started becoming a very light sleeper and my husband's snoring for the past two weeks now have been waking me up every night. We go to bed, fall asleep, and I wake up at 2 am to my husband's snoring. I did what we did with our first pregnancy by telling him to roll on his stomach which he does but 30 minutes later he is back to snoring. I feel guilty waking him up because he has been working A LOT of hours due to the virus, my work hours were reduced due to said virus, and we have a second child on the way so we are trying to save more money. Due to this, he is so tired now that when I wake him up in his sleep he says he will roll over and never does or denies his snoring. 

So now, i've been sleeping on the couch because im afraid his snoring will wake my son and my brother who lives with us if he sleeps on the couch. (We live in a one story house). However, the couch is uncomfortable and im only getting 2-3 hours of sleep due to this because its hard finding a comfy spot with a big belly. It kinda a thin couch so not a lot of room to spread out. My husband the next day always feels super guilty but I just brush it off because again he is working very long hours from Wed-Sat in the scorching Texas heat. (He works in the field in cable.) However, these nights with only 2-3 hours of sleep is effecting me in a very negative way. Dozing off at my work desk, being snappy with other people, and napping during the day which delays me going to bed even further.

We have tried removing pillows that my husband sleeps on, breathe right strips, flatter pillows, and even me wearing headphones/ear plugs but to no avail. I love my husband very much and miss sleeping beside him. Plus i very much miss my comfy soft cold bed.

So Advice subreddit any help to throw this pregnant momma her way?

**MEDICAL NOTE**: Sleep apena, diabetes, and obesity does run in my husband's family. My husband's snoring is significantly worse when he drinks. My husband is 27m.

Any advice is much appreciated!

**EDIT:** I am a 24f who is 26 weeks pregnant.

741,"I have had this thing in my head for quite a while now.

Some years ago, while browsing through xhamster, I came across a picture of my girlfriend that someone had taken of her when she was topless on a beach. She looked very young – younger than when we first met. At first I could not believe my eyes – like what is the chance that this actually happens – that you find somebody that you know there, and that person even being your partner! My thoughts were racing and I was not sure what to make of it. I had this feeling of disappointment kind of that a secret was being revealed and that the view that I thought only had access to was literally open to the public. On the other hand, I was kind of thrilled by the thought that thousands of users and maybe even people I or we know might have seen her.

I started researching where this pic came from and at first I thought I could find out who put it on the platform and talk to the person. Boy was I wrong. The pic was actually spread across several sites, including reddit, imagefap and some other sites. And that for years. Eventually I kind of found a source, the picture packed with two other pictures in high resolution in a compilation of beach candid pics in a well-known forum. One of the pics even showed her together with her mother, both being topless.

Since then, I have been struggling whether to tell her what I found – but I have not dared yet due to two reasons: 1) I don’t want to tell her that I am browsing random porn sites, like in order to make such chance hit it would require very long and intense browsing, and 2) I am not sure if she would like the fact that she is being exposed in that way.

Now my question: what would you suggest I should do? Tell her and risk negative emotions, or keep quiet and live on with my secret.",15Jul2020,3
742,"As much as I’ve grown throughout the years and have gotten a more mature way of thinking beyond my years. I know my traumatic past has deeply affected me to my core, and only now am I starting to realize how much it really does take affect in a negative way. It scares me knowing that I cling on so tightly to what little I could call “good” in my childhood. My boyfriend and I got into a bit of a scuffle over a character in a game that brought back good childhood memories of mine. I have an emotional attachment to it despite the little time I had spent with it, so it’s easy to understand why my boyfriend didn’t completely understand why I got so upset. I feel like I’ve grown a lot due to the experiences I’ve went through but a lot of the time when I’m speaking about things more maturely it feels like I’m just saying what other people want to hear from me or whatever sounds best in terms of intellect instead of what I actually feel. As the title may suggest, almost like I’m masking my past with a fake idealized image I have of myself to present to others. At times it feels suffocating because my parents don’t understand, their culture and egos are too strong for them to realize that I do still struggle with a lot of trauma and issues and it’s hard to face on my own. I ended therapy recently after four years not because I was finally at a stable point in my life or anything, simply because I had reached a plateau. I know my past still deeply affects me because whenever I think about it, it makes me want to cry. It’s been four years and yet only now am I truly seeing how deeply I’ve been affected, they’re scars on my back that will always be there but nobody can see them and I’ve barely started paying attention now.

I belong to a very orthodox family with my mother believing in quite traditional ways. A girl smoking is frowned upon and is equal to disownment in my family. Recently due to the pressure of my Master's degree final year being quite high, I used to be irritated all the times. I had an argument with my mother and then I talked about my mental health issues. She was shocked at first more shocked as to how dare I go to a doctor and take meds without letting her know. She guilt-tripped me into stopping my medications.   
It made things worse. everything was out of my control. I started to smoke regularly and sneak in alcohol at times and consume them at night to numb out everything. Today, while I was smoking my mother, crept behind me to see what I was doing and she was furious. she went nuts for my smoking and how she regrets having me. She wouldn't even talk to me now and is on the verge of disowning me. What should I do? I love my mother. I know I am a disappointment but I cannot see her like this.

745,"So, for context, I'm 21 and my brother is 11.

Just before christmas last year, I sold my ps4 because I barely played it, and when I did, it would constantly overheat (a problem I didn't have until I was forced to move rooms, but that's a story for another day) and so if I wanted to play video games, I'd use my stepdads ps4 in the living room, if it was free. Me and my brother would argue over it regularly because he'd always get priority over it from my parents. (Yes, I know, a 21 year old arguing with an 11 year old. Lockdown's been difficult, cut me some slack) This led to me buying a new ps4 last month. I should also point out that both me selling my old ps4 and buying a new one were met with scepticism from my parents, despite me explaining my reasons multiple times. I've gotten back into video games again since, mostly Rocket League and Warzone, games I exclusively play with friends, and I've begun to notice that whenever my brother is in the living room playing Gang Beasts with his friends, it causes an unplayable amount of lag on my end. It's only Gang Beasts. I don't lag if he plays GTA, or Minecraft, or anything else. It's specifically just that one game.

748,"My sister has been with her husband 20 years since they were both 16. He's the only boyfriend she ever had and he broke her down early telling her that no one else would date her because she was too fat. He got her pregnant in college, forcing her to drop-out and they got married. 

He's done stuff for a long time but this weekend, my family, my sister's, and my parents all stayed at a cabin for the weekend. At one point he told his 10-y/o daughter to ""Go get the \[foster\] baby"" so he could be with her in the hot tub. My niece did as she was told, but my sister informed her the baby was freshly bathed and in PJs. When my niece told him that, he changed his countenance, menacingly cackled, then said ""Maybe you didn't hear me right go *get* the baby"". My niece went back inside and something in the unspoken way he said it made both my niece and sister know they couldn't say no, so she brought out the 1 y/o and he put her in the hot tub with him. 

At another point, we were in two separate cars, my family and everyone else. We were parking and apparently there was a disagreement between my BIL and father. The gist is that he told my dad, ""if you wanted to decide where to park you should have driven your own fucking self""... he got out of the truck and began walking away with my mother on his heels as he yelled and swore at her... somehow she got him back in the truck and it was just him and my dad... when my dad got out his soul was gone and he wasn't the same the rest of the trip. When it was just him and my wife he told her that my BIL threatened to not let my parents see their grandchildren ever again. My BIL also said the first thing he's going to do when they adopt the foster is ""beat her bottom raw"" - a fucking 1-yr old

My BIL was fired from being a jailer because he abused an inmate, he failed the police academy psych evaluation, and can't hold a job. He consistently calls me a woman because I don't do car stuff and I don't spank and hardly ever yell at my kids. He is intimidatingly large, knows police hand-to-hand maneuvers because he has a hard-on for police, and he owns scores of guns. He threatened his own father and mother two Christmases ago and his father (former sheriff) pulled a gun on him. They haven't spoken since and hasn't let them see their grandchildren. He's also threatened to take the kids and run before from my parents despite living in their house rent free the first five years of their marriage.

I was talking all this through with a female co-worker and she suggested I seek help. My fear is that because they live in a small town and he has such a hardon for the police officers, no one will believe that there's anything wrong... I mean the asshole put on enough of an act to qualify for a foster. On the flip-side, I'm scared that any sign of threatening the foster or my sister and the kids leaving will unleash his full psycho and they'll end up dead. What the fuck do I do?",15Jul2020,1
749,"I have a friend who’s gotten very stringent with their time. They insist that we’re good friends despite never initiating any hangouts. I sometimes try to reach out to them but they’re always saying “maybe in the future!”.

I don’t doubt that they see me as a good friend  because they’re very friendly every time we run into each other. 

However, I’m the type of person who needs at least a constant interaction to maintain that camaraderie. I’m very bad at socializing. I find that the friendship bond fades and I have a hard time picking up where we left off. 

Last week we met up for the first time in almost a year (I initiated it) and I had a very tough time acting friendly. In fact, I think I was a bit cold but I couldn’t help it as I’ve barely interacted with them in a year. It almost felt like meeting up with a stranger.

Is there even a way to speak up publicly WITHOUT virtue signaling? 

I’ve read other articles that talk about virtue signaling in attempt to educate myself and it’s a mixed bag. Some said virtue signaling is inherent and human nature and it’s impossible to not virtue signal in some way, no matter how genuine the outrage. Some articles said it’s not even a real thing and accusing others of virtue signaling distracts from the real issues being discussed. Which is exactly why I came here!

753,"I feel a little context is necessary to start in this situation. My freshman year of highschool I was on the wrestling team. Even though I was the smallest guy on the team, 105 pounds   5 foot nothing, I had some anger issues (Napoleon complex to say the least) anyways, there was another guy let's say his name was Mark who was a senior in the team he was a good foot taller and probably a hundred pounds heavier at the time. I would mess with Mark during practice by tripping/tackling him and never really thought much of it at the time. Fast forward 8 years (I'm out of college now) and was at a retail store with my dad which Mark worked at. Mark was checking us out and my dad recognized him from the team and asked how he was doing and he said to my dad right in front of me ""you know your son used to bully me in highschool"". As you can imagine this created an extremely awkward situation. My dad and I talked for it for a bit and how I'm a completely different person now. I thought I should just ignore it as I didn't want to approach him at work and apologize and make him uncomfortable. Fast forward another year from that to present day and my younger brother visited the store with his gf where Mark still worked and recognized him as being my brother. Mark proceeded to tell my brother and his gf stories of how I bullied him seemingly out of nowhere. It bothers me that I had such an affect on someone I barely remember that he feels the need to bring it up everytime someone in my family enters the store and I'm not sure what to do.

TLDR: I bullied someone 9 years ago and they are still obviously hurting from it and holding a grudge. We're both adults now and I'm not sure how/if I should apologize to this guy or if it would just make things worse for him.

So much like the title says, I've recently started to notice I have a bad tendency to feel bad about everything, and I guess it boils down to overthinking, and it applies to everything. 

Each time I go to order food I feel bad ""because it could have been cheaper"" (even although I can afford it, and eat out pretty rarely anyways). 

Each time I floor my car, for the occasional fun, I feel bad afterwards because while I'm fully aware it wears down certain parts faster, it's always much worse than that (imagining parts will break left-right-and center, just because I briefly rev it up). 

And this applies, more or less, to every everyday activity. Like I mentioned, I've figured it's probably down to overthinking, but I'd enjoy life so much more if it weren't for that. Help is appreciated!",15Jul2020,1

I live an hour and a half away for school and I’ve come home twice for a total of two weeks so far in July. I’ve asked these two friends to hangout many times and I know they have had plenty of opportunities too. Now I don’t know if I’m just jealous, but another one of their good friends came home from another state and is here for a bit, and it seems like whenever that friend comes back and I’m just put on the back burner. I’ll give a few examples of how: 

I asked them hangout at like 8 or 9 PM one night and they said they had to work the next day at 12 or 1 PM, and usually they would more than likely hangout. It just didn’t make sense why they wouldn’t hangout when they work so much later the next day. 

Another example is one friend lives in the same town as me and she doesn’t even make time to hangout, even though we are 5 min apart from one another. The other friend is 30 min away but he is dating that friend here, but he always tells me that he needs to go home after work, even though he used to just come here and stay over at her place to hangout. It’s almost like he doesn’t try. 

Another example is that they will stay over at his place and I’ll ask them if they want to hangout, and when they are over there they make absolutely no effort either to try and hangout anymore. 

My last example is that I’m friends with one of their friends that lives two hours away from us and they went up their with their from the other state, and didn’t even think to invite me, fully knowing I am home from college for a week and doing nothing. 

What do you all think? I just feel like I’m being avoided lately because they never ask to hangout anymore, when I do they always have some excuse as to why they can’t, honestly I’m just tired of it. It make me sad that I’m putting in all this effort for nothing, then I feel guilty because I’m jealous. Please help and give me some good advice. I’ll try to reply when I can.

761,"My husband Rob (29M) and I (28F) are both white. We have been together for 6 years, married for 1 year and we are expecting our first baby. At the beginning of our relationship, I really got along well with Rob’s parents, my FIL (60ishM) and MIL (60ishF). They even let Rob and I live with them rent free for a year while we were saving for our house and FIL drove me to work for a month when I broke my ankle.

My conundrum… over the last year or two, my FIL has been getting progressively more and more racist. Or just braver with vocalizing his racist views. Either way, FIL will make a racist comment once or twice a month and MIL, Rob and I will all tell him he is wrong and racist. Except when FIL gets called out, his first reaction is to defend his views, which is basically just more racist bullshit.

A few examples of garbage FIL has said:

* Talked about calling his doctor’s office to ask for a white doctor.
* A few rants about how terrible the service at his favourite coffee shop has gotten since they started hiring immigrants.
* “Warned” us we will be the minorities in our neighbourhood unless we move soon

This has led to a huge increase in fights, mainly between myself and my FIL where I have literally told him how fucking awful he is being. Rob is not silent, either. He is actually extremely embarrassed by his father and has asked me not to tell anyone else, like my family or our friends, what my FIL says. Rob and I also told FIL that if he is ever racist around our child, we will not even bother arguing with him – we will pack our kid up and leave.

It just does not make any sense to me! FIL is not a stupid person. We live in a very multicultural metropolitan area with people of all backgrounds and colours. FIL actually grew up in the same city as my dad and my dad is his opposite (super left wing, open-minded, donated to all the BLM causes, etc.).

Plus, Rob’s two very best friends in the world, his co-best-men at or wedding, are two people of colour and they have all been best friends since they were children. These two guys have spent so much time with Rob and his family and it hurts me that my FIL actually thinks such terrible thoughts about them and their families. Rob’s best friends are such amazing people that I joke we should name the baby after them.

I am just so confused – FIL knows somebody will shut him down if he says something racist, yet he still does it??? What am I doing wrong? Does he enjoy getting yelled at?? I am getting to the end of my rope, which I told Rob yesterday. And why did all this racism start in the last year or so? I would never have lived with my in-laws for a year if my FIL was this vocal with his racist beliefs.

Something Rob and I agreed about recently is that we will not leave our child to his parents in our wills because we do not want them raised by his racist father. I know this would break my MIL’s heart, but part of me would love to tell him that so he understands how much he is fucking up by not changing his racist ways.

What can I do? I worry about becoming that daughter in law who causes trouble in the family (even though Rob has been very vocal himself against his dad). At the same time, my anti-racist beliefs outweigh by desire to be liked by my in-laws so I know these fights will continue.",15Jul2020,1

763,"I just turned 15 yesterday, and it got me thinking about my childhood and all my dreams and things that I wanted to experience that went unfulfilled. Like never experiencing a family day with my parents because they're to busy with their work. I also have never experienced a field trip my whole life, and it's probablly too late for me because field trips are banned in my country now. I feel left out because the people of my age that I know have all experienced those things in life and I haven't. I know I should be grateful for what I have, but I can't help but feel cheated because I never got to fulfill those dreams. I'd like advice on how to get rid of these thoughts.

764,"Hi All, apologies if this is not the right place to post. I recently purchased a car. A goal of mine was to buy a bucket and commute back and forth to work. However, I came across a steal of a car or that's what I tell myself  a 2015 Mazda 3 with 39k miles for 10k.

 Throughout  the entire day I was on a high and just loving it; however, now thats gone. As I laid my head to rest I couldn't help to feel this pit in my stomach of purchasing a car in mist of a crisis. A part of me feel like I don't deserve this car when I talked to  my selected friends each one of them disagree. They think Im a hard worker and one point out the fact that 10k is less than 20% of what I'm making rn. 

A little backstory after college due to an accident  I was carless  for about two years before buying this car. My gf was cool enough to let me used her car from time to time. Part of me not wanting a car was to pay off my student loans and the fear of getting back on the [road.](https://road.As) Also, I was going through a rough point in my life where literally I would spent nights not eating and living paycheck to paycheck making 600-700$ every other week. Fortunately, my circumstance changed since then my hard work paid off I was able to land a new job in the tech filed and have been aggressively saving as well as investing. I was able to pay off all my debt in 6 months.

So, I figured now was the perfect time to buy a car or so I thought. My commute from work is about 45 miles there and back which is why I thought this car was a good investment. Like I said Im feeling somewhat unease about this because part of me is thinking you just got yourself out of debt now you buy a car and put yourself back in debt? 

I live with my parents and help pay the bills, but I do plan on moving out by this time next year or the start of the year. Idk why but I'm so unsure despite feeling so sure prior to the purchase.  Should I return this car and just go back to my original plan in buying a bucket and save the rest? or Just stick with this car pay it off within a year ?",15Jul2020,1
765,"I'm a 21 year old guy and for about two years I was  tutoring a 28 year old woman. 

We had great chemistry and became friends after I stopped tutoring her. We have only met about 3 times in the last year, but we would text about every two months. I at all times saw this as a platonic friendship. 

She asked if I wanted to go to a bar or a cafe now that they are opening up. I thought nothing of it and looked forward to seeing my friend again.

A couple of days ago she asked me if an outfit was appropriate to wear for another event she was going to, and sent me a picture of her in a bra/top thing, which was very revealing.
I thought it was odd and felt that she was kinda hitting on me, by sending that picture.

Yesterday she drunk texted me and very explicitly told me that she wants to have sex with me.

This would all be great if it wasn't for the fact that she has a boyfriend.


But they have a pretty strange relationship.
He is 50-60 years old, and they don't seem very intimate. I kind of get more of a sugar dating vibe from them. He pays for everything (pretty sure she has no job), and she has told me about how he has cheated on her on different occasions.

What I want advice on is what do I do? I'm seeing her tomorrow and my friends disagree completely.

My one friend says that I should just go for it, and stop being  righteous. I'm not the one who is breaking any rules and I don't know if they are in an open relationship. She says their relationship is none of my business, and if I want to have sex with her I should go right ahead.

My other friend thinks it's wrong and that I shouldn't do it.


I think she is very attractive and I would be fine if they were in an open relationship. But I don't really know how to go about it, and where to draw the line, if any.

If you have any thoughts, advice or opinions please share, because I don't know what to do, and I would hate it, if I regretted and got a bad conscious.",15Jul2020,1

Now I'm realizing how she was right and I was not self-aware of the way I was coming across.

She literally told me to open my eyes and I glossed over it when really that was amazing advice.

768,"I was a promiscuous teen. I thought if people were going to say stuff about me anyways ,even when I wasn’t promiscuous, then I might as well do whatever the hell I want with who ever the hell I want. So I did. 

I thought I was owning my sexuality, of course that just meant I was a whore to everyone else. At first it didn’t bother me, I was very thick skinned and strong minded. The older I got, the more bad experiences I had (both related and unrelated). The worse my home life got(unrelatedly but took a role on my strong mindedness/thick skinned-ness). The more friends I lost(both related and unrelated). I found out so many of my “friends” would talk shit about me as soon as they weren’t in my presence anymore. I also found out that some of them who I had known for years and trusted would spread my person business to people that didn’t like me that they were friends with. There are some friendships were it was 100% my fault for things falling apart and I’m not upset with them for leaving/talking shit about me, I have no right to be. It got to the point were people started to mix up fact and fiction about what I did or didn’t do, even people I didn’t/don’t know spoke about it like they knew/know me. It started to affect me, far more often then it used to or should have. 

Over time it wore me down, don’t get me wrong I absolutely deserved some of it, I was a bitch sometimes and I did do a lot of shit for what I now know was selfish reasons. I was a shit friend at times and it was only a matter of time for that to all catch up to me. Problem is now this person who’s always sad, hating herself (more than usual), lonely anti social thing that can’t even make new friends without assuming they’re being nice as some cruel joke. I’ve been done with being promiscuous for a while now, and very rarely did I ever feel the want to do so again (it’s has happened though). 

I only every valued myself sexually/looks wise and even then I was harsh to myself constantly being self toxic calling myself  fat and ugly.  Even though I was mean to myself I sure as hell didn’t put up with anyone else being “mean” (bitchy) to me. 

I’m 22 now and people still talk about things I did back in high school WHEN I WAS SINGLE! Other adults just like me still go out of their way to make me uncomfortable or say shit about me, never to my face of course.. Most recently and the cause for me writing this is I just started a new job last week and already somebody who I DON’T KNOW every break makes a point to yell or mutter thot under their breath around me. At first I didn’t want to assume It was about me, so I ignored it but then it kept happening every day at break and I don’t recognize a single soul at that job, I have never seen any of those people EVER in my life ! 

This sucks because I’m not that strong “fuck you and go fuck your self” kind of person anymore, now I don’t like confrontation and like to avoid uncomfortable situations. I put on that brave idgaf who you are or what you have to say façade, or just “ignore” it most of the time. Whenever anything has happened throughout the year’s I “ignored” it but obviously it does bother me because IT’S BEEN YEARS! Like let it go and leave me the fuck alone! Or even if I did do whatever the fuck it is I did.. MIND YOUR BUSINESS! 

Yes I did it, it was years ago, can we move on please? I don’t even care if it was as recent as one to two years ago LET IT GO! If it didn’t personally affect you in anyway and you don’t even know me LEAVE ME ALONE! I hate myself because I brought all of this on. I can’t blame anybody else but myself, I thought I was empowering myself but turns out I was just setting myself up for social anxiety, fuck loads of self hate, and paranoia! I’m scared of turning back into that heartless, bitch, with a “fuck you I can do whatever I want” kind of attitude just to protect myself mentally. It hasn’t gone over well, but for whatever reason it’s my other defense mechanism besides letting it take over my life and shutting down mentally/emotionally completely which has lead to thoughts of... you knowww.... not living. 

I’m just so fed up at this point, these people have obviously shown that no matter how long ago it’s been they just won’t leave me alone no matter where I go or were I am. WE ARE AT WORK, wtf could you possibly gain from bringing up my past of that nature AT WORK!? If you don’t like me for what I did fine but at work? AT WORK!? I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE.. and they’re making a point to spread that shit at work already! I felt people talking about me the other day, I could have just been being paranoid.. but I don’t think so.",15Jul2020,2

770,"So, AP US history scores are out. I  (16F) got a 4, which considering I dun remember anything is great. However, the shitfest is actually my class. In normal AP classes, the students are very academically driven and stuff. 

Not with my class; there is a little more than 20 kids in my class and 1/3 to 1/2 of them SHOULD NOT be in an ap class. I am dead serious. That 1/2 have pretty low grades and dont put in the actual work for the class.

 (Ex: over spring break we were to take notes on an upcoming chapter. We had an open note pop quiz when we came back. There were many people who didnt take notes and laughed abt it in the hallway before class. They didnt have notes so they got terrible grades. One girl only put her name of the quiz and didnt do anything else bc she didnt even read the chapter) 

 There are so many resources aka prepreped notes online to print and practice tests but they do not take advantage of those. They get salty when some people in my class do well and have 90s or above in weekly scores. Ive maintained a B to an A in the class, and they'll ask people their grades. But when anybody who has higher than a 80 says so, they starting acting so happy for you and they laugh like ""omg hahaha I only have a 20-60, you're soooooo smart"" and you'll turn around and they give the most spiteful look to your back. 

They do so much talking and insulting abt the other students and the teacher, that the teacher had to have a class talk abt it. She straight up said that shes knows some people in my class are outright lying abt her and the class to other students. I know I get salty abt my teacher bc sometimes she is a lil mean in having a dbq when we have had no practice at all but not at the level of these people. They'll complain abt having to take notes for participating in class.

I'm aquiantances with most of the students in my class and I have regular conversation with the above mentioned students abt the class. However, I know that they are spiteful of me because I dont do a lot of work (work smarter not harder, printing out teacher notes instead of writing 20 pages of my own) and still get good grades. I know that if I want to avoid them talking behind my back and being spiteful, i should not tell them i got a 4. How do i avoid telling them my score? Should i lie abt it or just pretend i dont exist in the class chat

773,"So the relationship between me and my mom hasn't changed much since I was like 9. Sometimes this relationship is kind of nice because its good not to have a relationship where you're treated like an adult sometimes. I view it as a break from reality, but I think my mom still views me as her little girl, I'm 15 btw. When I told her I was gay a few months ago she was totally accepting, but she kept saying its so sad you're growing up and thinking about people this way, and she's treated me different because of this, I don't think she's homophobic tho.  I used to hear her bragging about how innocent I was to her mom friends, telling them I don't even know what sex is, I do there is this thing called google, and that I've never kissed anyone. She also cried because I was growing up when I got my first period.  She always says things like ""you're allowed to have a girlfriend, but I really love you're innocence"" 

So flash forward to now and I've been dating a girl for a few months and I like her a lot. We seem great together and haven't had many arguments. I'm worried to tell my mom about this because I'm worried she'll treat me even different and it'll break her heart.

779,"This is going to be a long one, I’ll put a tldr at the end.

The advice I’m (36f) asking for revolves around a letter I received yesterday out of the blue from 2 aunts (my late father’s only siblings). The letter basically explains why, despite her intentions, my brother and I will not be inheriting anything from my grandma. Included in the letter were 2 checks, one from each aunt, for $5000 each. I don’t know how to respond and I’m really struggling with what - if anything- to say.

Background: my grandma had 3 kids, my dad was the oldest. My grandmother definitely favored him, mostly just because he was the only boy. We were very close with one sister (O) and her family but neither of my parents really got along with the other sister (Y). When he  died (cancer) in ‘95 my mom was really mad at Y for how she had behaved during his illness and essentially wanted no contact with her. O was always the host of family parties etc. and she tried to make it work but eventually told my mom that she needed to focus on her relationship with her sister and we stopped getting invited to things. Luckily we lived in the same town as my grandma so we were able to remain close with her. 

Fast forward a few years and my grandmother decides she going to give the 2 beach houses she owns to her daughters. She talked to my mom and told her she planned to give my brother and I an equivalent gift in her will. I remember feeling so hurt mostly because those had been family homes that we could visit freely when they weren’t rented and that was over now. O sold hers since her family lived out of state and Y moved into hers and sold the house they had been living in. 

In the next decade or so my grandmother started to decline mentally. I remember voicing concern to Y at the first signs of dementia but I was brushed off. In the midst of this she signed her house over to O and Y. She got worse and worse for years until she finally wandered out of the house and was picked up by police roaming her neighborhood. She never went home after the hospital and has been in a nursing home ever since. Any money she had saved was absorbed by the state/medical bills/ etc. 

My aunts recently closed on her house, which I guess is the reason they sent the letter. Mind you I have semi-regular contact with them- before COVID I brought my toddler to visit her pretty regularly and Y was always there too. We get along, are friendly, and they are wonderful with my son. This letter was typed and pretty cold and out of absolutely nowhere. It reads like they’re afraid I’m going to sue them. I think they feel guilty because the main reason everything happened like it did was because my dad died. 

Here’s my actual problem that I need advice on: 

I don’t want to thank them. I don’t know how to acknowledge that I received this money without framing it as a thank you but I just don’t feel like I owe them a thank you. I’m still hurt about how everything went down and that it has never truly been acknowledged.

I want to be clear that I’m not complaining that it wasn’t more. I realize how fortunate I am I really just hate the way they’ve behaved and I don’t want them to think that this absolves them of all the selfish decisions they have made. What are the perfect words to communicate this lol?

TLDR: relatives felt guilty about me not getting an inheritance and  sent a “gift” of money that I don’t know how to respond to.",15Jul2020,1

I've known her for five years now, I met her through my art page on Instagram and we became really close. She really was a sweet, funny, happy-go-lucky person and she never failed to make me smile. Our friendship had ups and downs because of the distance between us (she lives in the US, I'm in Italy) but overall we always loved each other.

She was depressed, had absolutely no motivation to do anything she loved and I couldn't help but think something was wrong. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that her mother was violent towards her and psychologically abusing her.

She's had to leave community college and has had various odd jobs, but her mum took all the money she's earned so she was unable to move out and free herself from the abuse she's gone through. As soon as she expresses the desire to get on with her life, her mum beats her up.
She told me she feel worthless and unable to provide for herself even if she's 22 and by now she should be living her life to the fullest. Every time she tried calling the police, nothing happened and her beatings would just get more and more violent and I can't imagine how she feels.

She just expressed to me the desire to run away several times, but she can't because she just doesn't have the finances to do so. I helped her set up a gofundme so she can ask people to give her a headstart to find an apartment in another state and then find a job. I don't know if it's the best solution, since she wants to keep everything anonymous and just flee. As much as I love the Internet and most of its people, I don't know if that'll work.

She's never asked me for money, this time she did but I cannot help her financially since I have no job, I'm a full time university student.

I just don't know what to do. I just want her to be happy and I'm sad she's going through this. I'm sad I cannot give her the money she needs to run away. I usually wouldn't support this type of decision, but in an abusive household there's not much she can do and that I can understand.

What can I do to make things better? What support can I give her even if it's not financial? Do you guys think the gofundme could be a good idea for this types of situations?",15Jul2020,1
788,"I'm 18y/o and I find it really difficult to fully connect with people fully. I have friends who I'm close with but I feel as though in all of the relationships I have with people, there is something missing. For example, I don't have anyone that I'm fully comfortable with and unless I'm drunk, the conversation feels trivial/empty. I think this is the reason why I'm a secondary friend to people and I don't know how to fix this. I give good advice to people but I have trouble connecting and empathizing with them 100% which worries me. This also happens with my romantic relationships as I've genuinely only liked one girl in my life despite the fact that I do/have talked to lots of girls but I think this comes from porn/masturbation issues that I've dealt with from a disgustingly young age. I really need help because of my lack of an ability to connect with basically anyone even family as fully as possible and how I treat women, I guess.

She wasn't like blackout drunk, cause I know she remembers and she wasn't on the floor. My friends and I tried to give her advice on her romantic life. She would not listen at ALL, everything just went past her (which is okay, she was drunk), and she would not stop talking about it. However, she began speaking very rudely (in my opinion) to us. I tried to share experiences with her (one of the first things I said during this conversation, after listening to her for a solid 15minutes), but she shut me off, saying that everything isn't about me. Which kinda hurt me, seeing how I've listened to her for hours rant about her family or other problems (including this one). I tried to ignore it, then my other friend (Mia) tried to come with advice about being honest with her feelings, etc. She then begun to shut down her too, saying things like ""What do you know"", as Mia has never been in a relationship nor is bisexual. At this moment I broke in, and told her to get a grip and not belittle anyone's advice.

This might seem like a small deal, HOWEVER I'm not over it. I feel like the only solution to this is to speak to her, but what should I say? Should I speak to her at all? She might just go completely in defensive mode, but at the moment, I'm angry!!

794,"Hi everyone, 

I am now working on my project and I would like to conduct some information. As we now experience the global pandemic, it has affected our life and business so much. I am trying to come up with ideas on how to help those business companies, firms, and organizations by gathering ideas from everyone around them. Therefore, I believe that Reddit would be another good platform for my research.

My question is what type of webinars or service do you think a company might need the most after the post-covid-19? This can be anything to help every company to prepare its employees back to work. Especially, for companies that want to go internationally. Is there anything service/webinar/sessions that you would like to have?

Your input would mean a lot to me.

795,"I (24M) feel sorry for my mom (44). Our parents got divorced 11 years ago. I have been living with my dad for the most part and my sister (16) has been living with my mom. Since the divorce my dad married my now stepmom and had two kids. My mom has been single all this time and I know that she does feel lonely at times. She never goes on dates mostly because all the men that are interested in her are some teenagers or people way younger than her. My mom takes care of herself, trains, participates in fitness competitions and looks very fit and young for her age. The most recent guy who was texting her told her that he was 25 and I think they went on couple of dates until my mom found out he was actually 18. She blocked him but he still sends her flowers and begs her to be with him. I don’t know if it’s some MILF thing going on or if he wants to date my mom because he needs a sugar mommy... The point is my mom is very single and lonely. 
My sister now is thinking of moving to my dad’s state because schools there are better and if she moves my mom is gonna end up all be herself. I live and work abroad now and I am not planning to go back in the near future. My mom knows that my dad wants to take my sister because he cares about her education and everything and she’ll still spend holidays, summer and winter vacations with my mom but still 90 percent of the time she will be alone. I just talked to my mom and she sounded so sad and depressed. I don’t want her to be alone and feel lonely, her side of the family has a history of breast cancer and she has multiple cysts and a benign tumor that she’s too afraid to get checked out. Obviously loneliness and stress won’t do anything good... but still even when I go back I can’t possibly live with my mom in my 30s and 40s. What am I going to do then?

I'm a student at an online school and the work there has gotten pretty intense. Last week, I spent maybe 50 hours working, and had a lot of late nights. I know other people work more, and they get used to it, but I'm getting nervous I won't be able to keep this up. 

I'm seeing a doctor about getting an ADHD diagnosis next week, and I'm planning how much studying and work I have to do. I think I have about 40 hours this week, due Sunday. I've already lost two days trying to recover from last week, and I'm scared I'll not be able to finish. Or I'll have to spend every waking hour in front of my computer. 

Long story short, a lot of other stuff is going on in my life that makes it really hard to focus, ADHD aside.

I don’t really know how to write this up so ill compile a list of things that are concerning me.

Lack of empathy. Often when they hear about something bad someone did or something being sad about something, they dont seem to understand how that could be bad or make someone sad even when its extremely obvious (Such as cheating, manipulating, other scenarios like that) 

They dont seem to hold emotional attachment towards people and are willing to drop people in an instant without worrying how that will make them feel. (The only people they seem to care about apart from family is me but theres no real way of even knowing that) Another one of their friends got a boyfriend who they are also good friends with and they were trying to convince them to cheat on each other.

Theres a bunch of other random stuff like being extremely possessive over me, jealous if I become more friendly with someone else than I am with them, and they also seem to think that everyone is like this. They also never think theyre in the wrong which I guess is normal but theyre literally never the one to apologise and never accept blame for anything. 

The stuff that really started getting me concerned is their obsession with violence and gore filled websites and videos. They seem extremely fascinated and entertained watching videos of beheading and stuff like that after months of watching it. They have also stated that as a child, before knowing where to find these videos, they would google animal fight videos and be “hungry” to see the violence. But not only this, they confided in me about how when they were a child, they used to feed small stray cats theyd find to dogs and watch them get mauled (They wouldnt die they would just be really f***ed up) and that they felt nothing emotionally like guilt or anything. They’ve also talked about murdering a fully sized stray cat to see if theyd feel anything.

They used to be very happy and had an amazing relation, but then my dad fell off his bike 3 years ago, got brain damage, and now my dad is a different person, and my parents can't stop arguing. They really don't want to, and they still love eachother a lot, but it's hard for them to not get into arguments. So yeah, my dad said before that I'm the only one that understands him at times (tho I sometimes argue with him as well), and my mother said that it's a good thing that I'm still at home, because otherwise they won't have some sort of beam of light or distraction throughout their day to keep them from arguing with eachother.

After some years of holding back, my girlfriend is finally deciding to take therapy and see a psychologist. For the past years, she has been dealing with anxiety and traumas due to her bad experiences(life, with herself, past relationships, etc), and some of it have been popping up randomly as of late that she gets triggered. But she finally found the courage to face all of it head on because she wanted to be better for herself, to the people around her, and for me. In regards to our relationship, she felt like she was holding back, that I wasn't getting to know her enough, but then I always reassure her that she isn't, that I'm contented with how she's loving me, and that she can take her time in unfolding herself.


So getting to the point, I have been reading some articles of how to better care for people who are dealing with such things, and of course more often than not they would be the same, repetitive information(which I do take note of by the way) with some having their own ones. But to the people here who are dealing with this, who have dealt with this, people who are also supporting and helping friends or family with the same condition, like what are some of your personal &amp; practical advice that you'd wanna impart with me basing in your own experiences? I'm not a doctor, and I know that it isn't me who is gonna heal her(although of course I want to be cause I love her so much), but I just wanna be able to do my best in supporting her, whatever it is that I have to do, if this is as much that I can do aside from being there for her and loving her.


TLDR - My girlfriend decided to get therapy for her anxiety attacks and traumas, and I wonder what practical advice from your own personal experience/s can you impart with me in helping and supporting her in this journey of hers to recovery.

He said the following 
- he said ""you are silent, but efficient which is okay with me "" . I don't do small chats in the office but I make sure to say good morning to everyone. And I just update my boss and I don't talk about my work with colleagues bcz its not needed. Idk what I am doing wrong in this? I just don't want to be part of the gossip also I am just busy working. 

- since March they haven't got any deal at all up until last week. Due to Covid-19 of course.
- my first 3 months quotes ( customers acquiring prices)minimum target was 5 I got 11 and still have half a month to go. 
- he said that the number of quotes I got is average or below average, I told him most of the factories are actually closed due to covid-19 or were in a crisis and held off the investment btw these machines are 6 figures and up so it's not small machines. He said no this is not an excuse we are working in a mentality where covid-19 has no effect over our work.  
- he said my performance is Satisfying he said.which I don't know what it means he said if you get an order with the first 2-3 months you will be excellent although he said himself that he knows its impossible. 
- then he said that someone told him that when talked with them I didn't give them good technical details actually that person didn't ask anything technical and also we didn't speak the same language so we had a brief conversation so it was clear that someone was lying. 
- last week there was a national holiday but I wasn't informed by my boss that I shouldn't come to the office, same time my co-worker lied and said that the office would go to work a day earlier, since I didn't get confirmation I went to office and no one was there . I pretended that I didn't have the keys and returned home. 
- he said that he is going to add more responsibilities to me to work on I said what are they? He said I will tell you later (strange)

Hi everyone! I'm 22F and I've been on the Junel Fe birth control pills (28 day back, 24 on, 4 inactive) since last October. They've been great at preventing pregnancy (yay haha), but they make me feel kind of bleh. Like not horrible side effects, but I've gained some belly fat, I'm generally more anxious and stressed, I feel tired, that sort of thing. I really want to switch to an IUD, but they really freak me out (insertion process), so I want to make sure I'm choosing the better kind the first time haha. At first, I really wanted to get the copper IUD, because I figured no hormones means no bleh feeling.

My parents are old now and have always been there for me. I guess you could say I've been coddled and overprotected by them but they've always been there for me and I cannot imagine the thought of losing them. Growing up I didn't have many friends, did not get along that well with my siblings, and so my parents have always been my best friends and I share everything with them. 

I've never lived away from my parents for more than a few months at a time (even in college) and even then I would talk to them every day over phone or text. 

My wife and I are living in my parents' home because we are short on money and cannot afford to move out. My parents are more than happy for us to stay home with them and provide company and don't want us to move out (we are Asians so this is not really abnormal for us). I have two younger siblings but they are more or less seperated from the family and barely come around or even talk to me or my parents anymore. 

Lately my dad fell sick and was taken to the ER. He's thankfully recovered but since then I've been in a panic. It just hit me that one day I would have to lose my parents - my only emotional support system in the world. I cannot eat, cannot drink, cannot sleep, keep crying all the time, feel like there is a weight on my chest and a lump in my throat, and have nervous diarrhea.

The worst part is that I used to be religious and believed  100% that there is a heaven and one day my entire family would be reunited there, so any death would be a temporary seperation. But over the past few years I've begun to question my faith and begun to suspect that nothing happens after death and our consciousness just ends when we die and our brains shut down. 

The thought of never seeing my parents (or other family) after they pass, that they will go away forever for eternity - it is too much to bear. I hope and I pray with all my heart that death is not the end and we get to be with our loved ones again. 

I don't have any friends to confide in and I cannot become vulnerable or open up to my wife (the last time I tried that it hurt our relationship - she wants to see me as a strong, stoic, and silent protector and not a whining Mama's boy). I've opened up to my parents but they are devoutly religious and just tell me to not worry as we will all meet up in heaven eventually. 

What should I do? How can I deal with this? How do I stop all the crying and the insomnia and the anxiety? And who do I confide in?",15Jul2020,1
826,"I’m 17f and about 8 months about I met a guy at school the same age as me. He always showed a lot of interest in me but I was never interested in him. He‘s a bit weird and known to be odd because of the way he acts. I remember when he would talk to me sometimes he would get really close and this one time he was demonstrating some sort of fighting move to some guys and he came up to me and grabbed my head and neck, without asking, to demonstrate.

Ever since then I’ve been kind of been weirded out by him because I found it really disrespectful for him to touch me without even asking especially since he’s not even my friend. On top of that even though he was nice to me most of the time, there would be a couple of times where he would be kind of disrespectful. I always got weird vibes from him. But this was like 7 months ago.

A week ago he sent me a dm on Instagram asking me how I was, and we hadn’t talked in like 7 months since that class that we had together ended. I replied and then later on told him I wasn’t interested because it’s been pretty clear for a while that he likes me. He saw the message and never replied. I ended up just unfollowing him and removing him from my followers. I always found myself just skipping over his photos whenever he posted and I just wanted to remove him from my social media so he would be clear that I have no feelings for him.

On top of that even though he is a pretty nice person, I just didn’t get good vibes from him and I’ve always found it disrespectful how he demonstrated that move on me and just violated my personal space. My friends think I’m rude for unfollowing and removing him and that I overreacted. My only goal ever has been to be kind so Im feeling kind of bad right now even though I don’t think it’s a big deal.

I'm still searching for a job but at the same time I feel like giving up. I'm worried that I'm most likely not suitable for the tech industry since I don't feel any passion for it. I've forced myself to be interested in it by reading more about it but nothing goes in and stays. I enjoy the coding part of CS, but the theory - not so much.

831,"My friends and I got into an argument recently because I said something in passing about how I could never have a friends with benefits situation like one of the girls I was hanging out with has. To me it was just something I said without thinking and with no ill intent but to them i was slut shaming and being mean. Looking back I can see how it may have been taken that way but I apologized almost immediately. To them my apology wasn’t genuine and it was a cop out to end the conversation. So basically it went on for maybe two hours of me trying to explain what I said and what I meant and the two of them twisting my words into actually random things that were never said or implied. Eventually the friend with a fwb said she was going to leave and I realized that I was being immature by trying to prove why I wasn’t wrong and said a long and more genuine seeming apology. All of that was so pointless but it brought up something I realized I’ve been feeling for a while. Those two friends of mine constantly make me feel like I’m an aggressive and mean person. I know that I never mean to be at the very least and my other friends tell me I’m not at all. But they always have a problem with the way I word things and at this point it’s just so hard to tell if I’m the constant aggressor or they’re just sensitive? I don’t know what advice I’m asking for but I feel like I just need to hear an external opinion. 

Side note: after I apologized one of them told me “I’m glad no one left before you apologized because every time we argue, you always come around” this really pissed me off and I don’t think it’s solely my job to “come around” when I’m upset too",15Jul2020,1

I have a Long Distance relationship with a guy and our parents all know and his mom is very happy, however my parents are supportive but assholes about it. My mom is nicer about it, but still. 
For example, my dad will say things like ""you don't do shit for me and you wanna see your boyfriend?"" or ""you can't even do anything around the house"" (keep in mind I do his laundry, bring him water and sodas, do his dishes, and I grab stuff around the house for him). 
My mom is more possessive of me. She'll say things like ""why do you trust him so much?"" or ""why do you want to meet with him so badly?"" or even "" it's gonna be really awkward when we do plan this out""

833,"I'm a 16 year old girl, and I've had mental health issues in the past, but never been diagnosed. To clarify: I've seen a therapist for a while and she has explained to me that she thinks I may have certain disorders or illnesses but she can't diagnose me because that's not her specific occupation. 
I've tried talking to my dad about it but he doesn't really understand mental health necause he's never had issues (his words, not mine). Overall, he's super supportive though. My mom on the otherhand is a totally different story. Anytime I talk to her, she waves off my mental health experiences as normal or non-existant. The biggest problem for me right now is that I really want to go get a mental health screening done, and don't know how to convince my parents to or get it done.
Recently, while talking to some friends and other people online and hearing their stories, I felt like I really resonated with some of them. While looking into certain health disorders I found I matched with a lot of symptoms of some of them, and again, my therapist has recommended me looking into them as well. One of these happens to be ASD (autism spectrum disorder). I don't want to self-diagnose or anything like that, I'm not a mental health professional.

834,"I'm a 15 year old male and my sister is 16 years old. Recently we moved to a new house and got to pick our rooms, she picked one before me and told me to use the other one. I disagreed at first but realized my room was quieter and it wasn't in anyone's pathway (I'm an intovert and don't like people coming in my room). The way our house is that it has a room between the kitchen and the living room and two other rooms on the other side of the house (There's bathroom and stuff in the middle). My dad and I are currently in the two rooms. 

Just a while ago she came to my room and told me she wants to change rooms, she continued to explain that she couldn't study or read books in her room because of the noises of cars and people in the balcony (The kitchen, her room and the living room are facing the road, there's a balcony that surrounds the outside of her room and connects to the kitchen, there's two entrances to the balcony one through the room and one from the kitchen.) 

I then told her that I didn't want to change rooms because of the same reason.(I usually spend my time watching stuff online and am very concious about anyone else seeing what I watch.) But then she told me that I didn't even study so I didn't need to have a quiet room. I tried explaining to her that I don't want people in/around my room but she didn't care and told me that she would change the rooms.(We have the same furniture in our rooms so it's just moving the stuff in/on them.) 

I definitely don't want to be in her rooms but also her would reasoning seems more logical to outsiders (aka my dad and also I'm pretty sure he doesn't know about the situation yet.) How can I convince her or at least find a way around it? I'm just an introvert and bad at conflict so please no crazy suggestions.

Edit: My mother doesn't live in our house so she isn't involved. My sisters rooms windows open to the balcony and if you leave them open there's a lot of noise but if you close them it gets hot which is part of the problem.",15Jul2020,3

836,"Coming from me, a 20 year old (M), I feel like it's a shame. I only came here just because family's never helping, in fact, I'm always the one they start blaming in every situation. Before I begin, I'm asking for advice, not criticism, I'm already receiving plenty from my family. 

There's three of us, siblings, I'm the eldest and my sister is the youngest, I have a brother one year younger than me but that's a different story. My relationship with my sister has not always been toxic, but more she's growing up, the more toxic it all gets. Don't mean to be rude or offensive, but sometimes I do feel like she's a collection of worst traits of our family: she never listens, never studies, plays video games on her phone and watches YouTube videos the whole day, literally never cleans her room (including trash), only thinks about herself, always talks back to me and my brother but never to my parents, she's spoiled, even though both of our parents scold her fairly often. I'm never trying to be this manipulative piece of shit brother, or never want to at least, I'm always trying to teach her things, manners, habits which will be beneficial for her in the future, but she never listens to what I have to say and talks back on literally every word and that's what triggers me, sometimes I may be very indifferent, other times I get angry to the point where I gotta scream my way to get heard at best but at that point my entire family's quick to start pointing fingers at me and scold me. Worst part of it all, she gets scolded after me as well, but it never helps, I heard many of her apologies, but once again, it never changes anything, next day, regardless of how angry and frustrated she may get at me, she will act like nothing's happened and thus, get away with it. 

Obviously, our upbringing does differ, for starters, I'm a boy and she's a girl, thus she gets away with her things way more than I ever did, simply because there was more expected from me than her since I'm the eldest sibling, unfortunately, that's how's it's gonna be and I can't do anything about it. Even today, even in situations where she's clearly entirely wrong, I'm the one who gets told to be more mature. 

Now, I'm not an angel either. I'll admit, there were occasions, not many but still significant, where I went a little too hard. For example, once I went to her room, I opened a door and asked to do a certain thing, don't remember what it was but it wasn't anything crazy, as soon as I finish the sentence she talks back, ""leave me alone"" (in our language, obviously). I got really mad, keep in mind, I'm a calm human being in general and it's pretty hard to make me angry to the point I got that incident. Instead of starting to yell again, I slammed the door as strong as I could and left. My reasoning was, instead of talking about simple respect among family members and humans to a person that doesn't even know the word ""respect"", let alone the definition, it would be a better thing to just leave, but that was my reasoning for leaving, not for slamming the door, that has no justification. The aftermath of it all, as I said, my entire family pointing fingers at me, this time for good reasons, and my sister gets scolded, eventually apologizing and doing literally the same thing the next day. 

I'm tired, to say the least, it is my dream to move out. My entire family made me feel that way, that's a different story, a lot of things lead to me feeling that way but I can't deny my sister is the one that contributes to that the most. As much as I want to love my sister, she just doesn't let me do so due to her actions. I know, she's a kid, she doesn't know better, so all these years I've been trying to talk some sense into her, but after another altercation that went down a couple of hours ago I decided I'm gonna stop trying to fix her up and I feel like I should find some sort of coping mechanism to all of this.

843,"TW: suicide 


My family has has issues with my brother for years now. 
In the past few months he has been verbally abusive (he has been before, he works in a cycle of being nice and then nasty) as he was living with our parents and began using drugs and staying in unhygienic conditions under their roof. My parents rules for living there are a decently clean room, no drugs and no abusive behavior. He moved back in because he got himself into debt and has moved in and out for about 5 years now, always coming back apologetically and then throwing tantrums and sometimes getting violent after a few months. 

My mother kicked him out because while she was cleaning cups and glasses of urine, random supplements (and curling iron and parchment paper) and rotten food out of his room he came home. He spit in her face twice, verbally berated her and threw a giant pot of his food at the sink, breaking part of the sink and then broke the door frame on his way out. My mother was calm through all of this. So then he was out of the house, and despite my parents not charging him rent he was broke enough to have to live in his car.

Fast forward to yesterday and he drove to our parents house and repeatedly told them if they did not allow him to move back in he was going to kill himself. My parents begged him to come inside so they could keep him safe, when he asked if he was moving back in they said no so he screamed that he was going to go shoot himself and stormed back to his car. My mom convinced him to turn back around and come to the house.

He claims professional help of any sort cannot work. He needs to move in or that's it, and when he moves in he'll administer his own therapy or find and ""alternative route"". This all happened yesterday, and since then he has continued to call and text my parents that they want him to die, if he dies it's all their fault, they're sociopaths and horrible people, and that the only way he won't kill himself is if he can move back in.

I'm anxious because he has threatened suicide before but not to this extreme and not for this long, I know he's being manipulative but I feel guilty for thinking he may be disingenuous. Doubt in this situation seems like a regrettable thing, but he told my mother every time she brings up getting him professional in patient or out patient help or calling a hotline he's closer and closer to committing suicide.

If he wasn't speaking about death I would be okay with no contact but I'm confused now.

My parents are not okay with him moving back in because he has stolen from us, assaulted us, verbally abuses us and my parents are afraid of enabling his drug addiction.

848,"So I wanna start by saying I’ve made another post on a different advice subreddit about the same man I’m dating and referencing in this post, however, the issue talked about in that post I have communicated with him about and talked through with him. As the title says, this ones more so about my friends.

At the beginning of the relationship with my current bf I was convinced it was gonna be short and casual. Something for the school year ya know? Well it ended up getting serious and kept moving forward. Then it wasn’t as serious as I wanted and the things that I usually look for in a relationship weren’t being met. I complained to my friends of course and tended to focus on the bad, unfortunately. But me and him always were able to talk things out and so it would get better little by little. During quarantine it got really bad, there was a scare I thought he might be cheating but I am 100% sure I overreacted due to anxiety about myself, the relationship and just life in general. But since then, my friends have hated him and everything he does. I got over that and things in our relationship got better. Then there was another moment when I just got pissy at him and ranted about only the bad things that I’ve noticed in the relationship (I shouldn’t have done it, I was in a bad mood and spoke only with congruent thoughts). 

Obviously, this relationship has improved. I like to speak things out and give it a shot after and it was worked out. Ever since that last time I was just pissy and we had a small argument, things have been great?? It was a turn and it was a bit weird at first, but he met my mom and I’m meeting his family soon and my family adores him. I didn’t expect it but I’m so happy. He’s been sweeter and spending more time with me and our communication seems a lot better too just on a day to day. It’s turning into a really great relationship.

Now though, things are really great, but my friends are very stubborn in their thoughts. It’s hard to change their minds, especially when they think they’re right. My friends thought I should break up with him, and for awhile I did too, but seeing as we have gotten over a lot of obstacles and are both really happy, I don’t want to leave now. But I feel like I can’t speak about him. It started as me not wanting to hear them telling me to break up with him and now I just feel like I can’t tell them I’m happy in the place I am without receiving judgement for still being in the relationship. I feel like if I bring him up, they’ll be upset that I gave him so many chances.

Maybe I shouldn’t have, but obviously it’s worked out. I like the relationship and want to keep it, and I’d love nothing more to talk to my friends about it. It seems like the relationship is a whole new one and so much better than it ever has been. How can I include my friends though if they’re stuck in their ways? Any tips on bringing it up and defending my choice to stay?",15Jul2020,1

850,"I wouldn't normally do this, but I just need to write my thoughts and clear my head, so here goes.

I've never been unpopular, in school and in work I always had a circle of friends and we got on well, my grades are good and I'm on track to do well. That being said, at the beginning of the year, I realised that nobody actually spoke to me outside of college or outside of work, besides from my girlfriend. I tried to speak to people but although we'd have great conversations when I approached them, they would not talk to me afterwards or ever approach me themselves.

This really hurt, and was a moment of introspection for me, I don't think I'm a boring person or unlikable, but clearly I was doing something wrong, which I still haven't figured out. This sent me into a bit of a depressive downward spiral, which would've ruined my grades and caused me to fail, had Covid not come in and caused everyone to get predicted grades, which were thankfully still good.

In May I started running, and tried to start getting my life in order, which worked for a while, I was focused on other things, and although I didn't have any friends, I  still spoke to my girlfriend and to family, so I was starting to get better somewhat, however last week my girlfriend broke up with me, saying that she couldn't be there for me emotionally and that it wasn't fair on me if we continued the relationship or a friendship, citing my low mood from January. We had been together for ten months and it completely blindsided me, but I don't blame her and wish her all the best. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've once again realised how alone I am again, except the first time I still had my girlfriend to meet up with and talk to, and now I have nobody except my family, who're lovely, but they can't be a replacement for friends or a romantic partner. 

The thing that even sparked me to write this, was a certificate arrived today, as proof and congratulations of being a student governor in college, and I realised that although I'm good academically, that I have high grades, that I've made achievements; I feel unfulfilled and hollow. My university course has been cancelled due to Covid, so I'm off for a whole year, without the confidence or the means to meet new people, and I'm worried I'll fall into a worse slump than this time, and potentially not recover.

851,"I’ve struggled with anxiety in certain scenarios but I’ll shed light on the one I am currently in. I (22M) met a girl a couple weeks ago and as we talked we see each other as what we are looking for. She’s everything I want in a girl and she says I can provide her what she needs in a guy and we agree that we would work well in a relationship. She’s rushed into relationships in the past and wants this one to be different and taking it slow. Which I agree. 

We’ve had dates and they’re some of the best dates I’ve ever had and the connection is so genuine and I’m starting to develop feelings, but she wants it to move slower and I agree with the logic and I’m so down to wait as long as it takes to be able to end up with her. 

I genuinely care about her and want to be with her but in the fact that we are keeping it really slow, I fear that she will lose interest in me so I try to show that I still want us and care but it makes her think I’m not moving slow enough and she fees guarded. 

So I’ve been working on slowing my pace but that feeling of not being able to be with her, the knowledge of that if we aren’t official I can’t expect her not to see other guys (she said she doesn’t feel that way about anyone but me and she wouldn’t jeopardize us although I know she still has tinder and she said she wasn’t going to delete it until we leave the dating phase and into the talking phase and we would be monogamistic) but that is a real fear of mine because I like and care so much about her that Im only talking to her and only want to talk to her, and the fear of not getting the chance to show her that I’ll be all about her and her rock (if she lost interest in me)

So in the midst of those fears of mine while I’m taking a step back to move slower for her I find myself physically feeling that anxiety. Mentally I can wait and I will wait because she’s worth it to me. But I can’t shake the feeling of anxiety. 

Please give me some advice, some tips for managing the physical feeling of anxiety, and maybe some insight on the situation that I may be love blind to. Like I said I’m more than willing to wait for her cause she’s worth it and I don’t wanna push her away by rushing things but I don’t know how to deal with the anxiety. Thank you guys.",15Jul2020,1
852,"My best friend recently became very religious. He has always believed in god to some extent, but recently it has taken off very fast. He calls it “following god”. I noticed a difference when he started talking about resisting all temptations, and denouncing lust. I can understand to that point, but yesterday he started talking about demonic possessions and I started getting worried. He sent me a video of an apparent demonic possession and a priest attempting to expel the demon from the person’s body.

This is very strange because he is usually a very skeptical person, and would never come to a conclusion without looking at a wide variety of evidence and perspectives.

855,"I’m currently a graduate student going through the early process of a separation/divorce. Throughout the process I have been blessed to be surrounded by caring mentors, friends, and family. Two individuals specifically are doctors who have gone out of their way to help me. Doctor 1 is a personal mentor who I would consider a friend. Doctor 2 is a friend of Doctor 1 and not someone I personally know or am acquainted with. 

I really would like a way to thank them both. But as a graduate student I’m poor and they are both well off so I can’t purchase them anything they couldn’t get themselves (also I have no idea what Doctor 2 is interested in). I would appreciate any advice on how any of you have showed thanks to those who helped you when there is nothing you have to offer them in return.  

I intend on writing a personal letter to both thanking them in specific terms, but would appreciate advice on how to do more. Thanks for any advice.",15Jul2020,1
857,"So i share a lil 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with my boyfriend and his cousin as our roommate. My boyfriend and I have a 2 year old Maltese mix and his cousin has 2 chihuahuas ~ 4 and idk the other one's age but he's old. My dog is very well trained as his original purpose was to be a service dog but his attention span just didn't cut it 🥴 hes disciplined to a ""T"" but can be playful because he's just one of those dogs that love life. Happy to share everything including food, toys, his bed, and love. The other dogs are definitely more introverted which I can respect and I tell my dog all the time to stay away from them which he does. The other dogs are food aggressive and will growl and try to fight him for his bowl even tho its the same food 😐 so now I feed my dog in our room. They will fight him over his water dispenser even tho its the same water so he's handled it himself and just gives them space and i supervise at all times. They will fight him over his bed in his crate so he just lets them have it (again supervised at all times since i dont trust them). Even if my dog is just following me around (which hes trained to do as he was originally intended to service) they will growl at him. Today it finally escalated to the point where all the dogs were on the patio with our roommate and were walking in together and the older chihuahua attacked my dog : ( my dog doesn't fight back hes incredibly submissive and when i ran out to get him ( I was in the bathroom and I still feel so bad about it) he had peed on himself and was shaking from fear. All our roommate did was put his dogs in his room but I feel like that isn't going to solve anything as we've been living together for over a month and this is what he always does and theyre still aggressive. He refuses to crate his dogs as well since ""thats not right"" even tho they love my dogs crate??? So thats not an option. At this point I think the only thing to do is to just get rid of the aggressive older chihuahua and send it to his parents house or his brother who lives down the street. I dont like the idea of breaking up his family of doggos but I also don't like my dog being mistreated and terrified to go out of our room! Please help!",15Jul2020,1

I high five and handshake  all the girls and boys there  , but when I high five with her I feel so happy and cheered up . 

Also seeing her smiling or laughing while we high five as goodbye it makes me feel such a powerful happines rush . For real , the best moments became when I see her and high five with her . 

I just feel happy when I see her being happy , but on another level with her than other people .

860,"As the title states, my husband wants me to work out more and like it - spoiler alert - I don’t. This has nothing to do with weight rather than overall health. I’ve always been athletic and do not struggle with weight, I’m 130 lbs but like most women I am acutely aware of everything that jiggles. Gyms and scheduled workouts have never been my cup of tea, and I hate exercising unless it’s a sport or something fun. The gym is not fun to me, home workouts are not fun to me. I was going to the gym every other day but since the pandemic I’ve been skeptical, I tried home workouts but have no equipment and got so mentally exhausted just trying to be creative about it. 

Turn to my husband who is the Chris Traeger of health. He’s very involved and interested in his workouts, not to the point that it overtakes his entire life but it’s certainly important to him which I admire. We have never worked out together because not only are we on different levels strength and endurance wise, but I feel like he thinks he needs to coach me on everything. Like I said, I’m athletic, I played competitive sports my whole life, I do know what I’m doing. I may not like it, but sometimes his gentle coaching makes me feel like im a complete novice who knows nothing. So, every time he brings up working out, whether together or just suggesting something for me to do myself, I get defensive. And not just a little “oh thanks but that’s okay”, almost like I’m borderline wanting to accuse him of thinking something is wrong with me - which I KNOW is not true. 

The feelings I get are a mixture of not wanting to embarrass myself,  feeling like I’ll fail any challenging thing we do, having the attention on me to preform perfectly, and feeling like he’ll have to slow down for me. He is doing nothing wrong and only wants me to challenge myself and be healthy, and I’m thankful for that. So why do I respond so poorly when he does it? Is it an ego thing? I want to be able to workout with him or even on my own without having this internal rage over literally nothing. I’m not sure how to overcome this hurdle in my own mind and want to fix this so it’s not such an issue.",15Jul2020,1
862,"Hey all! 
My ex and I broke up a couple of weeks ago. It wasn’t a good relationship. He was very egocentric and found a way to blame everything on me. It’s quite possible he was manipulating me during the whole relationship. 
A few days after our break up, my dog died very suddenly and unexpectedly. I’m 18 and have known the dog my whole life, she was my best friend. 
I messaged my ex after being distant for a few days (we still talked almost everyday at this point which was not healthy) and explained the situation and how I’m adjusting to life without her. He said ‘it’s nice to know you at least love something’ and I promptly told him to fuck off and then blocked him. 
I’ve been no contact for a week now. Just happened to remember that his birthday is tomorrow. 
My ex doesn’t have a good family life but he does have work friends that are there for him. 
I’m mulling this over and feel that I’m at an impasse. I want to message him just to wish him a happy birthday as I do still care for him but I’m not really sure what I should do. Kind of scared about what his reaction may be.

About 4 days ago I met up with this guy and we had sexual intercourse, since I didn’t know him that well I made sure that he had a condom and I even gave him a blowjob with a condom on. 

Anyways it reaaaally hurt, after I got home I had so much blood in my stool like the whole day, the day after that I got constipated like super constipated. And ever since then I been taking fiber supplements which have kinda been helping I guess but now since yesterday my testicles get a little bit sore every now and then, and I am freaking the fuck out to be quite honest. 

I read online that being constipated can affect your testicles and make them sore and swollen, is that true? 

I hit up the guy and asked him is he really truly didn’t have anything, we met up again and he showed me his most recent test results, everything is negative, it gave me some peace of mind but I don’t know, I’m still freaking out! :( please help I’m really going thru it right now",15Jul2020,1

872,"So the other day, I jokingly (well somewhat) moaned to my friend 18m (I am also 18m) that I was lonely. For a bit of context, he’s arguably been my best friend for the last couple of years.

I can’t remember exactly how the conversation went, but basically he’s telling me to text this girl I like. We haven’t talked for about 6 weeks at this point, and I’m not sure he found my previous attempts at text conversation interesting, so I don’t want to bother her further. My conversation goes on with him telling me to talk to her tomorrow, but I disagree and say it’s not really my style, I’d rather talk to her in person to gauge whether we vibe or not. I find it much easier to pick up clues into how someone feels about talking by picking up on their body language and other factors, before getting attached to the person on pure text. I’ve made that mistake before.

My friend tells me to text her tomorrow and gives me advice on how to talk with her, something I don’t really take on board given his lack of success with women, and him recently being friend zoned by a girl he was using his ‘tactics’ on. Anyways, I say I might. The next day comes and I don’t text her, it was my Dad’s birthday and I didn’t have an opportunity even if I wanted to. He ends up asking and I say I didn’t and he gets frustrated and says he’s going to block me, something he’s done before when we’ve had clashes. In the end he doesn’t block me.

So a couple days have passed and he sends me a picture of the new Star Wars series announced, ‘Bad Batch’. Our main common interest is Star Wars so I try to talk about it. I have some theories I suggest. He replies with ‘gabblegabble’ so I reply with some roundabout way of saying he’s dumb, and he replied with the same again. I say ‘frick you’ and guess the reply ‘gabblegabble’. It’s a little annoying given I wanted to theorise about the new Star Wars show. I jokingly say I’m going to block him, and he goes “after I didn’t block you” referring to earlier, and I ask why he’d block me for that and he says it’s annoying to him because he wants us to happen.

I tell him that that’s not my style, my way of doing things, and he says “I mean if I’m being brutally honest they’re not the best methods.”

He adds “What if you two don’t get to meet, what if you two don’t go to a party together”

I reply with “How do you know what’s the best method? If I don’t get to meet her at a party, which I very much doubt, I’ll just be like damn, I guess I missed out, and I’ll just wait for the next person, who might even be better”

And he says “that I don’t really want her then”, which I say “of course I want her”. He says “why wouldn’t I want to talk to her if a party might not happen”. I don’t really understand what he means here so I say, “I believe I will get that opportunity, besides why do you care?”

He says that he’s trying to help me out, and I say I’ve got a plan. He pesters me about my plan which I’ve already told him multiple times. I explain it again and bear in mind I’ve already said what it was in this conversation, and he repeats the same point as early. I’m not going to wait for the conversation to repeat so I just tell him, rudely I admit, to shut up and that I’ve got this. He responds “do you though? Hmm” which honestly pisses me off a bit, does he not trust me?

The conversation continues with him repeating his ‘method’ two more times. After the second I tell him “HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY SHUT UP.” Rude, I know.

He replies “HOW MANY TIMES WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU TO REALISE IM TRYING TO HELP YOU AND THIS IS THE BEST CHANCE OF GETTING HER”

I say “SHUT THE FUCK UP OR ILL BLOCK YOU DICKHEAD DONT PRETEND LIKE YOUR BETTER THAN ME AT THIS SHIT. I KNOW WHAT IM FUCKING DOING EVEN IF ITS NOT YOUR DIPSHIT FUVKING METHOD LIKE FUCK OFF ALREADY YOURE REALLY PISSING ME OFF”

He responds “Fine alright you try your shitty method but you’ll look back in a few years from now and regret that you didn’t do anything. That’s all I’m gonna say. But for now. Go fuck yourself”

I say “Fuck you”

He says “You piece of shit”

And I finish the conversation with “Honestly”

To summarise how I feel about this conversation, I think he’s being completely unreasonable. He is absolutely convinced that his method is the only way I can get talking with this girl. No matter how many times I tell him that I’m doing this my way, the way I think is best. I believe he is being incredibly rude by not even considering my approach and straight up telling me I’m wrong with no evidence to back up that point. He thinks he’s some sort of dating master, when he’s never even been out with a girl.

I think I was slightly rude to him, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong here. The story continued this morning when I asked if he wanted a lift (I can drive and he can’t) to play football (soccer) with our friends.

He replied to me asking him if he needed the lift by saying “forget it” and I ask what’s wrong with him and if he wants our friendship to turn into this. To which he replies “You made it this way in the first place mate” which I don’t understand why he thinks I’m the one disrupting things here.

I reply “Wow ok, so you’re not going to accept that you were wrong?”

Him: “For what?”

Me: “That’s fine, I don’t need you in my life”

Him: “Hahahaha. Listen to yourself you fucking clown”

Me: “Are you that stuck up that you think you’re that important to me? I have no reason other than friendship to talk to you right now, and that doesn’t exactly seem to be going up right now”

Him: “And you know what I don’t really want it to go up either mate. And if I’m honest after having considered you to be a good friend of mine for the past few years you were kind of important to me and I was under the assumption that these feelings were mutual. Well you know what fuck yourself honestly”

Me: “I’m not going to respond to that. All I’m going to say is I apologise for being rude, but I know I am not in the wrong here. I hope one day you’ll be mature enough to talk this out properly”

Him: “Stop trying to take the moral high ground you just sound like a wanker. Although I must be fair to you your head is coming out of your arse a bit so well done to you 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻”

Me: “Goodbye”

Him: “Been a good one mate all the best x”

I’ve had fights with him before, and every time I’ve been the bigger man and apologised, even when I am sure I’m not in the wrong. He expects such ridiculous things, and often acts like the entire world revolves around him. He never had time for any of my issues, and moans constantly to me. I find him incredibly bipolar and often abrasive.

Part of me doesn’t like conflict, and I want to be on good terms with everyone, and I don’t want people to dislike me, I strive to be a good person. Knowing people don’t like me or are upset with me gives me massive anxiety as I don’t want to hurt them.

But at the same time, I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here, and I think for once, he has to be the one to apologise first, at least. But most of all I want him to realise he is wrong, and his attitude towards me is completely wrong.

Am I being the asshole here? Am I expecting impossible things, or am I wrong about this? Have I been reading this situation wrong? Am I being the abrasive one here?

I’m sorry for the long read, I don’t know what to do. I think I’m in the right, but his attitude suggests otherwise.",15Jul2020,1

875,"I feel a certain amount of guilt typing this, because I know my Dad loves me and I love him, but he’s always been opinionated and honestly a bit of a know it all blowhard. As he’s aged and especially since retiring 6 years ago, these qualities have only gotten worse and now he’s almost insufferable to be around. It feels like almost everything anyone says is met with a challenge from him, and his tone is always rude and belittling to everyone (even people he doesn’t know). He talks over people, has completely lost most of his social skills, and constantly sits around reading about politics (which is almost all he wants to talk about). Whenever I try to bring up a different subject, it always comes back to Trump somehow and how much he hates him. He knows more about what Trump does than he knows about me or what’s going on in my life. I’d like to blame his behavior on the current political situation because it IS incredibly frustrating, but I think it’s just brought out certain personality characteristics in him. Before Trump was even in office, I started to notice his mental decline into negativity and constant ruminating over how upsetting life is to him. It’s almost like Trump just gave him an outlet to channel all that negativity, and now it’s accelerated into making him a miserable person every single hour of the day. I don’t know if this makes sense, but it’s almost like Trump has turned my father into Trump (just on the opposite end of the political spectrum). There are more traits in common between them than different. 

My dad is constantly negative, and can’t seem to understand that I don’t want to be in that low state with him. I want to talk about uplifting things, because so much of the world is shitty right now. I’m clinging to happy movies, interesting pieces of media that DONT revolve around politics or Coronavirus, creating art... yet I try to bring these topics up to him and it seems to frustrate him that we’re not revolving around his obsessions. He says anyone who isn’t outraged about the current situation aren’t paying attention, but I am paying attention. I just also realize it’s not the only thing in life. It’s like, because he’s miserable everyone else has to be too. 

I can see living with him and having to be around him constantly has taken its toll on my Mom, who says he’s on Twitter literally 24/7. According to her, he wakes up in the middle of the night to check Twitter, then naps throughout the following day because he’s sleep deprived. I think in a certain way, my family has always revolved around him and his whims and it’s enabled him to become like this. He’s a fairly neurotic person who more than likely had undiagnosed mental disorders.

891,"**(throwaway account**) so I (21F) don't really know how to start here and I don't even know if this is a good idea since I'm terrified to do this but it's been making me anxious lately and I really need some advice to help my feelings of regret and just processing I think of what happened.

  
As a child I was really close to my neighbours, my parents never really cared a lot about me and are really strict/controlling, they also avoided talking to me about sex apart from the 'use a condom' part which was much later in my teens so I didn't really know about it since I had to teach myself everything and only in recent years have found out how everything works (still a virgin tho). also important to know I think is that I've always acted younger than my actual age, my interests, thoughts and way of behaving ran 2-3 years behind those of my peers and when I was like 5 my older brother (he's 8 years older than me) sexually assaulted me and tried raping me (I've been kind of struggling with this since I've only realised that it was wrong what he did in the past 3 years so idk maybe that's why I'm struggling with this so much but I really don't know), also nobody knows about what my brother has done to me, this is the first time I've really 'told' anyone. 

  
my neighbour's son who is like 3 years younger than me and I were always really good friends, we had the same interests and we grew up together so naturally, we were close. One day (I think I was like 11-12 or something) he asked me to play mommy and daddy but more real so we touched each other a bit and kissed but nothing more and this memory has also resurfaced recently and I feel a lot of regret for it and feel like it was so incredibly wrong for me to agree with it because, I was older and I should've realised that it was not okay to do this since it's too young to start exploring other sexually but I really don't know if this is just part of exploring sexual things and if it was 'okay' because there wasn't anything being forced. But I still feel like I want to erase that memory since I really regret it and don't know if now I'm just as bad as my brother because I didn't see anything wrong with 'playing mommy and daddy' at the time and didn't think anything of it. while in reality I should've said no.   
also the neighbours moved like 3 years ago and we eventually lost contact. 

  
Up until this day I haven't really had real sexual experiences apart from a boyfriend when I was 16 and the only thing that happened with him was some foreplay but I have been scared to engage into actual sex and relationship (also haven't had a boyfriend since my first bf at 16, but this is mainly because of my parents and busy school life) and I really don't know how to deal with all this since I really regret it but I can't turn back time and stop it from happening but I think I need some advice on how to deal with this since my anxiety and depression is really killing me atm and I want to find a way on how to give this a place or if these feelings are being made bigger because of what happened with my brother and I just really don't know, I'm sorry if this is such a ramble.   
anyway thanks for reading, I really don't know what I'm expecting from this, I guess I'm just losing my mind thinking about this and want to put an end to it.   


also this is my first post on reddit so I'm sorry if I messed something up",15Jul2020,1
892,"I am currently entering my junior year of college this fall, and this friendship fell apart my junior year of high school. 

I had this friend since the first grade, and as we finished elementary we went to different schools. We were friends long before we had two other friends added to our group later in elementary. When it came time for jr high and high school, one of the other girls and I went to school together and this friend, I'll call her Anna, went to a different school. We maintained contact still and hung out as the four of us up until 9th grade. In 9th grade Anna caused some tension in the group by cutting off the third girl in the group because of boy issues. That put weird in our friend group because Anna wouldn't even address cutting off the other girl, but my friend I went to school with and Anna and I remained friends. 

Fast forward to junior year of high school, things got messy. The girl I went to school with and I were invited to Anna's house, I think we might have come off as being not as grateful as we should have been for our time there that day. I feel so terrible if I acted spoiled or anything, but I can't go back and change that.Anna If I remember correctly, this was somewhere around Anna's birthday, but not on it. nonetheless, I later forgot to wish her a happy birthday because her birthday is around the holiday's and I got busy with family obligations and just forgot. It was horrible. These are all horrible things. I understand and I do not expect any sympathy. Junior year of hs was a very busy time for me and I think I was learning a lot of new lessons about life. 

Later on in the winter, Anna texted my friend and I. She said that she didn't think we could be close friends anymore and accused us of doing LSD (Which wasn't true, she gathered this theory through me putting a caption on my snapchat story of 4:20, and her sister must have told her because she didn't use snap ever). She continued to go on and say that we would be too much of a liability for her and her future,  and that she would get kicked out of her clubs for being associated with us (I think because of the drug use, that once again, wasn't happening). She said she was too busy for us and that she had a boyfriend and better things to do and that we could remain acquaintances but that basically we weren't worthy enough to be her friends. 

I was hurt, and I responded apologizing but also stood up for myself. I said that I felt bad that she felt left out and that we never meant to hurt her, and apologized for the birthday. I stood up for myself and said that I was also very busy with my own boyfriend and my own prestigious clubs and was offended that she would accuse me of using drugs, like it wouldn't affect my future more than it would affect hers. I got no response to this but I figured things were good.

Circling back to our friend that Anna cut off years ago, my friend and I still remained friends with her. We went to her birthday and one thing led to another and we made this stupid snapchat post on one of the girl's snapchats that was like ""welcome to the Anna fucked you over club"". 

Anna's sister saw the post because she of course used snapchat and we forgot we even had her on it. She showed it to Anna and Anna's mom freaked out and called our parents and went saying we were awful etc. Anna said that she never wanted to talk to us again. I understand. 

That post was horrible and it was awful. I am ashamed that we posted it, but at that point I was also very hurt by my friend cutting me off and acting better than me, especially when I always thought she saw us as equals. I was only just barely 16 when this all happened, and while I have always generally been a mature for my age kind of person, this got to me and I acted really poorly. I am truly remorseful for my actions. 

I have been thinking about our falling out a lot lately, but have felt like I don't deserve to try to contact her and ask for her forgiveness. **The only thing that prompts this post is that today I got a notification and she accidentally liked one of my most recent instagram pictures.** I'm sure she was probably just snooping or whatever because she doesn't really ever use social media, but I can't help but feel that she was thinking about me. I think about her all of the time and I just miss knowing what is going on with her and how she is doing. I went to look at her account and it had the whole ""user not found"" thing when I clicked on her page, so I assume she attempted to block me to try to cover up that she accidentally liked my photo. 

I need advice on if I should reach out to her and apologize and try to ask for forgiveness or if I should drop it. 

TLDR: long friendship fell apart 4 yrs ago, there was a messy friend breakup that I only helped make more messy and terrible. said ex-friend liked my insta post today out of nowhere and then blocked me trying to cover it up. This post was from January so I can't help but think that she was curious to see how I was and I wonder if its time that I could possibly try to rekindle our friendship.",15Jul2020,1

I don’t hate anyone, I don’t wish harm on anyone, and it’s the same for almost every other republican/conservative out there. everyone is entitled to their own opinion so I don’t understand why I’m not allowed to have mine?

897,"I will keep this as short as possible. I was with a girl for 6 months, the last month got pretty toxic cause she doesn't want sex as much as me or rather she decided she doesn't want it at all. I had to wait for it 4 months because the conditions were she meeting my mom and me her parents and us being longer in a relationship. But yeah, we had sex only 2 times in 6 months. She almost always rejected sex cause ""not in the mood"", ""pms"", ""she doesn't want it"". Keep in mind she promised that we will be more intimate after those conditions but she never once initiated it, even though prior to that she said ""I want to give you sex so you don't feel like something is missing in a relationship."" But no, she didn't keep the promise which I waited for like 1/3 of a year cause I really loved this girl...so yeah the last month was pretty toxic and we had fights and she just concluded that rather than her working on sex gradually she would rather break up. Kept saying things like ""I'm not happy in the relationship anymore, it's not only the sex."" Which I really doubt, she never actually tried to have sex,  rather had the attitude ""Let's just get this over with."" So in short, she didn't kept her promise, and I got mad at her for that and she got mad at me for that...bullshit. But the thing I said yesterday was super over the top and I hate myself for it, I am legit human scum. Funny enough, yesterday was my 20th birthday and she said ""Happy birthday  :)"" .So insincere. I give my all to this girl for 6 months and she writes me a birthday message consisting of 2 words and 1 emoji? I got pissed and I will not tell you the entirety of the message cause it's deleted as of now but at the beginning of it I said :""Oh you gonna seen me on my birthday? Classic move, your sister would have been proud of you \*insert clown emoji\*\[HER SISTER DIED ON BIRTH\], the rest was just me going off on her how I regret spending time and money on her when she doesn't even give me a second chance to fix something. And we were in a text war for about an hour or two. 

I was definitely right to be angry at her, but to mention her dead sister within my blackout anger over text? I feel like the worst human scum on earth.

Note : She is leaving for her studies 700 km away as well.

So I was thinking, when her birthday comes, to send her some roses and chocolate with a note which says ""I am so sorry for everything I have said, words cannot explain how sorry I am, you never deserved this, do not overthink this present, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me and I want you to know that, I honestly wish you the best, you deserve much better, best of luck""

I know I am basically worse than scum with what I have said, it's eating me inside and I am suicidal, disoriented and a disappointment.

I lost the credibility of who I am with an anger leak.

I am really lost, and I know I don't deserve help, but I wanna atone for this.

She deserves better. Is this just unnecessary? Will this beget just another checkpoint of regret on her birthday? Any help is appreciated.",15Jul2020,1
898,"So I’ve been living in the same house for the past year and recently a new roommate has moved in. I helped them move in and noticed their things vaguely smelling of weed, I didn’t think much of it as I don’t care if they do smoke, just if they do so in the house. The past couple days I’ve noticed the house now smelling vaguely of weed but once again I gave the new roommate the benefit of the doubt bc it was barely there. Now today, I’ve been in my room and heard someone spraying something in the hallway (assumingely febreeze or something), I needed to go downstairs anyways so I walked by their room to see and I notice the smell of weed again. Because of this I decided to go into the backyard to see if at least their widow was open, thankfully it was. Basically I just do not know how to approach this with them to let them know that I, along with my other roommates are not comfortable with anyone smoking in the house, (for smell and deposit reasons). Their obviously trying to cover the smell which is appreciated but because they obviously do not want me to know I don’t know how to casually ask them to smoke outside, especially because I rarely bump into them. I’m also nervous to just to text them about it because I don’t want them to think I’m being aggressive about the situation.  Any advice about this is appreciated. :)",15Jul2020,1

904,"Recently, I've had a sudden awakening to the fact I'm not a good person. I had a breakup a while ago, the girl I was dating came out to me as gay, broke up with me, and later changed it that she was bi. And I'm a dumbass who talks too much and told some of my good friends and and people around school that I trusted, so I've outed somebody as bi, even though I'm bi and realise how much it would suck to be outed. 

I mean, what kind of asshole does that? I've taken (in hindsight) a pretty small breakup, despite it having meant a lot to me (besides the point) and handled it so absolutely immaturely and seriously hurt somebodies feelings.

I'm trying to better myself because of this, but how do I even start to apologise to her? How could I ever make it up to her? How can I better myself? I've fucked up so immensely. Somebody help, please.",15Jul2020,1
906,"\&gt;&gt;&gt;in short: My partner and his mother don't always get along well and he is gearing up to stop communicating with her. How do you deal with your partner's family if they you don't get along? Can you exclude one parent without the rest? How can I best support my partner in this situation?

So some background information: My partner (M22) and I (F22) have been together for 6 years, planning to get engaged later. He is currently deployed and I am preparing to move in with him when he get's back in October. His mom and him have had an on again off again relationship for a while. She has been manipulative towards him, overbearing and plays the victim very often. 

Recently, his mom asked him about his opinion on the riots happening in the beginning of the BLM movement. He gave her his opinion and because she is a police officer he encouraged her to use her voice and platform to encourage stronger policies against police brutality and speak out against violence BUT she took it as 'you hate me, you don't care about my life, etc.' and when he just decided he was going to ignore her because obviously she didn't ask his opinion to have a conversation she didn't understand why he would be upset with her. She also came at me with an instagram dm after I shared a post on my instagram about police brutality and I ignored her too at the direction of my partner because he knew she would just make things worse. In turn, she has started ignoring me lol

The last time we talked about her my partner was saying he felt better when he wasn't talking to her and was essentially wanting to cut her out of his life (without cutting his dad and siblings). I have always been a person that tries to give a person the benefit of the doubt, that she means well but obviously she doesn't know how to go about things.  I don't know. It makes me sad to think about cutting her out but if she's causing him so much pain and headache I obviously want to support him.",15Jul2020,1
907," I’ll try to be concise. I (22F) am in an unexpected and difficult situation and I don’t really know how to handle it. I learned four months ago that my 26-year-old (ex)boyfriend I was with for two years and I was madly in love with, was cheating on me. 

We planned to move in together in September and we often discussed our future together, from my point of view it was a dream. At first I wanted to forgive him because I thought it happened only once and I really believe in second chance but I’ve been learning new things about him for four months. He cheated on me with 5 different women, he built a new relationship with a girl while I was abroad, he was with her for 9 months already when we broke up, he got her pregnant and she aborted when we were still together, today they are a couple, he has alcohol problems, and so on.  

 We have friends in common that I can’t afford to lose because I love them deeply but I don’t know how to handle it. When we are all together he tries to get closer to me and always ends up telling me that he loves me and not her and that he regrets everything. 

 On top of that I realize I don’t necessarily like my studies. I’m graduating in two months as a computer engineer, but I’m already fed up with what I do, I don’t feel like I belong in this field, I'm bad at what I do and useless. I also don’t know where to go because I left the city where I was with my ex. Anyway, I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid that all the decisions I’m going to make now about my future will be biased by my present sadness. 

 I’m a little lost, so if you have advice on how to handle a situation like this and how to make the right decisions in spite of everything, I’ll take it.

ever since then, i’ve been going out, hooking up with guys, and sexting people. it wasn’t until yesterday that i realized i might have a problem. 

i realized i crave attention and/or validation from men when i have sex with them and they want me. it gives me a boost of confidence in that moment and i feel wanted and i feel happy for some reason, like i might actually be worth something or worth love and a relationship .

915,"I just can't relate to any of this. Its like they feel inadequate so instead of working on that they try to take it out on the people around them responding with anger and rage instead of working on themselves. So up front I'm asking why these people are so angry? Like what are they trying to prove exactly? I don't understand it.  


I've mastered Zen. I might not have ever gone to a Monastery or lived as a Monk but at 14 I started meditating every day. Then I started reading Koans. I would say I'm not a Buddhist and more I practice pure Zen. Anytime I find myself angry annoyed or sad I quite my mind and let it pass. I'll give some examples of my interactions:  


I'm sitting at a restaurant one of my friends texts me and says hes going to prank everyone. He orders cheese sticks and refuses to eat them. Everyone but me keeps asking to have one and he says ""no, I just want them. They aren't for eating."" and mocking people for wanting them. This gets another one of my friends (unrelated to the first) angry talking about how its bothering him that he ordered them when no one got an appetizer, and is basically flaunting them. I don't respond to this stimulus at all. My friend 'pranking' everyone keeps sliding them closer to me.   


I ask ""So these aren't for eating?""   


He says ""Nope! No one can have one! I'm not even going to eat them!""  


Me: ""So you are just going to throw them away correct?""  


Him: ""Yep they aren't for eating!""  


Me: ""Let me do you a favor they are perfect for ***YEETING***!"" I then toss them into the trash behind me.  


I then order everyone at the table but him cheese sticks. When he asks why hes not getting him any I say ""Well you wanted them thrown away!""  


Said friend begins demanding I pay for them. I say ""You said you were just going to throw them away. I cut that process short. So why are you angry again?"" This goes on until hes fully screaming at me. I remain totally calm and laugh off everything hes saying. It gets nearly to the point that I think hes going to hit me and I say ""So let me get this straight you are ok with pissing everyone else off, but me, and when I remove their anger you get angry?""  


He screams a few more times and storms off, getting his food to go. Later texting me saying ""hey man, I never want to hear from you again. You took **MY FUN AWAY**."" I reply ""If your fun is pissing everyone off, and my fun is stopping that, then we are at odds. Perhaps learn to take your own medicine.""  


What he doesn't know is this: A separate friend was so angry about the 'joke' (hangry as its put) that he was texting me that if he taunted him again he was going to haul off and hit the dude ordering cheese sticks. I know the dude making the 'I'll hit him claim' isn't joking.  


\------------------------------  


On another occasion I purchased my brother a set of tires. I did this because he couldn't get to work without them. This leads to me getting a call from a family member who is absolutely irate that I didn't purchase something for all the other 'kids' of equal value. I spent about 300 on those tires and to purchase something of equal value for all the kids would have been nearly 6 grand. I reply ""Hey how about this, I spent 300 already so everyone who wants to buy one of the other kids something they need does so? Then its fair."" She then talks about how I'm being unfair to the other kids.  


This conversation slowly esculates to her yelling at me. Initially she started with talking about how ""You don't really care more about him than anyone else do you? I mean thats awful."" I reply to all of these with ""Possessions don't mean anything in terms of care. If he hated his job the correct thing to do would have been to not buy him tires. He loves his job so I purchased them."" With every single comment beyond that point slowly twisting my words.

Eventually after more or less refuting everything she says she more or less yells '**WELL ITS NOT FAIR**!' I reply with ""Well thats fine. Who wants fairness? My brother needed the tires to keep his job, so I bought him tires. I don't care if its not fair."" (Side note: My other family members that are 'the kids' is a huge list of people ranging from 5 -20ish.)  My grandmother begins screaming ""YOU DON'T CARE IF ITS NOT FAIR!""  I reply ""Nope"" she then starts talking about how now shes going to have to call everyone and tell them what an awful thing I did by not giving them $300, but before she can finish I just hang up the phone.  


She calls all the people on said list and all of them compliment what I did. I got texts from a few of my family members basically saying ""hey man good job on buying those tires!"" and a few later where they were like ""Hey why did you tell \[grandmother\] you don't love my kids? Also something about buying your brother tires?""  


\--------------------------  


I call this the 'monk' incident.   


Ever since this I've noticed Buddhists get really pissed when I talk about Zen for some reason and try to 'test' me. Let me tell you now: I love 'failing' those tests.  


So I'm on my colleges campus (this was a few years ago) and a few guys in Orange robes approach me. They are giving a lecture and passing out pamphlets. I decline. They are cool about it but ask why. I reply ""Well I already know everything I need to know about Zen."" One of them inquires about what I know of Zen. I reply:  


(The following is true to my opinion:) ""Well for starters any discussion of Zen is fake. Its a fraud, a sham. I consider most people in the monastic life for any long period of time to be liars. Its not that they are trying to lie, but the whole putting on false airs thing kills all the discussion with those types for me. The Buddha didn't learn to be the Buddha living in a monastery, so why are you? Sorry man I'm just not interested. Also I practice Zen, not Buddhism.""  


The more tenured in the group hears me saying this and comes over and asks me a very generic Koan ([here](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/563896-i-consider-the-positions-of-kings-and-rulers-as-that)) ""I consider the positions of kings and rulers as that of dust motes. I observe treasure of gold and gems as so many bricks and pebbles..."" Before he can finish I cut him off and start going ""blah blah blah blah blah"" sorta dancing around. I reply back with a Koan, to my knowledge, I made up on spot. Coincidentally I had a cup on me. I pull it out and ask ""Is this a cup?"" He says ""yes"" I reply at one of the water bottle filler-up-stations filling it up with water and say ""Not anymore! Its a drink!"" And drinking the water entirely and start trying to joke around with them.  


Somewhere in there the attention of the last guy, some old Asian man. All three of them are clearly holding back anger. Not that they need to. They can say whatever they like to me. He just grabs his two underlings and tells them ""I don't think *this man* (almost spitting the words) needs to attend *our* lecture. Hes clearly enlightened already"" (Sarcasm, if you aren't picking up on it) I yell as they walk away ""Hey have fun with that enlightenment stuff over there! OH, there arent any tenants. That includes ones against having possessions and uhhh... attachments. Don't forget that part!""

The theme park:

&amp;#x200B;

Cutting this story short. I went to a theme park. A guy whos a third wheel to mywife and I starts acting like a wet blanket, a wet blanket I'm not going to wear. He keeps insisting we do what HE wants to do. So I refuse. I tell him ""Hey man if you wanna \[do whatever it is\] go for it. I'm going over here and getting on this ride."" He keeps following us around and DEMANDING!!!!!!!1! that we do what he wants. I keep refusing. It gets to the point that he refuses to talk to me.  


What seems to infuriate him more is my interaction with people around me. While in line I'm talking to people, cutting up with them and my wife. Making jokes and just trying to raise the spirits out in the heat and sun. This really pisses this guy off until he demands we wait in line ...for a roller coaster... THAT ISN'T WORKING! I haven't laughed harder in years. I kept saying ""Wait so you want us to wait for hours in a line for a ride that doesn't work because its new?"" He replies ""***YES, I'VE DONE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. NOW LETS DO WHAT I WANT TO DO!""*** Up to this point I kept telling him ""go for it. If you think you wanna ride it, then go do it. I'm not going to but YOU can.""   


I point out that he wanted to follow us ( clearly else why is he?) and if he didn't want to do what we were doing, THEN DON'T! I also start laughing at the prospect of standing in line for a broken ride. My wife wrangles me a bit and says ""lets just go over there and see"" So I do. First thing I do is stop and ask the engineer on the ground ""Hey when will  this be up?"" He replies ""It won't be, not today at least. Thunderstorm is rolling in we can't work on it.""   


I look at my wifes friend and he says ""I still want to wait and see in this line"" There is a HUGE line.

920,"Hi guys, I'll keep this as short and sweet as possible.  I'm not new to Reddit, this is just a new account for obvious reasons.  As a last desperate attempt to help myself find a new career path, I am hoping y'all can help point me in the right direction.  

I am: 26,M, 4 year degree in business, currently still working at the job I started when I was 18.  I started as a helper making $7.56 digging trenches for gas lines.  I stuck with it, I have made my way to Assistant Manager, and I'm making very decent money for the stage of life I am in and my geographical location.   I own a house free and clear, and I have enough saved so I can afford to go back to school if needed.  I like my job for the most part, my counterparts have shit attitudes and are very negative people, which I hope to get away from.  Most importantly I work for a family company.  If there is one thing I have learned about working for a family company is that they treat you like family, and then they will eventually screw you over like family.... which is why I want to get out.  I think my industry is dying as the push towards going green is growing (even though natural gas/propane is one of the cleanest sources of energy, but that's a different story and doesn't fit the narrative.) 

I enjoy working outdoors (but not opposed to being indoors), being hands on, having a challenge, working with a team, being a part of something bigger, and having a purpose, if that makes sense. I have enrolled into Lineman school (electrical lines, that is) but I want to explore as many options as possible before I commit.  Also, I want to start a family soon, and working 70-80 hours a week would be rather hard.  

Is there anyone out there who has been in a similar situation or with similar issues who could help point me in the right direction?  I appreciate any and all help!

923,"This might be pretty long depending on how well I gather my thoughts and edit afterwards. Also sorry in advance about any grammar errors. 

About a month ago me and a bunch of friends decided we'd go on a trip to a friend's summer cottage for a few nights on the later half of July. Almost everybody agreed instantly and started making plans about how we'd get there and how long we'd stay etc. The cottage is about 150 km (93 miles) away and we quickly decided we'd need a car and someone to drive us there and back (not necessarily the same person). Note that we have about seven people of who 3 will go on their motorbikes. Also note that we didn't plan on an adult being there for the whole time more or less because some alcohol consumption is probably going to take place. 

Basically everybody's parents were more or less accepting and I'm the only one having a hard time. My parents know most of the guys I'm going with but there's a few they haven't met. In the end they firmly said no, with reasons like *""You're no doubt going to do something stupid since you're still a bunch of kids""*,  *""it's so far away""* and *""I can't believe the other parents agreed to this""*. After that I sort of wobbled to my room and had a bit of an emotional moment and sobbed a bit, which is nothing new.

I'm not sure if it's because I'm a weak person, emotional person or just because of my parent's way of arguing but this happens a lot when we exchange opinions or talk about difficult stuff. They don't necessarily raise their voice or make me feel like crying, but something about trying to convince my parents about something and having to have an argument about it makes me feel really weak. When I talk to them, I can't get out the words I was planning to say and what does come out of my mouth sounds fake and made up, even though it isn't. In the end they always shut me down and I just leave feeling defeated. 

I feel conflicted because I think I've always had a good relationship with my parents and we get along well but now I just disagree with them and almost feel like they're taking a big chance of making youthful memories away from me. I've always been an introverted person and never done something like this, until this summer when the friend group started inviting me out to play basketball and hang out. And don't get me wrong, I've known these guys for the past 10 years but just lately rarely hung out with them outside of school, because most of the time it was something like *""Come out here to this big party and drink with us""* which I respectfully declined to. I'm fine with like a bunch of friends who I know asking me to play basketball, but if I have to go to a house I don't know with people I don't recognize, yeah I'm skipping. 

I think I'm a pretty objective person and I can honestly view this as just my parents rightly exercising their authority and responsibility to protect me and I have nothing against that. If they really don't want me to go, then I can't go and that's it. But I haven't really decided where I stand emotionally, since I really want to go make memories and live my life to the fullest but on the other hand, I'm not sure I would even let my own kids go to some unknown place reasonably far away. It's like my teenage hormones are telling me to riot against my parents and honestly just hate them for this, but my logical brain understands the bigger picture and won't let me do something stupid like endanger our parent-child relationship because of a one-time thing like this. But that's just one more reason I'd like to go. I'm only 17 once in my life and this is my third last summer as a real teenager (if *""the teenage years""* stop when you turn 20). 

I know most of this probably sounds like complete bullshit and you'll probably have a really simple answer for this, but I just wanted to write this out firstly for myself to get my thoughts together, and secondly to get advice from people far wiser and older than me. 

If you read this far, I love you and hope you might have something to say. If I left something out or you'd like to ask something, then I'll gladly respond with more information. Sorry if I pissed you off with my insignificant teenage troubles.

925,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 
My friend group of 5 has been deteriorating and it makes me sad. We recently got into an argument against one, her name will be AM. 

Two of us including AM we’re planning to go camping one weekend. Her bfs birthday was also the day we were planning on leaving. A few days before we leave she mentions that her bf is getting a routine test for Covid and depending on his results she won’t be able to go. (the way she mentioned this made me really suspicious that she just wanted to stay for her bfs birthday) a day before we leave she says he tested positive and that she won’t be able to go. Both her and her bf stop sharing their locations with us an hour afterwards.

The unsharing locations solidified what my intuition was telling me. That she was lying about something.. 

She is aware that we think she isn’t being truthful about something and she’s hasn’t spoken to us since. We wouldn’t have made it a big deal if she had been completely honest. 

Are we wrong for assuming she isn’t being completely truthful?",15Jul2020,1

So at least for me, (20F) they said i cant come back until i get my results and feel better. Now for him,(21M) his job didnt give a crap how he felt or not. Covid or not they told him he had to work and i said thats bullshit that theyre willing to put their own customers and enployees at risk. Anyway he didnt go to work. 

So we are getting tested tomorrow morning. I told him hey you are aware that you may have to pay for yourself right 
He got upset, huffing and puffing saying no way im paying for it. Ill just get my grandmother to pay for me. I said whatever. 

We both live with my parents. We have a baby, (7months old M) soooo we have responsibilities. We both dont make very good money but we still need to care for ourselves. I know damn well he didnt expect my dad to cover his ass everytime we end up at some kind of fee. I paid for our oil change (50$ no biggie bc we are adults right, also my dad handed us his car because he knew we would need it, very thankful.) i paid for my dads lot rent (200$) even though i make about 120$ weekly. I dont complain because we are adults and we still live under my dads roof. He on the other hand makes about 250$ weekly. Way more, and i dont ask much from him. 

Basically, what do i do? Weve had many arguments(as recent as a week and a half ago...) about how we are not compatible. How i dont expect him to be responsible in the future if he isnt trying now.

929,"Hi y'all,

I am 23 yrs old and I have a 12 yr old cousin who is like a sister to me. I used to babysit her all the time, I used to change her diapers, I've watched her grow and become the pre teen she is today. All I want is the best for her but I am worried for her mental health and I just want to be there for her.

So my cousin has divorced parents. Mom left her and dad because it was ""too much"" for her but then she got married and had another kid right away. My uncle (cousin's father) raised her as a single dad. 

As soon as my uncle found a great girl and got in a relationship with her, my cousin's mom was not having it because she had been expecting to get back with my uncle once she was done with that second marriage (horrible, I know) She was cruel to my uncle and his girlfriend. 

About 2 years ago, mom suddenly wants full custody of my cousin. My uncle is not a wealthy man and did what he could to pay for lawyers and all that, but in the end, she basically won.

They now have split custody of her. My cousin will be going back and forth every year to her mom and dad. Parents now live in different cities (about a 4 hour drive away) and she just started her year with her mom. The instability in her life worries me enough.

My cousins mom is one of the most manipulative people I have ever met. When I was younger and more innocent, I used to love her and idolize her. But once I started seeing how much she was hurting my family, especially my cousin, I realized she was someone who cares about no one but herself.

She tries to pin my cousin against us and I have noticed, my cousin gets extremely anxious if her mom is brought up in conversation. She even bought my cousin a separate phone from the one her dad bought her because she wanted her to have her own phone while she's with her? (I hope that makes sense)

I was texting my cousin a few days ago from her other phone and the conversation ended very concerning for me. She randomly ended halfway through our convo by saying ""Oh no got to go sorry bye."" Then the day after, her mom sent me a request on Facebook to chat with my cousin over Messenger Kids. She basically wants to monitor the conversation I have with my cousin. I'm an adult, this is ridiculous. I don't want this woman monitoring what I talk about with my cousin because I want to create a safe space for her.

I know I can't do anything to get her out of the situation with her mom, especially with the pandemic going on. I just want to know how to be there for her. I'm very afraid her mom will try to ""brainwash"" her in to staying with her once she turns 13. She has mentioned to my cousin before that she can choose to stay with her once she's older. Any advice is appreciated.

Sorry for the long post, this has just been going on for too long and I just want my cousin to be okay.",15Jul2020,1

937,"First of all, I'm white. And I used to be a racist. Like, a major racist. I don't even want to talk about how racist I was. I would insist I wasn't racist while justifying racism. I was the epitome of white fragility. Anyways. In the past years, however, I realized how stupid I was and I actually started listening to people who experience racism rather than trying to tell them they were overly sensitive. 

I grew up in a household that was and is quite racist. I've been reading a lot of articles/essays/books on racism and I started seeing that the way most white people around me treat people of color is rather horrific. However, I don't know what to do about it. 

I don't want to send them into white-fragility-mode.

But I need to say something because I know it's not okay to just sit back and let them bash people because of their skin color.

But I'm just a teenager and my family can get really rude and unkind. 

For example, the other day I asked my mother why it was that white people always point out someone's skin color in conversations if the person isn't white. That was a weird sentence, so I'll give an example. If person A is talking about a problem they have with a coworker who is white, they'll say ""So-and-so, my coworker, did this...""

but if the coworker isn't white, they'd say ""so-and-so, my coworker--she's Black/Chinese/Arabian/Hispanic/etc-- did this...""

I don't even know if that's racism. I didn't say it was. All I did was ask why people do that. And my mom got super mad and started yelling at me and telling me I was ungrateful and that I was accusing her of being racist and I didn't know what I was talking about. I explained that I did the same thing and I didn't think it was racist I was just curious. But she was upset and wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the day. And obviously, she never gave me an answer to the question (if someone else has an answer I'd appreciate it).

I had thought through everything I said before I said it, editing it in my mind so I wouldn't accidentally be rude and still it was apparently rude, even though all I said was ""Why do we always point out people's races if they aren't white?""

And I've heard my parents and friends and other adults say really racist things/laugh at really racist things that I won't even write here because I don't want to hurt anyone. 

I feel guilty not calling them out when they say really awful things, but I also feel guilty for making them feel bad.

940,"This is actually my mom experiencing this issue. She came to me looking for suggestions, but honestly I don’t know how to maneuver this one!

Our family is good friends with our neighbor, who is a recent widow in her early 60s. Let’s call my neighbor Julie. Julie’s only child is her small dog, who she walks around our neighborhood several times a day. My mom just adopted a rescue puppy, and she likes to walk in the evening with Julie and her dog. She enjoys Julie’s company and the exercise. 

Julie used to be the president of our neighborhood’s homeowners association, until dramatically resigning last year. Although she isn’t on the board anymore, she still plays an active role in policing the neighborhood. On these walks she takes time to make note of any houses with landscaping violations, dead grass, toys laying in yards, or anything else that might be a violation of the HOA’s covenants. She takes pictures and reports them to the current president or my dad, the VP. 

So, obviously, she has something to say every time she observes someone speeding. She stops dead in her tracks, gives the driver a shitty look, and shouts at them at the top of her voice to slow down. In one instance, my mom and Julie were walking when a teenager was going a little fast in his sports car trying to impress some girls (classic lol). My mom reported that it was really nothing to get upset over, but Julie screamed at him and later told his mom that he had been speeding through the neighborhood.

This embarrasses my mom a lot, and she’s worried that Julie is going to piss someone off and they’re going to retaliate and get angry or violent. My mom doesn’t know how to ask her politely to stop or tone it down because it makes her not want to walk with her, not to mention it’s just not really an appropriate reaction in general. Julie also used to yell at kids who rode their bikes through the grass in my family’s yard, even though my parents have told her repeatedly they don’t care and there’s no need to tell them off. 

Any suggestions to get my neighbor to chill out?

TL,DR: My neighbor shouts and makes a scene when she observes drivers speeding in our neighborhood and it worries and embarrasses my mom.",15Jul2020,1

943,"For anonymity I’m going to call my boyfriend Harry, his best friend and housemate Sam, and Sam’s girlfriend Lily. 

Sam and Lily met and started a relationship a few months prior to me moving to the area and meeting Harry. I started dating Harry in October last year. Harry and Sam live together, and me and Lily spend most of our week at their house. I became good friends with Sam and Lily, and Harry also became good friends with Lily. We would go on double dates and such. 

Shortly into meeting Harry but prior to being in a relationship with him, I realised how much Lily flirted with him. Just small comments that haven’t stuck with me, but I can remember feeling a bit odd about them. Lily would frequently take Harry shopping or for food whilst Sam was at work. She even took him abroad for a day trip once which still makes me feel weird. Some days I would get back from work and be sat at Harry and Sams house whilst Sam was at work and I would realise that Harry and Lily had gone out without me despite knowing I was coming round. Because me and Harry weren’t dating at this point, I didn’t say anything about this to Lily but I did tell Harry that I thought it was very rude for me to be excluded when I’m physically sat at his house on my own. Harry is a huge people pleaser, but he understood and these outings with just Lily stopped. 

When Harry and I became exclusive, the flirting became a lot more regular and obvious to me. I was also told by Harry that Lily had talked shit about me. I confronted Lily about this back in February, and about the flirting and previous situations of me being left out. I told her that I had been feeling as though she liked Harry more than a friend for a while. She apologised for making me feel excluded, and reassured me that she has never felt romantic attraction to Harry, they are simply very good friends. She also agreed to try and end the flirting. 

Since then, the flirting hasn’t stopped. Harry does not flirt back so I don’t understand why she does it, but I’ve seen her act the same around other males too. I was already planning on having a conversation again about this with her, but I was scared of potentially ruining our friendship. I’m a very anxious and non-confrontational person anyway. 

However, last night we all got together and had a few drinks. None of us were drunk, but definitely a bit tipsy. We were on the topic of Lily’s ex best friend (calling her Ella). Ella had a one night stand with Harry months before we met and then confessed that she loved him as soon as I came into the picture and was generally just a horrible person to me, (but that’s another story). Lily, out of nowhere, said “I have definitely thought about how Harry could be the one for me”. I was shocked, Harry was shocked, and Sam was just sat there. Sam has cheated on Lily before, so Lily can basically say whatever she likes about any boys and get away with it because she’ll just bring up the cheating scenario if Sam tells her she’s being disrespectful. The room was silent and Lily very quickly changed the conversation. 

I always had the feeling that she liked Harry more than a friend, and even if she doesn’t now, (who knows when she was referring to), I feel so betrayed that she had told me she had never felt anything towards Harry when I opened up to her, and then she decides to confess in a room full of people (there were other housemates present too) instead of talking to me privately. It made me feel extremely embarrassed and I could feel eyes on me. I went to bed shortly after, and I think she can tell I’m pissed off by it because she’s been trying to speak to me a lot today, but she hasn’t addressed what she said last night. I spoke to Sam about it and he seems completely unphased, like this is her normal behaviour. Harry and I spoke and he thinks it’s extremely weird. 

Sorry for the long story, but I’m at a complete loss on what to do now. If it was anyone else I would block them and never speak to them again, but I see her very frequently since our boyfriends live together and we also share some of the same friends and I don’t want things to be awkward. Like I said before, I hate confrontation and the whole living situation makes it so much worse. Should I say something to her? Try and forget about it? Wait for her to bring it up?

So myself [26M] and K [28F] met 4 and half years ago right before I moved to another city 7 hours away and we hit it off really well which eventually blossomed into a great friendship. We would be in fairly constant contact through our mutual love of video games and would game together quite regularly. I've always had feelings for her but didn't admit to them until last summer when we got even closer, gamed mostly everyday and planned a trip together to go to Europe. After admitting these feelings, she went with it and admitted she had a bit towards me too and was saying all summer how she wanted to sleep with me and we should do it while in Germany etc. At this point, I wasn't entirely sure where my career was going top take me and I was hoping to be able to move to her city for it which got her perked up and excited. Long story short, it continued all summer of us flirting and such, I was extremely happy that I was able to be vulnerable and open up to this incredible girl only for it to come to a depressing halt when suddenly we're on our trip and nothing happens and she says ""that's territory I don't want to get into with you."" I was a bit pushy I'll admit and she was pretty upset about it. When we got back, she pretty well ignored me for a couple months, I got depressed to the point I nearly accepted a position across the country to start fresh and cut her out entirely. I decided it wasn't worth it and we eventually reconnected and were pretty well back to normal in February, drinking and gaming and thoroughly enjoying each others company everyday, especially during this pandemic.

One day we decided to stream while we drank and gamed but it ended up in a heated exchange between us, me calling her out on some hypocritical things she was doing. This is where I learned K, who professes to ""care and be loving to everyone"" selfishly refuses to accept any and all wrongdoing. I pretty much had to fall on the sword and take the entire blame in an attempt to make amends and work through it which she pretty well ignored. That was around another month of little contact, I'm pretty upset and distraught that someone who said ""I love you Joe, I'm also happy how we met and have stayed in touch. You're like my best friend"" days before this drama. This was after I showed my admiration for her for being so positive when she was going through some shit. It made me feel like she's put on some facade, and her claiming to ""value every friendship she has"" is merely her valuing people's positive look on her and really only caring about the fact people don't dislike her.

Through all this, I just tried to look past it and move on and try to get back to some normalcy. Well the other day, I asked if she wanted to game which she responded that she had a friend over the night before and they got hammered and was too tired to game. It was probably a mistake on my end to say this but I did anyway and said ""Well don't lead him on like you did to me, please. That shit kills."" Her sarcastic and dismissive response spoke volumes. I then admitted to her that in my depressive state when we got back from our trip I nearly moved across country and cut her out entirely. There has been no response since and this is where I feel like I should just give up and stop hoping she'll come around and realize the shit she put me through despite all the good I've done for her and support I've given, all of which has gone unreciprocated.

TLDR; Best friend that I had strong feelings for leads me on the entire summer leading up to a trip we planned together. She decided it wasn't territory she wanted to get into with me, I'm left depressed and heart broken when we return, nearly cut her out and move across country. Things went back to normal until a regrettable night of gaming in which I call her out on her hypocrisy forces me to take full blame to make amends. She's dismissive of my issues and refuses to accept any blame.",15Jul2020,1
945,"It’s a long story but cute, interesting, and kind of sad. So here it goes:

I’m a closeted Bisexual Man, 21 years old and have recently accepted myself. I was in search of new LGBT friends/possible relationships so I started to think of LGBT people I knew because I would enjoy being around like-minded people. One guy from high school came to my mind, we’ll call him ‘James’. I had never said a word to him in my life though, so I just decided I’d message him and see where it went, back in late April. James and I exchanged our phone numbers and Snapchat and began to talk.

As it turns out, James, like me, is 21 and in the closet. But unlike me, he is simply gay. Also, apparently I’m the first person he’s ever come out of the closet to. I ask why that is and he said it’s because He, His Family, and every single one of his Friends are Jehovah’s Witnesses. Apparently if he were to come out as gay, His Family, Friends, and Church would abandon him. He copes with his homosexuality by saying it’s okay for him to be gay, but it’s sinful for him to commit homosexual acts. He tells me only to expect to be his platonic friend and not to expect anything more than a platonic friendship with him, because all of these factors make him unavailable. I agree, so we continue to be friends and talk.

We start to snapchat and text all the time, like 24/7 we were bombarding each other’s phones. He finally dropped a big truth bomb on me:

James told me he had *big* crush on me *all throughout* high school. We had never even exchanged a SINGLE word in school, yet he knew and remembered everything about me. He somehow knew my middle name, certain things I tweeted back in 2014, where I lived, what kind of car I drove, my nonchalant demeanor, certain outfits I wore, and *even* the way our gym teacher would call out my name to take attendance! :)

Weeks go by of 24/7 conversation, and he basically cuts it off. James says he *likes* me too much to where it would be impossible for him to simply be *only* platonic friends and he wanted to nip it in the bud before emotions got out of hand, which made sense. After about a week of no contact, he was drawn to back to me and started talking to me again despite the agreement. We talk for about two weeks again, then all the sudden, he again says he feels like his emotions are getting out of hand with the way he feels for me. He, yet again, said he basically can’t just be platonic friends with me and even just talking to me is making him anxious and restless. He assured me that he thinks Im intelligent, cool, funny and attractive and that anyone would be lucky to have me. We agree to stop talking again.

A month of no contact goes by, and he messages me again. He basically says he takes back everything he said about the no-contact-rule and he wants to be friends and hangout. We start getting like overtly flirty and whatnot. Good morning/night texts, in contact 24/7, and sending flirty pics. Nothing vulgar but just flirty stuff like shirtless pics, cute pictures of his hands, hearts, cute poses, and all of that type of stuff. Remember this, it’s important: I said I was afraid he would leave me again for the 3rd time and he said not to worry about it and that he wouldn’t.

He said he was going to make a painting for me. We hangout with each other two times like *all* day. We kind of cuddle together, he laid his head on my chest, and we would hold hands a lot. We would go to the gym and workout together but afterwards he says he can’t even go out to eat with me because I make him too nervous and he gets intimidated and he loses his appetite. He wouldn’t even eat anything at home afterwards either. He’s always tapping his feet and fingers and whatnot because he says I just make him so nervous. I’ve seen the way he looks at me sometimes and his pupils are so dilated you would swear he is on LSD. He even cutely admitted that ever since we first added each other on Snapchat he would always stalk my SnapLocation and SnapScore every single time he’d open his app, like what! :)

I had a family vacation planned and James is being all cute about it. Badgering me making sure I’m packed, wants to know once I’ve landed, for me to be safe, he’s going to miss me, and he even made me a *personalized* 3 HOUR long Spotify Playlist for me to listen to so I can ‘think of him’. He is just so funny, and sweet, not to mention hot, he’s just my type and I think we are in each other’s leagues perfectly and are like a really good match for one another, it feels like we have genuine chemistry together and I love it. I was bordering on having legit strong feelings for him, hell I definitely liked him a lot and had a huge soft spot for him. He is adorable.

A week into my vacation, James randomly texts me this message yesterday, “Sorry I’ve been distant these past few days, but I’ve been thinking about it and I dont think I like you ‘like that’. When I was trying to flirt with you it felt forced and I didnt really enjoy it. Sorry, I just didn’t want to keep you in the dark.” All I said back was “Okay” and no words have been exchanged since.

So just like the first two times he went no-contact with me, is this his way of doing it again? 

1) Did he seriously fake the flirting with me? Is he really being serious and genuine about his lack of feelings given everything I’ve said we have been through?

2) Or maybe he didn’t want to look like he was abandoning me a third time like he promised he would not, so he is using his supposed ‘lack of feelings’ as an excuse to cut things off because he knows his Jehovah’s Witness Closeted Lifestyle is ultimately going to lead us nowhere good anyways? 

3) He told two of his Jehovah’s Witness friends he is gay and about his situation with me and I know they are all 3 hanging out a lot this previous week, I wonder if they are encouraging him to cut me off for religious reasons?

4) Or maybe he is just having internal conflict with his religion and got skittish and wanted to end things out of guilt and anxiety like before? 

Maybe a combination of all 4 possibilities?

After all like I said, if he came out of the closet he would lose everything, and maybe he is just pretending he doesn’t like me as an excuse to cut me off completely for good this time in the name of self preservation? Maybe he thinks if he says “Yeah I like you but we can’t do this” that I will have hope and still pursue him and suck him back in? Maybe that’s his way of ending it totally by crushing all hope and faking ‘not liking me’? 
Maybe he has just thought our relationship through to it’s logical conclusion... his life falling apart? 

Regardless, this relationship with him is clearly a push/pull type of thing and is *very* unhealthy, I admit that.

Im just so damn confused. I was wondering if we can talk about this. Again be brutally honest, what do you think? What do you think from the 4 options I’ve listed? Pretty upset and have no one to talk to about all of this because I am in the closet. This all sucks so much.",15Jul2020,1
946,"My friend (F) (now ex-friend) told me her husband has threatened to kill himself if she doesn’t cut all ties with her friends, including me. This is not the first time he has threatened himself to control her. She wants me to do nothing and ignore the threat and cut ties. I feel one day he will either follow through on the threat or hurt her or her daughter. Do I do nothing or do I report it to the police and his Navy command (multiple states away)?",15Jul2020,1
947,"I am 18 years old, and I live with my stepdad and mom. My mother is 45 years old and is the owner of a little market in my town. She decided to try her luck on lottery tickets and so she told me to pick one out and I did. I picked it and scratched and the ticket revealed to win 10,000$.

Immediately my mother tells everybody she won 10,000$ with her “sons luck”. 

I do think this money can benefit my family and I. But I could certainly use some for myself. I asked my mother for just 25%, which is about 2,500$. She immediately refused, and instead offered me two options. 

First one was just 500$.

Second one was a one month deposit of rent so I could have my own place. 

That’s it. When I argued why only 500$, she exclaimed that the money is for the house and the bills and my car note (I should add that she is paying my car) and other stuff. I could see where she is coming from.

But I still think 500$ is not enough. She is constantly asking me to move out and find my own place, and I told her this money is perfect for just that lol.

What do you guys think? I don’t want this money to impact the relationship of me or my mother",15Jul2020,1

949,"Hi everyone, I wasn’t too sure where to seek any information or advice on this matter so I decided to take to trusty redditors. I used to work for a small company (i’m going to keep out names, employees, etc. for now) that I left not even two weeks ago. Things seemed wrong and kind of corrupt, perhaps even fraudulent. It all started in mid to late March when COVID really began to kick off. I guess the company took a huge blow due to it, though we never closed, and was really hard up for money. There was 3 locations and eventually the main location was forced to close and ours was made to be the primary, and we had little to no work coming in whatsoever. Employees were coming in only two days a week and some 3 days with NO pay at that point. They began telling employees to come in full time again and to continue to collect unemployment while working with no pay (basically to look at UI as paychecks), which they all did to keep their jobs. I wasn’t getting my full hours back yet but I was the only one being payed for some reason, though they told me they’d pay me ‘under the table’ and ‘not report it’ and that I can also continue collecting UI. Obviously I didn’t do that, I reported that money. Now it’s seeming like I may be getting screwed over from the PUA that I did receive. Should I talk to a lawyer or something? Do I have any grounds to take action against said employer? If so, should I? I’ve never been in a position like this before and don’t really know how to handle it. Sorry if this is kind of long, thank you all i’m advance for your help!

P.S.
I do know that they did receive that government grant for businesses or whatever it was, and if what i’ve heard is correct, 75% of it is supposed to go to payroll right? idk.... They certainly weren’t putting it to that.",15Jul2020,1
950,"So I had finished my senior year of college and made another year of nothingness. I failed the same class 4 times, and keep lying to my parents saying I passed them but just need another year of college to get my degree.

I know I can’t go to college for another two years without saying something, but I feel like it’s my responsibility and that I should take out student loans or something. My girlfriend also has these expectations of me and I can’t just continue to lie to her either. I just don’t know what to say to either of them. I know the best method is to just be truthful and honest but I’m so far in this hole it makes me choke trying to climb out.

951,"My situation:

* Thankfully employed, but 10% reduction in salary due to COVID economy
* Living in 550 sq ft 1 bedroom apartment with 2 cats
* I  can still afford my rent after pay reduction, but after all monthly  expenses I'm not just breaking even or maybe able to save an extra  $100-$200 per month
* Have a good chunk of money saved up in short term savings, about 6 months worth of living expenses if i lost my job
* Working from home, all day every day

954,"Hey my name is Dan, I just turned 20 years old five days ago and I can honestly say I haven't done anything with my life, I lack quite a few social skills  because of my parents. When I was younger I was constantly belittled, spoke down to, pushed, grabbed and threatened pretty much all the time. I still get pushed about and threatened and stuff just I think less of it now and carry on. Yeah I still break down alot as you could guess.

    Half the time I feel like it's my fault that I somehow caused them to dislike me so much where if I speak to them about how  I've somehow done something I get screamed at. Yeah I may seem really wimpy being 20 years old allowing myself to be treated this way aswell as still living at home but I dont know what to do or what my first step should be to getting away from this mess I'm in.

    I can't get a job with all this Covid-19 crap going on I can't even go out and apply for any near me because I have no way to get there and back because of the bus time issues for my area. Being in the middle of nowhere, 7 miles away from any other town and all.

956,"I moved into my first apartment about two weeks ago with two of my best friends and so far so good. we get along well, our habits don't clash too much, but i have a problem with one of them and it kind of adds a little toxicity to my daily life.

  
I should begin by saying that it's not his fault at all. the problem is that i'm a hypersensitive person and I just now realize that it's not that cool. my roommate has been frustrated with a lot lately about his job, about his education and about his relationships with others and probably with himself to some extent. he might even have frustrations about our relationship and my moving in, since we built up a lot of expectations about it and the expectations weren't really met and he might be frustrated with that. thing is, i feel his frustration, literally. i'm just a big ass sponge for others' emotions and i just can't have my own bubble of emotions that would surround me, i just feel whatever vibe others are in and i take it all in. 

&amp;#x200B;

this morning, i woke up, really cozy, made some coffee, a breakfast, drew a little bit on my wacom with corel 2021. it was really chill and cool. i was vibin' until he woke up and started hyperfocusing on how the internet has been ridiculously slow for about 2 weeks, and then he went in the living room to play metal gear solid and proceeded to frustrate and swear about the game for like an hour and a half. i was in my room, but i could still hear him and that legit just killed my vibe for the whole day. and it happens quite often these days since he's kind of living through a rough patch. i tried talking to him about it, but i don't think he understands how this affects me or what he could even do about it, and he doesn't seem to think he has any frustrations to be concerned about and he keeps emphasising he's not a person who stresses about anything in life (he didn't say that in that specific conversation). i feel kind of hopeless about it and i don't know how i could even learn how to not absorb every feeling other people have. it's debilitating and i just wanna vibe when i can't vibe or else i'm just going to feel like utter shit everyday. i just don't know what to do.",15Jul2020,1
957,"So I'm new to reddit I'm a 22 F this fast food job is my 3rd job. I've worked there since March 2019 and I have not minded it until the past few months when Covid started. It all started when one of the rude managers yelled at me about our drive thru time. I was told to go talk to our store owner by our gm who has been great to me I'll call him Carl because the owner was there since we were starting the covid procedures back in around March I think. Anyways I have asbergers and adhd I ended up getting upset and almost cried being yelled at by this manager about the drive thru time. I couldnt control it. She kept yelling about how I'm making the time go down by little mistakes. She did this in the rudest way possible. I couldnt understand the people on the speaker so they pulled up to order their $40 order at the window. So Carl had me go talk to the owner for 30 mins for lunch time which left the rude manager ""by herself"" on drive thru. The owner and I talked about what's going on and my feelings etc. Husband is in the military and was away so I felt sad enough already and being treated like crap didnt do it for me. She was in fact not by herself and I've previously tried to help her out as much as possible and she has always been rude to me when I try to help. Anyways fast forward a few months pretty much the same thing happens with me again not understanding the customer at the speaker. I overhear this manager talking with a newer employee who is also lazy and rude. I heard her talking about how I'm always making excuses about me not feeling good, cant hear anything, etc. Just overall rude and inappropriate things to talk to someone about my own mental and physical health to another employee right in front of me. I confront her asking why are you talking about me in front of me and she just starts yelling I'm no talking to you over and over. I explain to her what she is saying and doing is wrong and I wont tolerate being treated like shit. She continues yelling at me and cursing which I never cursed at her but I raised my voice  too because she wouldnt let me speak. I kept trying to reason with her and I could not. She told me since that previous day the owner talked to me for 30 mins she has made it her goal not to talk to me ever again. How are you supposed to work with someone as a manager and not talk to one of the employees? I've been nothing but nice and helpful to everyone I can. I didnt tolerate her yelling at me and I walked out during lunch time and said fuck it. I apologize this is so long and run on it's just easier for me to communicate this way. 

About a week later my gm Carl speaks to this manager about how she wasnt treating me right etc and I was upset. I wanted it to be resolved as best as I could. I felt discriminated against because she knew of my disability and how I am in general. My mom wanted me to file a grievance against her to corporate. I was considering it if it didnt get resolved. Carl ended up scheduling us on different days so we never see each other. This was because I did not feel comfortable in a hostile environment like that and I deserve to be treated fairly and not like a piece of garbage. This continued for a few months during this pandemic. I'm glad I never worked with her since then. She does come through the drive thru sometimes while I'm working and I still try to be as nice as I can but she just ignores me and asks me to get someone else to give her her stuff. I've tried for months to do my best. I've started to really hate my job the only thing I like to do is clean and serve the customers in the lobby. I completely hate drive thru. It is the worst part of that place. I love helping people and cleaning and just overall doing my job. Anyways I really hate it here now and I recently started applying at jobs. I ended up getting a job at a retail store that sells technology and office stuff. I have previously worked at another version of this kind of store for about 9 months before I moved here. I really liked it most of the time and i already like my new job more than my fast food job. I've only been at this new job for almost 2 weeks and i already like my coworkers and managers are relaxed and cool. I'm still doing some training on the specialty areas in the store but since I've done a lot of it before at the other job a few years ago I get the hang of it very fast. Again sorry this is just how I vent and explain things. Usually I use all kinds of proper grammar and punctuation. 

So I work both jobs currently and the schedules have started to conflict because they are done on different days. I forgot to mention my fast food job is really great with giving me time off to visit family etc often but my new job said they are very flexible and are completely fine with me doing that as well. It has gotten to the point I call in sick more often at my fast food job. I have told them I have another job too and they still put the wrong days on the schedule. I'm basically asking what's the best way to quit and or manage my two jobs. I really like my general manager Carl he is awesome but theres so many new employees that keep coming in. Previously one of my fun coworkers quit the fast food job along with my favorite manager got transferred awhile ago and since then it's been sad. 

My new coworkers are super relaxed and not high strung so far and I love working hard but also need people I can be myself around. It really sucks because I never feel like a real person I just feel like I'm an idiot kid still. If you guys have any advice it is greatly appreciated. Again I'm very sorry if I made this too long I just need some advice.",15Jul2020,1
958,"Do I qualify for unemployment benefits in Washington state? 

I’m currently looking for a new job, but due to the current situation, it’s not the easiest time to find one. I feel trapped. I got this job shortly before everything started shutting down, and I keep telling myself I can stick it out until I find a new job, but it’s getting harder and harder.

I’m the only employee at a commercial business. My boss doesn’t give 10 minutes breaks required by law, but instead, he gives 40 minute lunches. Lunch time typically is at 1 when we start work at 9, but can vary significantly day to day. For instance, I worked 5.5 hours yesterday before taking my “lunch”. On Monday I also worked over 5 hours before having a break. On Saturday I worked 5 hours with no break and right when I thought I was going to get my break, we conveniently went home early, imagine that. No paid 10 minute break for me on Saturday. Friday I worked close to 6 hours before being told to take my break or do one last thing and “just get out of here”. I opted to wrap it up in 30 minutes instead of taking my lunch only to come back and work for 30 minutes. My employer is fully aware of the law, I’ve heard his wife discuss how they could get it trouble, but consistently they conveniently ignore what time it is depending on what task I’m working on. 

On top of not having breaks it’s “dress code” to wear a long sleeve shirt despite being over 80 degrees outside and +10 degrees inside. I constantly feel like I’m going to faint no matter the water I consume. The dress code is completely unnecessary, unlike my previous job, working with steel it was necessary. 

My employer and his wife constantly fight too, often times screaming at each other at the top of their voices, and he constantly calls her stupid and racist slurs (she’s Chinese). It’s very uncomfortable, I don’t agree with the reasoning, and often times have to be fake about it and take sides with my boss.

Oh, we don’t wear masks at work either, despite being required to right now. My boss is the biggest narcissist I’ve ever met. He won’t go anywhere that follows the rules and makes him wear a mask either ultimately putting me and my family at risk. There’s much more I’m forgetting right now, I’m sure. I can’t take it anymore. 

Do I qualify for unemployment for any of the above reasons? I’m not sure I can stick it out any longer.",15Jul2020,1

960,"Hey guys, I need some advice on a situation. I am 23 and I have recently been talking to this girl 22 over insta dm. She used to go to my school and she was the year below me. We never talked back in school but we have always known of each other and she was friends with my younger sister.

She has had a bf for 4 years now but last year I dmd her to chat her up but she mentioned she was in a relationship etc. A few days ago, so pretty much a year later she messaged me saying she’s been thinking of me all year and things are not going well with her and her bf.

We have been chatting every now and then, (I’m trying to not show too much validation) but she is flirting and saying how much she likes me but never thought I’d go for her because she has low confidence in herself and she sees me as someone who’s out of her league. 

She is giving hints that she wants to smash, (especially when she drunk text me the other day) but she isn’t talking about her bf anymore and he’s out of her insta bio now. Do I take this as she’s trying to get validation from me and she has no integrity? 

I’m confused on the situation because I could go for it and smash, but then idk maybe just leave things there, but I feel she might be having a rough patch and it’s a temp thing, maybe I smash and she goes back to her bf kinda thing. Idk any advice is appreciated",15Jul2020,1
961,"I made a post about this awhile ago but some new things happened. This is what I wrote about (with some changes): For context, I am a twitch streamer, granted - not a famous one, but have on average maybe seven viewers per stream. Even though I'm small, I've still gotten some viewers that are really nice. They've never been inappropriate or sexual with me - just genuinely nice (has helped me with setting up the streams, helped me in games etc). Some of them have also donated, not a big amount but I appreciate any donations I get! So, there's one viewer I've had for awhile who has donated like once (around 10 dollars or something) and has helped me in games and helped me with the stream. He's just genuinely a nice person (never said anything inappropriate etc). 

Now, he recently messaged me and said he and some friends were going to drive their car around in our country to see the different cities and will drive through my city and asked if I wanted to meet him and some of his friends for lunch or something. Without even thinking I said yes because I really want to have some friends! Ever since I've moved to this city I've struggled with not having friends (I only know one other person that lives here) and it gets really lonely. My boyfriend lives in another city and doesn't feel comfortable moving to mine cause he's, well, a real mamas boy lol. I've tried to convince him but he says he's not ready. So I can't even hang out with him in my city, we have to travel 1,5 hour with train to get to each other. 

I told him about maybe meeting up with the viewer and his friends and my boyfriend immediately said ""no"". I was really disappointed and tried to ask him why. He said that it's weird and that I can ""just befriend someone at my university"" and I tried explaining to him that it's not that easy. Of course I've tried to befriend people in my class at Uni but it just doesn't click so I haven't gotten any friends. He made it seem so obvious since he's so social and has an easy time making friends - he doesn't seem to understand that i's not so easy for everyone. 

I got really sad when he said no. I understand his point of view, that jealousy is a factor. He said ""How would you react if I met some viewers of mine IRL?"" and I thought really hard about it and honestly - I wouldn't mind as long as it's in public and they're not like in his house or anything. But of course I know why he's kinda insecure about it because he loves me and is scared of losing me. Sometimes it feels like he doesn't want me to have friends at all because when I meet guys that i connect with (friendly wise) he always says no. Which SUCKS cause (not to be like 'imnotlikeothergirls' but I've always had it easier befriending males. Not sure why, it has just always been like that. But now it feels like I can't do that anymore cause he gets jealous. He feels controlling when he just says ""No, you can't meet them"" and not even trying to understand why I want to meet them. Obviously we're gonna do it in a public place and I'm not just gonna invite them to my apartment.


So, I at last was able to convice him but he got mad when we talked on the phone. He told me that he alwyas has to ""keep a watch"" on me cause he doesn't believe I can take care of myself. I was like, I CAN DO IT. I have my own apartment, he still even lives with his parents. I can be independent. He told me he didnt like how, that when they asked me to hang out, I said yes ""too easily"". I was like tf you mean by that? Should I play hard to get when friends ask me to hang out? When I question him he's like ""I don't know..."" and backtracks cause he realized that what he said was wrong(I guess?). I've told him the friends are not gonna see where I live, I'm not gonna be in their car and we will only see each other in public (so he feels safer and just main safety for myself too since ive never met them)

 but he still tells me I shouldve been more careful???? And i'm like how??? What couldve done differently and how should I change? He answered ""I dont know, just look at [insert his guy friends' girlfriends names]. and that really hurt me. Like I should be more like them? I continued to ask him what he meant and the backtracked but then I asked ""You mean theyre more mature than me?"" and he was like ""Yes, I guess"". That hurt me so much. I started crying. Like, how am I more immature than them? I got so sad that he said that cause i really dont know what I couldve done differently. When I ask him he just says ""i dont know, just dont say yes too easy"". I really don't understand. It just feels like he doesnt want me to meet them tomorrow. nd i'm gonna have such a bad conscious cause he is probably gonna be very passive aggressive, like; ""Good youre having fun,im here all alone"" or something like that. 

He even did it today when I told him theyre coming tomorrow, he was like""but i was gonna come visit you tomorrow!"" (which he wouldnt, we have both agreed to save money and not visit each other til my bday). He did it just so I would get bad consiousness it feels like.
When we talked he also got pretty bad and had ""an attitude"" when we talked (raised his voice, sounded mad etc). When I confronted him about it he was like, ""So what? Am I not allowed to express my emotions? Its normal to take out your emotions on each other if youre irritaded"".He has always felt this way. I told him that if either of us feel annoyed, we should take a break from the conversation and come back when we feel relieved and better.

Please, what should I do? What should I tell him? Am I doing anything wrong? Is he controlling? I don't dare to meet the friends tomorrow cause of my boyfriend.",15Jul2020,1
962,"Hey, so the title says it all. I'll explain as much as I can. 
He's being abused by his parents, and has been for a while because he's gay and shit. Recently, they found out he was on an 18+ discord server, and are now severely punishing him for it. He had to leave the server, tell everyone he was underage and in the same message urge them to block him.
I didn't. 
I talked to him and found out this. He has said his parents have,
- Restricted who he can be friends with because some are ""too gay""
- Slowed internet for him alone
- Had his phone bugged by them so they listen to his stuff
- Tracker on his phone
- Worst of all, they were not allowing him to sleep for 36 hours (his words, not mine, so may be off)

He passed out on me just a bit ago, and I need to help him, he as even said he's being pushed to the point of wanting to die.
I talked to him and he has nowhere to go, no friends (part of the first thing his parents did, as listed) or family he can go to, not even a teacher or a doctor. He can't call police since he has such terrible internet, and was showing he's hesitant about using the home phone. I need to help him...
So I made a sort of plan. I found a website that produces a link that will locate and send me his IP, and a seperate one I would copy + paste it on to see his address, which from there I would call someone local to that area (we're both in Canada, so it shouldn't be long distance, nor would I be calling anyone who speaks another language. Worst case scenario, he's in Quebec, but I speak french, so it would be fine).
He's still passed out, been about half an hour now, and I need to know what to do, if I'm doing the right thing here, and if the list of things does show that he's being abused, by law and everything or not. But, lemme explain some details.

He must click the link for me to get his IP. Therefor, he would need to willingly click it. I have tested it on myself and it tracked my IP, so it's working at least.
He claims the local PD is ""corrupt"" and wouldn't help him without a bribe or something, which I highly doubt to be the case for child-abuse.
I have never done something like this before. I'm one of the ""lucky ones"" who has loving parents, so I have no experience with this.",15Jul2020,1
963,"Hiii everyone :)

This is kind of a small issue but it has made me and my bf feel so uncomfortable 😬😬😬
I'd like to get your input on this, please bear with me 😅

I live with my boyfriend and 2 flatmates (let's call them Kelly and Amber) in the same house. We're all friendly towards each other and we've been living together for over 2 years or so.
Amber kinda moved out 5 or 6 months ago to live with her boyfriend on a different house but they broke up and she just returned home.
Unfortunately, due to the covid-19 crisis, me and my boyfriend lost our jobs and we're leaving to our home country😓 This has obviously been a shocking, sad and stressful situation.
As a consequence, we need to pack the equivalent of 6 years worth of furniture, clothes, shoes, books, electronics... You get me :p 😓
We're gonna send it soon via airplane cargo to our home country before we finish some paperwork and leave altogether.
As you can imagine, this whole getting fired thing plus paperwork, plus trying to sell stuff, packing in a hurry, has gotten us sad and nervous lately.

Now, I've placed a few boxes in the living room, close to the wall and not in the way of the table or couch. Our living room is huge and has a lot of empty space. This is temporary, the moving company needs to see how many boxes we have, calculate the weight, etc...
I explained this first to Kelly, said sorry for the boxes being there, it's just for a while until we leave. She said ""hey ofc you guys put whatever you want, it's definitely not a problem. I'm just so sad you guys are leaving 😢""
So we told Amber the same when she got home, just to inform her why the boxes were there, and to our surprise she seemed displeased and said that ""the house would look kinda messy"".
We said well, sorry if it looks messy, it's temporary until we can send it through cargo.
She then asked why don't I put it in my boyfriend's store room, and we said, ""well, because Jim's boxes are already in the store room, these are mine, and you guys know I can't put them in our room. It fits one or two, but I need to keep the rest here"".
The room me and Jim sleep in is the tiniest.
She said again it would make the house look messy. Jim and I said that she won't have to worry, I mean we're leaving soon anyways, unfortunately...
And that was it, an uncomfortable silence followed, she didn't even look sad or said anything about the fact that we're leaving.
Honestly, we got caught by surprise and the conversation kind of stopped there. I get that she is obviously sad after her breakup, so I'm trying not to think too much on what she said, maybe she didn't mean it??
I feel uncomfortable know, because I mean... I do need to put boxes there for now. I was just trying to be nice by telling them why.

What do you guys think of this situation? Are we the idiots? Are we being sensitive or something?
Anyone been in a similar situation that has magic words?
Help an uncomfortable girl here 😅

We established that this week we would eat breakfast and lunch on our own, and then come together for a shared dinner in the evening. When they first got here, they went to the grocery store and bought things that they would like to eat while visiting. 

My friend's boyfriend keeps helping himself to my food - snacks, drinks, treats, etc. I'm okay with sharing some things, but I thought it was courtesy to ask beforehand so that we could discuss if this item was something I'm willing to share. Instead, he starts browsing and digging into my food, especially when no one is looking. So far he's depleted my expensive espresso pods and drinks. I just went downstairs and found him eating my haul of my favorite ice cream flavor. I mentioned ""oh, that flavor is actually really hard to find, I have to drive about 20 minutes to stock up on it"". Instead of getting the hint he said ""It's so good!"" as he kept digging in.

But its this that made me realize that she stole a lot of ideas from me. As a moderately competitive person, this rubbed me the wrong way completely. I recently realized i couldnt tell her any of my ideas or she would take them which kind of gave me the red flag moment. This wouldn't bother me if she didnt do everything i told her about. The only time she doesnt take ideas is when its too specific for her to get away with. She also sometimes involves herself with my friends that she has never spoken to as if they were friends too.

I've been freaking out about this for months now and am hoping some new perspectives will help. I (21F) was born overseas as an army brat, so I have a consular report of birth abroad instead of a typical state-issued birth certificate. My driver's license expired in March, but due to COVID DMV closures I wasn't able to get into the office for renewal until May. Apparently, the copy of my CRBA I've been using for everything for years won't cut it this time, because it has the wrong seal(?)...

In order to get a new copy, I sent a request in to the US Dept of State the very next day, which at this point was 8 weeks ago. After trying to get an update they can only tell me that they've received my request and that there's significant delays. 

The problem is I am going to be moving for my first post-college job ~Sept 1st, in a different state altogether. Due to all these delays I now have no form of valid ID, and I'm incredibly worried that I won't be able to get it all sorted in time to get an apartment and present ID to my employer. In my experience, even hotels/AirBnB's require ID, so I am feeling pretty screwed. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm not sure if my request for my CRBA is in the same pile as passport applications, or if the wait is still likely to be months. Is it likely that I won't get my document in time? In the event that I don't, how can I deal with my employer/living situation when moving?

975," Hi (F24 USA) this is alot to throw at this but I cant talk to my family about this an this is alot of emotional baggage to try an sort through.

 Im not looking for sympathy i simply want to start my marriage out on the right foot an not feel like Ive made a huge mistake towards our future. This is pretty unusual an i feel kinda weird airing my dirty laundry but im honestly extremely stressed out by this, i would just really like some advice from some people having had parental issues.

 So some background, my mom and dad both had me very young, my mom was 16 an my dad 18, therefore they where worlds unready an there relationship didnt last. They had my sister an soon after divorced when i was around 3ish. My mother left the state they lived in, my father gpt 3 jobs an me an my sister lived with our grandparents. 

 I never blamed one parent more than the other and never heard either of them blame the other, I loved them both deeply as kids do. When my mom left us i was upset and confused she moved about 12 hours away an I hardly heard from her she eventually came back started seeing me an my sister then took us with her to the state she was in before, my dad has had legal issues which gives her guaranteed custody of me an my sister, an my granparents didnt want to scar me with a legal battle with my biological mom. 6 months later we where brought back to my granparents, my mothers reason was she couldnt handle taking care of us. This happened 5 more times in my life that i can remember clearly. Eventually for insurance reasons my grandparents adopted us an she no longer took us.
 
 This has affected me growing up, I get really anxious when im alone, I find it incredibly hard to trust people, if someone lies to me my trust in them is broken, I have self worth problems etc. As ive grown older an given myself time to heal, Ive steadily been getting over these problems becoming more self reliant, confident, and outgoing, they still affect my sometimes but i have a wonderful supportive fiance whos very patient  

 However when i was 14 my biological parents decided to try an get back together. I told them it wouldnt work but I was a kid an they didn't listen an it did not work out between them. She then for the first time in my life my mother blamed my father. 

 I was outraged i told her it was both there faults she argued. We havnt spoken since this incident i cut all ties.

 Now im 24 about to be married in November to my best friend and Im not entirely sure what to do. She is my mother i have forgiven her for hurting me like she did growing up but Ive yet to reach out. Ive come to my own conclusion not to hang onto that feeling of self pity and resent ment but Ive never felt like inviting her toxicity back into my life to hurt me again.

 I called my family on my mothers side, i still love my granma an aunt and have multiple cousins i try to keep up with, they told me my mother has accidently over dosed four times this year, they didnt say on what. 

 Shes still my mom, I know she loved me at some point, and im hurt hearing shes in such a bad place. They gave me a number to reach her through but Im hesitant to call. I would feel guilty over not informing someone about somthing so important, but im also afraid. Im scared i may say somthing and push her over the edge or she may imediately take the chance to hurt me. I also would seriously feel tremendous guilt once me an my fiance started having children an i never gave her a chance to meet her grandchildren. 

 Im still figuring out how being an adult works, but i would greatly appreciate some advice or maybe even insight. Im struggling with this on my own, and it is a big decision. Any advice is appreciated, im sincerely looking for advice i really want to make it clear Im not trying to get pity or judgement on my mom. Im honestly stressing about this situation.",15Jul2020,1

Am in a bit of a predicament and wondered if any one could help at all...?

I wrote a prose piece about life in lockdown from the point of view of four people who are struggling. One of them is a junkie going through withdrawal cos he can't get a fix. Another is a mentally ill man who spirals from isolation and self-harms. The piece was written for a mates anthology and my parents would like to read it. 

I'm just worried, however, that my parents will read the vivid description of heroin withdrawal and think that I wrote it because I can relate to it. My mum knows I have a drug problem but has been too scared to explicitly address it; my dad has no idea. They must never find out - especially my dad - for many reasons. Primarily that it would absolutely destroy them and potentially kill them (literally). Especially dad. 

My mum has picked up on the fact that I've been venturing out more now that lockdown restrictions have eased, in order to pick up. And in the 'junkie chapter' the character is stuck without his fix because of lockdown travel restrictions. So I'm worried, too, that she will get that connection. 

I'm also worried that, if they think I'm writing from my own experience with depression and self-harm, they will be upset. 

Am I overthinking this? After all, writers write about things they've never experienced all the time. 

Other characters in the piece are an old married woman, and a teenage girl who suffers domestic abuse. Both of those are clearly fabrications.

986,"I have a friend that used to be a coworker of mine. We no longer work together, but ended up forming a close bond and eventually became best friends. Like a brother and sister bond, and always respected our boundaries. We talk about everything. We've gone through a lot over the years, but the last year has been rough. Her husband was diagnosed with cancer and a few months later passed away. I helped them raise money for his treatments, and it was heartbreaking when she told me he had passed one night. Understandably, she's been a mess since his passing, and I have supported her along the way. I've tried to help as much as I can, whether that is helping out around the house or grabbing things she's needed at home. I also watched her house while she and her husband were in and out of the hospital over the last year. A few months ago she became depressed and told me she was fine and needed to be alone. I tried to help, and assumed I meant well. I texted her once in a while, but not to overwhelm her. Just to remind her I was here for her, which at one point went well, but eventually she blocked my number suddenly. I messed up contacting her, but made her angry after I tried to visit her at home on my way home from work one afternoon.

Her best friend shows up, who I had previously never met, and starts shamelessly flirting with me. Even though it's a bit overwhelming I really like her confidence and decide to just go with it.

I think at the end she wants me to kiss her but I don't want to do anything wrong. From that evening on it's always me who texts her first and it seems she's not interested.

She tells me she wants me to sleep at her place and I do. I'm very confused at that point. We continue meeting up but it's like nothing ever happened. Fast forward to two days ago. I meet her in the daytime and she is being very flirty and cute, complimenting me whenever she can.

She tells me I am hard to read and she never knows what I am feeling/thinking, even though she'd like to know. She makes sure I will attend her birthday party on Saturday and expresses her excitement of meeting me again so soon. Throughout the entire evening my reaction to her behaviour is very cautious and I don't really respond to her change in behaviour. She seems disappointed in my reaction but I can't help feeling used. Am I right to be suspicious of her sudden change in behaviour? Should I just give her a chance and see where this is going?",15Jul2020,1
989,"My best friend (17F, we'll call her Grace)'s mom is addicted to heroin, she spends all their money on drugs, and she's abusive (doesn't let Grace eat for days, chokes her, throws plates at Grace, etc). She doesn't know who her dad is, and her mom doesn't let her contact any other family members. Grace has a job but she can never focus on things so she does poorly in school, she has a lot of anxiety and depression, and she's basically anorexic and very skinny because her mom is constantly calling her fat. Grace is also constantly drinking or on something and barely ever sober, she says she just needs to get fucked up to feel okay. Her mom is also constantly pressuring her to drink with her or try crack. She has a job and wants to save her money and try to go to college but she can't open a bank account (yet) because she's underage and her mom would steal her money if she opened an account with her mom. 

I try to help her out and support her as much as possible but I can't really get her out of her house much anymore because of lockdown, and it's hard to help her save money or help her stop drinking when I can't be with her. She wants to change but doesn't want to get professional help, and I don't know how to convince her, because I sure think she needs it. I feel like a terrible friend saying this but to be honest it's hard to take care of her and parent her when I'm trying to take care of my own problems too.

990,"I want to open this up to both sides, because I'm not sure if my girlfriend and I are in the right - but it's just as the title states.

After wading through many apartment visits and conversations, my girlfriend and I (who have lived together for years in the same place) found a great new apartment complex that we're excited to move into. So excited that we raved about it to some friends... As you may surmise, our friends (a couple) are now serious about moving in there as well... like a door away... less than a month after we're set to move in. None of their own research, just ""oh, us too.""

I can't exactly place why- but we're feeling bummed, bordering on agitated. Maybe it felt kind of special to us, I don't know. The other problem is that ANOTHER friend (different group) has expressed his desire to move out of his place soon as well, and every time we hang out he requests pretty much every detail of where we're looking. (There's a prior story of him nearly moving into our current complex that I'll spare you, but we're pretty certain when he finds out where we're moving, he'll follow suit.)

We aren't able to wrap our heads around why people feel the need to effectively follow us without doing their own research. Without a lot of definitive rights or wrongs, I'm hoping some of you may have insight on the topic. Are we wrong for feeling a bit invaded? Is there a polite way to even iterate this to someone?",15Jul2020,1

My mother, my sister (10) and I (15) have been repeatedly getting lice for the past 2 years. I know, it's really gross. There's always this cycle - we get them, we try to get rid of them, clean everything etc. It's okay for a month or two and then they come back.

At first we thought that my sister and I were getting them from school, but they came back in quarantine, Neither my mother nor me have really gone out anywhere, so we think that they could come from our father that my sister visits every week, but we have no way to confront him about it (he's narcisstic and abusive, long story - let's just say it would not end well). My head currently itches as I write this, I'm so embarrased but I don't seem to get any help from anyone else so in desperation I'm posting on Reddit.

Even if we get rid of them again, it's summer and my sister is going to our father for the rest of the month, so it will come back anyway. Also, the lice shampoos are unfortunately very expensive in my country and buying them every month has taken quite a toll on our family budget. 

Could you please offer any advice on how to pernamently (!) get rid of lice after such a long time? I would be really thankful for that and send a virtual hug, without any parasites of course.

994,"Hi, 

I'm 21M and live in LA.  I love exercising, specifically running outdoors (I live with my girlfriend, who doesn't like my outdoor workouts and prefers gyms). Today, I was running as usual in my neighborhood and towards the end of my workout, turned on an absolute ""banger"" of a song (David Guetta &amp; Kelly Rowland - Commander) and pretended to be a DJ and threw my hands in the air as I ran. (During my workouts, I like to pretend I'm in a club and dancing and putting my hands in the air and dancing (I suppose it's juvenile, but hey, it makes my workout more exciting).) I even sometimes yell ""Wohooo!!"" (it pumps my adrenaline). 

This delivery guy driving in the neighborhood drove to the other side of the street (where I was) and started filming me. He was looking at me like I stabbed someone and then he drove slowly around the corner and then I lost him. It was weird as hell and this never happened in the past. 

I'm in the process of applying for several jobs and this made me worried. I'm concerned that this could somehow end up on the news or trend on Facebook/Twitter/etc. (even though I'm not that interesting) and ruin any chance of finding work. I'm thinking there's more to worry about in this day and age: pandemics, elections, crime, etc...

996,"This was in high school (I was around 12/13) but it still perplexes me to this day. I really don't know where else to turn.

I'll call my friend Susan, just because. We had a small friendship group, pretty normal from my memory. We had silly arguments like most hormone-fuelled tweens but we always resolved them in the end.

The school year in question, Susan disappeared from school for a long period of time. When she finally returned, we didn't really recieve a solid explanation for it (after all we didn't push the matter). She soon disappeared for a final time. No explanation, no social media messages. We never saw her again.

At first, we wondered if she had just moved away without telling us. She was always talking about the possibility of doing so, but we never thought she was gonna until that point. However, not long afterwards we saw her parents in town. They still live here to the best of my knowledge. 

We couldn't find any idea of what might have happened. Like I said, her socials - radio silence. Whenever we see her parents, they avoid us or look at us as if they don't know us (which they definitely do). I've always supposed the school must know what happened, but the teachers had no clue. Susan's name remained on the school register for years afterwards. I remember one teacher reading her name out every class before finally asking us all where she was. All eyes turned to me - I didn't have anything to tell them.

For years, this has unnerved me. She has no social media, or at least none that can be easily found. My old FB account with our messages got deleted. I have only one photo that she's in and its so blurry.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do? Should I just let it go? I suppose if she wanted us to contact her, she would have messaged us, but I'm just still so confused.

997,"Okay, so my partner and I have been together for like 2 years now. Lately they’ve been more distant than usual, they say they’ve just not been feeling too well. I get that since I struggle with my own mental health issues. It’s been a bit and sometimes I miss how things used to be. I wonder if they still like me. The thing that makes me think they do is that they take the time to message me a couple times a day. Once in a while they make time to do something with me. Knowing her, i know that the effort means something. And I don’t take them as the type to lie about their feelings but everything just feels off. I recently learned that her ex has cancer. When we started being together she had stopped talking to him and they didn’t have each other on social media anymore. Despite how I feel or what happened between them, I think anyone would feel sad to learn their ex has cancer. I feel this might be why she’s being weird lately. Do you guys think that would be it? And their relationship had a lot of issues... I want to tell my gf that she can be there for her ex and that I get wanting to be a part of his process since they loved each other at some point... part of me though, is scared she’ll leave me. She’s a nice person, I fear she will want to be with him again. I know it’s selfish considering whats happening for me to even worry, but I just don’t know what to do. Any advice or thoughts? Sorry for the rambling. Also, I’d like to clarify once more that I’m not jealous of him right now and I’m in support of her being there for him.",15Jul2020,1
998,"Just for some context, TL:DR at the bottom of the explanation  


I had a friend I'll just call C. C was a really nice person to me when I moved to another country and didn't really speak English and helped me around in the class we shared. we then drifted apart and became friends again in 5th year and bonded over how much we didn't like our maths class. I for the longest time thought she was one of the nicest people I knew but was also aware of her reputation of not being nice though I thought other people had no proof for that.

  
fast forward maybe a year later and I started becoming close with her then-boyfriend (my current boyfriend. I'll call him DT) and her attitude towards me changed immediately. She started complaining about their relationship to me and venting about all things going wrong without asking me if I wanted to hear it. I'll give it to her she did at first but just stopped asking the longer it went on. She also started distancing herself from me, I assume because of me being friends with another girl she used to be friends with who left for pretty similar reasons to mine. I was made a middle man in their relationship half against my will but I cared about both of them too much to leave. This pretty much ruined my mental health (along with school stress) to a point where the mention of her name would get me upset. Around November of that year, she completely stopped talking to me about anything else but her boyfriend and I always gave her the same advice: if she wasn't happy she should leave and be fully honest about her feelings with her boyfriend. But no they kept going on the same toxic cycle of arguing and then half-assedly apologising and promising to do better. It honestly was sickening to watch.  in December all of it became too much (not just the situation with them but everything) and I became actively suicidal after a long time of not being that bad. It really really hurt and then she accused DT of cheating on her with me. she never said anything to my face but I knew she was upset about it. I had tried to tone down my affection around him just to keep her happy. but I never received anything similar from her. it didn't matter if she upset me because 'she was sorry and she was upset'. I supported her emotionally so much and I can count on one hand the times she offered the same treatment to me.  when back to school time came back I was terrified of seeing her and avoided her like plague the first day back but she acted like nothing happened. Big red flag.  My parents do the same with most of our disagreements so it hurt even more (funnily enough she always told my parents were shitty for this behaviour).  

The months went on nothing really changed. I was pretty sad constantly and had now developed a crush on DT  which made me more miserable because I felt like a horrible person for liking Cs boyfriend even when their relationship wasn't very good. then a whole thing with an open relationship happened where C allowed DT and me to mess around but under her rules which I do respect (I am polyamorous and so is DT) but it didn't really go well and maybe a month later she got mad yet again and called it off. a little while later DT told me that they were breaking up. Finally, I was free of that godforsaken relationship and couldn't be happier. I was willing to wait for DT to get over the break up before making any sort of move for multiple reasons but he told me that he was down to mess around again if I wanted so I said yes. I was cautious at first but he seemed so much happier after the breakup so stopped worrying and supported him when I could.

Perhaps a week later or so (the timeline gets very condensed by the end)  DT said something about fixing things with C while being upset and I decided to make that my official apology to C. I apologised for not being honest with her and how everything went down between us and at first she seemed to appreciate the honesty but quickly turned hostile. I told her I didn't want a fight and that she can do whatever she wants with my apology. Now about 5 weeks ago I woke up to 6 messages from C cussing me out calling me a terrible person etc and her asking me to prove her wrong. I obviously was very upset and talked to the girl I mentioned before (she is such a sweetheart) who has literally kept me sane throughout all this. she advised me to tell her I don't owe her anything and to cut things off swiftly and I did. She blocked me and hasn't talked to me since. 

C and DT were friends at this point so I avoided talking to him about it but got most of my venting out through some of my friends. I felt angry disappointed and sad at everything she said because she was basically describing herself in her messages to me but I couldn't even tell her that. She then caused her last riot after DT and I became official and she cut ties with him as well. I can tell you venting about every bullshit thing she has done with DT felt great. But I still get upset. I still can't let go of everything. I know she's out there spreading stupid things about me thinking she did nothing wrong even though her 3 close friends and boyfriend have left her for the same reasons. I guess I can't handle her thinking I'm a horrible person. Not to say I was a perfect angel throughout this, I did stupid things as well, but she was plainly emotionally abusive and she gets to walk off thinking everyone is wrong? she wanted me to explain to her what she did wrong even though she would never hear it. C was a person who you had to walk around eggshells with. I can't even imagine the poor treatment DT got from her. And it is not like she was a horrible person blaa blaa demon whatever. she was just shit when she was upset. which was a lot of the time. part of me is very happy she hates me now. part of me thinks I don't deserve it. I learned she didn't even like me for the most part of our friendship which just further confirms for me she was projecting her horrible qualities on me.  there's probably so much more I haven't even remembered to mention it was just messy all the time. 

sorry for the mess but if you read this thank you. I know it's just another stupid relationship thing 

TL:DR: My old friend C was nice until I befriended DT her then-boyfriend (my current one) and started to treat me like shit. She accused DT of cheating on her w/ me and all other shit until they broke up and I stopped being her friend. I now feel the need to always be petty about her mostly to get rid of negative feelings I can't deal with.

I don't know. Any advice on this? how to stop being petty and making snide remarks about her anytime shes mentioned as a defensive tactic? it's not good for my health and I know that but I don't know what to do",15Jul2020,1
999,"For context, my sister is 16 and is the oldest kid out of 4 kids (including me). She was really gifted to the point of skipping a grade. I don't know what started it, but ever since she started high school, she slowly started to spiral down. 

Once she hit junior year, everything came tumbling down. She stayed home 1/3rd of the whole entire year, started to become really anxious and started to stay in her bed more. She stopped talking to friends, stopped doing hobbies and things she was passionate about, gave up on her grades, and just overall isolated herself from everyone as much as she can. I tried to talk to her about this, but she would either snap at me or break into tears. I tried to get my parents and other family members to help her, but they would just brush me off, either saying that there's nothing wrong with her or that she's just a disappointment and a waste.

1000,"Okay, I think this post will be quite lengthy so tuck in I guess. I'll start from where it starts I guess.

Okay, I live in South Africa, so I'll be using Rands as a currency. 

My parents are divorced, my bro and I have to change houses every week. Ie take all our stuff from one house to another every week.

I joined this German private school in 2016, my brother joined in 2017. In total my parents pay +-R58k per year for the both of us. My marks werent the greatest but they aren't the worst (average of 65%) my older brothers marks were MUCH worse. (average of like 40%) My mother was forever trying new tactics and strategies to get better marks, she would try them for like a week, then give up. (This is partially because of us, but my dad wouldn't enforce it when we went to his house.)  My mother has a boyfriend and she is a writer and doesn't make alot of money, the boyfriend is a photographer and makes a fair amount of money but not enough to pay fees and still buy luxuries. My dad was journalist but lost his job last year, his main source of income is AirBnB, he makes enough to get by. He is currently 25k behind fees. Since the corona virus has basically cancelled his main source of income, he makes next to nothing, except some support from friends. Now the dillema is that my brother has not been taking school seriously at all. Last 2 years he had this girlfriend who he spent all of his time and money on. His marks plummeted as bad as they were. His lowest was 15% for English, a language he literally speaks everyday! He would bunk classes, not hand in work, and just play games. Once my parents received his report card, they decided that there is no point in spending so much money into someone that isn't taking it seriously.  

Unfortunately my parents aren't even making enough for me to carry on going to this school that I love. They are suggesting public schools like (parktown boys) which is an all boys school, last year,  a child drowned while on camp, the camp only found out a day later. This same school has had MANY teacher-child rape cases. There have been many reports of stabbings to students and teachers. Now it's not just this one school, there are ere so many public schools around me that experience things like this everyday. My mother doesn't want me to go to a school like this, she is scared of what could happen. I have the impression that my dad feels that a few fights will make me realize that I need to wake up in life. 

My mother has purposed a few solutions, if I can get all my grades up to 75% + then she will ask her parents and my dad's parents for money for me to finish school. i am trying to achieve this, I am even doing extra work and studying for 2hours a day. At this rate, I will not make it to that goal. Her next option was homeschool/online tutors. I would have 6 subjects instead of 13, so less stress and easier. More flexible times, longer weekends and I can finish schooling in 2 years, instead of 3. This all sounds superb, but I will miss my friends. Y'know  I have been mocked because my parents don't earn enough, so online school will be better I guess. But I have genuinely out so much effort into this school, I have raised about 3k for it through raffle tickets and such. I have had the best moments of my life there. 

Thanks if you read this far.

1001,"I’m really torn on the whole idea of “separate the art from the artist” when it comes to financial support. I’ve tried getting advice on this before but I’m still at lost of the issue since everyone’s advice is not black and white (sorry if this is long):

If there are allegations that are not yet proven true/taken to court against an actor, and the tv show theyr in gets a new season, is it immoral for me to tune into the show in the meantime?

I understand that everyone had different views when it comes to how you celebrate the art and if you continue to support the person with your money if you don’t like them. But I am not sure why a few bucks in my pocket automatically equals me enabling them to keep doing bad things. 

Most people say that is more a personal choice, but how does that apply to a tv show versus a movie or music?

Am I really a bad person if I don’t know what to believe and want to enjoy my favorite show? Am I really enabling bad behavior if I tune in or maybe pay for merch? Does that honestly send a message I don’t care about the potential victim? 

I don’t ever want it to come across like I don’t care about people who get hurt or don’t believe victims of a crime, but I truly don’t know what to believe. And I’m going crazy asking myself what is okay in the meantime while these allegations are pending.

So I am 18 and in England. As is custom, me and my friends were planning a sort of celebratory getaway for a week after our exams were finished. In school there was always one guy (we’ll call him B) who used to make fun of me relentlessly. Thanks to lockdown and some time away from him, My friends and I realised that this is not banter but bullying to mask his own insecurities. We went away without B because we had all decided that he was toxic and brought all of us down, only for my friends to tell me something during our trip to a cottage.

They told me that months ago he and another ‘friend’ (who we will call M) had tried to plan a group holiday and exclude me for the following reasons:

•1) My dyspraxia makes me a “liability” in a group setting

•2) I don’t bring a ‘lads’ energy to the group

•3) I’m not close enough to B and M, and therefore shouldn’t be allowed on holiday with them.

My friends essentially told them to get lost and that they weren’t going without me. We left B and M behind and went to a cottage together. This all came out while we were away and I feel so glad to have friends sticking beside me who see me as closer and more important to the group than B and M. But here’s the issue I can’t get out of my head:

B and M had a point. Maybe my disability does make me a liability who is prone to getting lost or injured. They surely shouldn’t be forced to go on holiday with someone they don’t feel close to either, right?

I just don’t know what to think. I want to say I wasn’t at fault here, and all my friends are saying that B and M are assholes and that they have no right to be so cruel to me like that. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, but I just want to deal with the anger and frustration I feel right now. I feel furious that they tried to stop me from having time with friends over a disability. I’m angry because I tried to be a decent guy and friend to B and M only for them to turn on me with no apparent reason. I feel vindicated that my friends chose to abandon B and M and go away with me. I don’t know what to feel, but maybe someone can help me?",15Jul2020,1
1009,"So basically our results just came out, he scored 85% and I scored 71%, I call him and tell him my percentage, grades etc and he straight up starts laughing like I got rejected or something, starts comparing me with everyone in the batch and tries to make me feel bad by how I did not get marks in 80s, and when I talk about working hard for the next semester, he straight up goes all negative on me, like ""How I say this every year and I am saying it this year too"".

My other friends supported me, told me to work hard for the next sem, so is this something normal or should I start parting my ways with him?

1011,"Hi! I’m a female college student who turns 20 in less than a month! I made a throwaway account because i’m too embarrassed to talk about this on my main, i know i’m probably overreacting but oh well.

So in 2012 , while i was 12 years old, i met a group of friends in middle school (6th grade is when middle school starts in my district) and we all discovered anime and were a very close knit friend group. We talked about anime, we watched it together, we made plans to cosplay together, we were always at each other’s houses playing video games and such. We also all came out as either bisexual or lesbian at the time of this so we pretty much grew up together and were very connected. Once we reached ninth grade we all had different classes, i stayed close to everyone but it was harder to keep up when we were all so busy, by the middle on tenth grade my bestest friend moved away and the friend group kind of became acquaintances that said hi to each other in the halls. By the end of high school i had friends who didn’t find interest in the things i liked (anime, online chat rooms, video games, etc) which was okay since these things aren’t my whole life, but while i got closer and closer to my now friends i’ve realized i let go of things that personally interest me. I got out of an abusive relationship in november and have since decided to focus on finishing school and while doing that i realized i have time to enjoy things that i wholeheartedly enjoy which includes; watching anime again, playing video games again, listening to my old emo music, listening to vocaloid, etc. But when i do this stuff i begin to critique myself and tell myself that i’m cringy and “can’t let people know” which causes me to not add songs i like to my playlist, not talk about any of my interests in general. I begin to tell myself that i’m too old to enjoy this stuff, etc. I’ve thought about going onto forums of certain anime or games that i like and finding people who enjoy the same stuff as me so i don’t feel as judged or alone but i always get too afraid to because i convince myself i’m going to go on there and everyone is going to be in their teens and here i am, a 20 year old stuck in this “phase,” plus i want to be friends with adults who like the same stuff, not kids ://...i don’t know how to go about this or feel less embarrassed of my interests. I don’t know how it got to this point.",15Jul2020,1
1012," We were both 13 and we were having a sleepover together with my younger sister at my friends house(friend at the time)this was in the beginning of our friendship. Then I pretended to fall and I just laid there on the floor. My friend told me to wake up and slapped my upper thigh. I got up and went to the bathroom with my phone to cry. I called my brother to pick me up and I just said,”I’m really uncomfortable please pick me up”, around midnight. He picked me up and went home. I didn’t tell him what happened. In the morning my sister was picked up by my mom. Two days later on Sunday night, I texted my friend and our conversation was about me being sorry for being too sensitive and my friend said that she does that to all her friends and I just should’ve told her it made me uncomfortable instead of crying. So I forgave her and she said she forgives me for making her feel bad about it. The next day at school I gave her a bag of bread as a “forgiveness gift” for me being too sensitive. Then we moved on, or so I thought. Months later she brought it up to me and she said after that happened she felt really sick for the two days I didn’t talk to her because I made her feel bad about. I told her that it’s okay and she said that she NOW is over it. Then months later in April  2020 I told her I don’t want to be friends with her anymore because other reasons. My friend talked to my sister about me being the worst friend ever, so my sister told me. I texted my friend and asked why she thinks I was the worst friend ever. She said that it was because I made her feel bad about her slapping my thigh by crying and leaving her house. She also said that the entire time we were friends that she was bothered by it. She also said that I accused her of sexual assault, I didn’t accuse her of sexual assault, I didn’t even tell anyone what happened. I told her that, then we finished the conversation. Anyway who is in the wrong? because I don’t have anyone else to talk to about it. I’m 14 now.",15Jul2020,1
1013,"My little sister (11f) recently made a new online friend. He says he’s only in middle school, but he has an oddly dark and sexual sense of humor for a middle schooler. Personally, I think he’s a bit older than he claims, but I have no proof. He also scams people, so I know he has the ability to lie easily.

My sister and her other irl friends (her age) play video games with him all the time. She thinks he’s the funniest and coolest thing in the world and always talks about him. She’s never talked about someone so much and I have the strangest feeling in my gut that he’s bad news. He knows I’m her older sister and has always been a bit standoffish with me, he’ll ignore me in conversations and exclude me from games in a subtle way. I feel like she has a crush on him, which I think makes this situation more dangerous. My sister’s irl friends act the same way, they’re all obsessed with him and won’t stop talking about him. It’s so odd and I’ve never seen them lose their heads over someone like that. 

My sister and her friends will pick him over me when playing video games and we’re choosing teams, I can’t lie and say that this doesn’t annoy me and make me jealous. I don’t know if I want to tell my parents because I know they’ll make her unfriend him and my sister will stop talking about him and choosing him over me, or because I truly care for my sister and don’t want her being in dangerous situations. I think maybe a combination of both? I also think that it’s odd that I dislike someone so quickly without even getting to know them, so maybe my subconscious already knows he’s bad news?

Please tell me your thoughts! I don’t know if I’m being paranoid and jealous or if I’m being reasonable.",15Jul2020,1

He seemed welcoming to the idea, as he believed maybe it would be good for me to move out and struggle to build some character. He invited my mother to the discussion and she immediately shut me down and convinced my father to support her side. Her reasoning was that in my 'culture' (come from south asian continent) the man is supposed to take the place of the father when he grows old and looks after the family. I of course see nothing wrong with this, but I wasn't born there and i would really only be gone a year. And of course in my religion drinking is illegal, ( i still drink anyways but they dont' know) and they brought up more stuff like you're gonna go broke and were a family we stick together.

1)  I don't have a vehicle. I have 5k saved up so i can buy one cash. But im considering purchasing/ financing a motorcycle instead of buying a cash car for like 3k .  insurance is way cheaper and i'm willing to bet i can learn how to ride one in half a day. ( I know how to ride manual, i have friends that ride and could teach me, work i would be like 20m away on the highway but i can take the feeder if i feel uncomfontable ) I could find a ride in the occasion it's raining or something . I don't have a license but fk the police ill take classes on the weekend and ride illegally for 2weeks/ a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I wish to move out:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a young 22 year old man. I make 400 bucks a week. I have a multi ab ility rice cooker/ steamer / slow cooker. It's not like I'm a little kid anymore. I have seen a little bit of the world and interacted with many people from different creeds of life, from millionaires to poor people. I am not naive as far as i know and I beleive i can take care of my self. My father has had trouble with me since i was a teenger till up to about recently, I used to smoke pot and it got to a point where my father taken away my bank account and i feel like a child. Plus all i do is work, sleep , eat my parents food and drink mischievously but i would rather experience life as a young 22 year old should, going out having friends and such. I feel like a burden on my family although i am probably not, I am somewhat the black sheep my lttle siblings are going to college and university and what not. Maybe spending a year away will help me decide to go to school for a specific career, or go up and work my way through construction. Right now I dont have much motivation for work. but if i move out i will have to go to work to pay the bills, and that will build character Maybe ill decide to go back to school. It's not like my parents can stop me from moving out but i need to give my friend a decision and soon. I feel like i should be at least having a fun part of my twenties where i had a little adventure and got out of my comfort zone. I feel like a bird in a cage at my house, and sometimes feel like I am getting fed hand to mouth and dont ever think for my self. Sorry this is lengthy read. I could use some advice right about now.",15Jul2020,1
1016,"Its gotten to the point where I’m like 90% sure this is the last straw. For context I’m an only child (19M), my mother has always been difficult (he doesn’t see the extent/hasn’t come to terms with her narcissism) but my dads seemed to manage over the years. Until now its always been water off a ducks back but she’s gone overboard this time and I don’t think there’s any coming back. Today he admitted that he feels like he doesn’t know who he married anymore, and doesn’t know how they can come back from this.

In need of advice as to what I should do — I don’t have insurance. I’m a US citizen if it matters. I’m 4”11 and 141 lbs. For sure, I need to lose weight. 

Also, should I see a doctor before I take prenatal medicine or...?

1019,First off I’m an African American 16 going on 17 teen. I grew up (and still am) in a mostly white area. I was one of like 3 other African American kids. So I think this is a big reason why I feel like the way I do. Basically I am more fond of lighter skinned girls rather than darker. Let me establish this though! I do not support racism at all and would like to see a world were everyone treats each other equally. I’m also not saying just because a girls skin is darker I wouldn’t date them or consider them. If I met a girl with darker skin and enjoyed a lot of things about her I would date her and skin color wouldn’t be an issue but I feel more attracted to lighter skinned girls off the bat. I don’t know if I’m contradicting myself or not. But am I showing a preferred preference or am I being racist?,15Jul2020,1
1020,"I'm going to keep this short as possible, for the past few weeks girls that I've been talking to on Snapchat have been sending me nudes without no context nor warning. It sounds like a good problem to have to any guy but I just don't feel comfortable opening my phone in public. I'm 17M and these girls are either my age or one/two years younger. I don't lead them on or talk about nudes in the slightest, I was talking about Ben 10 for some reason then boom I get sent a picture of her masturbating in the tub asking if I was horny. I keep pushing her off telling her no, I don't want to be a dick but Ben 10 doesn't do it for me. Another girl I was messaging was talking about 8ball and then she sends lingerie ( which for our age is kinda wack) asking me what I want to do to her. I'm not religious or anything but I value having a straight forward relationship, not really into having friends with benefits or anything of that sort. I'm just confused and I don't want to feel uncomfortable seeing these girls in school. I'm not sure what to do about this I tried asking my friends but they said I should feel lucky, I should screenshot it and send it to the boys, but they don't understand the struggle and I don't really like sharing them and having that shit on my phone. I'd get it if I were being flirty or Implying that kind of stuff, but I talk about Ben 10 and other nonsexual stuff all the time. I just need any advice if you can give it.",15Jul2020,1
1021,"(I'm 16f now)So this year i really started distancing from my friends ,cause i have a goal and i couldn't find time , actually i didn't want to give any time to my friends . It happened on its own at first and then i couldn't help but go with it . I explained them , they didn't understand me , I don't really understand but that how i feel and haven't regretted since. 


Sometimes like once in two months i remember how it was to be together 
And 
I have had ""sex"" with almost all of my friends and I've freaked out.  I know that i clearly don't feel attracted to them and neither do they , but this is sick and i know almost all the girls do it , like i still don't find it wierd if a girl will touch me or we kiss on somewhere ( in the mouth i find it wierd) . I found about ""that feeling "" from reeeally young , but anyways I'm not horny atall , i am but at really normal to non existent level.  With 3 of those friends we would do something for years , (our houses with almost all of my friends are no more that 1km far , i can see them from my house amd hear some of them)  so it was pretty easy to meet at a very young age since they were my first friends . 

We would do stuff except kiss , and i think we didn't kiss cause we didn't feel anything like that for each other.  Idk but it would happen with almost all of my friends ( not often , but it would) and sometimes 3 girls together or 4 

After some  years we stopped, but I'm really open with my friends like everyone i think , ( a year or two ago)we were talking and i had braces and my friend would kiss a boy with braces and i fucking said ok let's kiss . I hadn't kiss anyone before so it took us about an our to actually kiss kind of hook up cause one time I'd say don't come like that or don't open your mouth or let's go there 😂 we were laughing but not awkward at all . Then we would say if we kiss good . And there was another friend who we would do things . Then we tried actually doing stuff and like actual stuff . It's not that i liked it but i didn't get disgusted . And it's so frustrating cause i still don't. I feel like it's ok because they're girls but it's not and for my religion i really want to find the courage and confess it to a priestand never do it again even tho i feel like it's not a big deal but know that it's so wrong , if it were boys it would still be wrong and even worse maybe. 


Later we found out that the rest of our group would do that with each other even if some had boyfriends and wouldn't mean anything , just for fun and ahhhg why do i understand that??! 
All of the girls we are pretty attractive and rational ( ok 2-3 aren't) but I'm a little shook now that I realise it , but still would do it again . I'm definitely not excited or thinking about it when meeting with the girls it's just we recommend it if we're bored or say something about sex and stuff . Like it happened rarely as we got ""older.""


Anyone ever did this thing? I'm not sure what I'm asking for but - ( it's not that I'm afraid I'll do it again ofc not , it's not something I've ever looked forward to  , it's just i dont know why i still find it ok to do 

 ( Also I'm sorry but i don't support LGBTQ , I don't hate them ofc , this is not something that makes me decide on what to think of the other person , i just don't ever want to do such a thing as to do things with the same sex or have romantic feelings for them(I'm not talking about touchingor cuddling )

TL;DT   (female straight) did sexual things with many of my  female friends from a  every young age , just for fun without feeling attracted to them , until almost a year ago , feel it's still ok to do it , but definitely know it's not ( for me) amd I don't want it , I'm not afraid I'll do it again ( no nothing like that) just why i feel it's still ok ( I'm not talking about touching or cuddling)",15Jul2020,1

I have a really rare bowel problem where I'll know it's coming but I can't really control exactly when I ""have to go."" It's been a problem all my life. I had to wear diapers all the way up through the 4th grade and was bullied the whole time. Anyways I was at my camp today and all of a sudden it all just came out at once. I didn't think I would have a problem today because I hadn't had any ""incidents"" since elementary. But low and behold I shit myself in front of 70 adults and teenagers. I have been going to this camp for years and I know everyone really well too, so it was a complete disaster. At the time, we were all listening to a religious/motivational speaker, and I was standing towards the back of the crowd. This girl beside me (17) pointed it out first. I've known her for about 3 years now and we had become pretty good friends. She must've heard it hit the floor because she turned around and asked if I'd spilled something. But the liquid flowing down my leg wasn't chocolate milk. When she finally realized what I had actually done, she just kind of stood there in awe. This other older guy turned around next and was like ""Who shit their pants?"" I was crushed. I tried to make my escape to the porta-potty across this field but even the speaker I guess had realized and stopped talking. I finally made it and called my mom to pick me up. I don't know if I should ever return to the camp that I love so much. If anyone has any suggestions, please talk to me.

I have some very strict parents and grandparents, they told me I absolutely HAVE to attend, no exceptions.

A friend was in a bind and asked to stay at my place for a couple of days. While this is something that I normally wouldn't do, especially considering that I work from home and my 1-bedroom apartment is barely big enough for just me, I do consider him to be a friend, so I told him that it was ok. However, those couple of days have now turned into a week. In addition, He is currently sick (sinus infection) and is constantly hacking (hocking?) and clearing drainage. It is one of the most disgusting sounds that I can think of, however he says it is necessary as the fluid drains. I have started wearing headphones to combat this. 

This past weekend he told me that he would be leaving on Tuesday (yesterday, 7/14). I acknowledged this and in no way gave the impression that he should stay here for a bit longer. However Tuesday has come and gone and not a word was mentioned. In fact, he is behaving as he never said anything about leaving on Tuesday.

-A friend of mine who was in another field I liked offered to help me on a project that would help excel me into it. He ended up doing most of the work and I would sit and waste my time at home.

I’ve been having a hard time with my husband of 6 years. A couple years ago, he cheated on me (twice) and things just haven’t been the same.

I feel like I’m always fighting with him and it sucks, because I don’t tolerate anything from him and it comes off as, in his words, “me always trying to find reasons to fight him.” I feel like I am always nagging him, but it’s in defense to me as it is to him... let me explain.

Today, I was gone until 12 lunch and I wanted to spend time with him since I worked later that day. He proceeded to blow up and tell me that I need to make friends, because it’s not fair to him that I always want his attention. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I love my husband’s company. I don’t ever get tired of him. But, he seems to get tired being around me easily. Not to mention, he stepped on my heart strings, because I typically have a hard time making friends. He knows this about me, but continues to pressure me to pursue friendships. He made female friends and he keeps trying to force these friendships I don’t want.

Moving on, I’m a soft spoken person. I don’t talk loud. He, though he barely just admitted it, is hard of hearing. He asks me questions all the damn tome with music blaring or with his headphones on and, in his words “expects me to use my big girl voice when talking to him” because I’m too quiet. He said it’s a basic adult trait to speak up when talking to someone. Obviously I got defensive, and he said it’s because I’m always tired and I’m taking it out on him.

I admit I have an attitude, but I don’t tolerate anything that I feel is disrespectful and it comes off as me constantly nagging him. I know he’s human and he makes mistakes, but why do I have to always come off as the bad guy when I do feel the need to speak up when he disrespects me? I always feel so little around him and idk what to do anymore.

Am I just finding reasons to fight? If it sounds like I am, what should I do? I’m going crazy here. I love him to death, but I wish he would see me as an equal.",15Jul2020,1

I gave a colleague a load of grief cos he can't be arsed to do his job properly, so I called him out on all his mistakes...

Then I posted a photo to Facebook of some van that parked on the pavement/sidewalk, forcing me to push my pushchair / buggy / pram into the road, towards oncoming traffic... It was just a single photo with the caption ""well, this is annoying""... The owner saw it and tried to report me to the police for slander.

1038,"Hey everyone! Feeling really shit 😞

Had a woman and her granddaughter confronting me today at work (I work as a care worker, only started about a month ago) saying they weren’t happy with me

The reason for their complaint was they said a couple of weeks ago I made a comment to the client saying “oh you have a safe, Ive not seen a client have a safe.” They said that I made the client feel belittled, small and uncomfortable in her own home.

Honestly I don’t even remember saying this and I don’t see anything wrong with having a safe! Have whatever you want. I usually see blister packs so if I did say this I was probably just thinking out loud, I didn’t mean it to hurt or upset anyone. I was genuinely taken aback cos I thought as first I’d fucked up her meds or something 

They were both saying how my comment bothered them so much, she doesn’t have a safe anymore. They only just got rid of the safe though, despite them saying this was a comment I made weeks ago  that really bothered her🤔

I apologised and said I genuinely didn’t remember but nothing wrong with having a safe! The granddaughter wasn’t happy with this cos she said “it’s like you’re apologising and then taking it back” I was just being honest and I was sorry for upsetting them. I’m still a bit bewildered by it all tbh

Another thing is this client has requested to be seen at a particular time, yesterday the office had her appointment in for a later time than she wanted. With this, traffic (we get five minutes to travel from one side of town to another which takes longer than this) and my oil light going off and having to put more oil in my car (the oil part was ofc my own fault) it meant I was 10 minutes late according to my rota. To the client though, I was even later than this cos it wasn’t her set time. I ofc apologised yesterday, I even showed her her appointment time to prove it was put in for later and advised I’d feed this back to management to make sure it wouldn’t happen again. Well this was another reason for their complaint today. The manager had also blamed the lateness entirely on me even though it wasn’t all my fault.

Another thing I did “wrong” was I didn’t close the woman’s blinds and I should have seen them to close them. Tbh, I genuinely didn’t notice them, probably a blonde moment but the client was watching me shut the curtains so surely she could have asked me to close the blinds too. 

Her granddaughter was talking down to me a bit saying it’s “one thing after another” with me

I’ve been missing parts of my breaks for this client so I can see her earlier as she requested it. It’s funny they don’t complain about that 😪 This has been on my mind all night, I’m up at 6 and feel like I’m not going to sleep 

Not sure what I want for this, just it’s running on my mind. If you read this far, thank you

1039,"My best friend is an amazing musician. When she sings I almost always cry/tear up because that's how passionate I am about her talent. She often goes through phases of being creative and making music and then not doing it at all. When she is making music she is most happy. She lights up, she processes her emotions better, and she creates amazing stuff. She says she gets the most fulfillment out of life when she is making music. 

But then she starts to doubt and judge herself. She ends up telling herself that she is not good enough, that she won't make it as an artist, etc. Then she stops making music and buries herself in a deeper hole of depression.

I know that our society seems to undervalue artistic careers and I attribute that to capitalism--so that notion has probably been deeply engrained in her. But frankly, I don't give a shit. This is the only life she has and her purpose is not to work in a sad, uninspiring corporate office until she dies having only lived a lack-luster life. She deserves to follow her dreams and do what makes her happy and what is fulfilling for her. I know good will come of it, not only for her but for the people she shares her art with. 

I usually try to gently encourage her and tell her how good she is at music and attempt to inspire her to do it more. But today I was very upset when we were talking about it and I gave her a lot of tough love. I think I upset her more because she ended the conversation and hasn't talked to me since. 

I don't know what to do to help. If I was at all musically inclined I would try to make music with her, but unfortunately I fall into a different category of the arts. I just know deep in my heart that she is capable of great things and I want her to be happy and live her life with purpose.",15Jul2020,1

I take photos of it from every angle almost every 5 minutes I have over 400 photos of my nose, whenever I get a chance to see my reflection I look at it for ages, I measure it with my finger to feel how disfigured it is, it’s made me suicidal I know it sounds really stupid but it’s really affecting my life I don’t take photos, I cover my face in public and I don’t sit beside people in case they see my nose.

1041,"Alright reddit I need some good solid advice here. I'm on mobile and all the jazz  

My parents have always had a rocky relationship but I feel like it's just getting worse. This came to a peak about a year ago and when my mom threatened divorce my dad got his act together, and they renewed their vows.

But I feel like it's comes to another peak. With the whole covid thing going on right now my mom is the only one working and my dad seems like he has no intention of getting a job anytime soon (he was basically forced to quit his old job because his boss was a douch) and this is really stressing my mom out and whenever we ask about his job search he always says ""there's too much pressure on me right now"" and we never bothered to ask further. 

If I'm completely honest I feel like it just came to a new peak tonight. So with my dad not working he constantly drives my mom to and from work and I guess when he picked her up today he showed up early because when I asked my mom why dad was in a mood she said ""I took ten minutes leaving the store"" which is a shitty reason to be mad at someone. When they got home my mom hopped right into cleaning the whole house and my dad just hung out in the garage while I made dinner. I guess it came to a head when they were showering (because of covid and them constantly going out and me being high risk they decided to shower together to save water I guess) my mom is always the first one out of the shower but this time when she came out she was crying and told me to stay in my room, I didn't listen though and followed after her. All we did was hug and she started saying things like ""I'm a disappointment"" and ""I should be trying harder"" she kicked me out of her room though before I could do anything saying ""don't let dad catch you doing this""

1044,"I have a very unique situation and feel like no one can relate. 
I am a gay male but due to hormonal condition am often confused as female. 

I lived my teen years focusing solely on my education and had very little social life with zero love life and was quite somewhat content. I suppressed my emotions however by keeping busy... being a good son and student. 

I left home for college at 18 and spent the next 2 years making a small group of friends and partying occasionally etc... and was mentally in an ok-ish but suppressed place. 

However, just before turning 20 I realised that I had zero love life, no gay men showed interest in me when I appeared masculine... and so I made a change and began to dress slightly more femininely (still very androgynous). As soon as I did this... my life began to change and suddenly I got male attention. I look below average as male but very attractive when feminine. I didn’t know what I was missing. I then kind of went crazy and partied a lot and basically lived my best life... rebelled like I should have as a teen. However... then COVID happened. 

At first it wasn’t so bad. I spent March and April saving my grades after partying all semester and did very well in the end. After this I got a job as a pharmacy dispenser which I am still working in. 

However... I have recently felt trapped and extremely depressed. I moved away from college and my life is unbelievably dull. Any chance of love was again stripped from me. I can’t do online dating... it never works. I am removed from any college friends and so can’t meet anyone that way... I spend weekends with my home friends who are all quiet girls in relationships and I don’t feel I can relate with them anymore. 


I feel the only thing I lived for all my life has been education... and then partying. Now these two things have been taken from me and I’m trapped in a boring life alone with my thoughts. The only thing keeping me sane is work. I’ve also lost a whole summer... the first summer I had planned to make really great. I am also confronted with the fact that my youth is running out and young free summers aren’t endless... and I have to face the reality of growing up. 

As I am a practical person. I am trying to come up with an action plan to get out of my depression or rut. 

One way is to accept my boring life... stay with my family until COVID ends.... present more masculine again and eventually get a job using my econ degree in finance. 

The second option is continue presenting femininely. As I won’t be able to be taken seriously this way in the workforce... I have amassed a small following (4K) on the internet over quarantine and am considering starting an only fans. Even this way... I still will likely be alone. But I at least I will look good as shallow as that is... it’s important to me for some reason. 

The third option is honestly to kill myself. As neither of these other options seem appealing. Literally all I want from life is to be young and have fun. I feel I have already burnt myself out from studying and pleasing others. I wasted my youth and now can’t face getting older. 

I’ve also accepted the fact that I will never find someone who genuinely loves me... who meets my modest standards... and is not just there to treat me as a sexual experience. Which again makes the last option more appealing. 

I feel what makes me feel worse is I am surrounded by beautiful straight people and my life simply can’t compare. I can never be happy when constantly having to face what I can’t have when I see friends and family. 

I know I literally sound pathetic. But these feelings have been built up after 21 years of suppression. I am honestly a resilient person. This is just a time of weakness.

I have been holding onto a lot of anger from this issue. Last year on my 21st birthday, I attended my ex girlfriends grandmothers funeral as even though it was my milestone birthday, I felt as though she needed me and I was willing to be there for her. At this point in time, she told me she loved me and didn’t know what she’d do without me. I only saw my own family for 2 hours, didn’t see any friends and essentially didn’t get to celebrate my birthday. 

Then, just under 2 weeks later, she dumps me, saying that she’s been thinking about it for a while. This doesn’t really make much sense to me because she just said she didn’t know what she’d do without me? I literally just sacrificed my 21st birthday for this girl, only for her to tell me she’s been thinking about breaking up with me for a while? I could have seen my own friends and family on my 21st birthday just as everyone else got to, but I chose to support her, only for her to be thinking about dumping me while I was there.

You might consider that maybe she broke up with me because I didnt support her enough, but I felt that I definitely did, and she always said I was very supportive. She didn’t really give me a reason for breaking up with me, only that she’s changed as a person. 
I have been holding onto this anger for a very long time. Do I have the right to be angry about this, or am I out of line? I haven’t really told anyone so this anger has been built up a very long time.

1050,"My dad Is a single father to 3 kids from 3 different mothers. He moved us around to live with his various girlfriends as i was growing up about every 3-4 years. Once he found someone who would date him he basically left parenting up to the girlfriends.


I moved out about 3 years ago, I always had a general idea of why but I just remembered today of why exactly.

My dads girlfriend forced me to get 2 jobs at 16, and refused to teach me how to drive so I had to rely on her and my dad for rides to and from work. 

One day after I was coming home from work his girlfriend sat me down and kept saying that i needed to tell them the truth about my sexuality and gender. I kept telling them there's nothing to tell them about but then his girlfriend started yelling at me so i finally just said it all and left the room, ever since that they treated me differently.

I was left out of family dinners most of the time, so i had to walk a mile to and from the nearest grocery store to pick up food to make for myself, and when i did this half of the time she would throw out the food i bought for myself.

Once while i was trapped at work because she refused to pick me up she took that opportunity to take all my stuff from my room except the bed and a desk and forbid me from using the bathroom except one specific one in the house. 

And whenever i brought this up to my dad he would say "" i don't know she just feels disrepected"" 

Eventually she moved me to the kids play room so she could take my room and give it to her son. This is when I was 18. So I didn't have my own personal space, and I had to use a specific bathroom, and now all i had was a bed that previously belonged to a little boy. I finally decided after this to move out, which was probably her plan.

I moved out in one day and didn't say anything, they wouldn't let me have any furniture, so the move was easy. Me and his girlfriend used to have a pretty good relationship before they forced me out of the closet, and my dad doesn't seem to give a shit about anything that happened. But she doesn't talk to me at all any more and when we are there for holidays she won't really even look at me. And my dad won't acknowledge what happened.

I guess this is more of a vent than anything but i actually just remembered that all of this happened. It hurts me to see how well the kids are being treated so nicely by them but then I am thrown to the side, I just want to know am I valid for being mad about this now? (I'm 21) This really messed me up there are so many unhealthy behaviors that I have now that I'm just starting to realize is because of them.

It was partially my fault for being nosy and seeing the messages. I’m at fault for that and I know I was in the wrong however ever since I was younger I always saw my mom texting this one number, and when she was sleeping (her phone was next to me) i saw the message from him. He was talking about how he missed her and how they kissed last night. 

I was so angry and upset. But I was too numb to even say anything so I was crying all night. I’m usually close with my mom and we joke around a lot so I guess she noticed something was off about me so she asked me why I was acting like that. I couldn’t help it, i was so curious I asked her what the messages were.

She started crying and telling me it wasn’t real and she tried calming me down. I told her I felt bad for dad, and she told me he also cheated on her.

Double the shock. I don’t know why she told me that. Was it to save herself? To make me hate my dad too? 

I decided I would forget about it and just act like nothing happened.

1059,"It was about two years ago that my brother (both me and my brother in mid 30's, I am the older one) got out of an 5+ years relationship. My brother and his partner at this time bought a house together and apparently from there on it went downhill. They both broke up. My brother moved out into his own apartment for several month. But they somehow got back together, he moved back into the house but again they broke up. He again moved out into another apartment. And at that time he also lost his job. Both time of which he had to buy all new furniture and waste a lot of money to get back to his own apartment. My parents also helped him out a lot during this time. Talking to him at that time he said it just didn't work out so unless something 'weird' would happen I would not further intervene, just a 'normal' breakup. It's unfortunate but it happens.

Then he got into another relationship with a girl (about the same age as me). I don't know her because I moved to another country some years ago so I just can't pop by and have a quick visit unfortunately. So most of the news and talk I get and hear is only from talking to my mum because my brother and I we don't talk that much, besides sending over casual memes. Anyway, since he is in this relationship he shelled himself up even more, you can't reach him and sometimes you do not hear from him for weeks. It got worse and worse until one day my mum called me and had to tell me something. She told that my brother apparently has been taking heavy drugs for several years now. This has been the main breakup reason of his 5+ years relationship. And now he is together with a person that is also taking a lof of drugs. Furthermore this girl is diagnosed with having heavy depression and a severe borderline personality disorder. 

Just before christmas last year I got the news that my brother frequently gets beaten up by this girl. She is treatening him to kill herself and my brothers dog (My brother had his dog for 10 years now and it's his everything) if they break up. My brother managed to break up with this girl in a moment of consciousness until a week or two later just to fall back to her. This also happens with the girl he was together in the first place. So there was and is a constant changing between those two girls with lies everywhere.

Beginning of this year (before Covid), my brother flew over and visited me. At this time I knew he was together with the girl with the borderline disorder. It was the first time in month / years we had time to talk a bit. At that time he just wanted to be together with her, he wanted to help her because in a time where he needed help (losing job, getting new apartment), she was there and helped him. So now he feels obligated to return the favor. This is a good thing and it makes total sense to me but from the time they both got together, her condition got worse and worse to a point where, as I already said, she is hitting him. She is taking away his phone so he can't talk to friends and us, family. She is so insanely jealous that she is jealous to my brothers dog and TV actors. She's constantly smashing his and her's apartment (they do not live together), ripping out her own hair, damaging all the stuff and treatening my brother. So my brother wanted to help her make a therapy. He set up appointments and tried to work with her on her problems. At the same time he wanted to get drug therapy. All of our family and friends and even the health worker / therapist said that being with this girl is not a  good decision, he should take care about himself first, but he does not want to listen. And now my brother even gave away his dog because the girl treatened to kill the dog.

 I can see my mum and dad are starting to get very involved, sad and exhausted because that girl is also treatening my mum and dad to assault them, send ""people"" over and fuck up their life. I've seen some of the the chats, videos and voicemails she send over.

I don't know what I can do and how I can help. Since the last time my brother had visited me we did not spoke. And also even when he was at my place, I can't say I talked to my brother. He has always been a guy that know what he wants, he was spot on, direct and always pushed against something that he didn't like. But now he seems like he doesnt care anymore, is pushed down and silenced. Even the fact that he allows his phone to be taken away. This guy was always on his phone, almost every single minute, he works in the phone industry, he loves technology.

On a sidenote, I can't just let my brother fly over to my place and let him stay here for some months, cool down and get rest because he recently got a new job after a year without one so I am pretty sure that's not going to happen.

My mum and dad are at an point to just let my brother go, they are both not the youngest anymore and they did almost everything they could do. They are just about to break down every single bridge left unless there is a major change. Just had a call today with my mum, she cried a lot and also a lot of the story and small details and bits I just know since today because my mum didn't wanted me to know so that I don't worry too much.",15Jul2020,1

1061,"I am a 16 years old male. I've been part of my church youth group and been an altar boy for 8 years now, mainly because of my mother's insistence. When I was younger, my social awkwardness and anxiety was way worse than now, so my objective at social gatherings was to just survive, thus avoiding any interaction with my peers.

I am currently on a vacation with this group (parents aren't here) for 1.5 more days, and it's awkward that I only have one friend to talk to, while the other 5 people are having fun. He's complaining that their behavior is childish, but in reality, he wants to be accepted by them just like me. I hate seeming like a total buzzkill and/or a salty jealous kid. Truth be told, yelling stupid comments loudly in the street is not my thing, but I realize I should let a bit loose so I enjoy their company. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed that I am seemingly unable to socialize with them, that I would rather have a fiery-hot needle poking in my frontal lobe than to endure that emotional pain again.

There is another reason for me wanting to fit in with the others: a girl. She is well-adjusted and way more mature (emotionally, you pervs) than the others, so her *friend*ship would help me overcome my anxieties. I'm getting a vibe that she is intentionally suppressing her seriousness because of them. But that train of thought leads to white-knighting so I'll leave it at that. I'd be perfectly happy having a good conversation just with her, but she also has a sister with us, so me just taking her away is not an option.

I am terrible at banter, but I am apparently a good listener, FYI.

My question is: how do I join the group I've long coexisted with OR how do I build a meaningful friendship with one of them. Also, what do I do with my friend who is critical of everybody else?

1062,"(16M). I live in NY and this past year my camp friends and I have been planning this trip to c each other. There’s six of us. 3 in Cleveland, where we are going, one is Washington one in NJ and me. Obv corona has been a huge issue in our plans. The plan had been altered and instead of all of us staying together, each of the out of town kids are staying at a different house. That isn’t the problem though. The plan was for next Wednesday the NJ kids mom wud drive there, and then my parents wud drive us home. It’s a far drive but it was given an ok. But just yesterday Cuomo issued a new statement. Ohio has been added to the list of corona watch states. So if I go there I will have to quarantine in my room for 2 weeks alone. 
Also, if whichever of my parents pick me up, they might have to quarantine as well. My parents aren’t sure if I can go now. Understandably, they don’t know if I can go. I added the link at the bottom to what gov cuomo said. I’m trying to see if they might not have to quarantine if I wear a mask in the car. Like if you r with somebody quarantining do you have to? Just looking for any help how to make my parents think this is safe. I also don’t wanna bring corona into NY, but I still want to be able to go on this trip [Cuomo Link](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/we-went-through-hell-cuomo-ups-ante-on-quarantine-order-travelers-to-ny-face-2000-fine-for-failing-to-submit-form/2514296/)",15Jul2020,1

1064,"The thing about my hair is that me and my sisters are all biologically girls, and hair has kinduv been a point of contention (?). One sister has completely straight hair, one has wavy-ish hair, and one had curly hair but straightened it to the point that it's more wavy now.

I'm the only one with completely curly hair, and my parents are very proud of it and encourage me to take care of it. I never have consistently though. I'm just lazy or whatever. 

I want to go bald (or at least have a buzzcut or smth) for completely different reasons, which I can't even neccesarily explain. It's not related to me not caring for my hair though, or at least I don't think so.

I've made passing jokes about it but my mom has made it very clear she wouldn't want it that way. She wants me to grow my hair out, for it to be long. 

I've honestly been thinking about doing it behind her back, but it's not like I can neccesarily hide it for very long. We're quarantined and she doesnt have a job anymore, so it's not like I can just hide in my room when she comes home. And that would be pretty hard to explain even. 

I want to get rid of it. My mom would never let me, so I'm scared of what she'll say or if I'll be punished or something. I think I'm mad at her. That's not why I want to go bald, but I think that's why I'm seriously considering actually doing it.

How would you go about it? Would you hide it? Not do it? Or do it and just take whatever punishment she gives you?

When I say punishment, to be clear, she doesn't give physical punishment, and I'm fine with my electronics being taken away. I guess I'm just scared of the conversation.",15Jul2020,1
1065,"I’ve been completely exhausted with practices for the past month or so. Whenever I get home, all I want to do is sleep and rest. 

I have practice from 6:30 AM to 10:30 AM every morning, then my friend comes over because she doesn’t have a ride, And she stays until four. It’s extremely fun hanging out with her, but my energy just comes from being alone. 

I have trouble sleeping, and I’m always tired. It just makes my days miserable. That’s why, as soon as my friend goes home, I savor every minute of alone time that I have. 

Recently, my coach has been hosting optional scrimmages at her house from 6 to 10 PM. I’ve gone to a few, and absolutely hate them. Not because I don’t want to get better, but because I’m just so alone there. It’s mostly upperclassman and a few groups of other freshmen who don’t really talk to me. I just feel completely uncomfortable the whole time, and it just puts me in a horrible headspace. 

I like to be in bed by 10 PM, which is impossible if I go to the scrimmages. Every time that I go to the scrimmages, I’m way more exhausted than usual. It just doesn’t feel healthy. 

I have the option to go to one tonight, which I should go to, but I really just want to try and get some sleep. 

I’ve expressed these concerns to my mother, but she just tells me to quit if I don’t want to do it, which of course I do, I just want to still have energy for other things. I love the sports that I am in, and I will never give them up for anything. 

My question is, should I be going to the scrimmages more frequently, and if not, should I feel guilty? Sorry for this confusing jumble of words, I would just really like some advice on this. Thank you to anyone who has read this far and decides to possibly help.",15Jul2020,1

When I finally sat down with my parents, I told them not to worry about the situation and to let me handle it on my own. They said they were going to be there no matter what. Great parents, I know. I wanted a public defender because I didn’t want to go completely broke and in debt over this case. I know public defenders are shitty and my charges are serious; however, they’re not top tier years in prison serious. Nevertheless, my parents paid $10k for a lawyer. I expect to pay them back and more, but I hate how they hold it over my head like I begged them to get me a lawyer. I know they did it because they cared about me, but it’s hard enough for me to save enough after bills at my job. I have to pay back $10k I didn’t even want spent on me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m thankful and it helps a lot, but I was planning all along to just go with a public defender especially because I am a first offender.

She's now the biggest germaphobe I know and she doesn't let anyone leave the house for anything since we get groceries delivered straight to the house. Also no one is allowed to come over and whenever the doorbell rings she doesn't let anyone answer it. COVID is the only thing she ever talks about anymore. She fucking hit me today because I checked the mail without her permission. It was a drawing from my artist friend down the street, who I KNOW has also been staying in her home, and I told her that. Also, she says she is threatening to stop paying my tuition for next semester because she is trying to force me to drop out for the next semester and do classes online from home via a local community college. But ngl, I'd actually rather kill myself than stay at home for another 6 months. Fr I can't do it. How do I tell her that nicely? Any time I even MENTION going back to my apartment by my university she gets super offended and is like, ""oh so you hate living with me here??"" and tries to make me feel bad. Also I tell her that she's fucking insane and that she has issues but she doesn't listen and just keeps acting crazy. She is super annoying and never ever stops talking, and since she talks so much, she is constantly cutting me off and pays attention to anything I say. I respect that she is afraid of the virus since she's kinda old and so I have not left the house or invited anyone over for many months but she just keeps getting crazier and crazier everyday. She also made me quit my job back in March and says that if I ever leave the house, she will refuse to let me back in.

1077,"My partner’s kid asked me if I’d go to a parents event for her gymnastics team in the fall earlier this week, assuming it will be safe to do so by then, and I said no because I didn’t feel comfortable going and being labeled her parent. Well, I didn’t provide any reasoning, I just said I wouldn’t feel comfortable going. All of my friends who are moms (as well as sisters) all talk about how much they love their daughter and how it’s like their heart and I was thinking that I didn’t feel that way about my boyfriend’s daughter yet.

Since then, her attitude towards me has darkened. I realize that I could have responded differently and/or said yes, so the next day, I told her that I was sorry and would be willing to go. She told me to “forget about it” because “she already asked other women who said yes the first time and people who actually loved her.”

I can tell I’ve hurt her a lot, so I’ve been trying to schedule time for bonding and plan events she and I would like. I try to hug her and ask her how her day is going, but she pushes me away or never hugs back. I’ve even talked to “the other women” she invited for advice on how to get closer to her, but every time I ask if she’d like to bond, she rejects me more vehemently than the last time.

When he tells me something, he says it in Korean, not English. It's so embarrassing to do that in public, and people just stare at us. He does it when my friends come over, and you can hear him yelling something in Korean. I just wish my dad will learn the importance of speaking English when he is in the United States. The worst part is that my dad asks people if they speak Korean. He asks that question to people of all ethnicities. 99% of the time they don't, so he just speaks his broken English.

When he does speak English, he always mispronounces words. He makes really dumb errors like saying ""turn down the window"", ""drive a bike"", or ""close the lights"". He also mixes up words and says one thing but means the other. When he writes emails to others, there is a ton of grammar errors inside, and it takes me like 30 minutes to fix his email.

I've suggested that my dad watch ESL videos or take ESL classes, but he doesn't budge. He says that as long as people can understand him, it's fine. It's really not okay. I have a hard time understanding his English, and so does my mom and my siblings. I understand that he came to American for better job opportunities, but I totally don't see why he never fully devoted himself to learning English.

1082,"I wanted advice because I want to get my life together again, the past three years my life has been in pieces. I will explain the situation briefly, so someone can maybe advice me on the best way to go, I would really appreciate some opinions. In 2016 I completed a course to get into university as a mature student, I was 24. I had struggled with agoraphobia/ social anxiety since a teenager and got by doing different minimum wage jobs off and on until then. I was motivated to do this because I saw how the person I was with since 19 had got their degree and how confident and together their life was, I wanted something similar for myself. 

I still had panic attacks/ anxiety etc...through the access course, and it wasn't easy but steamed through because I was determined and had willpower to better my life. I got into a college course and was so happy my life was going to improve once I kept steaming ahead. I felt proud of myself for the first time ever. Low and behold the person I cared for so much and loved with all my heart who I was with for near 6 years told me they were leaving the country for good, they won't be returning and it's upto me if I want to leave my degree course and go with them. I was devastated. I had supported them through four years of a degree paying for all our social life through money I had earned on minimum wage and gave everything to the relationship and here I was trying to better myself and they decide to up and leave when my degree was just beginning. I truly believed they cared about me and wanted to support me through it, like I did them. I said no I will finish my degree, in the back of my mind I was hoping they would see my determination and wait a few years before moving. 

Instead they said they had found someone that suited them better, that they will leave the country with them in a few months and I found out they had been seeing them for months behind my back. I went to pieces. My whole world turned upside down in a matter of seconds. I kept telling myself I can do this, I can study and attend the classes etc...I lost all interest in life and became extremely withdrawn. All my willpower and fight to keep going was gone. I tried SSRIs to get me going again and nothing worked, I dropped out and cried for months and months and months. I didnt recognize myself anymore. I ended up saying enough, I went back to University with my best intentions, but my panic attacks were through the roof, I was a nervous wreck, before I was able to handle my anxiety, but it was overpowering me, I felt traumatized. Two of my close family members passed away, I felt life was too much for me to handle. I ended up seeing a counsellor and she told me why dont you go do something fun, and leave college you dont need it, your young. I ended up dropping out again. I had all these intentions to do something different with my life and pick myself up, but I just gave up, and sank into a depressive agoraphobic state. It was really devastating to me how my life was and I had no will to change it. I felt so ashamed and guilty of myself. It's been a road of trying to stop hating myself and blaming myself and extremely lonely, but somewhere I know I deserve to live a better life, and only I can make it happen.

Here I am now, I still have anxiety and dont like going out and being around people but I can handle it, I have become a good bit stronger, I want to have a go at life again. I have been looking into ways I can get my life back on track again. I was looking at different courses and jobs, it was stressing me out because they all require upto date references, I have none. I was looking at different options that dont need references, that would be short courses, I was thinking if I did one or two I could get references. I contacted the university I was in before and they said I could go back, in january 2021, I actually assumed they would tell me I can't, because of how much I have messed them around, with all my problems. I was wondering if you think this is the best option? Im at the age now where I need to be thinking of career options and I was thinking of becoming a counselor but maybe now isnt the time, I am not really in a good position to be doing an interview  and I dont have the references.

1086,"My mother (66) has been married to her husband (70) for \~40 years. This was an arranged marriage (we're middle eastern). It seems as my father has grown older, he's become more....insane? I never really noticed it (or remember) it from when I was younger, but stories told to me by my older siblings and mother indicate he's always had a crazy side but it was usually more tempered and controlled. But Within the last 3 years, after he retired (Jan 2017), he's dedicated more time to practicing religion (go figure he's a muslim) but also to activities he enjoys (farming/gardening). Im honestly not sure if he's bipolar or not because one day he seems very mild, relaxed, calm. Especially at the farm. And then another he'll snap over stupid shit (usually only with my mother, never with me or my other siblings). For example, recently he came home from his volunteer work at this farm and 20 minutes later he asked if dinner was ready, she said no, and he just went off on her (I wasnt home but this is what she's told me). Now I've only seen him flip out on her 1 time which was when i spoke up and got in his face which led to him kicking me out (i had just graduated college). But who the fuck flips out over dinner not being ready in 20 minutes? It's not normal. And then he wont talk to her or eat anything she gives him. He turns into a man-child for a few days and then it's like nothing even happened. Like he forgets he just flipped out on her and everything is back to normal till whatever the next trigger is. He has this ""im always right everyone is wrong. My word is law."" type mentality and is definitively sexist (believes women only belong in the house to cook, clean, bear children, etc CUZ GOD SAID SO). He's alienated almost everyone one of his ""friends"" and even cousins. Even his direct family (excluding his mother) wont really talk to him (his brother and sister). I didnt speak to him for 1.5 years after i got kicked out. My older brother shit talked him over the phone for kicking me out and they havent talked or seen each other since. The only reason i interact this with subhuman trash is because my mother is there and I dont want to abandon her by never going over there again. She doesnt have her own car to get out. She doesnt have really any income to move out (she's on social security). He's always handled any finances, healthcare, etc.. so she wouldnt know where to start but staying in that apartment with him is killing her and I dont know what to do because right now i just want to bash his head into the pavement. I could potentially afford a 2br apartment for her and I to live in but i cant force her to leave and I dont even know if she'd leave. She doesnt fight back or anything. She says she's developed a ""thick skin"", but when someone gets berated weekly and yelled at over stupid shit, it wears on you mentally and that translates to a decline in your physical health. I could care less what happens to the man, but I cant stand seeing my mother go through this. I dont know if my father is declining mentally, if he's bipolar or in early stages of Alzheimer's or Dementia or a combination of them, but it's not what i would classify as ""normal"" behavior. I remember him telling me sometime last year that the most important thing for him now is seeing my mother happy. Like....how do you spew that and then go off on her for not having your dinner ready when you're home? So yea idk what to about the situation.",15Jul2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the ages of 8-12, I was sexually abused by an older cousin of mine (he was 11-16). I kept quiet about the abuse until I heard he was bugging another one of our aunts to let him babysit our 2 year old cousin (no fucking way was I gonna let this happen to someone else) When I finally came forward about it, we were kept away  from each other- but he faced no legal repercussions from the abuse. He  adamantly denied the claims until he “found Jesus” and admitted to his  mother (my aunt) that I was telling the truth (approximately 10 years  after I came forward) He also wrote me an awkward letter apologizing, which I still have.

I  just found out he is getting married in 2 months to a Quaker girl  (legitimately) that he met at his church. She was described to me as  young, sweet, naive and a virgin. No one from my family, with the exception of his mother has been invited to the wedding.

I  really want to reach out to this girl. I highly doubt my cousin has  told her the things he did to me when he was younger. I worry about him  getting her pregnant and him doing the same things to his own children.  If she already knows and is (somehow) okay with it, that’s her prerogative.  My intention is not to blow up his life, though I realize that could very well happen. But if I were marrying a child molester, I would want to know.

Id appreciate any and all perspectives on this conundrum. Please let me know if there is additional information you feel could help paint a clearer picture.",15Jul2020,1
1088,"So I'm currently coming towards the age of full criminal responsibility and actual jailtime rather than a little Teehee Silly Ol Kids wristslap (though I haven't actually been caught yet). Weirdly, that doesn't appeal to me too much. Not going to bore you with the details, but I'm in the trade of selling stolen shit and scamming people, so it's not like I'm not some fucking mob boss or anything. This all started in the first place with literally no jobs in my area accepting me. Read my resume to multiple people that gave it their seal of approval, applied to easily 50+ shitty part time gigs, etc. Didn't even get an interview. I'm not sure why; I really did try. Even ended up padding out my CV with some lies near the end. But full disclosure - it's probably better that I didn't get these jobs. I'm not uhh. Very good at being punctual, or overly obedient (though I'm sure I *could* probably do it for a nice wage and if I liked the work enough). Then I tried flipping items on eBay. Was not good at that at all. Then I tried applying for more jobs. Then I gave up and went for the other path. I made more money in literally a day than I ever have in my life. 

For those reasons - I'm not very interested in the conventional job market/higher education. They don't want me and I don't want them. So where else could I use the skills my 'experience' has given me/my qualities are suited for? Preferably something legal. I've looked at options trading, but it seems even more risky than any crime lol. Opening a business seems like it might be a good idea (though probably time consuming and tedious as shit). Freelance writing also seems fun, but I wouldn't know where to start with that. Anything along these tracks?

1091,"(This is my first time posting)
I (17f) have 5 really close girl friends. One of them, R(17f) has had a boyfriend for about a year and half. They started dating the day after she broke up with her previous boyfriend who she had been together for about 8 months. 

For starters, I think it's ridiculous that they got together that quickly after her break up. Secondly, prior to them getting together she had told us that she found him creepy because he snuck into her room while they were camping. (To clarify their families are friends, so they're two families we're going camping together.) another thing I find worried about the relationship is that whenever they get in fights R tends to overreact a bit and to fix the fight her boyfriend just sent her a lengthy apology text or Snapchat that doesn't really address the issue it just says that he's sorry and she's the love of his life and etc etc. 

They've also semi recently started to have sex and he doesn't always wear a condom, which one she told us I said it's not very smart You're 17 still in high school and don't have insurance, what if you get pregnant? And it concerns me that her boyfriend doesn't seem to care about what could happen. Relationship that was also kept hidden because the boyfriend is R's brothers best friend.

At first I thought this was just going to be like a short fling type thing. The longer it goes on though the more worried I'm getting. it's gotten to the point where they're starting to talk about kids and getting married. Although to clarify that's not the main issue I have with it, it's more the previously mentioned items. 

I just think that she's still in high school and she should keep an open mind about future relationships. She also has a tendency to need a boyfriend in her life, which I believe stems from her family problems. I just worry that their relationship may be a bit toxic.

R is really happy though, so I don't want to rain on her parade or to have her feel like I'm judging her in any way.

I've brought it up once before but she was dismissive and then she just wouldn't bring up anything really with me and so I haven't brought it up since. Should I talk to her about my concerns or not my place?",15Jul2020,1
1092," Hello Reddit!

I really want a kitty. I’ve wanted one for a long time but it was never an option because of an allergic roommate. That roommate has now moved out. But the household is still traumatized and anti-pet from a previous experience. How can I convince them to let me get a cat?

Some background:

I rent a room in a house with two other folks, one is the homeowner. Before I moved in two years ago there was another, HORRIBLE roommate. We’ll call her Jane. Jane had two chill cats that mostly just snoozed and didn’t do any damage. The problem was Jane, who sucked at cleaning aaaanything. Cat fur clumps and litter all over the place, hairballs puked on her bed on a daily basis, leaving randomly and dumping kitty care on other (unwilling) roommates. All this and so many more disgusting bad habits led to the homeowner’s eviction of Jane and a “No pets ever again” policy.

I totally understand and respect this. I do not like having fur all over the place or stepping in/smelling pungent kitty litter. Jane was a terrible pet owner and person in general.

Now due to COVID I am unemployed and going to college classes part-time. The two housemates are both nurses at different clinics/hospitals so I pretty much have to self-isolate. I stay in the house 90% of the time. I go on walks, exercise, meet with friends via internet and all that for stress reduction. Still, I am *incredibly* lonely… I was lonely before all this stuff happened but it was definitely manageable and didn’t affect me much. Now it's a lot harder... I had plans to start volunteering at the local humane society to get my “pet fix” but obviously that is no longer an option. They insist that I can just go outside and play with the neighborhood cat if I want to, but I recently learned that you shouldn’t do that because COVID, duh.

I’ve had multiple kitties in the past. If I got a cat I would offer to clean the house 1x a week, vacuum 2x(+) a week depending on shedding. The litterbox would be in my personal bathroom and since I am sensitive to noxious cat poos I would be cleaning it multiple times a day. Kitty's claws would either be capped or clipped (NOT DECLAWED). Normally this routine would be hard to manage, but since I’m stuck for the foreseeable future I don’t see it being a problem. I was hoping to adopt a middle-aged cat, maybe one that’s a little shy because our home is calm and low-traffic. Or a kitten who I can train to not jump on counters and tear up the furniture.

Help me out, kind people. How can I convince my roommates? Is there something else I can offer? Should I give up on trying? Would someone please just hug me?

1093,"Hi. I’ll admit, this is my first post to reddit ever. I’ve come here in desperate need of advice.

I have been offered a dream job that requires me to move from sunny Southern California to rainy Seattle. I never saw myself moving out of California but I would be absolutely stupid not to take this job. I will be working from home until 2021, then will go into the office. 

I’ve been apartment hunting in Seattle for the past few days and I’m at my wits end. I can’t understand where to place myself during this pandemic. Here is my dilemma:

Option 1: I’ve never been a “city person” but I’ve always had the fantasy. Do I get a fancy city apartment to get it out of my system. Then, when covid ~ends~ find a more realistic living space? 
This will mean that I will basically have all of my life in 700 or less square feet. 

Option 2: Do I just go right for a more realistic place in a “fun” neighborhood near my friends and greet bars and shops, even though I can’t see or be near them for months?

Option 3: Do I just say fuck it and find a place with a yard outside of the city that is more fitting for a “stay at home” lifestyle? I’m working from home for about 6 more months (if not more) so might as well get some land out of it? 

If you were in a place where you had to uproot your life during this weird time, what would you do?

This guy liked and even asked once if I’d go out with him , me but never had the courage to ask me out directly  as he thought I’m way out of his league and way too hot for him. Honestly I’ve never even considered dating him .So one day after a few years of knowing each other  I initiated a hook up. 

The sex is good , we always have great and fun times together , he even cooked dinners for me.  A month ago he even suggested to watch a movie together , he said he’d love to watch a movie in my charming company , I never followed through. 
We have a crazy sexual chemistry .hr even told me once that he showed  mine pictures to his mom.
But our relationship is strictly hook ups .

I truly fell for him,but lately he’s been pulling away , suddenly became distant , He was always in touch, texted me, shared his day with me asked how’s mine going . 
He doesn’t text anymore. 

It happened kind of after we had a general conversation and I told him that he doesn’t know what he wants in life and that I want to find love but with the right guy , kinda implying that he’s not the right guy. He even told me not to worry because I’ll find someone .
he kinda said it himself in past that he’s not a really looking for a relationship and if it happens it happens, but before this conversation  he cancelled a few times and rescheduled . 

The last time we met was two weeks ago. We went out and had a great time , he introduced me to everyone . I badly wanted to hold his hand but was holding back . I could feel so did he. We had a very intimate sex that night and did it without a condom for the first time.
He text me three days after that day saying that all his buddies were so impressed by me and his gorgeous I am . And that’s it. 

A few days after I reached out and texted him that I’d love to spend  time with him, he resounded by saying he’d love too but he has to work .
Few day after I texted him again him to get together for drinks and watch a sunset.
He texted me back like after six hours saying that he would with pleasure but once he’s back as he is travelling for work and suggested to try to plan something this weekend. I said - sounds good.
He responded hours later: 
I apologize for the delayed reply, I’m busy with work, can’t even check my phone and reception here is bad,btw great pics.
Sounds like he’s brushing me off nicely ..

Haven’t heard from him since ..This was the last time we talked.
I don’t  know what happened to him And what changed ?Should I ask him on a real date and tell him how I feel ? or it’s a lost case and a bad idea?",15Jul2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

1. My coworkers. There is a lot of negative gossip, backstabbing, backbiting, negativity, lying, and blaming. All of my coworkers talk badly about each other. I've heard ""stupid"" ""fucking idiot"" ""retard"" etc. 
2. The building is old and falling apart. A part of the balcony fell off the other day and almost hit a guest. Whenever it rains, multiple rooms are flooded. It rained last night and there were three rooms that had a lot of water in the room and even on the bed. Then our break room had a leak as well. Oh and the elevator was leaking water.
3. The housekeeping. The rooms are frequently not ready till after 4 p.m. on check in day. I've had to tell guests to wait till 7:30 p.m. Nothing is done about this and this happens every year. 
4. We have one maintenance guy that is in charge of grounds, the pool, cleaning the grill, and taking care of all the maintenance issues that pop up for 73 rooms and a falling apart building.
5. One of the security guards was screaming at me because he told me I give out too many parking passes. The only reason this would be an issue is if we run out of parking spaces, which we never do. My manager has told me to keep giving out extra passes but just make sure we don't fill up .So we had 30 spaces left and the guard freaked out. Then I went to his boss about it, a manager, and this manager has told me he hasn't talked to the guard about it. It's been a week. So I was screamed at by another employee and they wait over a week to talk to him.
6. Constant passive aggression. They leave these notes all the time that imply we are stupid, lazy, or a mixture of both.
7. Lack of order and structure. We are told to collect all fees when someone makes a reservation, but my supervisor frequently ignores this. So on check in day I have to take payments from people who don't know there is a charge or their credit card does not work. Every 2 weeks there is a new policy or procedure in place. 
8. We are told to wear masks and check temperature. People walk around all the time without their mask, including supervisors. No one checks my temp before I clock in.

1099,"This is long and may get a little confusing since there's a lot to go into this

I have recently (and by recent I mean like 3 months ago) graduated from high school. YAYYY!!!!!

And my original plan was to take some time off and go back to school. But with everything that has happened, my parents and I agreed that I might as well just go back to school because I've had a ""vacation"" for a minute. I was down and fine with it.

My original choice for school was one with a culinary program. I've enjoyed being in the kitchen and even took one during my senior year that was basically a restaurant more or less run by high schoolers and our 3 teachers. I loved it. I made friends, learned how to do things properly, and did things culinary wise I would never do if I hadn't done it. And we even did a tour of the school that was my first choice. 

With my financial assistance I signed up for, it wouldn't cost too much out of pocket. But,I am taking a culinary class from the school. This is a basic class that's meant to show us skills we'd need and the class would help us with finding jobs (after the class there's going to be a job fair for us as well). And I'm down for this.

A couple of weeks ago my mom saw on Facebook post regarding a community college in my area that has free tuition. She encouraged me to apply and I did. But now that I'm going through with the entire process I'm feeling almost lost with this idea. At first I thought maybe it was the school and the program (I signed up for an early child education related major) that seemed weird and now I'm hating the idea of school. 

It sounds weird but I want to work. After the class I'm taking I'm going to look for a job at the job fair and use my new skills to use it. And I would be alright working for the restaurant for the rest of the foreseeable future. Obviously, I'm not going to make 100k a year and I'm fine with that. This may the capitalism talking through me (depending on who you ask) but that's what I see

I'm fine with renting a house, maybe not having a car in my life. Not having the most extra lifestyle.

But my parents just seem to have a whole other idea. Me running my own place. Whether it be a restaurant or my own daycare/school. That's what they see me doing. I hate that idea.

A few years ago when my grades were shit, they gave me the classic ""Do you wanna work at Wendy's the rest of your life"" spiel. And then told me that if I jumped right of high school and went to work they'd feel like they failed as parents. And idk why but that hurt so much. That's all I  can really think of with this.

First of all, I am sorry for the spelling and grammar mistakes, English is not my native language.

Also, this is not technically an advice that I'm looking for, more of an opinion, but here we go. 

Recently I started therapy and the question of trauma is starting to come up. I am anxious, have insomnia and depression and I don't really feel like I have an outside reason to feel that way. So some things made me think if I have some unresolved trauma. So I started going through my experiences and there is one that I come back to. I am really confused about it so I would like to state the facts and see your honest opinion about the situation.

So, I was in high school and the summer before the final year we went to excursion (graduation trip) to another country for 8 days. I was seventeen but I had my eighteenth birthday coming up during the trip (18th is the biggest one in Europe). The night leading to my birthday I didn't feel good as I had slight fever but as we planned to ""celebrate"" my birthday after midnight I took one ibuprofen while getting ready to feel better. An hour or so later I took another one. (If someone is not familiar with ibuprofen, it's a non prescription medication for headache, menstrual cramps and elevated temperature. I knew you shouldn't mix it with alcohol as it is hard for the liver and for the kindeys but being my 18th birthday I didn't care and I didn't think that it would make alcohol have that much stronger effect).

Anyway, my best friend suggested that before we meet the others in a club nearby, we could go have a few drinks with the two guys on our floor as she knew one of them from music school and they asked us to come. I agreed so the two of us and our roommate went at their room. We drank and I took a couple of tequila shots. Nothing happened between me and the guy X, I remember five of us talking on the balcony and drinking. I don't remember much after that point. I remember that when time came to go to the club, we somehow separated, the guy X and me went first and I think we took a taxi but I'm not sure. In the club I only remember the lights and I don't know how long we were there.

I don't remember the next part but my best friend was furious the next day because she said that when she finally came to the club I was already leaving, again with the X holding me, and she said that I just walked right past her, ignoring her. I don't remember that at all. I imagine that I said something to the X about wanting to go home, about not feeling well or I don't know.. I simply don't remember anything except the lights of the club.

One scene I remember is the taxi driver on the way to the hotel saying no kissing in the car so I guess we kissed in the car.

Next scene I remember is me lying on the bed in his room, feeling pain and pressure down there. Then next scene, me crying and him comforting me. I don't know if that was simultaneous or not.

Next thing I remember is waking up alone in the morning and running to my room, and as soon as my best friend opened the door I ran to the bathroom and puked.

The friend of X said that the whole room and bed was puked, but I don't remember any of it.

I never spoke or had eye contact with X ever again,even though we were on the same trip for a few more days and we shared a high school (not the same classes). He ignored me completely which was great by me. I tried to ignore his existence in general even when his name would come up with unrelated subject I tried to discretly change the subject because the sound of his name made me really uncomfortable.

Up until recently, I completely ignored that experience. When my friends asked and were teasing me about what had happened I said that nothing happened and even in my mind nothing had happened. I have had this idea that my first time happened two years later, when I was twenty. I just said to myself that that wasn't penetration but looking back at the feeling of pressure and the pain I don't know how could it not be penetration. (I realise writing that how delusional my thinking then sounds)

My version of the event was that we were both very very drunk and silly and that he also being very drunk was mistaken about me wanting to have sex with him, so then he tried but when I said no he stopped and nothing happened (very literally, I said to myself that his penis pushed and tried to penetrate but didn't, because it was hurting me). Still I was feeling sick and emotional so I started crying and he was very nice to comfort me. So that was the story in my head.

But the fact is that I don't know if it is true, I don't know if he was drunk, and if he was aware of the state that I was in. I don't know if he stopped, or even if I only ""woke up"" during the act. I don't know how he dressed me back, if his roomate came to the room at any point, why exactly I was crying.

Being older and looking the behaviour of men in the clubs and the behaviour of X afterthat night and the fact that he got involved with 5 more girls on the same trip makes me think that he may have been more conscious of what was going on than me. And I know for a fact that nothing happened between us during the period where I was ""conscious"". No flirting, kissing, dancing or anything. 

After that summer I started to have bad insomnia and even went to brain screenings. They said that the reason is psychological.

Also, the fact that I didn't have sex (""for the first time"") until two and a half years later may have something to do with it.

During sex with my boyfriend, he slapped me once on the ass, and I started crying uncontrollably. He never did it again but two years later he pulled my hair a bit during sex and again I broke down. Which is strange because we had also simulated forced sex in the meantime because that was something that made me aroused. (only with him I would feel safe enough to explore it but maybe the fact that I find it arousing in the first place has something to do with my experience). Also, once I cried for the whole time during sex but we looked at each in the eyes for the whole time. It was a strange experience.

I don't know. This was my way of telling what happened even though I myself am not sure.

I realise that it is extremely long so I really appreciate if anyone even took the time to read it.

I would like to know how you see this situation? As directly as possible, without trying to be sensitive about it (be it that you think that he did something wrong, or that I am retrospectively making too loose assumptions) 

(I'm not thinking about confronting the guy or anything, just trying to see if I suppressed something or if I'm making a big deal out of nothing)",15Jul2020,1
