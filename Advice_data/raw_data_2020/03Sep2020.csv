0,"So there was this series of games on armorgames I played when I was a teenager and I'm trying to find it again.
I don't remember much of the title just the gameplay. You play as a swordsman on a side scroll game fighting demon like enemies and every once in a while you fight an angel like boss. You have powers that have you basic cool downs. The most I remember is it had about 4 to 5 games in the series. The first 3 you play as the good guy. And the last two I think are prequels and you play as the villian in the first three , but like how he became a villian type situation. I think the title was like ""heavenly"" something.

Any help trying to find these games would be greatly appreciated.",03Sep2020,1

2,"I’m female, me and him have been really close friends for 3 years. Like we used to talk all day everyday. Lately tho he’s acting super distant and barley talks to me unless he needs something or if I msg him first and even then he would end the convo short and he would also not wanna chill with me either. 

He always says he’s busy or he will let me know and that’s usually a no when he says that. I tried talking to him about it but he just acts defensive so idk what do you think I should do? 


Should I just stop talking to him and hitting him up and asking him to chill unless he messaged me? Or do you think I should cut him off completely. 

Like yeah it hurts cause at one point he meant the world to me like he was my best friend and I did so much for him but at the same time I feel like I’ll be more happier without him in my life eventually because that means I won’t have to stress or worry myself and be sad when he acts like this. Help me please",03Sep2020,1
3,"I’ve been using Reddit for almost a year with different account, and I’ve got to say it’s pretty great. It’s helped me in many ways, but now I can see the negative ways it affects me as well. I often see myself using it to procrastinate from doing other tasks, generally waste time and not get anything out of it, and I end up sleeping later because of it. Does anyone have any advice on how I can control my use of it?",03Sep2020,1
4,"ya see, I originally posted a post to r/gross And that sub Reddit is NSFW, so my post was automatically marked as NSFW, and that changed my profile to NSFW.

I have a group that I created a few years back that just bikes around and has fun and recently we've decided we wanted an HQ. All sheds are occupied and in my town it's illegal to build things in your yard (me and them live fairly close but they are in another town, we are right on the border.) What do you guys suggest I do? We're very eager to have our own spot but I'm not too sure where to go (of course, Papa Rona helps us none.)",03Sep2020,1
6,"On Sunday, my cousins wife was on her way to the store, when a car crossed the center line and hit her head on. She was pronounced dead on the scene. She leaves behind two small children as well. He’s struggling financially, and can’t really afford a funeral, so I set up a GoFundMe for him, but I’m not having much luck with that. Besides trying to help him financially, is there any way take some of the burden off him? Help him grieve?",03Sep2020,1
7,"I, White Male 29, live in a small somewhat rural area and I can NOT stand my protesting neighbor.

My neighbor, Black Male 40s, goes outside everyday 3 times a day to protest about an incident that happened in his life and the way in which Police handled the situation. He has been protesting since January. I am one of 4 homes on my street and we do not live near any type of attractions. 

He walks around the front of his yard yelling:

“We live in a white America.”
“I can’t get a job because of this.”
“I won’t stop protesting until this is fixed.”
“I want a car just like everyone else.”
“No Justice, No Peace.”
“All Lives Matter.”

My Wife and I have talked to him on several occasions to find out what he was protesting about and to ask that if he sees us outside with our kids (2&amp;3 y.o.) that he refrain from shouting. 

An associate of his from 20 years ago stole his identity and now his name is associated with the crimes that individual committed. He was pulled over last year and “falsely imprisoned” because of the warrants in his name. (This is what he is upset about and is requesting to have the arresting officer fired)

Since then the police have worked with him and gotten him documentation/proof of the identity theft and cleaned up the mess this other individual has created. 

On another occasion when I heard he was looking for work I told him that I could get him a job but unfortunately the timing was rough due to COVID. Another neighbor further down the road was working on getting him a vehicle as well. 

I’ve talked to him and said: “All your neighbors support you and what you are trying to do but you aren’t reaching your target audience by protesting in your front yard. You should really bring it to the Police Station since it sounds like they are the ones your message is targeted at and hopefully they can resolve the issues.” He laughed and said, “That’s what they want me to do.” I’ve also told him to check out reddit and see if anyone could maybe give him some information/advice. 

My last neighbor is beyond fed up with it and has called the cops a few times. He’s spoke with the cops and they’ve told him that my protesting neighbor just needs to come down to the station to sort everything out. Whenever the cops arrive I’ll hang outside so my neighbor feels “supported” so he knows he has someone else watching the interaction. However, I’ve only witness the officers being nothing but pleasant and explain to him the same process about coming down to the station to get the issues resolved. 

My protesting neighbor says he won’t stop until he has closure, but he isn’t listening to anyone trying to actually help him. It’s almost like he wants everyone else to do the work for him. 

I like to believe that my wife and I have been an ideal neighbor, but I don’t know how much more we can take. It’s gotten so bad we’ve discussed moving. For now we are stuck in this never ending loop since he refuses to take action. 

He isn’t technically breaking any laws but it definitely feels like a burden on my family. 

Thanks all who read my rant. What can I do in a situation like this? 


TLDR:
My Neighbor has been protesting 3 times a day for 8 months about an issue that people are trying to help him with. He won’t take any advice or take any action to get the issue resolved aside from yelling outside of his home. What can I do in a situation like this?",03Sep2020,1

9,"

The assignment of this class was to make an audio comic. We got together in a conference call, and everyone chose their part of the work. She picked first, and chose to be the video editor, which is what I wanted, but she chose first, so whatever. 

To that, I followed by choosing to be in charge of the soundtrack. However, since she has some sort of diploma for music theory, she said she would help me. Which, I thought maybe she would make suggestions or little changes, which wasn’t a big deal, so I said nothing.

Big mistake.

The comic hasn’t even been completed, so I was taking my time and composing some stuff on FL Studio. I even finished one song.

Today comes and turns out she also had started making the music. On soundtrap. Which, was MY part of the job. I got pissed. Mainly because she stole my part, but the music also sucked. She added me to her soundtrap project and demanded for me to collab with her. I deleted some stuff that sounded bad, and added new tracks. But she had already saved her versions and sent them to our group chat as finished songs.

I want to tell her that if she wants to do the music by herself, we can just change roles and let me edit the video by myself, or else she should stop and let me work on the part of my job that remains intact.

I just don’t how to tell her. I have bad anxiety and I don’t know how to be confrontational. I can’t. I’m very stressed right now. I just don’t know what to do. I hate this feeling. How do I calm down and how should I proceed?",03Sep2020,1

I haven’t gone to the bathroom in maybe 3 days now, and my stomach hurts when I feel it. I don’t know what I should do, because my parents don’t take it seriously.

13,Last night I got pulled over while high. The cops took me in and took a blood test because I was to nervous to take a urine test.

When I came home tonight I had a long conversation with my parents about what happened. What really broke me is what I have to tell my younger sister. Im usually the one that takes her to practice and stuff like that but when the blood test results come back i’ll lose my license for 4 months. My parents and I don’t want to tell her what I did because she looks up to me and she recently had to switch school’s because of bullying and she thinks of me as her bestfriend.

16,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year and everything was perfect up until a couple months ago when we moved in together. He started to become more closed off and distant and mostly kept to himself. He wasn’t being as affectionate and I didn’t know what the problem was and tried my best to make him happy and improve his mood. It felt like I was losing him and I got scared that he didn’t love me anymore. When I brought this issue up to him he would repeatedly tell me he was “just tired” 
Last night though everything changed. He confided in me that he has OCD and suffers from extremely dark and intrusive thoughts that plague him constantly. I didn’t know what to do or say. Growing up I heard that term thrown around to usually describe someone who was a clean or neat freak. My boyfriend didn’t seem like a clean or neat freak. He explained to me that OCD wasn’t like that (though it can involve extensive cleanliness) but rather an anxiety induced illness. 
I guess my question is. How do I go about with this information? It does not in any way shape or form change how much I love or care for him but I do wonder if there is anyway I can help him? I want to make him happy and I want to help him any way I can. But I also feel selfish because I’m more of a clingy, overthinking individual (I have anxiety and depression) and even though I know when he wants to be alone it’s not because of me, I can’t help but still feel sad.

19," I don't have a lot of IRL friends so I spend my free time online chatting in small/large chatrooms. I think I fell in love with the anonymity of being online and that's when I started lying about small details of my life when chatting with other people on there. Normally, friends I make in these chatrooms don't last more than a week or two because you know people get bored so lying wasn't that big of deal I guess. About a year ago, I met a person online who made friends with me instantly since I was just messing around and joking a whole lot. I lied about who I was saying I was a guy from the Philippines who just wanted to make friends. After a couple of weeks we honestly were having a great time but I got bored of messaging them often so when that happened I kinda just made up stories about how I did a lot of work, my family was pressuring me a lot, and I had to have time to study. I basically used these excuses when I didn't want to talk with them for days extended. This person was always understanding plus considerate of me and my fake life. They were always up to chat when I was but I whenever they wanted to chat and I didn't, I would pull my bullshit excuses. Soon ( about a month in ) this person mentioned here and there that they found it hard to talk to people IRL also how poorly their classmates treated them. This was when I got the idea that the only friend they had was me and their siblings. Reading our texts back now I should have noticed sooner how insecure and worried this person was. 

I need advice because I'm not sure what to do at this point, I realized this friendship couldn't last about a month ago. This person has being fed lies for a year and doesn't have any clue of who their talking to. I tried to think about ghosting them but I'm scared of the mental impact that might leave on them other thing I could do is tell them then I'm left with the same problem.

My friends lease is up on November and she suggested we become roommates. While she proven to be reliable and dependable with money I'm concerned for several reasons. 

1. She owns two cats, 1 birds and 1 very good boy (dog). I own one cat.

2. Though she's dependable and trustworthy. She has very bad anxiety and I think she's may regret this later down the road.

29,"Over a month ago, my friend's dad suddenly passed away. It was a drastic loss for him because they were very close. His dad was also extremely close with mine.

My friend has had his ups and downs dealing with it and I'm trying to be as supportive as possible with him. I know I can't understand what he's going through but I'm trying my best to be sympathetic - even when he lashes out in pain. I'm dealing with survivor's guilt. Less than a week prior, my dad had a scare that took him to the ER, but he came back fine... meanwhile my friend's dad didn't make it. And because our dads were so close, that's what makes this so much worse.

Over the last month, I've been surrounded by this man's family and friends, distraught over his death. While I am sad too, of course, I've been trying to figure out how sad I am allowed to be. I wasn't super close to his dad but he was definitely an important person in my life, like family.

Now that you have some background -  I need some advice...

* What's the best way I can support my friend when I can't fully understand what he's going through?
* If he lashes out at me, at what point am I allowed to say I'm not a punching bag?

30,"Why I'm not sure about my relationship.. i need advice on what to do for both me (f20) and my fiance (m21),

I've been depressed for awhile. I feel as if my relationship is part of it. A bit of background, we've been together for two and a half years of strong love, we do everythingtogether. He's had a rough life up until we moved out together a year and a half ago, there was no constant with him except for me. His family is small, mine is big; my family has brought him in and they all love him too, some have been there for him like nobody else could. His dad's been dead (longer than we've been together) and my family has been different figures he hasn't had. And not to mention through hard times.

Right now we live in an apartment, we work at the same place same shift, different positions so its rare we see each other. We also put money together for a nice car. His friends come over pretty often and we smoke and chill, his friends are my friends too, but not as close to me. I dont have many people close to me, i try to socialize but nobody takes interest in being close to me. I still have a few that I care about. 

(Feels like this is a good time to dump my feelings and thoughts) while we live together, I'm pretty much the only one that does cleaning. He pucks up trash and (recently) has started rinsing dishes. But besides that I do 95% of the cleaning, he just cooks dinner. Our place is always a bit messy and it stresses me out. I have a physically demanding job so I'm always tired and sore. He also relies on me to wake him up before work, tell him the time, when to get ready, etc. A lot of time is spent in the apartment. We work well together as a couple so it might be way out of the blue for me to even question how I feel, but idk if we're on the same pages. 

I'm just going to blatantly say this, I cheated through pictures. Trigger warning for this paragraph, it gets dark.. I felt like a massive piece of shit when I did that, the feeling of him finding out make me want to die. Him too. That fight was bad, but he decided ultimately that he wants to stay with me. I couldn't be more thankful for the forgiveness he's given me and the effort for us to get through that. There was no excuse for why I did that, but I was seeking positive attention, I didn't even feel good doing it. I regret the entire thing. I felt like self harming really bad. To the point of almost killing myself, but i didn't (still think this) think I deserved the release of death. He hit me really hard a good few times, i wish he had done it harder/more. I still feel like a piece of shit, every waking moment. Even in my dreams I hurt myself because of it. I cant say it enough.... i really am sorry for what i did to him, he never deserved that, nobody does. And I hope you guys reading this can forgive me too because I don't think I ever will forgive myself. In a very undetailed nutshell, the why is my body dysmorphia spiraled the wrong way, I feel like i cant talk to him about it.

Body dysmorphic disorder (bdd here forward) has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My parents have told me stories of, toddler and young child me, pointing out features I already didn't like, askingbif I looked good or fat. Nobody knows where that came from, but can you imagine someone that young saying stuff like that? I've never liked how I looked. Especially my ""assets,"" I knew I didn't like them once puberty hit. Growing up I got that stuff pointed out so often by friends, family, and exes. Two of my exes have commented on my naked lower region, which again, I already didn't like, but that pushed it further. Onto the clothed me, I never have liked my features and have considered plastic surgery for well over 7 years now, I'd get it if I could. I dont feel like me in this body, never have. I recognize it is me though. Its not like I believe I'm wholelly ugly, its just not me... if that made sense 

I don't think he really gets how to help me, i don't blame him, it's complicated. However he has been super unhelpful with it. He used to just break me, I'm not getting into that because its fixed now. Whenever I'm feeling Especially dysmorphic he calls me shallow and just pushes the issue under the rug, but the rug can only hide so much. Just so you know, telling someone with bdd its shallow, unimportant, stupid, is a really bad idea. Some people don't understand how appearance matters to us, trust me, sometimes we don't either. Check out the r/BodyDysmorphia to check out more in the mind of it. Anyways, it eats me up, he doesn't get it at all, but tries to (kinda)....

Next subject i suppose.
Am I tied down too early? I ask that a lot to myself. I can see myself marrying him, but also not or doing so later.... I desire going out with friends more often, making friends; like I said, we do everything together, but i didn't mention that he usually decides what we're doing despite me protesting for something else. i don't feel free enough. Yeah yeah, get some time away from him, but i feel like i can't, if i take the car to go somewhere he's stranded at home and he doesn't like that. Not to mention he's very protective of me and likes being by my side if anything were to happen to me.

Lastly,, I have a hard time talking to him about most things. A lot of the time I feel its turned around to me, like its my fault. Example: we hang out with a group of friends together, hes talking over me, talking for me, not acknowledging I exist, and driving attention away from me to him. I'll feel pretty ignored and left out because of this, so I'd bring it up to him and he'd tell me i need to speak up or talk more (maybe if you heard me), or if he talks over me its because I'm bad at talking.

If i broke up with him a lot of shit would go downhill for him, he'd lose everything hes gained. He financially cant handle all the bills we split half and half with. The car and apartment are in his name and that alone woul cause him to go broke.... so I'd day theres a big reliance on that. Hed lose my family, which he considers his own and my family would not be too happy i left....

Besides what I wrote our relationship looks golden, two young adults that have their life together who can afford a nice and easy lifestyle, why would I want to leave? I probably would be in school for what i want to do in life, I'd have money for it. Instead I'm paying bills until he gets his dream job to support us (no schooling for it really) while I go through college",03Sep2020,1
31,So I got myself and my niece who is 5 months old a football jersey with our names and numbers written on back of the shirt. Now I want to post our photo on facebook. The problem is she can't sit yet and I want a photo taken from our back with our names and number visible. How to do this? How to make her sit with me or how to take picture so this happens. Anyone help this out. It matters to me a lot cuz i love her and we haven't any baby in our home since 15 years. Thanks,03Sep2020,1
32,"Im 18 now and my parents recently had a talk with me saying what I wanted to pursue in life. I told them that Im going to go to university next semester because I wanted to pursue a higher education. Both my mom and dad laughed in my face saying how do you expect to get a degree when you weren't focused in high school? It's true I wasn't focused in highschool but I know what it takes and what sacrifices I had to make to graduate college.

Since they were really hard on me in highschool I guess they had given up hope for me and gave me an ultimatum. I either enlist in active duty knowing full well I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, depression and PTSD or Be out of the house by January. 

Now thankfully I have a job throughout Covid-19 so I can start saving to move out and figure out the ropes myself and go to college but I'm not too sure where to start after that. I've talked with a couple friends who are in the mainland (I live in Hawaii) who said that they're moving out for college as well and need roommates to help pay for rent. They live in Las Vegas but none of us have credit but we do all have jobs that can support us. 

I do know that you need credit to rent out a house. We've looked at a couple houses in Las Vegas that offer very low prices for monthly but I'm not sure if that includes utilities, water, electric and all that jazz. How and what is the best way to look at places for rent? What is the best way to save money to leave? How much should I save up? I don't know alot of answers to these questions but I've seen alot of people being helped on this sub and I'm scared for the life changing event occuring in the next few months.

Sorry if this is not the correct format too.",03Sep2020,1

34,"Before the pandemic everything was great, my wife and I and our 2 kids (2yr old boy &amp; 7 year old boy) were pretty stable, both of us working and my mother watching our kids. Once the pandemic hit, I lost my job completely and my mother being high risk has refused to watch my kids now and I don’t have anybody to watch my children so I’ve been the stay at home dad collecting unemployment while my wife works. We’ve tried to figure out if it’s possible for me to work and can’t seem to fathom a way to make it possible. Childcare is already expensive but if the state seems it unsafe to send my 7 year old to school, I won’t be sending them to childcare (which I couldn’t afford in the first place) Especially since school just started and it’s all online from 9am-3:30pm. We’ve kept a pretty tight savings account for emergencies and haven’t been doing so bad as far as finances go, especially with unemployment keeping us on top of things (Before the extra benefits ended). 

But I’m stuck in the house all day everyday with my kids since my wife uses the car to travel to work. I live in a neighborhood that has no space to be outside. We go to a park throughout the week but it’s a pretty bogus park. We recycle doing the same outdoors activities which has gotten boring at this point. I’m just lost and can’t figure out how to get back on top of things again. I moved to Washington state after serving in the military to be near my mother who was down on tough times and now that she has practically ghosted us from Covid drama we are just sort of stuck and frustrated. This online schooling isn’t easy either, my 7 year old absolutely hates it, understandably. As much patience as we try to have in getting his assignments done - we are not school teachers. I’ve been wanting to move back to my home state and buy a house and I can’t do that without having a job. 

Any advice on how to get out of this trap that I’ve stumbled upon?",03Sep2020,1

I'm a shy person and now feel like I'm just not good at sex and am wondering should I try to learn with different men or hold off until a new relationship (even if it takes me into my twenties yikess)

Should I value experience and being good at it over saving my virginity another while?

36,"My job and most jobs in my company can now be completely virtual, which I'm alright with.  I currently live in New Jersey, and due to the insane cost of living, and how it will get a lot more expensive in the coming years, I'm considering moving out of state (but within the US).  So, I'm looking for issues and suggestions of places to look at.

I was thinking of Phoenix, it seems like a good city, but the heat may be an issue, and the scorpions (but I can deal with that). 

Aside from that, I'd prefer an area that is:

* Near a larger city
* Affordable (this is the most important)
* Would like to be near an MLB team
* Would like to be near some National Parks (photography is a hobby)
* Little risk of getting destroyed by hurricanes/flooding (I was thinking Houston, but the flooding concerns me)

Another city I was thinking about was Salt Lake City, but I'm still looking into that some more.

37,"*I'm a minor* For the past 2 years I've constantly been changing who I am. Completely. I'll factory reset my phone and create a new email and all new socials and stuff before deleting them within the hour. I've done this hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Now I just want to be normal and stick with one, but I can't figure out how. I don't even have any usernames, because I've used them all in the past. I can't access them because I've forgotten the passwords and can't reset them.

 On top of that, I didn't delete the accounts I actually should've, so the normal ones are taken, like all possible variations of my name, including nicknames. Also, I feel like I can't just use my name because there's so many old accounts of mine it looks like I've been hacked or trolled. If you look up my name on Instagram for example (my name is one of a kind) there's about 10 results. What I need:

- A username. I want it to be consitient between platforms, and at this point I don't really care if it's related to my name or not. I hate my name at this point, honestly. (I could and would never change it.) Should I accept that a million accounts hold my name and it's obvious that they're mine, or... try and put a spin on my name that won't be on other accounts?

How do I keep with the same account once I've got it? I gave this need for every aspect to line up perfectly, whether it's the date, time, I took a bad photo, I misspelled something... it's crazy.

I'll cut people out of my life because they know too much about me. I'll redo my room or my wardrobe, just fir it to hr a waste of time because I ""mess something up"". I feel the need to have an ""aesthetic"" and absolutely everything has to fit into figurative perfect boxes. I constantly want to completely start my life over from scratch, and my life isn't too bad.

Do I have some kind of mental illness? Nobody else in my life knows about this, and I know my parents would say I'm overreacting, but... I know for a fact this isn't normal. If I do have a mental illness, professional help isn't an option, so I couldn't even be diagnosed. If I may have mental illnesses, what may they be? Are there any online resources that could help me?

41,"we were together for about 6 years. It had great times and bad times. Things ended between us because she felt like I wasn't trying hard enough to meet her needs and felt I wasn't trying to be a better partner. Almost immediately afterwards she started seeing people. I know because I still had to make arrangements to move out so I knew for the last 3 weeks we were still living together. 

A few months later the breakup really started to sink in, in the sense that I started to understand and reflect on just how hard I had tried to be a good partner to her and felt like I could never meet her expectations. I thought about the fights she'd start with me, how she would demean me and how she'd consistently give me reasons to doubt that she was faithful, while at the same time she continued to accuse me of being interested in other women. Long story short, I realized that my whe relationship was toxic. 

Here we are now a few more months later she texts me telling me she misses spending time with me and that she wants to see me again. I'm torn because I don't know whether to just ignore her and move on with my life or if I should talk to her. As time has gone on, I've felt more and more that we didn't really have anything in common.

Google said it could be overexercising or not eating enough but before i started missing my period i used to exercise around 1-2 times a week, hence i don’t think it was a large increase in exercise intensity. And I eat a lot. what should i do? should i decrease my runs? i know i should be going to the doctors but my family isn’t doing so well financially at the moment, so i will avoid that option for now.

My only question is when I do open it and obviously the 4 of us aren’t going to drink all of it, what do I do with it??? do I just empty it in some gallon jugs I have?? I know it won’t taste as great if I do that but will it be that bad that I can’t drink it? i’m so confused as to what to do and I feel like a dumbass.

46,"So the title is pretty self explanatory so I’ll (M) go into more depth. Roughly about 3 years ago my buddy on Xbox introduced someone he played a game with to our bigger player group. For the sake of anonymity let’s call this person June (F). Me and June talked mostly within the gaming group via Xbox chats or Facebook chats. We all got along in the group and everything was pretty great. I then unfortunately started to Develop a small crush on her which I decided to tell her about it. Im not really great at getting my words across for stuff like that but made it through it. She said she was flattered but was in a long distance relationship with my buddy who introduced her to the group. Me being a little crushed by that I dealt with it in my own way but we still continued to be friends and nothing really changed.

Fast forward to the end of 2019. June and her bf were having some issues in their relationship. To keep it respectful I won’t go to deep into details. I tried my best to help them out as best I could cause I genuinely believed that they were great together despite how I felt for her. She ended things off with him and the group splintered off. Me and June still kept in touch and I tried my shot again after a couple months to respect the relationship she had with him. She said she didn’t know what she wanted and would like to keep it just as mutual friends. I was ok with that. But lately I’ve been thinking it’s about time I end the friendship with her. I don’t think it’s healthy for me to continue to try for someone who doesn’t want to be with me romantically.  We used to talk all the time but lately anytime I send a message I don’t get a reply back till a week later or none at all. I understand that COVID makes things more or a priority but it sucks that I might be an annoyance or an after thought in our friendship. 

Anyone got any advice on how to end this smoothly or am I just over reading the whole situation?",03Sep2020,1

I saw some little wiggly things and instantly thought “oh I guess I stepped in pasta” until it started moving. Maggots. First time I’ve ever even seen them before and it absolutely freaked me out. I threw them in the wash because I read online the heat from the dryer would definitely kill them.

At my job the floors are pretty gross, a lot gets dropped and there’s always a constant light layer of water on the ground. I’ve never personally seen the ground get cleaned but it supposedly happens after I leave for the night. I just started working there and at my past jobs I have never had this problem. It’s to the point that I don’t really want to bring my shoes into my own apartment because I don’t know what I’ll track in.

Ever since my discovery I wash them as often as possible, try to wash them every time I use them because even a single night of working packs them full of grease to the point they become slippery and if I get lazy and put it off ants are all over them the next day. I can’t even keep them outside anymore since I moved to a new apartment. 

Is there something new I should be doing to stop this? Is this normal? Is the kitchen at my job just that disgusting? I’ve checked the health inspections online and they always pass just fine. Help me please.",03Sep2020,1

Loki and Thor are brothers, Vicky is not blood-related to them.  Loki is the problem, we've owned him for about 5 years and he's started peeing outside the litterbox and around the house where he shouldn't, he did this last year and now he's doing it again this year.

We have three litter boxes, two upstairs and one downstairs they are spread out around the house, I clean them every Tuesday and Saturday.
I had just cleaned them yesterday and this morning he had peed on my clothing on the floor

Loki has been peeing on cardboard boxes, laundry, mats, carpets, bags, paper, clothing.  
We took him to the vet and they performed tests, nothing was wrong with him.
We have not brought in any other animals, my cats are indoor cats only, loki gets along with the other two cats, we have not brought in any big changes to the house or moved anything around

Even if the other person didn’t necessarily eat or something along those line, I would still be upset but I would also be understanding, but I guess I’m just trying to say that I wish I could stop being upset when it comes to sharing food.




And I don’t even know if I’m in the wrong or not at times, like here’s something that happened a couple of days ago. So basically my sister was going to eat pizza in 30 minutes and all I was going to eat that night was just 2 bowls of rice. My sister being hungry asks what’s up (he had already eaten pizza for lunch) and my dad had said there’s food downstairs (he mentioned the rice) and sure enough my sister grabs the bowl of rice that was essentially my dinner and eats it when she was gonna get pizza anyway. So I was upset that she just did that, and I’m sure she knew I was going to eat it since she knows that’s my favorite.




But yeah, that’s what’s up. Like see what I mean, I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong there or not. But at the end of the day, I truly don’t wanna be stingy with food anymore, even when I’m super hungry. Because I’m sure I’m gonna have kids that will always want my food and I obviously don’t wanna be stingy with them, but even then I don’t wanna be stingy period. 




Like with me, I won’t take someone’s food especially if I know they haven’t eaten, and I’ll only ask to try it if it’s something I’m curious in how it tastes. But like obviously the piece is just a standard piece, like not the whole plate.",03Sep2020,1

Along with my mom and dad at home there are my two kid siblings, my brother (10) and sister (7). The whole situation is just kind of awkward, like there's two children who still need to be told to brush their teeth and then an adult child who goes to school and works full time, it's just a really strange dynamic.
Before I turned 18, which was very recently, I also worked and went to school, but I was obviously still legally a child. My mom would expect me home for dinner, want to know where I was, who I was with, so on. Now, idk I still feel like I'm supposed to, like if I didn't come home for dinner I'd get calls after calls and idk. I feel my parents, especially my mom, have a hard time from switching from kiddie mode with my siblings, to adult mode with me. Also I just have a different schedule than all of them. I have a 10 hour work and school day. When I get home at 6, I don't want to wait til 8:30 to eat, I want to eat asap and sleep or nap then eat, or whatever. But I stay up to have dinner cuz there's just a feeling that im obligated to. 
Another situation is like if I now wanna go over to a guys house or just out at night, I feel like she'd pry and it'd just be awkward. I just envy the fact ppl my age in college or on their own get to do what they want with their new found adulthood. I'm just scared I'll be treated like a kid for the rest of my time at home and I feel trapped. Also being at my house just does my head in. I love my siblings don't get me wrong, and sometimes its really great to have such younger siblings, but man hearing them bicker with each other, fight with my mom, hear her give out to them, and so on 24/7 really wrecks me. On my days off if I have no plans I still go out and drive to a parking lot just to play on my phone, watch yt, etc. for hours because that's the only time it's quiet for me.
Whole thing is just making me feel panicked, anxious and depressed as fuck. I know, ""save for your own place"" I am. I also just bought my first car and tools for work, and it's just expensive where I am (Connecticut) and trying to find somewhere near work and school that isn't atleast 1,200k a month is hard. I didn't think this would be an issue. I also don't want to hurt my parents by just up and leaving. Especially my mom, I know she's worried I'm gonna leave and doesn't want me to, she's been trying to smother mother me a good bit leading up to my bday and now.
Honestly any advice helps. Or stories of your own experience of living at home, especially around the age I'm at. It's just a weird limbo imo. Its really taking a mental toll on me and I just don't know what to do, thank you :)

TLDR: Just turned 18, living at home while going to school (plus working) with my 10 and 7 yr old siblings. Parents seem to have a hard time with the age differences/transition of me being an adult now. treating me like a kid pretty much. The situation is stressing me out big time, advice?",03Sep2020,1
58,"
I’ve lived with my dad my whole life ever since the age of 3. My grandma raised me until the age of 3. The only positive memories I have with my dad is him teaching me how to ride the bike. Every other time we spent together was when we ate, and he drank. The only time my parents spend together was when my mom cooks for my dad and he eats and drinks and talks shit to my mom. He complains about my moms relatives, my mom, people that have “done bad” to him. One time he complained about my mom saying hi to my friend’s neighbor. He complained about it for months. My mom never talked back.

Recently, my mom stopped eating with him because he won’t stop saying things to my mom that makes her feel bad. He’d rather not eat with my mom at all than stop talking shit. My dad never goes on walks with us, never eats with us without drinking and making my mom feel bad, never helped my mom buy groceries or do laundry or carry home cases of water. My only interaction with my dad is eating and him drinking. His whole face changes and he turns into a different person when he drinks. He only talks to me when he drinks. And it’s not pleasant conversation.

Recently, while I was home from college for a bit, I decided to talk to my dad. I tried to put it in the nicest way possible. I told him if he’s unhappy and everyones unhappy, we can talk about it and try to solve the problems. I told him it always feels awkward between us, and we don’t even talk or spend time together. He replied with “if you’re unhappy then leave.” He said he doesn’t feel like he did anything wrong.

Before, I used to smile at him when I get home or wake up and that’s the only interaction I’d have with him. After that conversation, I stopped doing it.

He would tell my grandma that hes afraid of his wife. That’s a lie. He told my grandma “my daughter left for college and she didn’t tell me” If he talked to me or spent time with me, he would know naturally. My mom knows what I eat everyday, what I do, and when I leave for college because my mom spends time with me.

I usually would tell him when I’m leaving, and I usually would smile at him when I pass. I usually would send photos of my food to our family groupchat. Those were the only interactions. I decided to stop doing them because as time passes I just feel more angry at my dad. It kind of feels like sending streaks on snapchat to someone who you don’t know. Except he’s my dad and we live together.

Just looking for some advice. Thank you!

TLDR: My dad and I have a nonexistent relationship my whole life even though we live together. We don’t eat together, we exchange no conversation, I don’t even have his number saved. I call my grandmas every week, and my mom everyday. I’ve tried to talk to him, seriously, twice in my life about our family and how he feels. Nothing works.",03Sep2020,1
59,"So I just graduated from high school in June and now the big question is what do I study. The thing is I’ve always wanted to become a singer there was never something else I wanted to do that much but I know it’s just a dream and nothing that would really work in reality. I also thought about studying music oder something like that so that I have the musical aspect in it but I’m honestly not really skilled with music theory and all and I don’t have what you need to study music. I thought I could try and learn everything I need to get accepted and to get my degree but then the next problem is how am I going to get a job I can live off in a decent way. So no does not work. 

Ok so I decided if I can’t pursue music I want to do something in the creative industries no matter what. I’ve always been interested in fashion and clothing and designers, etc. so I decided to try and apply for Fashion Design Bachelor. I created my portfolio, wrote a motivational letter, send in my cv and applied for it. And I got accepted. I was really happy that I actually got accepted since it’s not easy to get into that university and all BUT here’s the problem: I live in Germany and the universities here aren’t private and you almost don’t pay anything for a really good education. The universities here that have the major fashion design however are private so I gotta pay about 16 times the amount of money I would have to pay if I went to a “normal” university. The problems with this major are 
1. It’s really expensive 
2. I would have to get a job cause I don’t want my parents to pay everything and wouldn’t have a lot of time cause one job is definitely not enough money but I actually wouldn’t have enough time for more jobs
3. Will I get a job after graduation that I will be able to live a decent life off? Probably not cause I’m not going to be the next Christian Dior directly after that. 
I think it’s the same with music you can’t just become a “star” whether it’s in fashion or music. So I probably will not really earn a lot, will have to pay a whole lot of money, my parents will have to sacrifice some things and will have to worry a lot and I will not be able to do anything else in my life cause I gotta pay so it’s only school-work-home everyday for 3,5 years. 

Now you might think bro just don’t do it if it brings all these problems with it but the thing is I really want to do it. Like really. I want to be in the creative industries so bad and this is the only thing I can think of and imagine myself doing if it’s not music. 

I know this is getting to long and probably going into the wrong direction but now the actual actual problem is I say I want it but do I want it because I want it or do I want it because I want to be replace something or want to be famous or  I don’t know what. I just can’t figure myself out and I am really scared of doing the wrong thing again (chose wrong “high school majors” I don’t know if you have something like that in your country). This time my decision will actually impact my future so yeah I don’t know what to do and I don’t really have people to talk to about it. 

I also applied for management and business majors but I get the replies for them really late probably at the end of September but fashion design starts in a week. 

I know it’s complicated and very long so sorry for that and if you read till here thank you very much and also thank you for answers.",03Sep2020,1

I thought he just wanted to hang out, then COVID began becoming a larger issue.

He said it was fine and to not think about it, and we could hang out another time and we haven't spoken much since.

A few days ago he texted me asking about the $20. By this point I had completely forgotten I owed him money, but whatever. I apologized and asked for his number or Venmo or whatever he used to get cash electronically. He said he didn't want cash, he wanted me to take him out on a date with said money instead. 

I never thought of any of this as seriously flirty, so not at all a date. I even told him the first time it wasn't going to be a date and he agreed. The sudden change came very out of the blue. 

He has a very strong personality that can be hard to manage sometimes, which is one of the reasons I didn't get too close to him while I was in the party scene. He is dramatic and very in the moment. I want to pay him back, I just don't want to go on a date to do so.

63,"I hate feeling like this. I really do. 

Every time one of my parents disappear for a really long time and I hear a loud crash upstairs I always think they’ve killed themselves or something when in reality they just went to go get something from the closet or dropped a bottle in the shower. Everytime my brother goes upstairs or leaves for a really long time I always always think something horrible has happened to him, like he’s tried to kill himself or he’s dead when he’s really just slept in. The other day my mom was commenting about how high our dog can jump and how cute it’d be if she could jump fences and instead of being allowed to enjoy imagining it, the first thing that popped into my head was her getting cut up and hurt by the sharp points fences have. I always panic when she runs outside without her leash because I always imagine that a car might hit her or something.

I don’t know why I have these thoughts so often, I used to never have them before. It’s so exhausting having to deal with them, I just want to live in peace.

It makes me quite paranoid because I don’t want these thoughts to manifest in real life. How can I make them stop??",03Sep2020,1
66,"(This is my first post ever, please don't judge me)

I, 26f, came out as a lesbian around 5 years ago. I know that this does not define all of me, but after all these years, figuring out this part of me has been a really important step in my life. Around that time I had a girlfriend, who I really liked, but sadly it didn't work out, and the whole time after that, nothing really happened I went on a few dates, but that was it. Now I met this guy who is a friend of a friend, and I have only met him a couple of times, but this friend told me that he was kinda disappointed that I was only into women. One night, when we had a drink with a close circle of friends, I thought that I would not say no if he wanted to kiss me. And that night, I thought of kissing him a lot. I am still not sure what this means, maybe I was just drunk and too desperate for intimacy. Tonight I saw him again, and I am still unsure if I like him or not, but I think I could be able to be actually attracted to him. Are there other lesbians who have experienced something similar, or if I found out that I do like him that way, how do I proceed?",03Sep2020,1

75,"I guess I will just say it, I want to become an artist, a parents worst nightmare to hear, a job that's uncontrollable in means of providing, I know that one can never fully know if they became an artist that it would work out or even be stable once prosperous, a job that requires dedication and creativity, requires you to be skillful and I would guess lucky.

I've also just read it back and it's so long so if you do read it all, you're a hero just for making it through. I don't know how to edit it down without leaving out things I feel are useful context/background. I'm in the UK if that is helpful info too.  

I have bipolar. It's generally under control but obviously can still sometimes make some parts of life a little challenging. The worst part being work. I have had a chaotic work history and have a repeating pattern where I'll start a job, be firing on all cylinders, great performance reviews, full of energy/enthusiasm, etc... But then I burn out and it drops off. I start making mistakes, I get so tired, I lose concentration, and I get ridiculously anxious. This has often preceded me either being signed off sick for a period, or actually leaving jobs, and taking a break. A break helps me recuperate, I feel back on form, go back to work or start a new job.... Repeat cycle. I'm painfully aware this sounds like I just don't want to work. I really do. I've had various careers which I've been genuinely passionate about, but they've all gone down the pan.  

In my current job I've started to notice this pattern again. I had a four year break shortly before this job, my longest ever break by far because I did get really quite ill and had to be properly removed from most of life while I was diagnosed and treated (before bipolar diagnosis I'd just been on the treatment-resistant-depression treadmill and getting the bipolar diagnosis really helped as I got on a treatment plan that finally worked) - in the last year or so of that break I did a bit of volunteering and stuff to get back in to the swing of things and really felt like I was better and ready to be a normal productive human being again. I got a job I was stoked about doing something I'd been interested in for ages which I felt a lot of my personal skills fitted in to. I made it through months of training, flew through it, loved most of it, great feedback, etc but then towards the end, in the month or so before we were about to pass training, I just... fell apart. Lost my mojo completely, struggling to keep up, ended up not coping. I tried so goddamn hard but it was like the harder I tried the more burnt out and upset I became until I was just either sleeping or crying all the time when I wasn't at work. I talked it over with my supervisors and we all very sadly decided it wouldn't be right for me to carry on. They were super about it and really helped me, suggested other jobs in the same organisation I could go for, even arranged for me to go and shadow some people in some of the roles and talked to the managers etc. They wanted me to succeed and I've never been more grateful for anything in any job I've had. I owe them so much. I got a job in another department. There was a good amount of time inbetween one job ending and the next one starting, a few months, enough time to rest and recuperate. I did a little bit of part time temp work to keep me going. I felt loads better. This job has much lower stress, I get to work from home a few days a week, I can be slightly flexible with my start and finish times, it has so much about it that should help with me being able to cope with it. This was going to be the time it worked out for me.  

But it's not. I've been in post for 15 months now and I'm struggling. I've been struggling for a good 6 months. Same thing as always. Got tired. Tried to adjust my meds, didn't have much effect. Error rate has gone up. I'm sad and anxious. Things were taking me too long to do so I started staying late at work so I could finish them, because the anxiety about having work left over for the next day was eating me up and I figured just staying late to finish it was the lesser of two evils. When they realised I was doing that they got concerned for my welfare and have just been so supportive. And I feel so guilty. Because based on past experiences I know it's not going to get better again. I feel so guilty that my last managers worked so hard to help me find something else I could do and it's gone to waste, and I feel so guilty taking so much support from my current team when I fear it might not help. There's been a lot of tears at home recently about how I just feel like I'm not a normal person and just don't feel like I'm capable of doing a normal full time jobs like a normal person and I want to so much but I seem to not be able to and I hate it so much and I hate my brain so much. Added to this, my family find it hard to understand my bipolar and they are all so happy that things seem to have ""worked out"" for me, as far as they know they have because I can't face disappointing them again that I've failed and got ill again, so I have no idea how I would explain yet another job ending/period of sickness to them.  

So anyway, what's currently happened is, work referred me to occupational health (for the second time - first time, in February, was just because my doctor had signed me off for two weeks while we tried tinkering with my meds, so I had an OH referral just for procedure). I spoke to the OH doctor today. She was amazing, so lovely, listened, helped, was so perceptive. My work have had me on reduced hours, 5 hours a day, for two weeks so I can try to recuperate a bit. OH are arranging for that to be extended to 6-8 weeks while we try to figure out what to do. I explained everything from above including all the tears about feeling incapable. And the doctor said (to paraphrase), ""I totally hear you, and, well... You know what... Maybe there's some truth in that, and it sucks, but it's not your fault. You have a long term chronic condition. People with long term conditions sometimes have limitations. This may well be one of yours."" It meant so much to hear someone say it's not my fault if it is the case and that has eased some of the pressure. The thing is, I can not afford to work part time on my salary. Neither my partner or I earn much money, we are low earners, and we have *just enough*. I've been less financially stable in the past than I am now and it was so difficult, I lived in a horrible place and had to constantly take money from my family just to pay bills and couldn't buy new clothes (even underwear) or shoes when I needed them and I just sat on the sofa all day sometimes with no heating or lighting and I really don't want to go back to that as a permanent way of life with no improvement in sight. My partner has health complications too so also has limitations he works with. We have enough to have a home, food, bills, the odd treat, but we do have to compromise every month on things we need or want and have very little left to save anything. Because we live together I also wouldn't get anything in the way of benefits now because the UK benefits systems says that if you cohabit and your partner is in full time work, you have a household income. His income is not enough for two people. After rent and bills we would be in negative figures (and we do not have a big house or extravagant bills). The doctor completely understood this and said she's by no means going to prescribe that I go down to part time hours, but she is going to stay in touch and try to help me work out how I can make this work. The relief I felt that someone offered to give me targeted help in this way made me sob, I'm so grateful. But... What if I just really can't manage full time work, and can't cope with the sort of jobs that would have a salary good enough to be able to pay me enough for part time hours, what if this lifelong repeating pattern does indicate that? What do I do? I'm lost for ideas. I don't know what to do. I feel totally overwhelmed and really frightened about what the future holds. Literally any advice anyone could give me would be so welcome. I'm so lost and feel very frustrated, sad, hopeless and scared.",03Sep2020,1

82,"Hello Reddit, I'm new to this so please excuse any errors.

I need some advice. A long time friend and I are having some issues and I feel like they're treating me unjustly.

Let me set up the people in the situation, 

Me (20)

I met A (18) (the friend in question) back in 2016 but we didn't really become inseparable till 2018 and when I mean we did EVERYTHING together I mean it. I felt like for a long time we were meant to be life long friends.

But I think I was just being used for whatever they wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

I have another friend we'll call him D (20), I meet him at work through A (we all work at the same place) and he and I really hit it off. We've gone on 2 trips together and have gotten matching tattoos as a joke and overall hangout all the time. We've only known each other for little over half a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm a really forgiving person and I deeply care about people but I feel like I'm reaching my wit's end. I've gone through a lot being friends with A and I feel like I'm justified in my feelings about this but I'll tell you all about some of them and I'll let you decide.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I ever went to a concert with A it was to see their at the time favorite rapper. During the concert, A wanted to get as close as we could and that led us to the very front getting completely smooshed and leading me to get pinned up against the guard rail. At some point I was grabbed by someone in the crowd and yanked away from my friend, This led to me to start hyperventilating and freaking out a little. I found A and told them what happened and they told me they were not leaving the concert so I left the concert room and found some stairs to sit on.

I had my fist every panic attack by myself, alone on the stairs of some venue watching my hands cramp up and feeling my heart racing.

I was soon sat down with some EMT's that where there and spent the rest of the concert with them until it was over and A came to find me.

A told me they wanted to go wait for the artist to come out to there tour bus behind the venue so I went with A and waited in the cold with them after all I had gone threw all I wanted to do was go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Months later I take A to see my favorite band, I paid for their ticket and was super excited to take them.  I had seen this band once before so I didn't want to be close to the stage, I just wanted to have room to dance/ jump around without bothering anyone. The day when A comes to pick me up and I see our guy friend (we'll call him 'Boy Toy') in the car...

Come to find out A bought Boy Toy a ticket and he's coming now.

Now I love being around my friends and I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't for what ended up happening. We get to the concert and I see another friend of ours (kinda) who just so happens to be Boy Toys EX-GIRLFRIEND  who he only dated for the sole reason of taking her V card...

I end up spending the concert by myself with the ex-girlfriend and her mom because A was making out with Boy Toy the entire time.

&amp;#x200B;

A has canceled plans with me to go hang out with their boyfriend.

I was there for A when their boyfriend cheated on them.

&amp;#x200B;

I was there for A when we got into a bad car crash, I pulled them out of the car, calmed them down, talked to there mom for them and just overall was there for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I canceled plans with a girlfriend of mine that A didn't like because A said they were going through it mentally and I did so because they needed me there for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple times we had plans just for the two of us and they'd bring their boyfriend without asking.

&amp;#x200B;

On A's 18th birthday, D and I split the cost of the Airbnb. I spent about 100$ for A on their birthday, and they continuously used my dead name and the wrong pronouns. D caught this very early on into the party and would blatantly use my correct name and pronouns but A didn't seem to notice. When I finally commented on it to them privately, they told me ""Oh, I'm not worried about that right now.""

&amp;#x200B;

I have a really nice camera and I LOVE taking photos of my friends, and that's what I've done for A. For A's graduation I told them I would do their pictures, when the day came all I asked for was some nice pictures of me.

Not a lot but some, and I found a really beautiful spot to take a picture. So I ask A to take a picture of me and showed them how to get the angle I wanted. They took 3 pictures all of which looked like shit. I asked A to try one more time and they gave me an attitude. I never got that photo.

&amp;#x200B;

I have photos of them all over my room, in a photo book, I've made 3 really cute videos for A with all of the videos and pictures I have of them because I care about them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know everyone shows affection for others differently but I feel like A doesn't care about our friendship. They never really talk to me and when they do its just mundane things, it mostly feels like I'm unwanted when A, D, and I hang out together. I never feel ignored when I'm around D but A?

I can't talk about anything I like or what I'm going through because they get disinterested and ignore me. They make it clear they don't like my music taste and ignore me when I show them some artwork I've done.

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning on moving out with them when they turned 18 but when we went apartment hunting they dropped the bomb that their boyfriend of about 6 months was moving out with us (but I couldn't have my at the time girlfriend over once we moved out). I was never asked if it was okay if he moved out with us. Then slowly they keep adding on other roommates that I was not asked about, so I told A I didn't have the money and it wasn't a good time for me to move out. 

They told our friend D they think I did it out of malice because I'm mad at them for something?

I've slowly come to the realization that A hasn't really treated me well but they keep saying how they miss ""us"" and how sad they are we've drifted apart.  A has made it very obvious they are upset I'm closer to D even though they met first and has excluded me from outings, like one time I was having the worst day at work and starting crying because of how mad I was. A had plans with D and said they didn't want me around.

A keeps acting as if they're upset their not with D and myself when we're out but we've never once said they can't be there. 

Now A has told us that they are going through a ruff patch mentally but only wants to hang out with D. Someone they've only known for about a year but not me, someone they've known longer.

I feel like this is a waste of my energy to worry about and put up with when they're never here for me when I need them. 

But I also don't want to abandon them if they really do need help and are 'going through it mentally'; But so am I and I feel like this is just keeping me down, am I wrong for thinking that? What should I do about our friendship?

&amp;#x200B;

(TL;DR) I think my friend is treating me like trash after I've done nothing but work on our friendship, but I don't want to abandon them altogether.",03Sep2020,1
83,"so i used to be a super picky eater, but for the past couple of years i've been really good and eating just a bout anything besides things i for sure know i don't like. however i've been with my boyfriend for about a year and some months and he's pickier than i've ever been. i mean chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, mac and cheese, pizza. and that's really it. he feels pressured eating around his family and other people cause people don't get it and tell him to ""just try it"" and from experience i know that doesn't help. but it's getting to the point where i'm really worried, i want him to be healthy and with him having pre existing health issues i know it can make things just worse all around. i don't know how to get him to try other things or even just eat normal chicken not chicken tenders or  chicken nuggets like just home made chicken. i don't know what to really do. he's got a consistency issue and issues with food touching as i've discussed with him before but it feels like he may never try anything and he's going to be stuck eating this same garbage for ever and that's not a way to healthily live. i hope someone can give me so advice on this and how to help him try other things. i would do anything for him and it hurts me going to eat with his family and him not being able to come cause he feels pressured or even embarrassed. i want him to be able to just eat food and explore what he's really missing. i love him and want him to be okay. so please if you have any advice at all that would be amazing.",03Sep2020,1

88,"I've had this friend since I was 7 we are 3 years apart. He moved away when I was in 7th grade. I am now 18 and he is 21 and we just recently started to talk again. 

We use to talk romantically when I was 16 and he was 19. But then he completely ghosted me for a year. I got into a relationship during that time but it still really hurt what he did. 

Now fast forward back to the present. We are now both single again and have begun to talk romantically again. As I have said I am now 18 and he is 21. He lives an hour and a half away from me. He came to visit me last weekend and we talked about the ghosting situation. He wants to move back to the city where we grew up in (I still live there) in about 6 months. 

I'm really scared if I should start dating him or not because last time he literally just ghosted me randomly. And this relationship would be long distance lowkey and we'd at the very most see eachother maybe once a week but it be more like once every 2 or 3 weeks. He said that is ok if I want to wait till he moves back closer to me to actually date but I'm scared that he'll find someone else and I really really like him.

89,"Hello.

I'm 18, and I've very recently started classes in a community college. Due to the pandemic, the proximity of the college to my house, and that it's now entirely online, I've been living at home. However, the only reason I am enrolled in college is because my parents, specifically my mother, who I live with, want me to get ""at least an associates degree"", because she said verbatim, ""You say you'll stop working and go back to college, but then you never do, or when you do go back you don't finish, just like \[X person she knows\] and \[X person she knows\], and then you'll be mad at me for being successful"".

Since my sophomore year of high school, I figured that it'd be best for me personally to go into the trades. During the summer, I figured out that I'd like to get into locksmithing specifically. This college doesn't offer locksmithing courses, and the closest locksmithing school is 3 hours away \[Though the closest locksmiths who may be open to apprenticeships are much closer, but either way\]. On top of that, I've recently got a job offer from a woman who owns a cleaning company in the area. This is something I've been trying to get into for a long while, so I really do want to get hired by her.

However, I know that I won't be able to work for her full-time if I continue college, and on top of that I'll have to wait 2 years in order to get a degree I don't want to even attempt to get an apprenticeship or enroll in a locksmithing school, if I even have the money. I'm also aware that I may get kicked out if I drop out of college, especially if my mother and I don't reach some kind of agreement. Even though this is making me feel trapped, I have made my mind up that, at some point this semester, I'm going to drop out of my community college.

I don't need advice on how to get her to let me drop out or make me stay, I have a therapist who I see regularly, and my mother apparently wants her input. I still very much want to prepare because, even if my therapist sides with me, I'm pretty sure I'll still be kicked out, as she's disagreed with what former therapists of mine had said and done the opposite of what was advised.

Thing is, I have no friends in the area, the only other family that lives close by is my father who wouldn't be able to take me in, I have very little in my bank account, and we're still in a pandemic. My mother owes me money, but the amount wouldn't really help in the long run. I'm not sure if any places are for rent due to the pandemic, and I have no driver's license \[I can't drive\]. I'm also disabled and I do take medication for it, so if I get kicked out, I'm worried that she may take me off her insurance. What should I do, and how should I prepare if/when I do get kicked out?

TL;DR: I may get kicked out for dropping out of college so I can work and get a certificate in a skilled trade, how do I prepare for this?",03Sep2020,1

93,"So my sister fell off her horse two Christmas’ ago and became paralyzed. She has been lucky enough to recover partially (as the unsympathetic doctor told her she’d never walk again as soon as she woke up). 

She is currently progressing and has to walk with crutches (more like ski poles).

Today I was told that some man said to her ‘nice day for skiing’ and she has had other rude comments towards her.

Obviously, as her brother, I would have beat the living shit out of this guy but we don’t live together anymore.

I’m hoping we can put our heads together here to find a comment that will make such people feel small and crush them. I usually am not like this but this breaks my heart.

94,"I've recently developed severe pregnancy anxiety. I have no idea what it seems from. I never had anything traumatic happen at all. I've always had worries even before I've gone all the way. I for a while thought that sperm on my hand from masturbation with my bf could go on tp and get into me. And I would freak out until my already irregular but there period came. Then I overcame that stupid irrational thought and educated myself.

Now about a year and 3 months ago I got on Nexplanon. I wanted to get an IUD but after finding out the implant is more effective than an iud AND sterilization and it can't mess up I got it. The first few months were so nice. I've had spotting, but then my periods disappeared and it was/is so nice not to be in pain anymore. I like how the implant can't shift like an iud and fail and that it stops ovulation extremely well. All the studies I've read either didn't find any failure with nexplanon or the person was already pregnant or they had some medication interaction. Not having any of those problems it was a win/win. My bf and I still use condoms and he has this thing which ends up with perfect pull out and no premature ejaculation. Aside from regular precum. 

But then a year in I don't know what happened. I suddenly got super sick. Like woke up with extreme nausea and dry heaving. Then threw up that same day. This cause a extreme panic attack. I took pregnancy tests but they were negative. I've had stomach issues and nausea, but not as bad as day one. A week after it started I went to my obgyn and she even did a blood test seeing how scared I was. It was negative. I should have been fine right? Haha no. My anxiety kicked in again and I still had on and off nausea and stomach issues, including weird stools and stuff. It was hard to eat. I cut out bread and the thought of food freaked me out and anything and everything made me think of pregnancy. I must have taken over 50 pregnancy tests from clear blue, to Walgreens brands, to several types of amazon strips. Still all negative. The nausea has gone away after about 2 months. It got progressively less serious and would often act up when I was anxious. After crying I always felt better. 

I've tried to calm myself down since. It's been better. I'm not 24/7 anxious, but it's on and off panic attacks. First I'm fine. I know I used 3 methods of contraception, I had a blood test a week after nausea started (before I had breast pain that went away), I have had periods in several months because of my birthcontrol, all home tests are negative, I found out about overloading pregnancy tests so I diluted urine so any hormones would bind better. Still negative and I can't but think something is wrong. It would be over 16 weeks for me by now. No baby bump. Stomach issues and burping with certain foods that I haven't had before, but I wake up with a flat stomach and go to bed with a slightly expanded one after eating.

Still this anxiety is there. I have a gi doctor appointment later this month and a ob appointment again. I don't want to change my birthcontrol. Anything else would be less effective and worse for my anxiety. I just don't know what to do or how to react. I'm tired of being so anxious. I want my sex life back. Saying ""oh just don't have sex"" is stupid because I haven't had sex in the last 3.5 months because of this. I want to be able to like every normal human being.

What should I do?",03Sep2020,1
95,"I [18,f] started college last week. So far w/ this pandemic, all of my classes have been online, which I don’t enjoy at all. I’ve declared my major to be nursing and aim to get my bachelor of science for it. Thing is, lately I’ve been doubting if I should continue this path. I know I’m capable of completing the course and getting into my uni’s nursing program, but I don’t know if it’s the right path for me. I know I’m young and I still have time to decide, but money is a big factor -I don’t want to pay for classes that won’t be beneficial for my future (even though I’ve gotten a scholarship that covers most expenses). I have this strong intuition that life has a lot in store for me, but I’m not sure what (it’s quite a flighty dream).

I don’t know how to proceed with exploring. I’ve tried taking personality/career tests and quizzes, but I’ve found that my hobbies usually influence the results. I love my hobbies, but I don’t see myself pursuing careers in those areas. For more context about me, mentors and friends have said that I personify the “modern renaissance woman.”  I learn concepts and skills quickly and often will be diligent in improving, especially if I’m interested in it.

98,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years now. Our first year I got my own apartment and he kind of moved himself in and didn’t help with any bills (He didn’t have a job). I was the only one with a car at the time, so he would always drive my car... pick &amp; drop his brother up from work, do things for his mom IN MY CAR. Sometimes he would randomly break down and cry because he was stressed out and i guess since he was broke. I moved out of the apartment to go back to my mom’s house in hopes that he’ll go back to his moms house because I didn’t know how to break up with him (he was always crying). I knew taking care of someone’s son wasn’t what the universe had planned for me. Unfortunately, he followed me to my moms house... he wouldn’t go home. My mom and everyone would tell me to stop being mean to him, but they didn’t know he was broke and didn’t seem to want to work. 

A few months later he ended up getting a job and really starting becoming a provider. I ended up getting me a new car and passed my old car to him, being that he didn’t have one and i just wanted MY OWN CAR! He then decided it was time for us to get our own apartment together, and we did. He was able to pay most of the rent... $500/$600 and I paid utilities. I started noticing that he was basically just letting his brother use the car I gave him whenever. Sometimes the brother would have the car for days, then weeks and then it was like it was his. I didn’t say anything, because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings and he starts to cry again (silly me). 

About 6 months into us living together, he lost his job and the brother cased mechanical issues on the car. Of course that’s when he returned the car to our house. Neither one of them cared to get it looked at or fixed... therefore our apartment complex towed it. Again... neither one of them cared to get it out the tow yard and get it fixed. Here I am back paying ALL the bills... my boyfriend thinking he’s gonna just use my car all day and drop me off to work everyday after I just gave him a car and he let his brother have it.

6 months later... our lease is up and I’m going back to live with my mom to save to move to texas and get away. I try to put my foot down and break up with him but he just cried and plays victim. Yes he’s sweet and provides for me when he is able. But, he just got too entitled. He grabs my keys without asking. He smokes in my car all day, causing me to smell like weed. The side hustle he has is obviously not doing him any good because all he can afford to do is buy me fast food. We don’t go on any dates anymore because when I let him pay for our tab after he acts like he got it in front of the waiter, he asks for it back when we get home. 

I’ve tried to motivate him to build his credit, open up a banking account, get a JOB, and save for a car and he just wants to live like a bum. Im over it! Am I wrong? I want someone whose going to make things easier not harder. I want to go on dates, buy each other gifts... but he’s broke. I cannot",03Sep2020,1
99,"Throughout my life people have never put in an effort to get to know me, instead they wrongly assume what I am like (most likely a boring and negative stereotype), automatically creating a disconnect. This has happened even who I was a kid, so much so that I am convinced my own dad (who is definitely a good man but just too busy) didn't get me into sports or any other activity.

By the way how did most guys get into sports? Was it their fathers or friends?

Anyways, the only time I make friends is when people want to use me. I consider myself intelligent and more hardworking than most of the people that I have met in my young life of 18 years old. The most recent ''close friendship'' was this lazy guy trying to use me to get his grades up- he didn't have anyone else to talk to in school and I was new. Now I just want to be comfortable on my own. My greatest need was to have friends, now I just see it as a stupid weakness. I'm not asking to survive without any sort of human interaction I know its not possible.

In short, The majority of my social interactions have been negative. I just want wisdom on how some people such as George O'keeffe (A painter that uses solitude from Ted ed) are able to do that, even ritually. History repeats itself and when that happens its because there is a common denominator- and its me. Fundamentally there are aspects of my personality that I can't change without being fake. But I am not shy (I am quite the opposite actually) or hideous enough to cause people to not want to talk to me. But for whatever reason I have had enough of trying-  I have never once had a true **close** friend. I'm going uni in about 2 weeks an I know a similar thing will happen once I get there. I'm not gonna try and shut everyone out, I just wanna know the best way to deal with the inevitable loneliness that comes with being labelled and excluded that will always come.

I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have it, I'm aware self diagnosis is not okay but even though my family has a history of anxiety and depression my parents never cared about my mental health. I'm on a pretty bad economic place right now (and I have been for a couple of years now) and that's why I've read tons about anxiety and depression to try and help myself since I can't afford to go to therapy. 

I'm a pretty reserved person and I've never been good at making friends when I'm not around them all the time, I was studying college online and then the pandemic happened so it's been 3 years that I've been stuck at home. I just don't feel like my personal life is moving forward, I've been stuck since I graduated high school in the same place and I'm too scared to try anything new

I've lost my motivation to do anything and I started drawing again but I barely feel motivated to actually finish a drawing, and it's the same thing with exercising. Sometimes it's just physically impossible for me to do it or concentrate in doing just one thing.

I've been watching A LOT of tv shows and it's been helping a lot to keep my mind off of things and stop over thinking, but once I finish a show I just feel this void inside, this pressure in my heart and I have this feeling of hopelessness that is unbearable. 

I can be completely fine one day and at the edge of a breakdown the next day

I don't know what to do anymore. Please help.",03Sep2020,1

111,"I live in Florida for context.

A few weeks ago, I bumped a car in front of me when she abruptly stopped in a right turn lane on a green arrow. There was another car in front of her, however the impact didn't cause her to hit that car. 

I immediately turned on my flashers and collected my information. 

She took a few minutes to get out of her car, and when she finally did, she was on her phone; distracted enough that she left her driver side door open for oncoming traffic to (almost) hit. 

She didn't acknowledge me, but continued talking on the phone while she inspected both my car and hers. She told whoever she was talking to that there was so damage and she was fine. She finally acknowledged me after I told her that cars were honking to warn her that her driver side door was still open. 

She finally hung up the phone, then asked to move our cars out of the turn lane. So I followed her to a street over so we could talk without cars honking at us to move our cars from the lane. From there, she inspected the damage again, but claimed she saw none. Immediately, she was back on her phone trying to reach her teenage son. (She told me she was on her way to pick him up, and needed to call him to tell him she'll be late.) He didn't answer, so she called someone else to try to get a hold of him. Again, she held a conversation with this person about the incident while I awkwardly stood there. 

When she finally put her phone away, we exchanged information. She didn't take any pictures and no police report was filed/no police were called. Again, she said she didn't see any damage, claimed she was fine, and that she needed to go pick up her son. 

So we parted ways there. 

Next day, my insurance reaches out to me about a claim, however my insurance didn't actually call me to get my side of the story until yesterday (this incident happened weeks ago). 

How would insurance work for an incident for little, if any, evidence? Should I file a claim with her insurance myself due to her distracted driving?",03Sep2020,1
112,"COVID has made it so you can't be evicted from your place and some people have been fools saying ""I don't have to pay rent."" Stupid idiots, of course you have to pay the rent still. Just because they can't evict you now, doesn't mean you don't have to pay. You still have to pay what you owe and when it ends (next month for this state), they're going to want all that back pay + late fees.

Here is where the problem is. I have been paying for my half of the rent this whole time but my roommate hasn't. We are both on the lease and have been splitting it. When I went to the office yesterday to drop off a money order, the leasing agent asked me if I knew we had an outstanding balance. I had no idea because I was paying my part and have all my receipts to prove it. He has gotten in the hole $2100 and I am just finding out now. They gave me a copy of the records and my name appears all the time but his very seldom.

We've been friends for 15 years. He helped me with a few things I needed and I am grateful. But since we moved out here from Massachusetts to Arizona, he has been getting involved with all the drama and making stupid decisions. He's changed jobs 5 times in 2 years, every time getting fired. He got with this girl and she wanted to get out of the projects so they signed a lease on a house together and that's where his rent went because he couldn't afford to pay for both. Now they had a falling out and he came back here after staying there since November last year.

So when I found out that from the rental office, I was pissed. He got back to the house and I asked him WTF was going on. He's giving me bullshit saying he's been paying them, their paperwork is wrong. We did have issues in the past with paperwork but it was never over $2000, more like a hundred or less. I'm pretty sure that it's not a $2100 mistake and he knows that he screwed up. I haven't seen or heard from him since yesterday and he told me that he was going to go to the office with me and talk to him. Since he didn't show up, it's telling me he's avoiding the issue.

The way I see it, I have two options. Either I talk to the office and see because I have been keeping up my end of the deal, if they will let me downgrade to a  studio. I'll have to pay for damages to the apartment I'm in plus a few to transfer the electric to the new place and have to sell some of my stuff. Or, I talk to my sister and maybe sell just about everything I own with the exception of my truck, TV, PS4 and clothes, pack up and head for New Hampshire. My job should allow me to get a transfer to another store there and at least I will be closer to my family again. As far as he goes, at this point I can care less. Yes we have been friends but now I have no trust for him. 

Judging by what you have read, and I do appreciate you reading it and any advice would be appreciated, what do you think I should do? Is there really anything else I can do besides what options I have?",03Sep2020,1

116,"I’m genderfluid and in the closet, and my parents are transphobic. They’re avid Fox News, rush Limbaugh, and Trump supporters, and they’re convinced that being trans is a mental illness and that we need to be given therapy to live in our body how it is in birth, and that “god doesn’t make mistakes so how can someone’s gender not be aligned with their AGAB?”. 

I don’t want to cut them out of my life when I move out, but I’m scared they’ll never come around and I don’t know what to do. I have really bad dysphoria and I don’t think they’ll accept me when I publicly come out. They’re always convinced that they’re right and I’m wrong, and I’ve had zero luck with convincing them they’re wrong about anything so far.

Does anyone have any advice? This is my senior year of high school and after that I’m going to college, so it’s not like I have to live with them for much longer if I can’t convince them, I just would like to not lose them if at all possible. Sorry for the long rant, thanks in advance!",03Sep2020,1
117,"Want to start with saying I know I need to move on, but I need help in processing this. My ex and I broke up about a month ago (she dumped me) and we haven’t talked much since. I had made attempts to reconcile, but I’ve really been working on myself and finally told her last week that I had accepted the breakup and would love to try to be friends. 

Two days ago, she FaceTimed me out of nowhere asking if I could help move something in her house for her. I did, then she asked if I wanted to go grab a beer and some food. We did and it was fine, no heavy conversation, just casual. We both laughed, it wasn’t tense, all good. She even snapped me at few times yesterday.

Fast forward to today, I text her saying ‘hey wanna grab food tomorrow?’ No response, didn’t think much of it. Later noticed that she has removed me on IG, so I texted her (probably not the smartest move) saying “....did you block me on IG? Not sure if it was on purpose but kinda thought we were all good with being friends” No response. Called (again probably not smart) but no answer.

I think she’s ghosting me now and I’m just confused about it. The reality is she knows I still love her, but it’s still odd considering that she was the one who called me two days ago asking for a favor literally anyone could have helped her with. Then asked if I wanted to grab food, then she snapped me multiple times. 

Was she just wanting closure, does she not respect me, or is she just messing with my head? I’m lost, man.",03Sep2020,1

120,"I am an international student in Australia and it is extremely difficult for us to find a job here after graduation due to our visa status. Dont get me wrong, its an amazing country. You need to extremely skilled to find a job. A lot of helpless students are contacted by 'companies' who offer to provide them an internship in their related field, where they need to work for free for a period of 3 to 6 months. On top of that, these companies charge around 1000-2000$ for their service. On a normal day, I would have ignored these calls, but due to the pandemic, I had lost the job that I was working part time. I was going through a tough phase and I was contacted by one of these companies who promised me on the call they would find me an internship within a month.

I had to pay 300$ for the registration so that they could start the process. The person on the phone was very smooth and experienced. She did not even give me enough time to let me think about it. I got easily convinced and went for it without reading their terms and stuff.  Its been 2 months now, they havent even tried to contact me after the registration. I had to keep calling them every day to check if there was any progress. They gave up after a certain period saying that they are unable to find employers due to the lockdown and they can only help me after the lockdown ends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said Fair enough. I could understand it was difficult and I asked her if I could get a refund, because the 300$ would at least help me pay my bills in these tough times. She said sure, I will initiate the process. Its been one month now after she said that and everytime I call her, she keeps saying it will be processed in a couple of days. Today, I was contacted by a different person who said that I am not eligible for the refund because I agreed to the terms and conditions which said that the deposit was not refundable. 

I am so pissed, because the only way I can contact them now is by email. I cannot talk to them on call unless they call me because my call doesnt get connected.

121,"I have a lab and I’m kinda slow when it comes to lab. But I never stay pass the time we have for labs, I’m just usually one of the last people to leave. 

My TAs for one of my labs basically mocked me for taking a while. Everyone left early and I stayed for another 10 minutes because my partner accidentally threw out my solution so I had to make more. I still had an hour of lab left too. My TAs talked indirectly about me, saying how it shouldn’t take someone this long to do the lab and anyone who does take this long is just stupid. 

They were obviously trying to rush me so they can go home. But that’s so counterproductive because if I rush and messed up my data, I would have to redo the experiment and they would still be in the lab with me.

Not to mention, the data I collected was better than my partner who left early. So if I had rushed too, my data would’ve been bad.

124,"I recognize this post is very sulky and I'm very sorry for that, this is such a stupid issue and so many of ya'll are having much bigger issues so I apologize.

Throughout my life I've been an outcast more or less, I can remember summers as young as 7, 8 years old where nobody invited me to anything. The only time I really played with other kids outside of school was when I moved to the city with my neighbors. It didn't really bother me back then because I didn't realize I was one of the few kids who never got invited to birthday parties or out to play.

Sorry for the long post but this is something that's been happening since I was a child, I'm not sure why. I've always been extremely social and have never had a shortage of acquaintances and generally feel well liked but even with my best efforts nobody has wanted to actually become my friend. I try and do things where I'll be around other people, play sports, go hiking on popular trails, get involved in various political groups.

The only way I've been able to have any meaningful relationships is through dating. If you went through my messages over the past two years, you'd maybe find 4-5 people who contacted me that weren't someone I was either dating or hooking up with.

As a pre-teen/teen Summers were some of the worst times for me, I never was invited to anything, I spent all my summers alone playing video games in my room or outside by myself. Every year when school started again I'd lie about how fun of a Summer I had so nobody would know I spent it online. I'd talk to pretty much everyone in my school about the normal things everyone else was talking about but nobody took an interest in me.  I tried to extend it to them inviting them to hang at my house, go to football games, play video games or even but they never seemed interested in a real friendship with me  I always had to panic whenever the teachers didn't pick groups for a project because nobody wanted to be in a group with me.

I played several sports throughout high school, was involved in several clubs but I never made a bond through them. Admittedly I had a little group I ran with, ate lunch with but whenever they'd hang out outside school I'd never get an invite.  When people started having parties everyone would make sure to tell me the awesome stories about the crazy nights that were going on but I never caught an invite.  When prom happened my date ended up not going with me because I didn't have a group to go with, so I never went to prom.

I was generally well liked and thankfully never bullied but I never had a friend.

Since then, I still haven't been able to make a friend. Not at work, not in college, not outside of it. I've taken initiative myself and go out, when I do I try to talk with people.  There's been times where I'll spot someone wearing the shirt of a band I like and I'll compliment it to try and strike up a conversation but get a bland response in return. Then I'll overhear someone else compliment them on the same thing and the person gets excited then instantly sparks up a conversation with them.

I ended up going to community college after graduating where I just got a degree, I'm attending a University atm but am unable to attend in person due to corona.

I have felt like such an alien throughout my life because of this, ""what kind of person has never had a friend?"" I'm generally happy with my life now but there's been times where I've been extremely depressed even suicidal over this. It's hard when you see people you knew in high school hanging out all the time and you haven't even been to a bar before because no one is interested in going with you.

I spent my 21rst birthday sleeping in my car because I was too ashamed to tell my mom that I had no friends who wanted to go out with me on my birthday, i've done this the past five years.

I'm not sure what is wrong with me, I want to fix it so bad. I feel like I'm a pretty average person, I enjoy sports, video games, history, the outdoors, social activism and politics. I've had a multi year relationship with someone who had a large social life and I go on plenty of dates but haven't been interested in anyone romantically lately.  But clearly I'm not average if not a single person wants to spend extended time with me if we're not in some sort of fwb or dating situation.  I go out and try to meet people but nothing comes of it.

I'm just hoping that when corona's over and I move a few hours away from the city I've lived my entire life things will be different.",03Sep2020,1

One of the girls which I'm attracted towards is really nice but it still feels like they will just gravitate more towards talking with my other friends over talking with me. Saying this sounds selfish and maybe it is, but my friend recently brought up how he has been texting with said girl and is talking about how she's really cool and I hide it, but it is like a punch in the gut every time he talks about her or when she just jumps conversation from me to with my other friend, because he came in mid conversation. TL;DR :I'm feeling sad about how I always feel like a
 background character when talking with girls that hang out with our group.

Thanks for any responses this will get I'm probably just using this to get my sadness out in some sort of capacity...",03Sep2020,1
141,"I'm currently a freshman in college and I'm under so much stress right now. I don't like my current school at all and I found out that I have to somehow cough up $10k and I can't take out any loans on that according to them (and I can only take out a 2,000 loan which is subsidized and accrues interest right away), and it's messed up too because my mom is currently unemployed  but the process to get financial aid appeal is actually horrible.

I'm a pre-med so my gpa is important, but my college is kinda bad for pre-med for many reasons. No one really goes to any medical schools other than the local ones in-state that are unranked. Also, it's way too large and there's tens of thousands of students here so it's very hard to get to know my professors or to get some advising. I could keep going but one more con is that it's in the middle of nowhere and the campus felt SO off when I saw it in person. I'm just overall very depressed that I have to go to this school and I'm literally just a number to the them.

It's currently drop/add so I am deciding on whether or not I should drop all of my courses and sign up for community College courses. I see many pros of this:

pros:
- Colleges like CC applicants more for transfer admissions
- Easier classes and much better gpa
- More free time to work on my extracurriculars
- Better adjustment to college
- Cheaper

cons:
- some credits may not transfer to a four-year
- cc stigma",03Sep2020,1

144,"14[F] for the past few months (around late 2019) I have felt almost nothing, if that makes sense; just void, that isn't to say I don't feel anything *ever* cause I do, just most of the time it's just v o i d
I feel even worse due to lockdown and being pretty trapped with my brain, which is *great.* I have had thoughts of and have hurt myself, nothing serious so I wouldn't say it's r e a l l y a problem; and talking about it like it is makes me feel super weak.

I am normally the ""therapist friend"" I rarely open up, last time I did it was to a very close friend who is going through her own stuff so I haven't opened up to her in a while, I feel like she needs to talk to me and adding to her stress would be a burden she doesn't need.

I feel like everyone hates me constantly and can come up with many reasons why they do, cause I don't really like me either, I'm selfish and tend to be super annoying and clingy.

145,"So, this is complicated. Let's start this off with the fact that I am twenty two, and before you huff and puff at me, this friend (we will call her Sadie) was the step daughter of my Ex-best friend, Jenny. 

Jenny homewrecked Sadie's dad's relationship (she was barely eighteen and he was forty) and they moved in together shortly thereafter and became engaged. They took on the guardianship of Sadie because she claimed her biological mother was abusive and terrible to her because she preffered her father.

I pop into the picture years later, when Sadie is ten, and I'm quite likeable to kids (I also have a big family and a lot of neices). We bond over the horses on their property and while I'm friends with Jenny, to be honest, I get along better with Sadie, and I soon she her as a little sister of sorts.

After some personal hardship, Jenny allows me to move in with them, before this I had already noticed Jenny seemed jealous of her stepdaughter, and borderline cruel, but at the same time Jenny was extremely good to me, and in my brain, I almost thought I was imagining it, because she seemed so kind in every other way. Anyhow, I basically roped myself in so completely into her world, that in saying something about the abuse put me at risk of homelessness, but low and behold, I finally cracked after Sadie was made to sleep outside (in a swag Jenny has spat in) after recently being put into a neckbrace from a riding accident.

Cue an explosive meltdown from Jenny, where she (at least four times my size) basically beats the shit out of me and Sadie and I have to escape by basically running Jenny over and calling the police. Anyway, a few hours later, Sadie is picked up from the hospital and returned to her mother. And we ALMOST think things are looking up.

I'm temporarily homeless so I can't do much asides from getting my shit together in case the time comes and she can live with me. Fast forward to comittment and moving and a boyfriend and suddenly their are obstacles. I had promised her a place with me, but she had chosen to stay with her mother, who at the time, was all smiles and love.

It's been almost a year, and her mother has been institutionalized twice (in which Sadie stayed with me on a blow up single mattress - I slept on the floor) and has done a complete one eighty. She blames Sadie for everything, constantly puts her down, and is just terrible. She's threatened to dump her kids and made plans to do so, and most recently punched Sadie's older sister in the face! I can't speak to her mother, because she will almost certainly bar me from seeing Sadie (I walk on eggshells around her) and each time we talk, it's another update on how this poor, brave thirteen year old just.. Doesn't want to be here anymore.

It breaks my heart, and I feel responsible for putting her into that environment. What did I save her from?! Nothing. Just put her into another abusive household.

I need advice, because there's no proof (I've tried to get Sadie to discreetly video things but they happen so quickly) and this kid needs help, and I don't know how to help her.",03Sep2020,1

148,"I’ve been struggling with what I believe to be social anxiety. I’m not trying to self diagnose at all and anxiety is very common in my family but my mom never allowed me to get help because she thought that since I didn’t get panic attacks like my sister then I didn’t need to or she didn’t want me to be on medication. I tried to be open and tell my mom but i was comfortable with her and i guess she assumed I could be the same way with others. I spoke to my doctor about this and she did recommend me something but i couldn’t drive at the time so I couldn’t go get it myself and my mom still didn’t want me taking medicine. I’m a commuter student in college and only have a couple in person classes but when I go on campus I can’t help but think to myself that people are watching and judging which sounds really selfish but I feel like they think I look stupid or I dress weird or even that they hate me.

150,"So I go to McGill university in psychology. I applied to honours which is kind of required in order to go to grad school, but they only accept 40 people and the cut off GPA was 3.91 this year, mine being a 3.85. I applied for a research course after and was lucky to find a professor who wanted to supervise me (which is rare for people) and I only realized now (after a lot of organizing and back and forth emailing) that I don’t have the right prerequisites to apply for the course. 

I feel terrible that I potentially wasted so much of her time.... and she had so much faith in me and helped me out with my application. I feel sick to my stomach and want to die... the anxiety is unbearable.

154,"Warning, I'm stupid as hell when it comes to technology. So to all the computer science people and coders on this site: Please don't be an asshole about this I know I'm technologically dumb you don't have to tell me. Please explain like I'm 5.

Background info: this initially happened a couple years ago, but then it seemed to stop so I kind of forgot about it. But some fishy stuff has been happening to a lot of my accounts again such as passwords randomly resetting, my email accounts getting signed into from devices I don't own, unfamiliar account activity, etc. So I think I should do something about this.

So when I got a new phone a couple years ago, I noticed something was off. It seemed that someone else had my number, or at least had access to it. When I was in group chats with my friends, it would always automatically add another member with the same phone number as me listed. And it caused a lot of issues. So I changed my number. But that person kept automatically getting added to group chats and it wouldn't let me remove them. And then one day that extra person with my old number sent a message to our group chat telling us all to shut up and that they would block us if we ever contacted them again. I awkwardly sent a message telling them that there was something wack with my phone, they have my old number, and I'm not sending them any messages intentionally. I asked them to block my number. 

Then one of my friends told me they had found me on snapchat. I was confused because I never had a snapchat. Turns out there was an account linked to my number. I told her I didn't have a snapchat and I didn't know who that was. And then the owner of that account later requested to add my friend. She accepted, and she sent something like ""Thanks for adding me as a friend"" (idk why) and the account just responded with a smiley face. When I heard about this I asked her to block this person bc I didn't know who they were or if they were trying to impersonate me or something. This might be relevant, it might not be. I now realize they could have just had an outdated phone number listed for their account, but in my defense, at the time I was stupid and in middle school. 

A few months later, I was in a group chat for my church youth group. And then a chain mail message was sent from my number that was basically something along the lines of ""send this to 15 friends to get into heaven"". I didn't send the message even though it came from my number. Someone else did. And nobody took my phone and typed it out themselves. It was sent while I was holding my phone in my hands. It included lots of details about my specific church and in-group vocabulary that someone wouldn't know unless they were familiar with the religion I was part of at the time. It was really creepy. The person who sent it had to have learned a lot about me in order to be that accurate. It honestly sounded like it could have come from me, but it didn't. 

I changed my phone service provider and my apple ID, and all of that stopped. So I kind of just went on with my life.

But then recently I've noticed some of my email accounts have been getting logged into by other devices, and I've noticed suspicious activity happening on many of my accounts. One of my accounts got logged into and someone used it to leave a review on a furniture store. I suspect that some of my emails were deleted. All of the accounts getting logged into have very long, secure, and unique passwords. I only have these passwords saved onto one password-protected note on my phone. They aren't saved anywhere else. 

Whoever accessed these accounts must have had access to the notes on my phone, unless my account information got leaked in a data breach or something. But I checked the haveibeenpwned website and most of my compromised accounts don't show any signs of having been compromised from any mass data breach. So I think it might be possible that someone has some sort of access to my phone. Especially because of that scary ass text that was sent out from my number.

Most of the suspicious account activity I've been able to track comes from the state I live in, and a city near where I live. And I'm not sure how many of my accounts have been compromised. I have a lot of old emails. And I have a lot of old social media accounts linked to those many emails. And I can't remember all of them. I don't know which ones they have access to.

Is there a way to find all the email accounts linked to one gmail? I want to find them and make sure they're secure.

Is there a way to find all the social media sites and website sign-ups linked to one of my email accounts? I want to secure those as well. 

I just need to find out exactly what has been compromised and to what extent. I've secured all the compromised accounts I could find. But I don't think I got them all.

And I need to know what to do about my phone because there seems to be some sketchy shit that's happened (and is possibly still happening) to it.

155,"I know this is a very odd request for advice, but no matter how I explained it, my friend couldn't understand, and it kind of worries me.

So I (25, F) was talking to my friend (25M) about a relationship between 2 people that I know. The wife had just turned 20 and the man was in his mid 30s. Both were consenting adults, yes. But the man had known the girl since she was a child, and watched her grow up, was friends with the family, etc.

So when I mentioned ""grooming"" my friend hadn't heard of it, so I explained it as simple as possible, and he couldn't understand what inwas saying. He said as long as both were happy, then grooming isn't a problem; If the wife isn't complaining about her marriage, then she's happy. He thinks the husband has a right to choose how he gets his wife as long as he isn't forcing her to marry her. 

Basically he views grooming as a long term ""future wife project"", instead of predatory. It's kind of alarming. I was wondering how I could explain it in a way he would understand?",03Sep2020,1
156,"Long story short, I didn’t give someone space because they weren’t sure if they’d be okay with me contacting them in the future (after a fight over text). No cuss words were said, no negative wishes for anyone’s future, but I did say I wished I never met them (I really regret saying this). Sent a happy birthday a few days later and received a thank you and said you’re welcome. I tried to send something they’d be interested in to be more lighthearted and was ghosted, which made me feel really anxious and so I texted them a few times every couple days for about a week and then was blocked. Then messaged them on fb and ig for a couple weeks or so and then was blocked there too. Emailed them and they informed me that they were in contact with the police. I feel like it was really immature of them to not tell me anything before blocking me, and especially hateful to not tell me to stop before contacting the police. Did they try to press charges on me? And what are the chances they will feel bad and unblock me? I really thought this person was a good person. We have our differences but I want to make amends but haven’t contacted them in two weeks and I know I can’t ever again, and I won’t.

I think I understand her point of view, but I really am not going to just sit around doing a bunch of stuff that isnt boring, but it isn’t necessarily fun, while my friends are off having a great time together. Maybe it’s because shes a single parent, but I highly doubt it since she still has a good relationship with my dad and Im with him half the time.

It feels like she wants me to be like her and do things like her, but I dont want to because shes always stressed and doesnt really have any day to day hobbies. I respect her a lot, but i dont want to be like that. Maybe its just the point of my life where i become more independent, maybe i just dont care enough about stuff, and maybe shes right.

159,"So this summer I’ve been stuck in my hometown working at a boat rental business while I wait for covid to clear up. I’ve been working at this place for the past four summers, and overall I’d say I’m a pretty good worker. 

Aside from work though, my coworkers don’t seem to like me, at all. There’s five of them in total, all around my age.

161,"Hello reddit. 

A few months ago,i was bored and decided to go on youtube and check out 'new scams on steam 2020' because i naturally wanted to find a discord of scammers to mess around with. I found someone who had a discord server. I told this to one of my new friend i made with and he was very very interested so instead of just messing with them,we thought of bringing em down. My friend has done it before by going to court and taking down a scammer's fake website/scam and those kind of things.

To understand the scam they are doing,they are using 'fake paypal payment template' which means they claim they will pay money to you first and then you send your CSGO cosmetic/weapon skin to them but when they send the 'payment',the victim will know they didnt get the funds so the scammer would say 'maybe paypal is down?i alr sent money,give me the items' and sadly it has worked. Another scam they do is owning a fake CSGO trading website where they will have the victim to log in their credentials in the website and then take over the account and will try to steal their items.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently,they have started to do unemployment check fraud and as far as i know,this is definitely illegal as heck. My friend is real hyper is get the authorities soon and will try and do something.

&amp;#x200B;

my question is that is there someone or a proper authority we should consult with or check out the law sections and stuff first? i know discord support is a thing but i do not think discord may do anything apart from deleting their server and banning their accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

162,"Hey everyone, I’m in a really tough situation right now and I would really appreciate if you guys could give this a read and maybe offer some advice. Basically, my relationship with my parents isn’t great. Sometimes my mom is great to be around, and other times she’s a complete fucking menace. She can go from being sweet to nasty so quickly; it’s no fun to deal with. I’m almost positive this is because she’s bipolar. My sister even says she got a bipolar diagnosis, but she refuses to accept it because she is a therapist herself and she thinks she knows better. Because she is most likely bipolar and isn’t getting any type of treatment, she can be an absolute nightmare to deal with. My dad is no help because he’s completely terrified of my mom and backs her up 100% of the time, even when she’s clearly wrong; he’s a good dude but completely spineless. This is where my drug problem comes in. Before quarantine, I was an occasional weed smoker, sometimes to deal with stress and sometimes just to have fun with friends. Since quarantine began and I’ve been spending so much time with my parents, I’ve started smoking an unhealthy amount. Today is the first time I’ve been completely sober since late April. I’ve been smoking multiple times a day every day since quarantine began. This presents a bit of a problem though because I just started school, and I can’t go to school high, partly because I have ADD and need to take adderall to focus properly, and I don’t want to mix weed and adderall. The other reason I don’t want to be high in school is so that I can get good grades and get into a good college next year, and move far away from home.

Today the youngest one, who's a freshman, had a big fight with her friend. From what I could gather, the friend through a drink, my sister yelled pretty loudly, and it escalated to some minor physical violence (they slapped each other, but not hard enough to leave a mark). I ended up having to get off a work call to go pick her up, and she had clearly been crying. When we got home, she cried for about half an hour then started hitting pillows, so we went through some breathing exercises to calm down. After all that, she was still pretty angry and she was shaking pretty bad. I sent her to go try and take a nap because I figured her being tired was probably playing a role in how upset she was. She seemed happier when I woke her up after a few hours, and then I went to grab her for dinner and she was talking  on FaceTime to the other girl. They were laughing about what happened, and apparently they're ""totally chill, and hanging out this weekend"".

172,"So we got a kitten about a week ago. Last night noticed it was breathing rapidly and not eating or drinking. I've never been to a vet before so this was my first time. He ended up having a condition where his intestines are in his lungs and would need surgery. I asked about how much it would be and they told me starting at $300 but would go up depending on what was needed and that he only had a 50/50 chance of surviving and nothing was for sure since he was so small. I said something along the lines of well I'll be taking him home for today and I will call back and they told me I can't do that because he would just be uncomfortable the whole time so I can't. I decided to surrender him so he would not be euthanized and be would get the surgery  and one of the vet techs were going to take him. I feel I was cornered into this and that it was my only option or my kitten would die. I surrendered him, paid $185 for xrays and walk in check up, cried, and went home called some family and they told me they should have given me an option for care credit but they didn't. So my question is would they be able to give me my kitten back since I am qualified with care credit for up to $750 or since I've signed off on his surrender is there nothing I can do? I was crying and everything they  could tell I didnt want to give him up or put him down. This was very upsetting as a first visit to a vet office. Any advice?",03Sep2020,1

Worst pain of my life. 
They had to stop the procedure, and give me antibiotics to help cure any infections in the tooth.

174,"My sister gave birth to her first child. She is anti-social media, and asked my parents (the grandparents) not to announce his birth on Facebook until she and her husband had some time with her new son. Again, they didn’t listen (They also announced when she was first pregnant and she wouldn’t talk to them for two months)
I saw the post and told her. She exploded.  Since then she is very limited on giving my parents any information about her son as she’s still in the hospital. My parents called me up screaming, saying his birth was not my business because I’m just an “aunt” and I mean nothing. They said they are “grandparents” and more related so I need to mind my own business ..I never heard that one before nor did I know this is a competition down to DNA.
They proceeded to call me a slut, that I ruined the best day of their lives because they’re entitled to do as they please, and his birth means more than when they had their own kids. They shamed me for being single and childless and are going around telling relatives what a vile person I am.
My parents are very narcissistic people. They make everything about themselves and are very enmeshed in our lives. Im very close with my sister and I was protecting she and her new baby’s privacy. I told them they should respect her wishes as a new parent as they knew posting it would upset her. My sister said she’s grateful I told her but I’ve never felt so bad about myself. 
My parents threw out my mail, and said they will call my boyfriend up and tell him I’m cheating on him (not true btw) and that I’m trash. They said they want to ruin my life and that I owe them an apology and respect.  
I tried to make amends out of the sake for my nephew because he doesn’t deserve to come home to toxicity. It was a terrible idea and they just bullied me more and said I need to be committed. They have said such hurtful things. I don’t know what to do :’(",03Sep2020,1

178,"If your parents use a spectrum app that goes through the wifi (this technic may also work on other company routers or apps), and they are able to turn ur wifi off from that app through the router, here's a simple step to bypass that you can do anytime (even without wifi). All you have to do is go into settings on android (may work for iphone too.. idk) and click on wifi. Locate the wifi your being blocked from and connect to it. It should say ""no wifi connection"" and that's what we need. Go to the settings for that wifi (the gear button next to the name), and change your MAC from Randomized to Phone Mac. And reconnect to your wifi. This will automatically send the wifi from the router directly to YOUR phone and will ignore any third party, or service apps that my interfere.     I for sure know that it works on android version 10 and up. Later versions I cannot say. For me, I can bypass Spectrum (or netgear) apps that stops specific devices from connecting to the internet connections. (This may or may not work for other apps.

179,"The story was I had a presentation in my History class, and each student was assigned a date to present. The teacher turns out to be sick and cancel 1 class. I made a bad decision which was to assume that my presentation date will be moved back one class since the teacher cancelled a class. Some people's presentation in my class did get moved back 1 days. But then on the date that I originally supposed to do my presentation, the teacher called up my name. Because some people who had to go before me were absent and the teacher was rushing everyone to finish their presentation faster so he can catch up because of his sick day. I tried to explain to him that because he had a sick day, I assume that my presentation is moved back one class so I should do it the class after this. I even showed her my work, the only thing is I hasn't finished the Powerpoint so I couldn't present (she made really harsh requirements about the presentations.). The teacher refused to listen and he automatically gave me a zero for not doing my work. I felt really bad about myself because I really worked really hard for that class and that zero grades turns everything to dust since the presentation worth a lot. I tried to talk to the school office but they refused to help me, saying that it was my fault to assume that my presentation is moved back one class.

180,"Hi guys! I am a homestay student and recently got into a big fight with my homestay. Although it ended in peace, i just wanted to know if it is my fault. What happened was that I talked with the new share mate about moving out together and my homestay thinks i am interfering with her and discussing stuff like moving out with share mate instead of telling her as well. My side of the story is that i was planning to move originally, and my sharemate begged me to stay because they think they can't deal with the homestay alone(the sharemate said because of the strict rules,[e.g](https://e.g.no).dry water on the tap after use). So I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then i found that i really can't wait for longer(I kind of cried when i knew i couldn't move because the homestay said to me i shouldn't with this coronavirus going on, and i think it is true too) so i searched to move out and my sharemate wanted to move out as a result. The problem is...my homestay is not bad. I mean my homestay does care about my family matters, is responsible to drop me off in their friend's home if they are traveling to somewhere else overnight and don't ask me to do much chores/only ask me to do light chores(I help with the trash and putting dishes back from the dishwasher,occasionally hang the clothes). 

&amp;#x200B;

But then, sometimes, their actions made me feel a bit upset,e.g. finding excuses to tell me off because they are in a bad mood(but like, their backstory and like their daily stress with their son and daughter justify it) or double standard(having rules that i can't break but they can break/ They can talk about how sensitive i am to coronavirus to their friends and i can't talk about how strict they are to my share mate) or (rarely)emphasize that they treat me like their own and they should also get treated the same way while it is not(they don't cook much anymore after their son and daughter moved out and they picked up their son and daughter because it looked scary outside but did not do so for me). Sometimes i felt that they genuinely cared but sometimes i felt like i am just someone who rented the room. Honestly, i felt tired to have an emotional connection with the homestay and i have lost trust... But then again, what i did was bitchy too...",03Sep2020,1

I would catch him looking a few times but I think I look at him more than he looks at me. I usually see him looking at me when we are farther apart.

186,"Throwaway cuz my bf has a reddit and well, yeah. I don’t know who else to talk to about this because I don’t think any of my friends will offer great advice and I can’t talk to my bf about this. 

So me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for awhile. We met in college and have been together ever since. There was a period in the beginning where we were on and off but we worked it out. As a whole, it has been a very enjoyable and fulfilling relationship. We communicate well, we are able to work out most issues, we squabble from time to time but what couple doesn’t? We have had some fundamental issues but I don’t want to make this post too long so I won’t go too deep into it. In the end, we are able to compromise for each other most of the time. I am happy and love him to bits and we have talked about marriage. We’ve been living together for the past 3 years so our lives are very intertwined.

However, over the past few months, I have been having growing homosexual urges that are starting to worry me. I identify as bisexual but have never been with a woman before (met my bf before I really started to feel comfortable with myself) and the thought of it is consuming my mind. It’s to the point where I’m having dreams about being with a woman and feeling depressed over not being able to ever have a girlfriend. The urges are not just sexual either, it feels like I’m mourning a relationship I never had. I’ve started having nightmares about being stuck in quicksand or trying to run but not being able to walk which I think are related. All of these feelings are new. I have always felt very fulfilled and pleased by my boyfriend in every way, except now.

My bf knows about my sexuality but not about how I have been feeling recently. I have tried to “hint” at it but he just makes a threesome joke and that’s the end of it. He’s 100% not ok with an open relationship, this I know for fact from previous conversations. 

I don’t know what to do. I am terrified to destroy what could be the greatest relationship of my life and make myself or my bf homeless for something that may not pan out but I also am feeling so trapped and devastated about not being able to know that side of me. I just can’t think of anything to do so I’m just quietly suffering but it’s getting too much to bear.

So my mum had cancer and she was kinda a bad person like did lots a shitty things but was nice and sorta did things she thought was right in her mind and near the end of her life she became real slow and was nice didn’t do anything bad but she was depressed cause of her situation 

And in this time my dad (i dont have a great relationship with him) started texting some lady “luxky” and began having an affair and me and my siblings knew about it but he didn’t know we knew anyway 

My siblings thought it was okay for him cause of all the bad things mum did but I didn’t agree and thought he was a shitty person

and then my mother passed and my dad was upset but lived for the attention of being viewed as a victim 

My dad tells my older brother and sister about this person but not me or my other sister (which my other sister would of been fully informed by my older sister) 

Months pass he is still texting luxky and i see him secretly texting so id asked oh who is that or something like that every now and then 
and he would just say no one then tell my older sister about me being nosey then she tell me off 

And today recently my older sister is telling my dad that it would be a great idea for him to have a conversation with mainly me and my other sister  about bringing this person home 
while my older brother is asking if i could say something saying it was okey than my dad having the conversation

188,"I gotta be honest, I'm pretty confused about what I want in life. Society is just so fucked up. Being a virgin is seen as being bad to the point where I feel ashamed for being one. Having a lot of sex is seen as having high status. I just can't deal with this anymore. I don't know what I want. I thought I liked this girl but the only reason why I liked her is because she's hot and I felt obligated to get with someone like her. Then comes things like The Red Pill which I've researched a bit. Reading stories about those guys who have sex with a lot of girls made me feel bitter yet motivated to become a guy like that. Red Pill preaches being the best version of yourself and having sex with many girls. On the other hand, my friends all tell me that I should find a good girl, and that it doesn't matter that I've never had a girlfriend and am a virgin. Do good girls even exist anymore, because all society seems to do is just sexualize them. A lot of girls also seem to sexualize themselves and take pride in being a hoe. While guys who have a lot of sex are seen as studs. Then there is me on the sidelines, looking at all this, feeling lost, confused, and liek a loser.

At the end of august I moved 4 hours away for college. The day after I moved in he removed me from both his instagram and snapchat.

191,"It’s currently 4 in the morning as I start writing this and I feel like it will be long so apologies in advance for the short essay. This has become a usual time for me to be awake as I just can’t sleep anymore, the constant state of anxiety I’m in makes it impossible. 

To start of, I’m a full time unpaid carer for my disabled mum. I have no life of my own and I’ve never really had a life since graduating from college because as soon as I graduated, that’s when I became a carer but not for my mum at first, for my terminally ill step dad. It was during that stressful time that my mums health got worse and a few years after my step dad passed away, she was diagnosed with a very advanced autoimmune disease that just seems to be getting worse. 

I thought I would be able to handle it but really, I had no choice. I was the only one in my family with no prior responsibilities and really the only who actually seemed to realise how serious her illness was so the task of being her carer just naturally fell to me without any discussions. My siblings didn’t even see me as her carer until recently and kept pressuring me to get a job, assuming I was using her illness as an excuse to be lazy. 

Because of this, I handle everything on my own. No one comes to check up on us to see how we’re doing or if we need anything. No one asks if I need help despite knowing I have severe depression and anxiety. It’s like they’ve just forgotten about my mum and
I, and would rather get on with their easy-going lives. And in a way this all terrifies me. 

I’m just terrified that the eventual day is coming sooner than I expected, the day I lose my mum. Even thinking about it now is triggering my anxiety and making me cry. It doesn’t help that it constantly triggers memories of me witnessing my dad dying in front of me when I was a child when no one else was around. It paralyses me with fear because I don’t want to see anyone else I love die in front of me again. 

Today all of that really hit me when it almost happened. My mum isn’t well at the moment, the nurse suspects it’s tonsillitis but I’m scared she could have that god-damn virus so we should be getting her tested today, so my anxiety is already above 100%. One of the symptoms of her autoimmune disease is difficulty swallowing and right now there’s swelling in her throat. I was in the kitchen when I suddenly heard her cough followed by a lot of wheezing, I ran into the living room to see her keeled over on the floor choking and struggling to breathe and I just broke down. I didn’t know what to do. I froze. I was about to call an ambulance when she suddenly coughed up a large chunk of apple and thankfully she quickly recovered. But jesus. I honesty thought I was going to lose her right there and then. That feeling of terror was all too familiar. 

I haven’t told my brothers about what happened, I don’t know if I should? I just feel like they’re always so busy that they wouldn’t take it seriously. I’ve also never been one to open up to my brothers and I find having any kind of serious conversation with them very difficult, whenever we do talk it’s always just a very short and causal conversation. I just know I really need to talk to someone about this whole situation and it made me feel so alone in all of this. 

One of my other big worries is what do I do when it does happen? I have no savings and no work experience so finding a job isn’t going to be easy. There’s no way I can afford to live alone in my current place. I feel like I’ll end up homeless or dead. I just have no hope for my future after this. 

I feel so lost and defeated and I could really do with any advice anyone can offer or even just a virtual hug?",03Sep2020,1
193,"I (30F) have been in a leadership position with my company for 2.5 years. It was a struggle for me to step in and earn respect of people twice my age but I  put in the work and now I am family there. One of my assistants (23F) has been reluctantly supporting me for about 2 years now, and any chance she gets she tries to upstage me or take full credit for the success of our department. She regularly undermines my authority by telling my other staff to listen to her instead of me. She throws literal tantrums if she doesn't get her way, crying and throwing things and slamming things down. She also brings her personal problems into work with her and causes huge dramatic scenes in the department. We've done lots of emotional intelligence training and mentoring and I even referred her to the EAP once. I have tried everything to help her mature. She is otherwise a good worker and I value the skills she has but these bouts of psychotic behavior drive me up the wall.

I gave her an annual review very recently with a pay increase, which I fought to get approved during  COVID because I thought things were improving with her, and she cried because it wasn't enough of an increase, and then was slamming doors and crying the rest of the afternoon, making everyone uncomfortable. Honestly I should've gotten rid of her ages ago. But she is so silly and flirty to everyone else at the company outside of my department, nobody sees what we see and everyone adores her because she is very young and silly and flirty. 

Earlier this week she asked my boss, who is the President of the company, for my job. My boss told me about the conversation and said he'd leave it up to me how to handle this. We talked in depth about the issues I have been facing with her from day one and how I have given it my best effort but it might be time to throw in the towel. I confided in my boss that I have wanted to leave because she makes my job miserable and the undermining is a constant thing. He knows I love my job and would do anything for the company so the fact that we were even having this conversation was alarming for him. He told me he never ever wants to lose me because I'm the best that has ever been in my position, and gave me a $15k raise, an extra week of vacation, and a Director title to let me know that I am appreciated, which, like... wow. So I definitely don't feel threatened for my job security. 

Today one of my staff told me that my assistant plans to give her resume and cover letter directly to the CEO tomorrow and demand my job. Apparently she was crying today that my boss hasn't put her in my job yet. I have been stressing about how to deal with this. My staff is uncomfortable and wants her gone to rid the department of negativity and get the team feeling back. I know I need to just rip the bandaid and let her go. I'm not even sure what to say.

I’ve always loved cartoons. From Disney channel to Cartoon Network to PBS Kids etc. They are my comfort show. Growing up I dealt with a lot of trauma and cartoons instantly make me feel better. My dad has always had a problem with that. Well today he goes on this long rant about how I’m about to turn 18 in a few minutes and how I need to grow up. How I need to stop acting like a child. That I need to act my age and stop being immature.  Idk if I’m to old for cartoons or what. 

I barely watch tv as it is. I do like other shoes other than cartoons but that’s just what I prefer. I have a stable job, I’m doing well in college, and I kept to myself mainly. I don’t see how I’m acting immaturely. But maybe I’m just seeing my perspective.

202,"I will start this by saying I have a couple learning disabilities, I have severe dyslexia and dyscalculia and I believe I have dysgraphia (not officially diagnosed) which all means I have very poor penmanship and No amount of writing training, medicine, practice or “slowing down” can help.  Today at work the two secretaries and my boss were processing paperwork I had done (that I have to hand write and can not type) with a customer and started making fun of my penmanship laughing with the customer. I had left the office earlier In the day and they did not believe I was in the office. This alone bothered me but what really set it over the edge was when one of the ladies said “a writing test should be a job requirement for this position” implying that I am not qualified to do my job because of my learning disabilities. It is one thing to make fun of me to my face but to do it behind my back is another thing and to do it to a customer and with my boss is a whole other issue.

203,"First of all, I love my career. The hours are flexible, I work from home, and it works for my hermit lifestyle. I’ve worked for the same company for 15 years and have seen a lot of growth in that time period. I also make good money, I have a great reputation within the company, and have fantastic benefits. With the nature of my job comes deadlines at the end of the month. Up until about a year ago, the deadlines were not an issue, as a department we were done by the deadline and they were stress free...

About a year ago, we got a new manager who was not equipped for the job. She was a manager in another department and although she holds the same credentials as everyone else in the department, she has never actually done the job, which is very different. Because of that, she makes decisions with no supporting documentation, and when she is presented with documentation to show what she is saying is incorrect, she blows a gasket. She is very abrasive and when anyone emails her a question she often replies with information that is not relevant to the question because she didn’t actually take the time to read the email. It’s exhausting. She also denies any previous conversation or instruction she has given if it comes to light she has directed the department incorrectly. 

Due to COVID, half of our department was furloughed and when they called everyone back, there were some who chose not to come back. We are now short staffed by 4 people and the company has piled additional work on top of us to boot, and because of her very high productivity standards, our month end deadlines are now a nightmare. They have become increasingly worse and although with the company having picked up exponentially after COVID, she is making no effort to hire help, is stingy with desperately needed overtime and is pushing everyone to their breaking points by requiring us to work weekends, and sometimes 12 hour days. By the way, while we were all working over the weekend, she and the supervisors did not work. They took the time off. 

Today was the deadline and we all ended up working from 5-5, except for her when she showed up at 9. We were all exhausted and glad it’s over. Thursday I am already at my 40 hours for the week. I am so tired of working for a boss who does not hesitate to throw employees under the bus, one who doesn’t appreciate us, and one who isn’t willing to work as hard as she expects everyone else to. She is volatile and over the top in her actions. I have gone to HR about her before and I know I am not the only one. I want to find a new job but I hesitate because my husband and I want to move to a new state in a year which would require a new job anyway. Should I suck it up and hope it gets better to keep the good benefits and seniority or try to get out? I hate the idea of switching jobs again in a year.",03Sep2020,1
204,"Hi y'all,

I hope y'all are well and this is the right place for me to ask this. 

So I recently started an internship at a pretty prestigious/competitive company this fall semester and I'm over the moon. This is my first ever internship after receiving hundreds of rejection letters for the past year and a half. However, because of this, I'm feeling both overwhelmed and experiencing a heavy case of imposter syndrome. This morning it was pretty bad and I kept wondering if they made a mistake in taking me on and sooner or later they'll figure out that I'm actually not qualified and will turn me away. I'm scared of failing and not meeting up to any expectations that's had of me and I'm even more scared to express this to my mentor because what if they realize that I'm really not what they're looking for and change their mind. I haven't really done any assignments yet since it's only my second week, but I want to address this so it doesn't hurt my work performance, productivity, and mental health later on. My mentor seems like a pretty a chill person, but I don't know how to approach this with them. How should I go about wording my email to them that I'm both excited and worried about starting my internship?",03Sep2020,1

206,"Like most teens, I’m horny and think I’m mature for my age, when in reality I am quite stupid at times. A few months ago, when I was 16, I decided to join some 18+ private discord servers for kicks, meaning to just lurk and not communicate to anyone. (Stated that I was 18 on the public registry, but only admin knows specific fake birthdate) Unfortunately I decided to get ballsy and do the opposite, leading me to start drawing 18+ art and joining ERP sessions. When I turned 17 on my birthday I suddenly felt a wave of guilt from what I was doing, knowing that what I was doing could potentially get innocent people in massive legal trouble.

My problem now is that I don’t know what to do from here. I was thinking of leaving, but I have fears over what repercussions running away from this matter could have. I have a small twitter account (300 followers) that I’m trying to grow for my strictly SFW art. I’m not sure if I’m just being overly paranoid, but I’m worried this information could be brought public and I could be “cancelled” and have the account I have worked on to grow be rendered null. (Main concern is if sometime soon, I say something related to my age and someone connects the dots.) I also wish to remain on friendly terms with some of the people in that server as I speak with them on twitter about art. Admitting to being underage on the server results in an immediate and permanent ban. Do I bite the bullet now? Should I wait until I’m 18 to address it? Should I just hope that no one ever brings my age into question? Or maybe I’m just being overly paranoid. I’m really not sure about what to do and advice would greatly help.",03Sep2020,1
208,"Backstory, I'm M17, she's F17, we've been friends for almost 6 years, we met online and live 9 hrs away from each other and haven't met up irl, but we're best friends and can trust each other with our lives without hesitation, we trust each other and love each other, we've been through good and bad together and relied on each other for emotional support, we talk every day, we've had our ups and downs but it's a strong friendship. 

Fast forward to earlier tonight, I asked her if she could help me with something I was struggling with in geometry, I wasn't expecting her to do so because we live in different states and I could be ahead of her, the education system is different from state to state. She said she barely knew anything about it, then I said something like I wasn't surprised or something (I'm not gonna go into details), because to me it seemed like she didn't do much in school that specific year. (Note: this is all happening thorough instagram texts, not a call) That offended her, she told me that what seemed like slacking off to me was her trying to find anything to distract her from her depression and she was struggling to even get up from bed, and that I don't know what's going on her life or what's happening with her therapist and depression, and that she's deleting instagram ""for now"" and ""fuck you for saying that""..  she didn't tell me much about what exactly she was going through specifically, like I knew we both had depression and anxiety, but she never told me anything specific and she never brought up school or school work, or what went on at her therapist, which I understand. I'm not looking for sympathy, I'm an asshole. Period. But right now I just don't know what to do, I've been crying on my couch here like a 6 yr old that lost his mom at the store, she's literally my only friend, and that's not an exaggeration, no one likes me irl nor online, I'm just a depressed and anxious and quiet guy, she's the only one that understands me and is similar to me, she means the world to me, I love her to death.

213,"Basically title. 
This is going to sound kind of ling convoluted  because i am not referring to myself but my parents 

My dad cheated on ny mon for an entire year. My parents relationship is obviously strained but they stayed together. They even celebrated their 30th anniversary thus year. 

Anything my dad does my mom constantly accuses him of cheating. She's always snooping on his phone and his computer and is basically an fbi level detective. I don't blane her fir thus based on what my dad did, but she overreacts to everything. My dad had a cute meme saved on his phone to send to her abd she asked him who's the bitch he's going to send that too. Another time he was messaging a woman on linked in about a job. My mom flipped out because it was a woman. My dad can't ecen wear cologne because my mom thinjs he's only wearing it for other women.

My mom tells me everything because she doesn't have any friends ir gal pals to talk to. I don't  mind because i want to help my mom. But knowing all these details about my parents private life is really taxing on my mental health. 

What my dad did was wrong and idk if i can ever forgive him for it. But  On my dad's side of things. I can tell the constant accusations are making him upset and depressed. My mom and dad got in a fight today snd dad told my mom he constantly thinks about killing himself. (He didn't say it was because of her). My dad tends to keep all of his problems to himself i.e. work, family, money etc. And doesn't talk to my mom/ his wife. 

I can tell they still love each other. Probably too much actually. My mom won't leave my dad for cheating on her. And my dad won't leave my mom for the emotional abuse she keeps putting him through. 

So is this relationship even fixable??? Again they've been together 30 years. 


Has anyone who's been cheated on ever been the same after. Does the thoughts of he/she is cheating ever go away? 

Did anyone ever make it work with the same person? Or is splitting up always the best option in this situation?

216,"So up until a couple weeks ago I thought I lived in a happy family, with my mom(37F), dad(37M), brother 1(21M), me (16F), Brother 2(6M).

What I didn't know for awhile was my mom and dad were having issues, and my dad believed my mom was cheating on him, that and my younger brother looked nothing liked him so he got a 23andme test, during this time of waiting I think his paranoia got to him and he decided to check if I was his daughter to.

What a shit show that was, My little brother is his son, While I'm not his daughter, When my mother was confronted about this she still denied it, My dad contact a PI and sure enough she has been sleeping with someone else, When confronting her again, my mom kept saying by dad wasn't around a lot and wasn't giving her enough attention, which was straight up a lie, because even though my mom was a SAHM my dad worked at home to and very much put the family especially my mom more attention if anything my dad would ignore me and my brother sometimes so my mom got the attention she ""deserved"", and this was when she was home 20% of the time the other 80%? she always said she was always ""running errands"", and sometimes these errands ended up her staying out over night.

My dad has had enough and left with my little brother, telling me he is ""sorry"".

Since then I haven't heard anything from my dad he was always someone I could talk to about anything, and with my mom constantly taking out her anger on me, I've isolated myself. I've tried telling my mom I'm not going to live with her and go live with friends, but she always tells me, That I don't have a choice and I am staying with her, she will literally block me or force ably push me back from the door so I can't leave, I came home from school a couple of days ago and she's installed a lock on the back of my door so she can lock me in.

I contacted my older brother and he tried to come get me but my mom completely ignored him and wouldn't open the door, She then screamed at me for calling him, apparently I need to respect her and keep my mouth shut.

I don't deserve this, It not my fault she wouldn't keep her legs shut and I should not be her punching bag I want to leave but I know she will try anything to keep me around waiting 18 months is not an option.

218,"I’m a licensed tattoo artist, in my state you legally have to go to a school to get your license. School is unfortunately a scam, but legally required, so after I finished schooling, I decided to find an apprenticeship to continue learning (the right way) because school left me empty handed in a lot of ways. 

My town is FULL of tattoo artists &amp; we are running out of room, especially for newbies like myself. So I settled at the shop that I’m at now, and I wish I would’ve trusted my gut and continued looking. 
I could go on about the unprofessionalism my boss puts out, like her publicly saying she will let me tattoo buttholes for free, or how she talks about how incredibly hungover she is in front of many clients. She speaks for me &amp; it’s kind of her way or the highway. Not in a respectable way, but in a closed minded way. Bottom line, my reputation is going to compromised before I can even build one - and the one thing I’m not willing to compromise is my tattoo career. 
I can deal with people who are hard to work with, but to put it nicely - I personally wouldn’t get tattooed by her and I don’t want my work to look like hers... therefor, it’s not worth it to me...
I CAN put up with it, but I won’t. Especially after what I found today: 
I was reading the reviews about the shop, Google, Yelp &amp; Facebook. On a Facebook review, a client was (understandably) complaining about a tattoo my boss had done. Lines didn’t meet, uneven lines, patchy - all correct based off of the photo she showed. 
Long story short, boss never takes accountability in any negative review and eventually said this - 

“Your scars from self mutilation are what caused your tattoo to have such inconsistencies. I can only imagine that someone with a self mutilation disorder should understand that scaring can and will cause tattoos to be inconsistent. However someone as unreasonable as yourself that cuts in her own arm can’t seem to reason! How do I know you didn’t sit down with a razor blade and mess up your tattoo deliberately? Your obviously mentally unstable and seek attention or you wouldn’t mutilate yourself and cut on your own arm. I’m sure it’s completely possible that you went home and took a razor blade to your own tattoo!” 

Um... What the actual fuck? This makes me sick to my fucking stomach, I’m in complete disbelief. This was a year ago, but I do not give a fuck. I don’t want to associate with someone who says this shit, especially publicly. To a fucking client who got a shitty tattoo that had nothing to do with the scarring and everything to do with half assed tattooing. 
The funny thing is, there are some very small scars about 3 inches away from the tattoo. The client says she even chose the placement so the scars were out of the way. 

So, my dilemma with getting out... 
There is one other skilled, experienced artist in the shop that is also getting a bit fed up with the boss’ shenanigans. gonna bring this up tomorrow morning with her. I click really well with her and have learned lots - boss gets protective and won’t let me learn from this other artist. But she interacts with me way more. Anyway, this artist is considering opening up her own shop &amp; bringing me with her. Problem is, this takes time. 
So, I wonder if in the meantime I can find something temporary elsewhere, then continue learning from the other girl. Not sure if she is down for this idea, might piss her off. But I need out... I feel like I’m taking steps backwards. She’s old school &amp; probably won’t want me hopping around with these newer age artists if I’m committed to her. 
Technically, I am licensed and could just go out on my own. But that’s not the right thing to do... 

I don’t know what to tell my boss, need to finish my appointments this week but I’m out of words. I need to be polite and not make it personal, probably just tell her it’s not working out. She’s a well known artist &amp; loves to shit talk,
I’m sure if she knew why I was leaving for sure that she would put a bad name out for me. Same difference if I were to just leave without explanation. 
Anyway, but of a rant.  Thanks if you made it this far!!",03Sep2020,1
219,"Hi, tomorrow I will get the results of my blood test. I went to the Dr about a week ago when I discovered an unexplained, big bruise on my breast. I showed a trusted friend and she suggested that I get it checked by a dr since we both know someone that had a similar looking bruise that turned out to be cancer. So with that said I went to the Dr. last week and I’m scheduled to get my results tomorrow. In the meantime I’m very happy to report that the bruise is practically gone today👍.....so this makes me feel very optimistic about the whole thing since the unexplained bruise was the only thing that spurred me to get tested. I have no other symptoms. In fact, part of me is wondering if I should even bother following up to get the results now that the bruise is gone? But I suppose it makes sense to follow up. Afterall I’m not even sure if the bruise going away means anything anyway? Maybe it would go away if it were cancer too? I’m not sure so I guess I should follow up.

So anyway,  I’m a bit nervous to get the results even with the bruise going away and even having no other symptoms and feeling very healthy I’m still a bit anxious about getting the results tomorrow. I guess it’s just the idea that it’s a cancer test that is scary to me. ...so I’m not sure how to mentally prepare myself for tomorrow? Would it be better for me to go in assuming I have it and than hopefully getting relief to find out I don’t? Or is it better to be positive and assume I don’t have it until told otherwise?

Well, I've been struggling with my sexuality for the past year or so. Being a teenager and all, and growing up in a middle eastern household that's religious, it has not been fun finding out I get turned on by both males and females. My parents are devoted Christians and culturally they have a middle eastern mind-set in terms of same-sex relationships, which is basically a no no. don't talk about it, don't think about it, and especially don't be one of ""those people"".

Watching porn I've been finding myself going back and forth in terms of gay and straight videos and I'm turned on equally by guys and girls. I've found some things that guys do attractive as well as girls. I started university this past year and going to parties, I've kissed guys and girls and I've been having a great time, also I've had a secret girlfriend for a bit but not a boyfriend so far. Kissing a guy or a girl would make my parents upset either way. It just feels very wrong to me, and I'm just hating myself for being this way.

Since then I got a full scholarship to my university, I'm studying to become a doctor, I have a 4.0 GPA, I play music (piano and saxophone as I enjoy jazz music), and I played varsity soccer in high school and now play with a club intermural.

Especially being home due to quarantine and just having these thoughts in my head.

(First and foremost, I believe that everyone deserves to have their feelings expressed and should vent when they aren’t feeling the best. I am not saying that it’s bad to show your emotions or let your problems be known with your close friends.)


It’s just that my friend vents to me every single day. We’ve been friends for years, but starting this year, I feel like he’s been venting to me more and more about his trauma and what he’s going through. I usually try to reassure him, or stay on calls with him for hours while he details his problems and gets my input. And while I’m glad that he feels comfortable enough to let me know these things about him, I just can’t help him the way he thinks that I can. 

I’m not a licensed professional, I’m not a therapist, I only have a few experiences under my belt that I can use to relate and reassure him with. Some of his experiences I just do not know what to say to, and sometimes I’m left just telling him it’ll be okay over and over again. 

I’ve told him to look into online counseling, or downloading a vent app and get input from that community, but he still insists on talking to me about things. I feel bad for saying it, but I am exhausted. I have my own problems that I’m working through, and a job, and I hate having to worry constantly about how he’s doing, or feeling obligated to speak to him out of fear that he might do something to himself. I want to talk like we used to again. 

How do I tell him to get professional help?",03Sep2020,1
228,"I’m a male going into my final (senior) year of high school and I would like to lose my virginity. More and more of my friends are starting to have sex and it’s something that I’m thinking about more frequently. It sounds like something super fun that I really want to try.

Unfortunately I don’t know what the best way is going about this. I’m not ugly, but I’m not handsome, and I’ve definitely gotten better looking this past year (aged, bulked up, and gotten taller). I’m generally an outgoing person and friends with a lot of girls in my grade. I think that’s the problem as in I’m friends with these girls and they overlook me when it comes to “sex” or relationships in general. 

I think my best chances of getting laid are:
- asking one of my close friends (who is also a virgin and wants to lose their virginity) if they wanna have sex
- go to a party and get laid (easier said than done).

Idk any help would be greatly appreciated.",03Sep2020,1

Organization is also ok. But junk drawers get full of random stuff, my pantry is a total disaster, cupboards are full of haphazardly strewn items.

I feel like I have no reason to live. I have failed at every meaningful goal I have ever set for myself and i have nothing to look forward to. To top it all off I’m fucking disgustingly ugly so no girl is ever going to settle for me.

I don’t have any goals or aspirations anymore, I don’t have anything I want to work towards. I’m in debt for a fucking history degree that I may not even get because my financial aid was lowered this year so I may not even be able to pay for this semester. I told myself I was going to lose weight and I lost 80 pounds. I’m still 230 but there’s no point in losing anymore, I’m still embarrassingly ugly. My goal was to get to 200 but I’m stuck and can’t lose anymore, and I don’t have the motivation to keep trying.

There’s no reason for anyone to get involved with me. Nobody has ever really loved me and I’m never going to get to have that experience. The only things I ever wanted out of my life was to not be in poverty, and to have a girlfriend. That’s it. But I can’t even accomplish that.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about these things so I’m just posting it here. I give up. Theres nothing that inspires me and any light from my life is gone.

B is a woman who works close to me.
I Do have allergies from type of perfumes so I only wear the once that don’t give me allergies cause I love perfumes and I choose my perfumes very carefully.
So A was at work today and I barely have any interaction with, told B that he didn’t like my perfume and that he will tell his Boss and HR about it!!
B claims that she has allergies yet she always next to me and never really sneeze or died yet! So she was like oh I am telling you cause he is a guy and I told him not to tell you cause it’s awkward. She told me that I shouldn’t wear perfume.

FYI: A is a smelly guy and if he puts perfume, I actually get allergies from it! 

My perfume wears off when I get to work. 

We also wearing masks since its Pandemic!!!
So I don’t know what to do and I am thinking of going to HR and complains about gossiping and harassing cause I don’t meet this guy and he is fine, he has no allergies cause he put a cologne that gives me allergies. He is not even at work every day. 
Then I saw him talking to B and looking to my direction in front of me!!

I wonder if they would mention that if a CEO put a perfume that annoys them or is just cause I am woman and they think I won’t say anything and its always easy to complain about women in this society.

I need help. What should I do? This is a first! Everyone loves my perfume whether it was at old job or with friends. They always comment on how I smell beautifully!

244," I’m turning to reddit because I honestly have no idea of what I can do anymore and I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I’ve struggled with mental health for about four years of my life now, and three years ago I opened up to my parents about it and it was recommended that I go to a hospital, or at least a therapist. None of that ended up happening, not even the court case that was supposed to happen when my school called the police over a trauma that happened to me (my mom ended up calling the police behind my back and cancelled the case). My mom even made a joke about me offing myself at dinner after finding out I was suicidal. All of this is relevant to get an understanding of how my parents approach my mental health. Anyway, flash forward to now, a couple months ago I wrote my dad a note asking if I could actually begin therapy as my ed relapse was starting to get worse and depression was coming back, bad. He agreed but we had to keep therapy a secret from my mom. (For context, my mom is an immigrant and doesn’t really understand mental illness. My dad doesn’t either but he understands more than her). After about a month or so of therapy my ed got really bad and I lost an amount of weight that I will not specify, but my parents began to notice. After countless nights of being yelled at and sobbing because I was being force fed my parents watched me passed out and had to get me evaluated for an eating disorder. After my evaluation, I was told I needed to be taken to the er. I was checked out and discharged after I stopped getting dizzy. Since then, my parents have had to keep in touch with the hospital and I was told I wasn’t eligible to go into an outpatient program as I am at risk for refeeding syndrome and I can’t eat enough. Since my parents were told this they’re trying to feed me over double the amount of calories a day I normally eat to get out of paying for hospitalization. We aren’t poor either, they just simply don’t want to spend the money. My parents keep me at the table for hours while I sob and they force me to eat. I constantly get headaches and feel extremely sick after every meal. I feel like my body is starting to shut down and I can’t do basic tasks anymore. It can be so hard for me to form basic sentences in conversations anymore, my hair is falling down and I can barely stand up or go up the stairs anymore. The very few relationships I have in my life are getting completely destroyed. I’m tired of my parents trying to fix this themselves and be completely ignorant to how I feel. My dad says he will ground me and force feed me over 3x the amount I eat in a day and I constantly get threatened with being grounded if I don’t eat. My dad will rub my spine and say gross and constantly tell me I look too skinny and now I don’t even want to wear anything other than a hoodie around him. I’m always told it’s so easy to just eat and I constantly feel laughed at and invalidated. I understand everything they do is out of care and concern for me but I can’t take it anymore. I was supposed to get into treatment about two or three weeks ago and now my mom is just talking about cancelling it altogether and I’m pretty sure I’m never going to get it at this point. It’s at the point where I dread waking up and consider dying because I completely dread the next day and what will be said and what will happen at dinner. I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t want to live like this and I feel like this is completely consuming my life. I want to get better, I really do and I hate living like this. I just think my parents trying to fix this themselves is making everything worse. Am I just being dramatic? I’m sorry that this is so long I just don’t know what to do at this point.",03Sep2020,1

251,"Hello! This is my first post and I really need some advice as everyone seems to think that I am oversensitive. It is a bit long but please bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I was friends with one of my colleagues everything went fine I mean from my perspective. I was dating a guy and this person was his friend. We would talk on the phone outside work, and have our breaks together on shift, but nothing else. I was a team leader at the time and it was a bit overwhelming with my depression and anxiety, so I was not really talking to anyone and pulling away from the work friend as well. He was giving out some toxic vibes, 'joking' with other colleagues how he is the best worker and no one else is better than him. Everyone seemed to get the 'joke' but it felt wrong to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to add that this particular person was really good friends with our manager, like loaning money to each other close. One day I was running a shift in our manager's absence and he was the one who used to take all the deliveries, as I said I kept my distance for a while not just from him but from everyone. I informed him about the lorry's 🚚 arrival and if he can take it. He said that I should direct the lorry in which is pretty tricky, especially for me because I just recently started driving in the UK, I was not trained to do it either so I did not go outside. (note he knew about this) anyway, he got upset that I did not open the shutter and made him take the delivery so unfortunately with a sass I told him that I cannot do everything by myself and other employees needed my help to get the deliveries. we got into a screaming match me kept on saying to not be disrespectful and that he should back off because he got closer and closer to my face. My brother and one more employee witnessed the situation and obviously the stood up for me. We ended up having a conversation for the time the same day and once more with our manager when he returned from his holiday.

&amp;#x200B;

The manager ended up taking his side that it was a misunderstanding and I could not take it anymore I burst into tears and poured my heart out, which did not make my situation any better. He said that as a team leader I should not be so emotional about every little thing and that you cannot get anywhere in the retail world like this. In my interpretation: 'man up little girl'. when we had our meeting the three of us he called me uneducated and all other synonyms of stupid, and he stormed out. I know I cried a lot, but I have been holding all my emotions in for a while and this day it just came out. The manager ended up calling the guy back to the office, but before they stepped in I heard them talking outside. 'you need to apologise she wants to step down.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you have not down anything but she is a woman and they are way more emotional than men.' following 'I am not gonna apologise I do not care who and what is she' I pretended that I did not hear them, and sat there motionless feeling like the ground is going to open under me and swallow me whole. He said ' I am sorry that I am such a huge part of your life that you feel the need to step down from your position'. The manager told him that he can leave and turned to me ' I know it was not the perfect apology but better than nothing right?' I said ' I guess...' and informed him that I still want to step down from my position because in my mental state it was just too much abuse and bullying at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then this guy turned most of the employees and friends away from me to the point that I have a nervous hour before every one of my shift. (finding another job is been a nightmare in the COVID situation). Every person laughs and watches me how I work I keep on overhearing them laughing at me and gossiping about me. My new manager was turned against me by this guy, saying that I am the abusive one and the bully. I do not know what did I do to deserve all this. Now my manager is pushing me harder and harder and saying that my performance is not good enough for the money I am getting, and I should do more, like the (ex)friend of mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

All this bullying makes me think about suicide, and I am dead on crying all the time. My brother experiences the same treatment after standing up for me. I don't know what to do.

i don’t know where this doubt came from. i was so sure i wanted to move to a new state and even have little goals to hit in order to be “prepared” to leave. 

i was going to move 3 months from now but because i worked 12-15 hours days in order to quickly hit my goals, i’ve come to the point where i can actually move by the end of this month. i wasn’t planning on moving till november to make sure i had enough funds but i also didn’t expect to work this much so it’s all really good timing with my finances. 

i never told anyone about this because 1) i really have no friends &amp; 2) i didn’t want anyone’s opinion to influence my decision on moving. 

well these last few weeks have been extremely brutal and lonely. it’s been hard ngl. had 2 mental break downs and took a little bit to recover from those. i really pushed myself to the edge by working these long hours, going to school full time &amp; working out. 

now that i can see the light at the end of the tunnel, i almost feel disconnected from my home, family and town. it’s like i know i’m leaving and whatever i do here is meaningless and i could give a shit less type of vibe. but with all this, i’m really scared. like keeping me up at night scared. i love how much i have saved but still feel like no matter what i do or how much i save, i’m still going to fail and end up moving back home. i don’t want that to happen i don’t want to fail. 

so reddit, i’m desperately looking for advice. for context, please put yourself in this situation. i’ll be as honest as i can be so hopefully something comes out of this post. 

you’re 28, feel like you have nothing going for you in your home town. you have nothing holding you back but family. have decent experience as an admin assistant so you’re leaving with the thought that it might take 2 months to get a job in the new state. you have suffered with depression for years but manage. you think this is also going to help with that and make some very important necessary changes in your life. i’m scared shitless of missing out on my family and also failing. i can’t imagine me doing all this just to end up right back in my room at my moms. no housing situation but it shouldn’t be that hard to find a roommate (saving first &amp; last to be ready) 

reddit, what would you do? i’m just really nervous/anxious and honestly scared. i’ll be the first in my family to move out of state. again no one knows that i’m doing this

I used to just scream and get away from it then be ok, but now, I scream, hyperventilat, cry,  and won't go where I seen it for two weeks at most. Now onto the story. My sister has a pet lizard who eats superworms. There for we keep them in a big plastic container, and sometimes they escape. Like what happened an hour ago. I was normally getting ready for bed brushing my teeth with FB etc, etc. I turn around and see something moving from the corner of my eye. You guessed it!

That was the latest incident.
Another time was when BS cornered me in a bedroom with a hell worm in tweezers, and was chasing me when she dropped it in a box of my stuff. so I ended up Giving BS the box and everything in it. That time I almost fainted from hyperventilating so bad, also my first breakdown.

258,"About 2 years ago I got my friend a job at a job where I had been working for about a year and a half, I had already created a sort of work facade there which I was complacent with the idea my coworkers had of me (they knew extremely little about my personal life or lifestyle outside of work) before my friend even started the job I laid down boundaries “try not to talk about my personal life to the best of your ability and please for the live of god don’t tell them I smoke weed.” So right off the bat my friend started divulging a lot about my personal life, nothing too crazy but more than I’d choose to share but we have different personalities, she’s very outgoing and chatty whereas I’m more reserved. Anywho a couple months later she ended up breaking my cardinal rule and told I coworker I “used to smoke weed” because that lie (I was currently smoking and weed isn’t legal in our state so I like to keep it low key) was somehow a better lie than just straight up saying I don’t smoke.
I naturally got very annoyed at this and she claimed not to recall me ever setting that boundary (I did, so many times I reiterated it) and that was our first and most serious argument. Flash forward 2 years and against my better judgement I got her a job at my second job because she needed money. The first shift we worked together I told her I had a crush on a regular and she proceeded to flirt with that regular on purpose, we’ve since talked it out and she knows that bothered me but more recently we worked a shift together where she micromanaged everything I did which REALLY annoyed me given I’ve work there for YEARS and she’s been there a few months. How do I go about communicating my need for respect and boundaries?",03Sep2020,1
260,I’m 17 from Canada. Has anyone ever had to deal with this situation? I can’t let this go on any longer. I am scared.

263,"I’m 18(f) and my boyfriend is 22(m) and we’ve been dating for almost 8 months. He’s my first real boyfriend so I have no idea if this is how it is in most relationships. 

So for a bit of context of bfs an avid gamer who some would deem as very lazy. I would see it as his anxiety disorder keeping him from actually doing things worth his while. Because he’s really smart and has tons of potential, but he’d rather play video games than do his  work. He also has ADHD, which makes it difficult for him to focus on one thing at a time. I myself also have anxiety/ depression and a form of trauma based anxiety with ADHD (also possible autism but I haven’t been diagnosed). So I get where he’s coming from. He also has a really good relationship with his mom, like weirdly good even though she annoys the hell out of him. I, on the other hand, do not have any relationship with my mom as I moved away from her at 16. 

Anyways, so my anxiety started when he had a back issue and wanted me to massage him. I didn’t know how to do it properly and he got annoyed and went to his mom. Every time he has a minor issue i might be able to solve, he calls his mom for it. We forgot an ingredient at the store, great I’ll go get it for him. Nope, he’s already called his mom and she’s left work to go get it. You kinda get the gist. It’s annoying at times. His mom is super nice. I absolutely adore his mom. But this week has kind of upset me, like a lot. I know it shouldn’t, but it does. He got in a mega depressed mood one day, where all he wanted to do was sleep. He didn’t wanna play video games, he didn’t want to cook (he likes cooking), he didn’t even want to go on his phone and look at memes. I didn’t even know what was happening, I thought he had another night of staying up til 6am playing games and then woke up at 11 when I came over. His mom immediately saw what was going on instantly when she got home, and tried to calm him down. I couldn’t do anything but hug him. I decided, you know what? I’m gonna do something nice for him since he’s not feeling well and so I bought him a weighted blanket and a new gaming chair. The blanket arrives, he likes it. He uses it (I think I’m not there when he sleeps). Then the chair comes. God damn, this chair was the bane of my existence. While he was doing homework, I put the chair together. And listen, I have put many a gaming chair together in the past. I had just bought my own chair a few weeks prior and I put it together like a pro. But this chair, this chair sucked. It looked really comfortable, and it was, but it was soooo hard to put together on my own. Nothing wanted to fit right. Maybe it’s just because it’s a very plump chair, like this thing had hella cushioning. he tried to help a little and after like three hours I finally got it put together. He tried it out, said it was really comfortable, and then tried to raise it. This is where I got upset. It didn’t reach to the height he likes. So I said no problem, we’ll just take the base of your old chair and put the new body on that. Except the wheels on the old chair were awful. So he wanted me to return it. No problem, I guess. I’m upset he didn’t love it like I thought he would. I mean, I’m not trying to complain here but I have absolutely zero income at the moment and I bought this chair because he wasn’t feeling well. Cool that’s fine, I’ll return it. Except return fee is like $10 and we can’t get a part off. Well shit. You know, I’ll just give him my new chair or have him pick out another one and it’ll be fine. Except he doesn’t want that. So I’m even more upset, because my attempt at making him feel better backfired and I now have a black eye because his dog smacked me in the face while trying to eat plastic. So he said we’d pick out a new one the next day and I was happy because I want to do something for him for once because every time I’ve tried, he’s just gone to his mom and she’s saved the day. And guess what, he’s done it again. I was sitting at home and looking at new chairs (and my bank account, yikes) when he texts me and says his mom just got him a new chair. Oh. I guess he did that because I don’t have that kind of money right now and my car needs to be fixed but still. I don’t know why I’m so upset. I just wanted to help him but I couldn’t even buy him a decent chair. I failed miserably and even though he says it’s fine, it’s not. Because is he going to keep going to his mom for help when I can’t provide? I just want to do one thing properly for him, and I’m a bad girlfriend. I don’t know how to fix that. Please help :/",03Sep2020,1

266,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently 26 years old working full-time for the government. I love how government is stable, good benefit and adequate salary. But most importantly, I am not enjoying my administrative job and recently got interested in going back to school for two year computer science program. People give me advice that I can learn by myself with enormous amount of free resources, but I’m getting a hard time pushing myself and believing that I will eventually get an IT job with my own effort. I truly feel the value of getting a diploma since the school provides great hands-on skills. In order to go to school, I need to quit my job since the program is extremely intensive (100 hours a week study).
While I’m considering to attend school in January 2021, my girlfriend also wants to get married. She has a full time job and earns approximately $60k before tax. She considers that if I get a student loan, bursary and grant, we’ll be able to live off by starting off with renting an apartment. I’m currently based in Vancouver, Canada. I want to know how realistic this is?

Thank you",03Sep2020,1
267,"I'm (M20) starting to see myself catch stronger feelings for a girl (F18) I tried to set boundaries with and I'm not sure what, if any, action to take about it. We had a casual relationship last summer before I went back to school out of state, had no issue being away. We kept hanging out on breaks, kept snapping every now and then, and picked up where we left off after COVID sent me back home for the summer. Now she's the one going off to school and I elected to take a gap semester for mental health and career development reasons, and even though I stressed to her that I didn't believe in any kind of long distance relationship and I didn't want to be making myself a part of her college experience, I haven't been able to stop face-timing her every other night or so and even drove up to visit in the second week.

I'm (M20) starting to see myself catch stronger feelings for a girl (F18) I tried to set boundaries with and I'm not sure what, if any, action to take about it. We had a casual relationship last summer before I went back to school out of state, had no issue being away. We kept hanging out on breaks, kept snapping every now and then, and picked up where we left off after COVID sent me back home for the summer. Now she's the one going off to school and I elected to take a gap semester for mental health and career development reasons, and even though I stressed to her that I didn't believe in any kind of long distance relationship and I didn't want to be making myself a part of her college experience, I haven't been able to stop facetiming her every other night or so and even drove up to visit in the second week.

We are both pretty aware and accepting that fate's probably going to take us on different life paths, but she is into me enough that she'll allow me to get as close as I want to so the onus is really on me to make any kind of difficult choice. I wish I could sit here and say I was just catching feelings, and that maybe this is just a sign that the love is meant to be, and I really outta give long distance a shot, but if I'm being honest, this is coming at a time when I'm mentally unstable and trying to sort through a lot of bigger issues. I am also stuck at home with only my parents the vast majority of days, with no real friends to text from school and only the occasional hangout buddy here in town. Its lonely, and I'm feeling really bad a lot of the time, and nothing feels better than calling her up to talk about it all. She's been super supportive since I opened up about mental health issues, and especially lately I've felt especially close to here--for instance when I came up to see here I was practically broken down crying half the time and she just, got me through it. When I call her I never want to sleep because I finally feel seen and heard, even if I have nothing to say. Of course, it feels bad getting emotional and turning up a wreck on the phone, but I still feel productive and loved while talking with her.

This all feels incredibly selfish of me. I wasn't irrational ending things for near future with her, I do believe its better for her to focus on friends and pursuits up there rather than entertaining me (she insists though that because of COVID there's nothing for her to do and nowhere to make new friends anyway). Even if I enjoy being with her, it feels like I'm just using her to cope with everything else going on. At times I practically treat her as my therapist, and while emotional support is certainly good in a relationship, that type of treatment was never really a part of our operations before she left. She says she doesn't mind, but I definitely feel like I'm just feeding an addiction that might get out of control soon. I really like this girl, but part of giving her space this semester was to make the eventual ending easier on us, and I don't want to string her along if that's still the idea. I also feel like while I can probably stop now, I can see a path where I get over emotionally dependent on this person to the point where my days would base their value in her, where this behavior just spirals out of control.

I guess my question is, how real and great do you think that threat is? Is it likely that if I keep calling her every couple days eventually I'll get way too attached? And if so, from what you guys can judge in context would the consequence of that be large enough that I should just force some space between us now? I don't want to hurt her, but I also know if I stop calling now she'd get pretty worried. And I don't instinctively want to cut her off, but I also feel like we know that trying long distance for the next three years isn't likely to pan out anyway. All these conflicting motives at least make answering those questions tough for me personally. What do y'all think would be the best way to handle this? Thanks for any help!

Tl;dr: Combo of my bad mental health + loneliness during gap semester at home have cause me to depend a lot more on spending phone time with a girl away at college who I likely don't have a future with. I feel like I'm using her as a crutch and leading her on that we might manage to keep up a long distance relationship through four years of school, even though we're both on board with the present arrangement. Think that breaking things off soon would be better for her and might stop me from getting too emotionally dependent before its too later, but unsure about pulling the trigger.",03Sep2020,1

Last year I always texted the group chat asking to hang, bc I felt like people were much more receptive.

- I have absolutely nothing against LGBT+ people. The Bible says to love your neighbor as yourself, and that the disciples left alone any who didn’t wish to hear the gospel (which I take as respecting others beliefs and not forcing my own onto them or any variation of that.)

278,"I met her bartending. She was a stripper and we became friends. To get herself out of that she started doing permanent eyelashes, the individuals. I told her it was good business and she actually started on it. 

Now, what I had suggested was to do the online cosmetic license, get certified and rent a small salon. That way she’s not only informed but protected by her certification. What she did was pay a girl to show her how and started doing eyelashes. Not the most professional, but I trusted that she had paid someone certified to teach. 

I have been getting my eyelashes done for two years now, I paid her what I pay my usual certified lash tech. My lashes lasted one day, they usually go on to 3-4 weeks before the needed fill. Also, my friend lives an hour and a half away, so i took off from work to get her service. I told her my lashes were falling out and she blamed me. Said maybe I cry too much (low blow to my depression) and that maybe that day I cried.  

I convinced her to redo my eyelashes and she said it was most likely the glue. So she would order a new one. I was suppose to do them today, but she hasn’t responded my calls for the last couple of days. I can return my own payment through my bank but I would love to sort this out the correct way.

280,"Some background information: My parents died when I was around seven and he was a little more than a baby. We lived with our Uncle and Aunt who are wonderful people and really took care of us. I remember my parents but my brother doesn't (obviously) and his first word was apparently my name. I don't remember. I have always felt protective towards him, and that was even before Mom and Dad passed away. 

He was (is) prone to nightmares so we share a bed always have and well... cuddle around because it's sort of a child hood habit now. We have weird Nick names for each other that no one else is allowed to use. We tell each other everything. I have seriously no secrets that my brother doesn't know. My uncle jokingly used to say that we had no concept of personal space and even my gf in high school commented that we always sat too close. I guess we also hug each other more than the normal amount. I don't feel strange at all. I have always taken care of him. It's my job and I think he feels the same. He has my back and he looks up to me. Always. I feel relieved that he comes to me whenever he screws up and stuff.

So we are really close and it has never been a problem but my present gf thinks it's unnatural. She said that when I was setting out his clothes for him. (Another habit) while he was in the shower. She also sort of glared at me when he hugged me and kissed my cheek before heading out. When I am in college I always go back home on weekends to spend all of it with him. He wants to go to the college I plan on doing my masters from when he graduates and I have proposed that if possible we share the apartment there. Idk how that'll work out but he was excited. 

I have been having other problems with my gf but I was willing to ignore them. I don't think I will start behaving differently with my brother to please her though. There is nothing dirty about my relationship with him. My brother is very sweet and shy, and everyone sort of falls in love with him. He is really cute and looks young for his age.

290,"So a few months ago, I was horny and desperate, so while scrolling through Reddit one day I saw a link to a BDSM Discord. I decided to join, and initially was very intrigued, and had a lot of fun.

Then I met someone. He joined the server, started relentlessly talking to me, trying to get me to roleplay, share pictures, and I stopped using the server because of his vibes.

Now, due to my own doing, I had my NSFW twitter linked in my Discord, which I removed.

Somehow, this guy found all 5 of my Twitter accounts, even though none of the accounts have any common links.

I don't know what to do, I'm scared.

I feel so violated and intruded on with him having found my private accounts.",03Sep2020,1
292,"So I just graduated college with a film degree and the pressure is on to find a job.  The problem is I'm a choosing beggar.  I don't want to work just anywhere, I want to work somewhere I'm going to like.  I have worked at a fast food restaurant on my campus for the past 3 years and besides my film knowledge, I don't have marketable skills, I can't even type fast and I'm a writer lol.  
My resume only has film related things on it besides my fast food job and I don't think its good enough to send out.  Are there any fields out that are remote and willing to train me that isn't Subway (never going back)?
Being back home is stressful and my mom doesn't understand that the job market is crap and she keeps recommending job that I literally don't have any of the qualifications they are looking for but her famous words are ""They can only say yay or nay.""",03Sep2020,1
294,"my mom (white, 50) constantly makes racist jokes and does racist things in public and in private and i (white, 20) don’t know how to make her stop. She doesn’t see anything wrong with what she’s doing and when i tell her it’s not funny or okay she turns the situation around and tried to shame me for making her feel bad about what she has said.

Some of the more recent ‘jokes’ or things she has said include seeing a bunch of white cars on one side of the road and a ton of black cars on the other and exclaiming “looks like they’re segregated! segregations back!”. i think that was racist or a least very inconsiderate??? idk either way i wasn’t okay with her saying that and it was after helping me move into my new neighborhood where most of my neighbors are POC, and they easily could’ve heard her/been offended if they had. i told her that it wasnt alright to say that and she was like “what! i’m just making a joke, and thats what it looked like!”

another example is we went shopping and an asian family walked past and one guy in the family was laughing, my mom looked at them and started laughing, i asked why she was laughing and she ws just like “he was just so *proceeds to squint eyes and make laughing face* “. i immediately was like wtf? bc she was making fun of his eyes. and she immediately got butthurt and was like “ u know i didn’t mean it like that, he was just so happy”. and i ws like now ur backtracking bc i said it wasnt okay?

those are just a few examples, but every time she does something/says something racist i tell her it’s not okay and then she gets upset with me for getting upset with her/calling her out. is there a way to handle this better?",03Sep2020,1
295,"So its been , not even 24 hours since I saw my boyfriend last. He said he missed me today, I told him I miss you too. Later  I asked myself do I really miss him though , or was I just saying it to please him? Also is it okay to not miss someone after seeing them for 24 hrs? I just saw him yesterday? I asked him this same question and he said he guesses it’s okay to not miss someone after 24 hours, and that it’s our decision whether we miss someone or not. I hope that this question to him didn’t make him feel like I never liked being around him. It was just my inner thoughts. I want to hear your opinion though . Do you think though that it is okay to not miss someone , after not seeing them for 24 hours? Or is it okay to choose when to miss someone for ourselves? Or do you think me telling asking my own boyfriend this question was a good thing to do??",03Sep2020,1

So basically my dad has just gotten home from work and I came out to the kitchen to get some ice cream. As I walked out of the kitchen and back into my room, my dad looks at my bowl of ice cream and sighs and says, “another one”, and i walk to my room and want to cry. I have always been really conscious of my weight and i have always been really unhappy with the person i see in the mirror. I think this has to do with the fact that during my whole entire lifetime, my dad has always told me that i’m big, or need to go on a diet and he’s obese. Is this someway of living his life though me? I don’t know what to do and i’m to scared to confront him about it.",03Sep2020,1

tl;dr at the bottom, also reposting because the auto flair bot 😫

i don’t know where this doubt came from. i was so sure i wanted to move to a new state and even have little goals to hit in order to be “prepared” to leave. 

i was going to move 3 months from now but because i worked 12-15 hours days in order to quickly hit my goals, i’ve come to the point where i can actually move by the end of this month. i wasn’t planning on moving till november to make sure i had enough funds but i also didn’t expect to work this much so it’s all really good timing with my finances. 

i never told anyone about this because 1) i really have no friends &amp;amp;amp; 2) i didn’t want anyone’s opinion to influence my decision on moving. 

well these last few weeks have been extremely brutal and lonely. it’s been hard ngl. had 2 mental break downs and took a little bit to recover from those. i really pushed myself to the edge by working these long hours, going to school full time &amp;amp;amp; working out. 

now that i can see the light at the end of the tunnel, i almost feel disconnected from my home, family and town. it’s like i know i’m leaving and whatever i do here is meaningless and i could give a shit less type of vibe. but with all this, i’m really scared. like keeping me up at night scared. i love how much i have saved but still feel like no matter what i do or how much i save, i’m still going to fail and end up moving back home. i don’t want that to happen i don’t want to fail. 

so reddit, i’m desperately looking for advice. for context, please put yourself in this situation. i’ll be as honest as i can be so hopefully something comes out of this post. 

*you’re 28, feel like you have nothing going for you in your home town. you have nothing holding you back but family. have decent experience as an admin assistant so you’re leaving with the thought that it might take 2 months to get a job in the new state. you have suffered with depression for years but manage. you think this is also going to help with that and make some very important necessary changes in your life. i’m scared shitless of missing out on my family and also failing. i can’t imagine me doing all this just to end up right back in my room at my moms. no housing situation but it shouldn’t be that hard to find a roommate (saving first &amp;amp;amp; last to be ready)*

reddit, what would you do? i’m just really nervous/anxious and honestly scared. i’ll be the first in my family to move out of state. again no one knows that i’m doing this


tl;dr: scared that my moving day is getting closer to leave california and start new at a different state. no friends or family to talk to and taking a big risk at a new state alone. wwyd??",03Sep2020,1

I don’t want to end up a drug addict because I know people who feel this way usually turn to drugs.

300,"My dad has no friends, no job, and he’s increasingly being more and more angry and proud to admit any mistakes. I’m worried for him when my sister and I leave the house to live our own lives that he might become and lost and pick up bad habits or activities, especially with growing tension between him and my mom who said that she doesn’t want to live with him when we’re gone and done with college.

He’s asked me if he could live with him but I don’t know how to respond to him. I love my dad but I don’t know if I could live with him being physically with me for the rest of my life. 

Maybe it’s just Asian culture for how he and my mom act towards each other but my sister and I can only help and work with our mom on mental and emotional stuff since she’s the only one that’s willing to listen and think sometimes. We just don’t know what to do. He won’t listen to us about anything serious or personal as he sees at as “stuff in your head” or believes it isn’t real.

301,"I recently met a girl who is exactly my type, all in all, and I fell hard for her. We talked a lot prior to meeting for the first time and I found that we share a lot of the same interests, have similar senses of humor, and are just generally very compatible. Admittedly, I got pretty excited when I learned she was interested and might have laid on the flirtation and stuff pretty hard, but we went along with.

After talking for a few weeks, we decide to hang out. It goes great, we have fun, and decide that we'd like to try going on a date and possibly starting a relationship. Again, pretty excited, might have talked about this too much.

Cut to the next time we hang out casually (planned date hasn't happened yet), and we have fun listening to music and whatnot. A few hours in, however, things get serious and she says ""how would you feel if I said I wasn't ready for a relationship?"" My heart sinks, say I'd be bummed, and am not sure how to go forward. I mean, we met on a dating app, so I went into this thinking that was the whole point. I'm pretty bummed out, seeing as I was so infatuated with her, but she says her mental health just isn't in the right spot. She reinforces that she really likes me, but she's just not there. After some talking, we decide that it's a bummer but that for both of us, but it's probably best to go our separate ways. Damm, that stings. 

Two days later, I wake up to a text from her asking if we could still be friends because I'm ""to cool not to try to."" I tell her that it would be hard for me to close the door on the idea of a relationship after being so infatuated with her, and echo what my friend said: ""If her mental health isn't crippling and going into a relationship wouldn't make it worse, why not try if she's interested?"" She says good point, but that we should start off as friends and work to it so she can figure herself out. She reinforces that maybe something sparks, maybe we stay friends.

So here I am: I don't wanna get dragged along for her ride of figuring out what's good, because it'll just sting more later, but on the other hand, she is the person I have been the most compatible with in years. Right now, to evade the turmoil I'm in currently and to avoid hurt in the future, I'm thinking of saying ""It's fine if we take things slow, but I'd like the reassurance that you want this and I'm not a dog chasing cars. If you can't commit to that or give me some assurance, I think I'll have to close the door on this to end my turmoil and avoid hurt in the future.""

302,"So I(16M) got in some bad breakup(15F) like 6 months ago. Last time I even heard from her was when her account came up in my feed, I viewed the account story (after we broke up) and she got far too pissed. And then my friend viewed her story one day randomly, saw she was talking about killing people, told me, and then she saw he viewed the story - went ballistic. We blocked each other and I've been doing fine since.

I went onto Twitter which I hadn't been there in a long time. I saw she was still in my searches. You can call this stalkish but I decided to check her account to see basically how she was doing for whatever reason. When I searched it I found a new account by her with the same name. I scrolled down and my stomach dropped.

She was sexually fantasizing about Eric and Dylan (from the Columbine shooting). She sexually fantasized about them in several comments and Tweets. I saw posts like ""Homicidal fantasies again"" and Tweets of her talking about how she cut herself really deep. I was sickened by the amount of school shooting references on her page like ""School shootings are the only good part of America"", ""I am a Columbiner"", and the worst one, ""yo what if I shoot up my school"". Her friends were agreeing in the comments and all this made me sick. I wanna just pretend it's a joke but a joke would be one or two Tweets, not actual graphic hentai and descriptions of being horny for Dylan, Eric, and other school shootings. One saying ""What if I told people irl that I stan killers""

I know for a fact she hates me to the core. She unfairly calls me racist and once sent one of her friends to harass me. Luckily we have online school for the first trimester - and even so I don't have many classes in that school. But I feel like she's actually going to shoot up the school one day. I feel like target number 1 as well. I don't know what to do. If I speak out or say something to someone, it could trace back to me and I'll look like some sort of stalker (I mean tbf that wouldn't be far off). But I don't want it all tracing back to me.

305,"My best friend is pregnant. We have been friends for 25 years and I was thrilled when I found out she was pregnant. 

Another one of our best friends and I immediately jumped into baby shower planning. We spoke to her mum and sister and had Covid plans, Zoom plans, a plan for every scenario. 

Three weeks ago our pregnant friend told use she didn’t want to have a shower over Zoom as it would be overwhelming, and would much rather a “Sip and See” once the baby is born and we can have gatherings. We are currently severely restricted due to Covid precautions. 

We started to plan a drive by shower of our immediate group, getting her fiancé involved to ensure suitability etc. 

All of the sudden she is planning a Zoom shower with another girl with 30+ people. My friends mother and sister are not invited. 

I’m upset that I’ve been ditched in the planning, but also that they are going against our friends wishes. This other girl has also overstated information about our friends birth plan etc to a group on a Facebook event.

306,"So, I went on a double date last night with a friend. He hooked me up with this gal he used to go to school with, and long story short, the night ended in legendary fashion with a separate-bed, date-respective hotel room romp.

Now, I know I did pretty well (in fact, the best I have ever done), but she was experiencing serious pain this morning. We had continuous sex for about 5-6 hours and got no sleep prior to checking out of the hotel. I understand that pain is normal in some circumstances, but she could barely walk, and it took a long time for her to get out of bed. She was very happy with the night, and said multiple times it was nothing to worry about due to me making it very obvious that I felt really bad. I'm just wondering if THIS much pain is really that normal because it wasn't her first time. Every time she came, I stopped and gave her a minute, waiting until she said it was okay to continue. I wasn't anymore rough than usual, and we didn't engage in any wild positions. When she started to get worn out in the last hour, I quit in order to not hurt her anymore.

Should I slow down when we do it next time? Be more gentle? I am genuinely concerned that I did something wrong and want to correct what I can for next time. Thanks in advance!",03Sep2020,1

In this group I was known as the comedian and I liked making them happy I'd joke about all types of stuff including sex related jokes. At the same time I would make these jokes I would make clear that I wasn't looking for any type of sexual relationship or anything of the sort the girl in hand was very flirty and kind of entitled but we had thought nothing of it I at the time had a girlfriend that I really had a good connection with but as time went on I noticed that the girl let's call her Jess was getting more flirty with me in general and a little more hands on now keep in mind I'm not the quickest person when.

309,"Currently I'm working two jobs (At a gas station across from where I live, and at a fast food restaurant downtown), though the job in question is the fast food joint. I have been working there since 2014, and currently have been working for six years and three months with them. (I even have worked with a different branch of the same franchise for the past four years while I was at college) and I love my coworkers, I get along with my managers, and my bosses like me enough that they've even offered me a manager position (I had to decline as it was the store I worked at during my time at college, and thus i was only in that town for part of the year).

Now, that isn't to say I love the place. It's stressful, and it does not pay enough to put up with the verbal abuse a large chunk of our customers provide. Since this year started, I haven't even been getting anywhere close to full-time hours (I'm barely making in 20 hours a week now). I recently asked my managers if it would be possible for me to get a raise (My last pay raise  was back in 2018) and was given a 25 cent raise just yesterday (I'm getting 11.25 an hour now, at this point I have no idea if that's good for how long I've worked there, or bad). Management also decided to give me more time on my shifts; a whole whopping 15 minutes, so now I'm clocking in four and a half hours a day at this place- and that's if they don't send me early. 

My plan back when I graduated last fall was that I would have a better paying job so I could be moved out of my parents place and into my own apartment come summer. And, well, summer is almost over and with the hours and pay I'm getting right now; I am not making enough to cover student loan payments, insurance, *and* rent. So, I'm still living with my parents, not the worse, but certainly not where I wanted to be at this point in time.

However, about an hour ago when I got home from my second job, my dad pulled me aside and told me of this job opportunity he found out. My dad works for B.I.T with the state, has been since I was like a baby, and he knows I've been applying since I graduated to all the state jobs I qualified for that popped up. The job is temp work, but it's a full 40 hour weeks for ten-something an hour, and he said they expect the job to be for about a year. We don't know what the job will entail since it's basically me helping the main crew, but it's essentially a desk job. 

The pay is less, but the overall payout each week is more, since it's temp work, I won't be getting any of the benefits of a government employee, but it's a really good way to get my foot in the door, build connections, etc. 

The problem is; idk if it's just my anxiety or what, but I'm terrified I'm going to be burning bridges with my current job's coworkers if I do that. I just got a raise after asking, I just got a shift that starts a little earlier after asking. Logically speaking; the temp job is a far better job to have anyway you look at it, . 

But, is it a dick move to apply for it?

We don't really have a lot of *good* employees over there, and we've even less who are out of high school and able to work my early-day shifts. Hell, these last two weeks we've had 1 manager move to a different state, one coworker is sitting in jail, and another got fired yesterday. We don't have a lot of staff right now, and if I leave and things go sour; I'm going to get dragged for it since my sister is the assistant manager, and I do not want to deal with the passive aggression from her, nor do I want to add to her already unnecessarily stressful life. I really feel like I'll be screwing them over if I apply, and I'll feel like I'm being a dick for doing so so soon after all that's happened. But on the other hand, I do need the money this other job provides, even if it's only temp work.

This got long, sorry. I'm just not sure what to do, my brain is just doubt-central, and I can't wait too long thinking and having anxiety attacks over it. Any advice appreciated.",03Sep2020,1
310,"Me and my cousin were extremely close, but for the past 2 years, we've drifted apart kinda mainly because of adult life. Basically, we used to talk alot and not anymore. It's been irritating me mainly because we have a group chat where I'll ask if they want to talk whenever they're free, or honestly just ask questions, ask for advice, etc and they never answer, like ever. I get a reply once in a blue moon. I've brought this up and they told me that they're busy, which I understand, but i guess i just wish that they kinda tried more to stay connected in a way?

311,"I am also a girl(20 F), just fyi. 
My friend(21 F) has had a really weird year. She broke up with her boyfriend of 3 years, went through somewhat of a hoe stage where she was talking to multiple guys, and now she has finally gotten a new boyfriend. This all happened in the span of 8 months I believe. 
I've tried to stay quiet for the most part, because I cannot tell her what to do(despite her constantly asking for advice and never taking it). 
Eventually I was tired of giving her advice and told her to stop coming to me if she's never going to listen to what I say. I was exhausted catering to all the issues she had that could've been easily fixed if she listened(For example, she wanted to talk to her ex to try to get back together, and I told her that she needs to give him space because he's probably hurt and talking to him will drive him away. And guess what? She didn't listen, kept pestering him about missing him and still being in love and he blocked her on everything). 
She got really mad that I told her off and stopped talking to me for like 5 months. 
She never talked to me about it again, which I don't like because I feel we should be able to communicate and work out our issues but she just does not want to talk about it. 
Anyway, I was so excited to hear she had a new boyfriend, because I knew she had a hard year, and companionship is a great thing.
 However, when I asked questions(like where she met him, what his name was), she deflected my questions and told us what I assume is what she wanted us to know, which wasn't very much, only that he lives in our area. 
I stayed quiet for the most part. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he thought it was kinda weird but not enough to really worry about it. 
During this time, I also noticed whenever she would post about him on snapchat, she would constantly censor his face with a sticker, or a scribble. 
At this point, I feel like she's purposefully trying to keep her bf and the friend group apart. 
Which makes me and our friends feel really bad because it's almost as if she's embarrassed by us(which would not be the first time). 
I honestly am really tired of being her friend if shes going to constantly disregard us. 
The reason I stayed friends for so long is she is my only girl friend. And I have a hard time making girl friends in general, so having her in my life(intially) was a blessing for me. 

TL,DR: My friend seems like she's trying to keep her new boyfriend away from me and our friend group and I don't understand why.",03Sep2020,1
312,"So a few weeks ago I was at food lion with my dad and sisters and we were checking out with our groceries. Suddenly I start feeling extremely nauseous and the room is getting dark. Normally you’d be confused but I already understand sort of what was going on because it’s like when you stand up too fast and everything becomes static, except I had been standing the whole time?? Anyways I stumble to the women’s restroom with my little sister because I think I’m either gonna shit til I cry or barf out my brains but I do neither, instead by the time I’m in the stall everything is gone the world is muted and everything is dark even with my eyes wide open. I was desperately struggling to close the lock on my stall when I apparently just collapsed. There are holes in the story cause yknow I passed out, and so I “wake up” but everything is still dark and I’m on the floor of the bathroom (ew) like with my feet in the stall and my chin is all bloody and I have a huge goose egg on my forehead from hitting the wall on my way down. My sister is freaking out asking are you ok what happened should I go get dad, and I’m still out of it so I’m yawning cause I’m sleepy and I just get comfy on the floor focusing on my breathing and I’m like idk what’s happening I’m fine I’m fine and my sister is like, ok I’m getting dad now, and so she leaves and a woman enters the restroom idk what she looked like cause I couldn’t see and everything was extremely muffled but she asked if I was ok I said I was but -I’m literally on the floor of a bathroom like ok lady sure believe me- she steps over my weak body and proceeds to go pee in the stall next to the one I’m halfway in!! Bruh moment. My sister comes back with my other younger sister, slightly older, and she handles the situation very well asking are you ok are you bleeding and I’m like idk I’m fine just vibing dude and I’m like trying to get up and put back on my Nike slides cause they went flying when I fell but I am wobbly and immediately fall again but my sister notices I’m bleeding and we don’t know where it’s coming from, my first thought was well nothing cause static brain but I figured I fell on my face so my nose but it was I had bashed a huge gaping hole in my chin that made the inside of my mask (corona) soaked in blood as well as the bathroom floor. By then I’m getting up angry at everyone for bothering me cause I was still nauseous thinking I needed to barf but also sleep really bad it was weird and so I get up and climb my way to the stall and lock and sit in it, breathing heavily, cold sweat, just trying so hard not to literally die cause I’m scared and confused, and by then my dad is done checking out and I hear him arguing with the worker saying he needs to come get me his daughter but he’s a guy so he can’t so they have this old lady worker come in and carry me basically holding my whole body weight cause I could not walk for shit, and they sit me on the chair outside of the bathroom and hand me a cold water bottle. I slowly sip on the water with my eyes all squinted and glazed looking like I was probably on drugs and my vision slightly comes back but my hearing is still muffled. I answer all their questions, whatd I eat today, have I had water, did you slip and fall, where are you bleeding. My dad is stressed but I see it as anger and so I start crying apologizing cause by now I’m making a spectacle of myself in this random ass food lion probably terrorizing the customers making them think I got corona. My dad carries me to the car and I go home and sip on more water until my learners permit test which I proceeded to fail lol. (I passed later on tho) I would like to know why I fainted. It has been causing a lot of anxiety and whenever I’m in public feeling similar feelings to then I get so scared. Some possible theories are that I just hadn’t eaten enough, but I ate life cereal that morning which was actually more than I normally eat for breakfast, another thought is dehydration which yes probably I don’t drink enough water but why then specifically? I actually had a cup of water that morning cause I had a big day ahead. Another theory is I was nervous about my learners test at the dmv, but I wasn’t even that scared just kinda jittery like normal. A thought my mom raised is that it was cause I was wearing the mask and I overheat easily, but the mask doesn’t hinder your breathing, it could’ve been some sort of anxiety/claustrophobia thing, or I was breathing shallow so as not to fog up my glasses. Some thoughts my anxiety filled brain provided me with was that it could’ve been signs of a blood clot, diabetes, or any other severe physical ailment, although I doubt it something else would’ve happened by now. So what happened then? Happy to answer questions I just need some closure because we never went to the doctor.

I am a sophomore in highschool and am genuinely concerned if I will ever make a real connection with someone outside of family.

315,"For starters, my parents divorced when I was very young, around age 3 or 4. My mom got full custody of me and remarried when I was 8. It's not like she wasn't dating before that or anything, she just always kept busy with work. That's just how she is. Whenever I was home, which was almost any time I wasn't at school, I was home with my stepdad. Within a couple of months, he started making sexual advances towards me. From there, it quickly turned to full-on sexual abuse. Whenever we were alone, it would happen. It continued I moved out-of-state to attend a university. Unfortunately, I ended up with a roommate from hell. He also began acting extremely sexual and dominant towards me. At first, I liked it but he became abusive after a while. It got to the point where I couldn't do ANYTHING without his approval. He threatened my life constantly and even held a pocket knife to my throat for doing things without permission. My spring break happened shortly before the pandemic, and I made use of the break by dropping out of the university and moving across the country to live with my aunt without his or my mom/stepdad's knowledge. I couldn't move in with my dad because he died from a heart attack not long after the divorce. I still don't have any friends here, and I haven't had any luck in the relationship department. I have these lingering thoughts that stay with me about them. They're these urges to throw myself back into an abusive relationship because it was the only way I received any attention, and it was the only time I felt useful or like anybody wanted me. I kind of miss it. Is it bad that I miss being in those situations sometimes? Does that make me a bad person? How do I deal with feeling this way?",03Sep2020,1

324,"Hi everyone!

So I (15f) have been friends with Sarah (16F, name changed for privacy reasons) for about a year now. We’ve grown close and apart a couple of times, and I’ve noticed that whenever we’re distanced, I genuinely feel happier.

Sarah is a fairly nice person but I feel like she’s designated me to be her emotional dumpster. She seems to like to talk about herself a lot (i.e. will ask about me for a minute and then bring the conversation back to herself) and when she does, she brings up VERY personal topics (self harm, her experience with an eating disorder, etc.) into conversations that didn’t reflect that vibe at all. I do agree that there should be more conversations about those topics, but it’s a very abrupt transition that just kind of makes the conversation...awkward.

She also tends to project her own opinions and feelings onto me. She will be VERY hypocritical when  we’re talking to boys (telling me I shouldn’t talk to guys, that it’s not good for me to get attached to boys I just met, etc.) while she flirts a guy up and literally imagines this random boy she just started talking to as her boyfriend. It’s not a super huge deal, just a boy, but admittedly I do get frustrated with the hypocrisy.

She dominates our conversations a lot and sometimes kind of traps me into conversations to the point where I would feel bad for leaving or not responding. 

I clearly sound fed up with her, but the problem is that I don’t know how to take a break from her respectfully. I think she thinks that we’re best friends (I do NOT consider us such) and that it’s all fun and games, but I don’t know how to tell her it’s too much. 

Another problem is that we’re both part of a wonderful friend group and I don’t want other people to feel like they have to “pick sides” or anything like that. We have talked about how she can be kind of exhausting to handle in the past - the topic has just come up and we’ve all chipped in our stories of how we really just didn’t feel valued as friends, but more like sponges to soak up all of her trauma.

At the end of the day, I just need to not talk to her for a while, but I don’t quite know how to do that without her/other people questioning me. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! Also I apologize if the formatting was confusing or anything like that, I am on mobile and I’m writing this pretty late at night.",03Sep2020,1
325,"Okay. Some context.

I'm 22 now, still live at home and suffer from social anxiety. Suffering to the point where I'm often afraid to open the door to accept a package, but being the middle of the drama no problem. I am very afraid of talking to strangers, not because I have no skills (I do), but because of the actual sound of my voice.

My school career was weird. I finished middle school after 10th grade at age 16 and then did a job training to become a kindergarten teacher. All my friends went off to high school, while I got left behind. I quit job training due to my social anxiety and then stayed home for a whole year because of medical reasons doing absolutely nothing, while my friends were in high school, bonding without me. After that when I was 19 I went back to school (kind of like high school light edition, only until 12th grade but with a specific main subject: mine was pedagogy) to get a secondary entrance qualification to university, which I did get. But here you won't be accepted to most universities unless you have a full high school diploma, so after 12th grade I went back to school, starting from the beginning in 11th grade, because I was missing a secondary foreign language. I held out for like 2 weeks until I stopped going. I couldn't bear being the frightened 21 y/o in a class full of 16/17/18 y/o. So I quit that as well and started online school from home last October. But my motivation was so low I only ever managed to keep it up for like 2 months until I stopped doing that as well. I'm still registered to online school, but only for child financial reasons.

Now I'm at home yet again having achieved nothing. I only have a little cleaning job in order to buy luxury goods by myself without being dependent on my mom for it. All my friends are doing fine. One is studying social work, one is becoming a foreign language correspondent, one is becoming a medical assistant. And me? I'm a freakin' cleaning lady growing more and more body fat by the minute.

Now to the actual problem I am facing:

I would love to go to college. I enjoy writing and would love to become a professional writer and editor. My first novel is already written. The university my social work friend goes to has a class for literature, culture and media and a lot of other creativity influenced courses I would like to take. No normal job training is interesting to me, I couldn't just go to school (yet again) and do something I wouldn't enjoy in the long run, just for financial reasons.

Over the past couple of years I have developed this romanticized idea about uni, like in the movies. But I also feel like I'm only worth something if I get a college degree of some sorts, coming from the worst types of schools there is in my country and constantly being shamed for having attended it in the past.

I want to study at this university my friend is already studying at next year in October. She would help me find a place and we even planned me visiting her to go with her for a day in order to see how university really is. But studying there would be bound to moving away.

I want change, but I know I have a hard time dealing with change, especially since my family won't be around so much then (it's in another state). I live my family, I love hone. If I had the assurance I'd be a successful writer I could stay home and be a cleaning lady forever. But I also really want to go to uni, but looking at my record of quitting things and my inability to talk to strangers without my throat stitching itself together whenever I need to talk...I am really scared. Scared of moving away, scared of being alone. I would totally come back home after those 3 years, I'm not the type of person to live alone, but I feel like for now I need to do something new.

I can attend this university without a full high school diploma, which is why I'm planning on quitting online school as well. I would have to take a qualification test and then wait until I get accepted (since the class is admission free).

But my struggle also lies with time. Thinking about going away next October keeps me up at night. Is next year the right time? Or the year after that? I definitely decided that should next year's winter semester be home studying again due to the current corona pandemic, I will take the test (since I can use it for reference for the next application) but not apply for the semester, but wait for the next one. Then again, it's ""only"" literature, stuff I would need to do from home anyways.

So yeah. This is my life, this is my struggle. And I have absolutely no idea what to do right now.",03Sep2020,1
326,"Perhaps you will think of the title as an exaggeration, but it is truly what I feel inside.

I struggled with severe depression in high school, I become so desperate to finish I put no effort into my grades. 

When I graduated (3 years late) I never applied to post secondary school and quickly entered the workforce. I had a 9-5office job but the day to day life of pushing papers is not for me, so I left.

Since then I have been working dead end jobs, saving my money. But I am still as lost as I ever was.

I have no direction in which I want to go, no ambitions, just a desire to escape the rat race and find happiness whilst earning money.

I fear that my lack of efforts in high-school and no post secondary were a mistake, although I still feel little desire to enter post secondary.

328,"hi guys, i have an anorexic friend. recently, his eating habits (or lack thereof) have been affecting him much more severely, emotionally speaking. he has more mental breakdowns lately due to his inability to eat, and even the littlest reminders of his weight or something related to his past could cause his mood to change instantly. i wanted to hear from people who have similar eating issues/know someone who does who can give me their opinions and advice on how to support him, but not make him feel like he's given special treatment.

  
here's some of his behavior traits that may help with your advice:

\-jokes and chill around a lot to keep the mood light

\-absolutely refuses to talk about his violent past which traumatized him and may have caused his eating disorder

\-will refuse to do anything if given pressure (i tried to make him eat more than a single piece of corn and he ended up not eating at all)

\-probably would refuse getting professional help from a doctor

\-does not take people who focuses on helping him seriously. for example, if someone unironically talks about depression or suicide and tells him not to have negative thoughts, he would make fun of them and maybe even ignore them

\-said he may start taking antidepressants to gain some weight, although it gives him severe mood swings

\-also said he may smoke weed again cuz it sometimes made him feel like eating",03Sep2020,1
329,"Hey there, just looking for any advice on what I should do here. I realize that there are many more people in much worse situation, but this has all kind of hit me like a truck and I have no idea what to do. 

So, to begin with, I broke up with my girlfriend the other day. It’s a decision I thought through for a long time, and I truly believe it was the right thing to do, but when I did, I alienated a huge part of my support network. This is big for me, because I don’t have any family in the area - they moved across the country last week, and regardless of where they are, I haven’t had much contact with them since I graduated high school, due to the fact that I have an extremely controlling father, and haven’t been welcome in their home since he kicked me out. Anyways, when I broke up with my girlfriend, I also lost access to the car I was using (it was her parent’s spare), and I live a mile from campus. I’m under quarantine right now because of two of my roommates testing positive, so that hasn’t been an issue so far, but I don’t know what I’m going to do when I go back. On top of all that, I tried to drink away the anxiety tonight, spilled a whole drink on my computer, and now it’s fried. I’m out almost 1k for a new one, because I have to use it for both work and school. I can’t work until it comes in, and a huge chunk of my hours come on Fridays. The cherry on top is that I went to hang out with a girl I’m friends with earlier tonight, sat there for an hour, only to be stood up. 

I guess the gist of it all is that a bunch of things have gone down the drain for me recently, and I’m at a loss for what to do, both for my mental health and financially. I truly believe that I’ve made the best decisions I knew to make, but nothing seems to be going right and I’m extremely discouraged right now",03Sep2020,1

346,"I am a 15 year old boy, so part of me thinks this might just be puberty, but recently I cannot stand my dad. He makes insane rules that don’t make any sense to me, and then only enforced them sometimes, so I don’t really know if he’s serious or not. When he does enforce them he blows up on me, and it feels like a lot of the time when he’s angry he takes it out on me. As an example of this, I am not allowed to eat watermelon without first moving what I am going to eat from the big bowl into a smaller bowl, which makes some sense, except I’m the only person in the house who eats watermelon. One day I forgot to do this as we had talked about it a few weeks prior and not since, and my dad yelled at me for 30 minutes about how disrespectful that was and grounded me for a month and told me to put the watermelon back. I put one last piece of watermelon in my mouth just before I was going to do that, only because I wanted one more piece of watermelon, (not as any sign of disrespect),  and he got PISSED. He started pushing me around to the point that I was genuinely afraid that I might get hurt. Another example is that, recently, especially during quarantine, I was wearing a robe a lot, just as a way to be comfortable, and he told me that if I was going to do that that I would have to wear some kind of pants, but then once again we didn’t talk about it for about a month, I forgot one day, and a similar scene unfolded. He started shouting expletives at me and pushing me, and at one point even trying to forcefully undress me (to prove a point I guess). When I was able to stop him from doing that he pulled his pants off like a crazy person flaunting his genitals around me. (I am fairly certain this was never an issue when I was wearing my robe). But sometimes I’ll just be sitting and he will say something that will get me unreasonably pissed off at him. For example, my entire family has weight issues except for my brother, and I have been working on it for a long time with little success, and sometimes he will say something about my effort to lose weight (nothing particularly mean), but it feels really condescending and patronizing, which makes me want to go to my room or do basically anything to be alone. Not that this works, as he has no respect for my personal space or privacy. I have tried talking with him about some of this but we both tend to accuse each other of a lot and get really defensive, and walk away having taken nothing in.

My ex and my him have broken my trust. i get why he would want something because he is alone and tired of being a single parent and not knowing what to do, when she has been alone all her parenthood. they were also drunk and it could have been a huge mistake neither of them ment to make. I found out she has talked shit about be behind my back. Ive given her love and friendship and money for her daughter just so she can take her to daycare. 

I dont know what to do. part of me feels like bashing my head aginst a wall till i break and part of me wants to forgive them both because ive made my fair share of drunken mistakes. He has told me the truth while she has lied about everything. she is part of our friend group and no one wants her around but our friends are mainly family and no one wants to blame him.

i get that he is at fault just as much as she is but she knew his situation and how lonely he could/would be going into it. what do i do reddit?  please dont sat disown them both cause thats not an option they are both close to me and i would love to forgive them both however i have decision to make and its not possible.",03Sep2020,1

358,"Hello, thanks for giving me your time and reading this. Appreciate any feedback!

I am a 2nd year Doctorate of Physical Therapy Student. I have found myself continuously struggling with anticipated career depression. When in undergrad I studied to get into dental school and did not get accepted my first year of applying, so I took advice from my mentor at the time and applied to a Physical Therapy program because I had the pre-requisites for it. With a high GPA, I was able to get into the program first round and this was my only option after undergrad. With one day in between graduation and the start of my graduate school doctorate program, I had little to reflect on other options. I figured since I liked to exercise and lift, Physical Therapy (PT) would feel accomplishing to me. 

Fast Forwarding... I am now a 2nd year of 3 years. I am on my final didactic (book work) year and am on the border of just dropping out as I can’t see myself being satisfied with this career. I think there are great PTs out there but the career itself seems too easy for me. The schooling has been challenging at times but I don’t even care to master the material. I take it slow and never talk to any of my family about my schooling, what I’ve learned, or any skills I have mastered. I just avoid the conversations by saying its okay and prompt them with a different topic. The hand skills such as joint mobilizations, stretching, surgery (sx) protocols and lab components have been too easy for me. I do not even need to practice them to execute them well in a mock testing scenario. I have been continuously let down by the quality of my teachers and am just overall discouraged with where my life will be in 10-20 years. 

On top of all this info, I have a super awesome, supportive girlfriend in my life who is determined to finish the program. We are in the same class. I have already mentioned to her about my thoughts and how I am dreading my possible future. She too feels this isn’t a field for her but is much older than me and wants to earn a degree and start her career/life. 

My question is reddit...  What would you guys suggest/do? 

TLDR: 23 yr old male not satisfied with career path in doctorate of physical therapy program. Has had a shit 1.5 years in the program so far, dislikes the core classes, thinks the field isn’t backed by enough evidence based practice, and goes to school with a sub-par cohort. Wants to drop, has a desire to do something with software programming but has no knowledge other than making private servers of video games when a teenager. Doesn’t know if he should take a leave of absence since its offered with COVID or to stay in the program.

Thanks for reading. Looking forward to replies.",03Sep2020,1
360,"Every once and a while, I’ll suddenly just feel completely detached from my body. Kind of feels like I’m on auto pilot, like my body is doing one thing and my mind is sitting back and watching. I feel no emotions when this happens. 

The thing that concerns me is that this happens most frequently when I’m driving (or perhaps I just notice it more when I’m driving). My auto-pilot body still knows what to do when driving, so I wouldn’t say it’s completely dangerous.... but it’s also obviously not completely safe. It’s kind of hard to explain, but my brain still tells my body what to do when I’m driving, but it almost feels like I’m giving instructions to a third person. I haven’t had an experience where a depersonalization episode is so bad that I had to pull over or anything... so I don’t really know if this is a problem I urgently need to address.

363,"So, before you read this, know that I’m aware my advisable solution is to move out and go my own way.  

It’s covid times though. I’m recently unemployed and there aren’t a ton of housing options in my area that fit my needs and budget.

Effectively this is an inconvenience.  How do I proceed here?

I [m] have a roommate [f] who feels left out and starts acting in a passive aggressive manner towards the weekend when she isn’t invited to hang out with my friends and I.  

She’s gotten to know many of them on first name a basis, but has never cultivated friendships / relationships independently.  Furthermore, it’s been made clear to me by my friends and acquaintances that she’s not a very desirable person to be around.  I myself am friendly and diplomatic with her as we live together, but prefer to keep my social life independent from my home life.  

Normally this wouldn’t be the case.  But this girl is basically a weed.  

I frequently get texts from her asking “hey where are you?” Or, “what’s going on tonight?” and “What should I bring to the party?” In terms of actual, real live, impact; there was a small cookout where she showed up with her dog.  The dog went inside the house and crapped on the carpet.  She asked for help cleaning it up and acted surprised that a [trained] dog would act out.  Most recently however she admonished me for not inviting her out for beers on a Sunday night.  The genuine circumstance of the matter, which I told her, was that the get-together was unplanned and a spontaneous interaction between friends.  

So, in addition to ignoring social customs and disregarding common courtesies, she’s just difficult to be around. 

Frequently interrupts people.  Gets too drunk.  Tells bad and inappropriate jokes.  Comes off as an opportunist and entitled. Has a depressing personality.  These aren’t just my observations.  This is what I’ve been told.

I feel like I’m living out a real life version lf The Cable Guy.

Short of completely ignoring her, I’m unsure how to convey that people genuinely don’t like being around her and she needs to find her own group of friends for social stimulation.

TLDR; Female roommate expects to be included on most social interactions in my friend-group.",03Sep2020,1

365,"*I’ll try to add a link of the screenshots.*
Long but petty rage. I also just wanna know if I was wrong or if I’m trippin cause she’s bullshitting. 

But this whole thing started because a while ago I told my 2 friends (S &amp; V) we should hang out with this girl we went to school with (K) &amp; they said it was fine. K’s a stay home mom so I wanted to be nice &amp; invite her for girls night but I didn’t ask them first cause I didn’t think about it. I just kinda invited her you know? &amp; now that she was coming, S was bothered by it &amp; I cant help but to drag it on cause she goes out all the time w other people but doesn’t wanna hang out cause K was coming. (Read screenshots first.) 

I’m not trippin on V cause she actually HAS been social distancing. She hasn’t been going to parties, or stores, or even go out in public. She doesn’t even see her boyfriend cause she’s so paranoid &amp; I felt bad cause V apologized &amp; said she felt like she was attacking me &amp; I told her it was okay cause she wasn’t but I understood why they’re paranoid. It’s just stupid cause I think S was just bullshitting. 

So, S said she’s being “really careful” but she’s been trynna to go to restaurants with us, goes to dance classes with a group of people she doesn’t know, seeing family who’s been traveling out of state, always wants to go to the stores like Target or 5 below or Ross to go shopping together. Her boyfriend &amp; parents come into contact with people when they’re at work (her dad also came into contact with somebody who actually has the virus.) &amp; by her starting work IS “risking” it. &amp; 2 days after I got home from the hospital (I went into labor) they both came over to my house without it being a problem, &amp; I think it was before I even told them my test was negative. 

I DID tell her they were from SO&amp;SO cause she asked what the party was for &amp; that’s when I told her it was for her boyfriends birthday (my neighbors boyfriend) &amp; the only people showing up are from SO&amp;SO. I literally told her THAT NIGHT before we even went cause we saw my other neighbor who was walking around &amp; was supposed to go/be there already. There were like 30 or 40 people there. She said I watched her stand in the corner..yeah, she stood in the corner &amp; was talking to 3 guys &amp; 2 other girls. While I was standing there at the counter talking to my dad. She was also on the balcony talking to other people. &amp; played beer pong w some guy while I sat on the couch by myself.

It WAS my dads idea to go, but after the first time he brought it up she was literally fucking BEGGING me to go cause she wanted to drink. Then when we got there she changed her mind &amp; didn’t wanna drink anymore cause she didn’t trust the people around us serving us drinks. So I asked if she just wanted me to pour them for us &amp; she said yeah. After she got drunk I asked if she wanted to leave still &amp; she told me she wanted to stay &amp; get more drunk so her boyfriend brought her a mikes hard.

What she was saying was bothering me cause all her actions just go against the reason she didn’t wanna go. &amp; I’m EVEN MORE pissed that she lied about the whole party situation saying that she wasn’t talking to anybody &amp; felt uncomfortable yet she was the one partying &amp; socializing. &amp; I’ll say it again, I didn’t even wanna be there. 

V asked me to ask K if she’s been anywhere else so I did &amp; also asked if they got tested. The night they were supposed to come over I sent them a video saying “I wish you guys were here” &amp; S was like “Are you alone?” &amp; I replied back with “Yep.” &amp; she asked what happened to K &amp; I told her she said another time after I told her they bailed &amp; she was like “that’s fucked up.” We were supposed to go to a car show on Saturday &amp; she bailed cause she said she couldn’t hang out but then makes plans to go to the beach with V. They ended up going to the car show without me..After S said she couldn’t go. 

Am I wrong tho for saying all that to her?? Cause we’re in the group chat &amp; it feels like she’s trying to make me look like a dumbass cause she was straight up fucking lying &amp; my boyfriend even heard her from the other room begging to go. I also have videos of her playing BP with that guy &amp; the party host has a video of her there at the party too. Then the whole car show situation was just shady &amp; fake asf to me. &amp; I don’t believe her cause she’s done some shady shit like this to her other friend too &amp; told me about it so I have a hard time trusting anything she says. Cause after the first time she bailed, V ended up texting me just a few minutes after S &amp; bailed too, so it made me think she convinced V to not go.",03Sep2020,1

I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure if anyone will be able to help or if this is the right thing to do. I’m sorry if it’s not.

Basically I live away from home (16 hour drive) so that I can study at Uni. I’m in a completely different mental state from where I was at the start of the year and it’s gradually been getting worse. I absolutely despise living with my flatmates and I’m just finding everything so overwhelming. Consequently, I came up with the idea of possibly moving back to my home town and cross crediting my papers there. 

However, there are a few issues: 

1. I’ve already signed a flat- although I technically could find someone else to fill my room.

2. I absolutely love genetics. I want to get a Genetics degree and my current University is well known for it’s science program, whereas the University in my home town is more centred towards Law.

3. I’ve already enrolled here and starting a new University again could trigger an unwanted stress response.

4. I’m utterly terrified of telling my flatmates that I can’t stay anymore. I despise conflict and the thought of them possibly arguing with me about it makes me very anxious.


But, there’s also plenty of reasons why I should leave:

1. Next year there won’t be any true support networks here as I don’t trust any of my flatmates and my boyfriend is moving back home.

2. I’m starting to socially isolate myself here and I don’t think it would be good for me to do this for a whole year.

3. My mental health seems to be much worse down here.

4. I’ve also discovered recently that I don’t like living with girls my age as they often fight/bitch about eachother and I feel as though I’m stuck in a social situation 24/7.

5. It would also be much easier financially.

I’ve always been super insecure and it only escalated in my freshman year, I began to self harm which eventually led to my first attempt when I was 14. I was in the hospital for 3 days then in an inpatient facility for another week. After I got out and got home my mom tried her best to act like everything was ok and that things were turning around for me, which they were but it was still very hard. She started to talk to me less and less and started telling friends that I was manipulative and that she had to walk on eggshells around me so I wouldn’t “go off”. This of course really hurt me and I pulled away from her again. It stayed this way until last year when we got really close again and everything was actually really good. But now that I’ve turned 18 and graduated and have a career path set it’s almost like she believes her job is complete and she doesn’t need to talk to me or see me at all. My girlfriend moved away for college and I took it really hard, I didn’t eat for 2 days and didn’t sleep for 3, never left my bed, didn’t shower, it was incredibly hard. It took my mom 2 days to notice I hadn’t eaten, 4 days to notice I wasn’t sleeping, and a week for her to finally come check on me and all she had to say was “it’s harder than you thought huh?” And just watched me cry.

So far it’s been fine living, and I wasn’t too worried about bugs until just now. So around four months after living here, my mom found a huge roach in the pantry. She killed it and we just assumed it was a loner, but we still did a little double check to make sure. Not too much longer after that, I spotted a roach carcass in my garage. It looked like it had been dead for a while, as it was crumpled and dry. It wasn’t a shed because it still had the meat on it. Anyways, the part that’s really unnerving me is just now I saw a baby roach in my bathroom. After a 3 minute battle, I can proudly say it is no more than a pulp now. I made sure to check under the sink, under the mat, towels, but found nothing. Not even droppings or legs. I looked it up and heard that baby roaches most likely mean infestation. Can anyone tell me if I’m dealing with just some rogues or a full on colony of the little hell spawns. Here are some things to take note of: it’s a brand new house, just finished getting built before I moved; me and my family are very clean, a bit messy, but very sanitary; I have two cats but there food is kept locked in a plastic tub; these incidents are very far apart and I’ve only seen the three, with no evidence such as body parts or droppings to suggest more; the perimeter of the house is always sprayed with bug poison.

fast forward a few months later, i dated a friend of mine (“B”) to try and get over “A”. while i was in that relationship, she ended up confessing that she actually did like me back after i had confessed. by this point, me and “B” didn’t feel any romantic feelings toward each other, but we hadn’t spoken about it. i felt bad to accept her confession, so i merely told her i moved on when i hadn’t.

the next month, me and “B” broke up and ultimately decided to stay best friends. i ended up overthinking “A”’s confession and asked her if she still liked me because i actually liked her back. unfortunately, she rejected me once again because school is beginning and during this pandemic, we wouldn’t be able to see each other anyways. also we both have slight commitment issues (her’s being a lot worse than mine.)

at this point, i’m wondering if i should just get over it and move on for the last time or wait it out again to see if she’ll like me back again. it’s just a lot of back and forth and it’s really making me feel like a burden or as if my feelings aren’t valid in a way? just want some advice from anyone who can help &lt;3",03Sep2020,1

After we broke up I deleted everything I had of her including her nudes and I even  told her to unsave and delete out conversation but she wanted to keep it.

Anyways as I was going through our messages randomly, I noticed that on that on 2017 (6 months before her turning 18) she sent a nude photo of her showing her breasts, unsolicited, saved on the chat function. I immediately freaked out and told her to unsave it straight away and she did, she didn't seem to care. 

Anyways for the next week as everyone did, I freaked out that cops will FBI will come and all that and arrest me for possessing it, but I am like 99% sure that I never actually saved that photo in my camera roll, nor did I ever notice it was there. 

Now I just can't seem to forgive myself, in my mind I saved that photo to my camera roll and deleted it when we broke up, but I feel so guilty because she was underage when she sent it. I know I didn't save it but I just can't seem to get it off my mind, I feel disgusted in myself, I feel like I can't ever be happy until I somehow figure out whether I saved that picture or not. Then again, if I did, I'm having the thoughts again but it still being somewhere in the deleted section of my phone, being recovered by the police...paranoid

I tried to talk about it to my ex and she told me to fuck off and get over it but I can't, I just feel so guilty for even just looking at it, and even worse if I did save it..

Just needed to get it off my chest and tell anyone even if it is Reddit. Thankyou",03Sep2020,1
382,"Hi I am a girl now 22 years old. I think I was just 17 when this happened. 

So I met this guy “T” and we started a relationship. We had nothing in common and I don’t really think I was in love. I think it was more because of the idea of having a boyfriend and getting attention from someone. We had been together for about three months. During this “relationship” he kept pushing me in having sex with him. He would be my first and I was not ready to have sex yet. So I kept telling him this. He kept complaining to me about me not loving him enough and me defending myself. 
Summer came and he invited me to come along to a music festival with his friends. We would also be sleeping there for two nights at a festival camping. I agreed. I decided that I was going to sleep with him at the festival. When the time came and we where in the tent we started making out and stuff. It was okay. But when we did the deed I really felt uncomfortable. He was really dominant and kept telling me how he wanted me to lie down and stuff. It was not romantic at all. It was my first time, and he wasn’t really gentle with me. It kind of hurted but I thought it was normal and that it would go away if I did it more. I cried during the sex also. But it was not like I said no or protested. I was just silent during this whole thing. After he was done he walked out of the tent without a word to smoke a sigaret. I felt really bad and sad and was in a lot of pain. It hurted when I would move. He came back to go see me after his sigaret and he asked why I was looking so down and sad. But he didn’t ask me in a worried way. More in a way as if he was mildly annoyed. I said that I felt hurt and that it hurted down there if I moved. He just laughed and said “you’re overreacting, it’s just sex” 
After that night we packt our stuff and went home. When I came home he broke up with me via text. 

I don’t know if it was rape or not because I kinda gave consent at the beginning, and during the sex I didn’t say no I just let him be. But I was cying tho and it really didn’t feel good at all...
Some friends say it was bad communication and he was just being selfish, but others really called it rape. 
I have been walking with these thoughts for years and I still don’t know. But ever since this happened I do still feel kind of scared at the thought of sex. I have had sex with other people after the incident but often I really feel very low about myself and useless and stuff. I get these really bad thoughts about myself",03Sep2020,1
383,"Here is what I remember:
I looked down and saw a bullet in my chest, Looked in a mirror to see one poking out my hair, too in the back of my arm, one in the back of the leg.
They weren’t fully through me which is why I could see them. When I pulled them out in the dream  I could feel PAIN and there was HOLES. I COULD SEE MY FRICKING INSIDES FROM THE ONE THAT WAS IN MY CHEST!!! Then in the dream I went to my mom told her and then I woke up.

With full disclosure, there was no imminent threat, just emotional confidence.

For me, this made the *s* word circle around my head more. But I'm not sure what's right or wrong anymore. My life is fucked up. I want to know if I should even speak to this person again after that. I'm devastated by it",03Sep2020,1

386,"Just to give some context here, I went out with a guy friend for lunch (am a girl) and I implied before we ate that we'd split the bill. He didn't respond so I assumed that he acknowledged this. Went out to eat and when it came to paying for the bill he refused to let me pay. I insisted since we were close friends but he didn't budge so I transferred him money over the phone and he got super mad. I feel uncomfortable for letting people pay for me but I'm not sure if it's a guy thing or??? He's a really good friend and I don't want to anger him further but really hoping for some advice on how to respond to situations like this. Did I make a wrong move paying back the money?

Then my dad kicked the door open, breaking half of it in the process, I woke up because the noise was loud, then he yelled  at me for keeping him awake at 3:00 am even though I was trying to go to bed. I knew they were going to take my phone away if I didn't so I was texting my sister really fast because shes the only person I know who would u understand, even just a little bit, because we have the same parents (obviously). I type pretty fast, especially since I was panicking, I got through about  five sentences before my dad snatched my phone away, and then my mom yelled, not even yelled, I could feel how sore her throat was gonna be after that, to give her the password for it. I don't hide anything. The only thing I do is watch youtube videos on it, mostly bc I don't know what else to do. My background is literally a green bird on a skateboard. I did, she made me write it down, it's the password for half of my socials, so, after I write this I'm changing all of them. My dad gave me my phone back and they are on my laptop rn. Am I being too dramatic? Ive been crying for a good thirty minutes. Was I in the wrong? They didn't have to break my door though. He has a thingy that can unlock every lock in the house, he should've just used that. I just wanted them to ask my teacher, If I knew they would do that, I would have just given it up and let them waste their time. I didn't know they ever acted like that either.

I've been dealing with depression and loneliness for as long as I can remember and after I graduated from high school I pretty much lost all my friends and I've been living completely isolated ever since.

An hour ago a girl I know from my university randomly asked if I want to hang out and I was shocked because that's a message I've been hoping to get for a very long time.

The thing is that she's with a bunch of friends I don't know and she asked me to bring someone as well. I don't have a single friend. I could just lie and go alone but I'm thinking about just saying no. I'm way too scared that it's going to be awkward. I'm very introvert and fairly shy. Not too shy but shy enough to be pretty awkward with new people especially if it's an entire group of friends.

It felt like we had a strong connection before . It’s now been 2 years.

I definitely overthink talking to him recently because I’m scared to run out of things to say, and that’s what the problem is I think. I’m not natural with it. He’s different than my friends since he doesn’t reply in a way where we can continue a topic for a long time. 

What is a way to have deeper talks like we use to? I don’t know if it’s him or me. Or the effort he puts into talking about things. I just get confused because it wasn’t like this before.

407,"So... I've never been to a dentist. I know what you're thinking. I'm probably scared. I'm probably someone who brushes everyday twice and doesn't think i worry about it. But recently i noticed my gums have been bleeding alot. I brush my teeth and they bleed. But that's not the worst part. A bad part of it is I've genuienly never ever been to a dentist. But it gets worse... Hell i literally never heard of them until i was like... 14. 

Anyways. The reason i am posting this to the r/advice. Is because i think i need to go but... is it really worth it. As i said my gums are bleeding. But the worst part of the whole situation. I'm loosing gum itself. I think they call that gum receding or something. I don't know I've never ever been. I remember at 14 i didn't really care for a dentist. And thought nothing of it. I always thought it was optional. Or somewhere you went if you had bad tooth ache or something.

(Btw this is not a troll I'm deadly serious) 

A plus is I've never had toothache. I've never really had any pain in my mouth. But the thing with the gums is kinda scary. Its just started happening but its happening fast. My girlfriend says I'm extremely heavy handed and i brush too hard. Is that it? Do i need new toothbrush? Maybe an electric one?

The final paragraph is about the dentist itself. What are they like? What happens. Is it easy to register? I can imagine covids actually gonna affect if i can even get an appointment. Is it normal that I've never been? Are receding gums bad? I'm sorry i have so many questions. The way i imagined a dentist until... 24 hours ago, was it's somewhere you go if you have like an rly painful black tooth and they have to rip it out. That's literally what I thought it was for. Like a hospital if you break your arm. 

Thanks to anyone who took their time to read this. I'm more annoyed because about 5 minutes ago i just got told by my gf that my parents shoulda took my when i was a kid because it was free as I'm located in the uk. So my final question. Is this about to break my bank account?

410,"I'm not sure where to start with this. My friend, ""Jen"", often makes irrational or risky decisions. She is a teenager, so of course she likes the sense of danger but I think it has gone too far. A couple weeks ago, my other friend ""Kim"" told me she had recently been hanging out with her boyfriend and met his co-worker ""John"" who joked he wanted to take Jen out for coffee. John is a 42 year old man. Not to mention he has a (recent) criminal record. I dismissed this at first, thinking it was a (creepy) joke. 

But Jen, Kim, Kim's boyfriend, and John start to hang out together and ""joke"" about Jen and John getting together. I tell them all I find this to be incredibly inappropriate, that is there is no circumstance in which a 42 year old man should be hanging out with a bunch of teenagers. All of my other friends agree with me that this is wrong. They definitely both know it's wrong because all they can say about this is ""It's funny"", or ""It's just a running joke"".  I think it's ridiculous to say this when Jen and John are texting each other everyday, Jen is always talking about John, etc. I guess it's also a ""joke"" when John says he will wait until Jen is legal.

Except apparently he couldn't even be held to that because the other night the four of them rented out a cabin, he provided them with shrooms, and him and Jen had sexual relations that night (not actual sex). I was appalled when she told me this like it was just some juicy gossip or something. I continue to tell them this is wrong and now very serious considering what had just happened. But Jen and Kim continually will make excuses for John, he is a manchild, he always makes sure Jen is comfortable/everything is ""consensual"", he has never done this before, etc. (even though I believe any predator with a brain would not admit to being a repeat offender.) I am very mad at Kim especially because I thought someone with past traumatic experiences with men would understand my point of view, but instead she is actively encouraging this. Jen is now looking up the age of consent laws in our state because she wants to hook up with John. I'm not sure of the laws regardless I don't think there is anything I can do to stop her. I hate that I have to pretend I'm remotely okay with this by giving her advice on at least being safe if they are going to have sex.

Tomorrow Jen and John are going camping and Jen told me the only thing that is stopping her from going all the way is that she's on her period. I think maybe for now I talked some sense into her, only after telling her John could go to prison for a long time and he would get beat up because no one likes a kiddy diddler. This is something I didn't even think I had to say. I hate having this weight on me and usually I will confide in my mom but I can't now obviously or she will call the police. Also it is very tempting to tell her dad because that is just one step away from him killing John and solving the problem.",03Sep2020,1

413,"Hi, I(24m) am having a hard time with some stuff lately. In late June I was in a support group on Facebook when I met someone(24f) that ended up turning into an online friendship. The first month she gave me subtle hints that she’s into me and the more I got to know her, the more I started to catch feelings for her. After a month we had a late night chat and we both confessed that we had been feeling Deja Vú. I’ve had flashes go through my head of my exact situation, just different slightly, talking to her. I’ve had dreams that she’s in. We both experience anxiety at the same time of the day, separately without discussion until later in the day. It’s almost like we have the same emotions at the same times throughout the day. I brought this up to her and she says she experiences the same things. She said when she first messaged me, she thought paced around her room for almost 2 days before sending a message. I almost did myself before she sent me the first one. She has a 2 year old daughter that is a sweetest little girl. Her being a mother doesn’t bother me, in fact, I love how much of a good mother she is. She sends me photos of her from time to time and it melts my heart. I’ve asked her if she wants to give us a try when we get to know each other better and she originally said she had to think about it, which is understandable. It’s more of a big deal for her than it is for me. We talked since then about it and she says it’s possible that we have a shot. I’ve fallen in love with this woman so quickly and I feel such a connection. I’m scared. I’ve been hurt, cheated on and left.

414,University has started up again and all classes are online now. I have also moved back home from living with three others in the city center last year (I did not work out and put a lot of stress and anxiety on me). I feel more alone and isolated than ever before and I find it difficult to reach out to friends. I don’t feel like my friends really want to hang out either :// I struggle with social anxiety so not reaching out obviously feels “safer”. Do you have any tips on how to handle feeling alone? Any activities that you’ve done by yourself that have helped? Or with others? Thanks!,03Sep2020,1
416,"(i'm sorry if some of my wording isn't great, i'm trying to avoid showing personal info. also, the title doesn't really sum up my entire post, but i didn't want to make it too long.)

hii, sorry if this is lengthy, just looking for some advice. i'm 14f and just started freshman year. i started online school about two weeks ago and i'm in all honors classes. we're only doing 3 courses each quarter, but i'm already close to a week behind atm (btw we don't do zoom or anything, the only time we have to do anything in person is for discussion-based assignments, though i haven't done any because i'm terrified). i'm not only just having a hard time keeping up, but the workload has increased a ton recently and i'm *incredibly* stressed out about catching up. i've got *really* ***really*** bad anxiety, and my fear of failure is making me feel like i can't do the work until i understand it all perfectly. unfortunately, i can't understand it all unless i click on the assignments and do them, but seeing how far behind i am is enough to give me a panic attack. at this point, i can't even click on the bookmark to the webpage. my school makes it so that you can only have 3 zeros each quarter to be eligible for finals, and you've got 15 days until an assignment is no longer submittable (making it a zero). i'm worried that i'll be stuck like this and will fail my first year. my parents have given me the option to switch another online learning program that's supposed to be better than what i'm doing now, but i'm scared it won't be as advanced and i'll fall behind when i go back to highschool. some of my friends are doing what i'm doing right now too, and i don't want to leave them behind, if that makes sense. i'm just scared and tired and i don't know what to do. my parents are also in the middle of a custody battle of sorts, so that sucks too (parents mentioned previously are mom and stepdad).

i suppose the question i'm asking after all of that is what should i do? i keep thinking about how much better i'd do if life was *normal*, but it's not. cry me a river, build a bridge, and get over it, i guess.

anyway, thank you for reading, even if you can't help. please stay safe! wear a mask, wash your hands, etc., etc. i wish you nothing but the best. take care &lt;: )",03Sep2020,1

I always stress out and get anxious, leave it 2-3 days or sometimes an hour or two before the assignment is due. 

I have an assignment due in two days and I have some questions regarding it however my uni professor is not helping and isn’t answering them and is ignoring my messages. 

I have 0 friends in uni especially because of the whole quarantine thing. I have no one else to ask for help. 

The professor said that there is a recording of her explaining on the site but it’s literally not there, I told her and got ignored.

I know for fact my mum is cheating on my dad (found texts to another guy) i haven’t yet told my dad.

I know if I tell my dad it’s going to brake him and he most likely flip how can I stop my mum from taking everything and leaving with no money after he’s worked his ass off the last 20 years trying to provide for us just for my mum to start cheating.

422,"I‘ve never made a Reddit post a day in my life. I read the rules and I’m not quite sure if this falls into the /newtoredit category or not but I’m sorry in advance if it is. This has been the worst year of my life so far. I’m 22 currently. 9 months ago I was in the military I got kicked out due to weight issues ( coast guard if you really want to know ) and I really liked the military I loved every minute of it and never regretted it. I was honorably discharged.  Were now getting a divorce and my spouse and I have been together for 7 years now. I had a family member who passed away and because of covid I couldn’t be there. I also had another family member who died for 12 minutes but the hospital brought them back to life. This has happened a few times it was a very weird occurrence but eventually they had to put a peacemaker in them so that it wouldn’t happen again. I also found out that I was manipulated by my mother my whole life into thinking my father was a pos ( my parents are divorced ) and while I’m out here I read some things that proved my mother committed adultery while she was pregnant with me. 

So anyways the divorce. It’s kind of mutual kind of not. I hate that I love her but it’s just not the same anymore. Our romantic side of our relationship is completely done. Whenever we hang out because we’re still friends ( idk why ) we can’t stand each other more than 5 minutes. And I want to restore it but I think it’s done. I just can’t get over it. I understand that since we’re so young ( she’s 21 ) that we might want to experience different things in life that part doesn’t make me so upset. Because I also want to do new things and experience life but it just sucks. 

So I made a trip out to see family and try to relax and work on my self a bit. So I went to the Grand Canyon and that’s something her and I have talked about in the past doing together. And when I got there it was a beautiful sight but I couldn’t help to think of her. And I was really upset because that’s something we should of done it together. It made me hate her at first but when I thought about it. It made me hate that she wasn’t there with me. Experiencing what I was experiencing. What we should of experienced together. And it made me upset. 

I can’t help but to feel like a failure. I know someone might say” just get a therapist why talk to us? “ and I use to see a therapist back when I was in but since I’ve been out I haven’t received my dd-214. And unfortunately I don’t even know if I have insurance. At 22 I would of never thought of my life the way it is now.  Does anyone have advice on what I should do?",03Sep2020,1

424,"Basically as the title suggests I don’t know if I should quit my job or not. Last month my (27F) boyfriend (26M) and I moved in together, to make it easier on both of us I took a month off of work so I could organise and get the apartment somewhat normal and lived in. I had money saved for my portion of the rent and bills for when September was to roll around so I was okay with doing that. Not only that but since my job was one of the many affected by Covid-19 I still receive unemployment. Obvs since they took away the extra 600$ I don’t make as much as I was before but for me that was fine since I’m good at managing my money and have had money saved up since before COVID. However now that September has started I’ve been feeling a strong urge to quit my job. Where I used to live I was 5 minutes away and only had to wake up an hour before my shifts to be there on time; however now I have to wake up almost 2 hours earlier and drive 30 mins just to get there. I already don’t like that. I’ve been with this company for 5 years and never intended to be there this long but all of what’s been going on with COVID and my moving to another town is really forcing me to see my life in a different perspective. I want to quit to just focus on finishing school and hopefully getting a much better job but I am honestly terrified to quit. Growing up my family was homeless for awhile and a lot of times (unbeknownst to me) we had barely any money for food or to even get a hotel to shower. Because of those things I guess I have some trauma of being broke and homeless due to my wanting to quit. The idea of not going to work to get money causes me to have a small panic attack and I get super stressed out but I genuinely hate my job, I hate the way the company says one thing and does another, I hate almost all of my managers cause they think just cause they have to put in 12 hours a day then so do you even though that’s illegal, they expect all of the other full time and part time associates to give their all and basically make this job their life while they barely do anything. On top of that they allow the worst people to continue to be full time at this place just because they’ve worked there for 9+ years. They won’t even give me full time even though I know every department and am the best with customers. All in all this job not only drains me physically but it’s draining me mentally and emotionally. I feel no happiness from it yet like I used to but I’m scared to be homeless again. I know I can apply to other places and I have but the thought of continuing to work there until I get hired elsewhere just makes my anxiety even worse. I honestly don’t know what to do because the fear of being homeless again really stresses me out therefore I overwork myself but the overworking and just having to go to this job basically everyday is also stressing me out.

427,"

Backstory: My best friend invited me and my then boyfriend to come stay with her for a while, as we were homeless. My bff told me her boyfriend was renting out their second bedroom to his cousin, Derrick so we would have to sleep on a blow up bed in the living room. My first night there, I opened the garage to smoke a cigarette and at that moment Derrick was coming in to the house. I was shocked, at first because I wasn’t expecting him to be there, and then because of how handsome he was. I apologized out of habit and walked into the garage. I made it a point from that moment forward not to interact or even make eye contact with him. My boyfriend at the time was super jealous, so even looking his way would be cheating. 
The next day, I’m laying on the blow up bed while my boyfriend is making food for us in the kitchen. I hear footsteps coming down the steps, and watch Derrick wall into the kitchen out of the corner of my eye. A few moments later I feel a blanket go over me. I look up and my boyfriend walks back into the kitchen without a word. I asked him later on why he did it and he told me that Derrick had been staring at me. I didn’t believe him, because the man is gorgeous why would he be looking at me? He asked me simply why as your boyfriend would I even want to tell you that?  

Fast forward a couple years.

My friend and I have once again come back together after a fall out. I go to visit her and Derrick is staying with them again. I gained about 50 pounds, and he was out of my league when I was thinner so I just pushed any thought of him out of my mind. To protect myself from another Tyneisha Kelly “I wish you loved me” situation, I didn’t even say hello. FOR MONTHS. 

Until the day when shit got really weird. 

I used the bathroom in his room to shower at the direction of my friend but only when he wasn’t home. This particular day, I went into the bathroom and happens to notice he was running out of soap. So I took my soap downstairs. 

The next morning, after I confirmed they were gone, I went to go take a shower. When I opened the shower door, I immediately noticed my washcloth was wet. Not damp, drenched. I looked closer to see if it could have just fell and gotten wet. The closer I got I saw purple soap embedded in my washcloth. My soap is bright pink. I knew it had been used, but I figured it was his girlfriend, seeing as he knew it was my washcloth. I felt bad for her. Maybe he didn’t tell her the only white washcloth in the bathroom wasn’t his. Simple mistake, right?


I didn’t use it. I just left it there. The next day I went to shower, and my washcloth was just missing. Gone.

Weird but whatever. 

A couple days go by, and I decided to go to the casino. When I came home, I put on a song and listened to it on repeat and went to sleep. At around 5 am I heard a noise that startled me. I quickly realized it couldn’t have been from the song. I kept my eyes closed but I kept listening. Derrick usually goes to work at 5 so I figured he was getting ready and making noise. (Their house has been broken into weeks prior, so thats why I was on edge). 
 I heard a noise again. I opened my eyes this time, listening. I didn’t hear anything. I waited for a minute or so, before I propped myself up on my hands. 

Suddenly from my feet, I see him dart out of the room and into the garage. All I could say was “OH SHIT!”. 

Then it clicked, that a robber/murderer/cannibal  would have went out the front door, not the garage. 

It sank in further that my friend had a no shoes rule for the house. Which meant for him to just run out to the garage, he already had his shoes on.

And I had been listening so he made an effort for me not to hear him.

I drew three conclusions. Either he likes me, was planning to kill me, or was trying to steal cigarettes. Then I remembered he makes allot of money. 

I decided to ask him about my washcloth and hope for a chance to ask for an explanation. 

So the next day he was in the garage and I asked “Excuse me, have you seen my washcloth?”.

He told me he had it for me upstairs, and that when he came back he would bring it to me. Never did. 

I waited until 3pm the next day, still nothing. So I go up to his room and ask again. He tells me he just put in the washer, and that it should be out in 45 minutes. 
He tells me he washed it because it fell in the shower and he felt bad. He’ll bring it to me when it washed. 


45 minutes later, he tell me the “bath stuff” will be upstairs. I go upstairs and there is a stack of washcloths none of them mine. He gave me his washcloth to use....

I just decided to leave the situation alone, but it’s bugging me. Please any insight will help.",03Sep2020,1
428,"I have general anxiety that rarely flairs up, ever. Generally, a thing that makes them flair up without failure, are conspiracy theories. With my dad being a conservative in his 40s, I am exposed to many conspiracies, very often. The most recent ones that actually trigger the anxiety, are NWO conspiracies in particular. 

I don't have the money for therapy, and I personally choose not to medicate my anxiety, since I do not wish to grow dependent on the medications. Are there ways to stop this anxiety? Are there ways that these can easily be disproven  so I can easily get rid of the associated anxiety by convincing myself these things aren't real?

As for the seemingly ridiculous secondary question, a lot of these conspiracies somehow have something to do with Bill Gates. They specifically have to do with micro chipping, and a specific TED Talk that Gates did about reducing population. I find myself going back to that specific TED Talk, and the comments on it are a cesspit of conspiracy theorists, who make my anxiety raise tenfold.

431,"I’m terrified..

I’ve been struggling to find a place of my own with my husband due to one income at minimum wage, and we have bad credit scores. He works and I stay home to take care of our baby.

I’ve thought about working but my 10 month old can’t be separated from me for longer than an hour. She gets really anxious, cries constantly to the point of exhaustion and starves herself if I’m away too long. 

It’s been a struggle due to my current living conditions. Im staying in a room at my husbands aunts house and he’s not even allowed to stay there because she doesn’t want men living there so he lives back at his parents house. He’s been paying my rent there, and only visits for a few hours a day due to work and the curfew placed at the house.

One of his aunts daughters, let’s call her AD, is mildly autistic and has a few mental health issues. 6 months ago AD started bullying me and my daughter on a daily basis out of the blue, AD wasn’t always like this.. she was nice to me and would always want to play with my daughter.. but now AD hates us and has been tormenting us. She would leave me hateful and violent notes on the fridge, say violent things out loud for me to hear, like how she wishes she could hit me and my baby. She’s called me a lot of nasty names, AD has even intentionally cut herself so she can wipe her blood all over my baby’s washcloths in the bathroom.. its happened 4 times. I’ve told her mother about it but I don’t think she’s done much.. she always said “I’ll talk to her” but things kept happening.

The thing is, I’m diagnosed with a few mental illnesses including depression, so this has been taking a huge toll on my mental health.. I started seeing a therapist weekly now and it’s still not enough.. I’ve been crying on a daily basis, I’m barely eating and it messed with my milk supply, I’m not producing much and I’ve been struggling to produce more. I’ve been extremely depressed.. 

Two days ago I heard AD saying things about my baby and then heard her say she wanted to chop their head off, and I assume shes talking about my daughter.  I tell her mother and she replies with “she’s in her room, she’s not bothering anyone.” I get upset and go back to my room and start crying.  I’m emotional and I text AD’s mom telling her I’m going to look for a shelter because I can’t handle it anymore.

A few hours ago AD’s mother comes to me and tells me that she doesn’t appreciate me saying her house is a hellhole and that it’s worse than a shelter, when I didn’t say that?.. and tells me I need to leave at the end of the month. She tells me that the past few months she’s had to take her daughter to therapy as if I’m the cause?

I didn’t do a thing to her or her daughter. I’ve been trying my best to get along with everyone here and AD started tormenting me 6 months ago for something I didn’t even do. I found out in group therapy with the family that she hates me because my husband was yelling during thanksgiving and that never happened. She made it up. So she hates me for something not only I didn’t even do, but something she made up in her head and I feel upset because her mom tried to justify it and her behavior.. then makes me feel like it’s my fault her daughters in therapy, but her daughter has been in therapy way before I’ve even met them.. so it’s just more nonsense to make me feel bad.

I’m being forced out now with 28 days notice, and I have no where to go. I have no friends, and my parents won’t let me stay with them. My dad was never in my life and neglected me for his girlfriend, my mother wants to be alone, My husbands parents don’t want me there because they want to have the freedom to walk around in their underwear.

I feel so defeated.. I can’t get help with a hotel for a few weeks unless I get a written eviction notice and AD’s mom won’t write one. I’m scared to go to a shelter because of this pandemic.. I don’t want my baby to be in a shelter or out on the streets..

443, I grew up pretty normal. my parents are very wealthy individuals with a lot of success in smart investments into stocks and starting businesses. 3 months ago they had a long talk with me about life and how it is hard and how it is unforgiving and i'm pretty smart i know how harsh this world can be. anyways they continued to talk about how their time was coming and they just wanted me to be set for generations on generations and carry the last name out(1st gen immigrants). They said they will be giving me this large sum of money this coming week and I am very grateful and appreciative but also shocked because they are both 43m and 44f. I don't understand? like this money I can do whatever I want. Life is cool has its up and downs but I actually just want to play video games and continue streaming and growing my fan base. I'm not the smartest person in the world but I've always been smart with my allowance. I bought my first dream car with my allowance at the age of 17. I just don't know what to do I'm in shock. I know life as getting your financial shit straight then have a family but I'm 20 I'm not ready for a family or even want a girlfriend. I just don't know what to do.

447,"This whole situation is very confusing and involves a lot moving parts, so here we go:

There's this girl, at my very cliquey, shallow high school (I'm starting my last year), and she is very popular, albeit quite stuck-up/mean girl material. Very ""easy on the eyes"", as the saying goes. Long, blonde hair, clear green eyes, high cheekbones, slim, hourglass figure, everything, but was also really stuck up and bratty. Pre-quarantine, she was a cheerleader, played sports, had a lot of supposed friends that she hung out with, and all. 
However, during quarantine, she gained about 30-40 pounds, lost contact with a lot of friends, got kicked off cheerleading, and other sports (this was basically her life plan), and stopped posting on social media. She reaches out to me and a couple of other people who knew her, but didn't talk to her often before. She needs a lot of emotional support when having a breakdown (Example: She saw a recent picture of one of her former friends, and basically went on a rant about losing weight). 
On one hand, she seems very set on losing weight, which means she'd most likely revert back to her old ways. However, she's had to do college applications, and everything's closed, so she's been stuck at a desk all day mostly eating, which only fuels her breakdowns. Going from 10,000 steps to 500 can't be healthy. Couple that with the frequent eating of junk food (she was used to eating sweets and not having it affect her because of her athletics) She’s got a bit of an ego crisis going on now that she’s well-overweight. Maybe she'll be humbled by this, but then again, she was planning on going to university using her athletic record. Guess that’s all out the window. 
I’m not sure whether she’s reaching out to me simply to be validated or because she actually has nowhere to turn. This is all very confusing. 
Is this her denying her own reality because she simply can't believe what's happened? Is this her way of coping? Is this whole situation karma? What should I do? What should she do?",03Sep2020,1

So I [20M] am currently a junior in college studying engineering and I feel stuck. During the pandemic and taking classes on Zoom, I feel depressed for the first time in my life and I'm not sure what to do about it. My days just consist of being on my laptop or phone constantly, then taking a walk in the evening for an hour and then staying up late at night binging tv shows. I don't really have a passion for anything, not even engineering. I'm just studying it because I don't know any other profession that would suit me. As of right now, I'm even sick of learning which is stupid to me because after graduation, I want to get a master's degree. I'm really not sure what to do to get more excited about school or how to get out of this rut I'm in or how to find a passion for something.

If anyone has experienced anything similar to this and has advice or even has some general life advice, I could really use it right now.

453,"Ok so it's not a big dilemma but it is actually negatively affecting my health. Basically I live in an area that gets around 100+ outside so we constantly have the ac going. At my apartment, one of my housemates has anaemia and likes to crank the ac up to 79 or 80 out of nowhere (I.e doesnt turn on until it's that temp inside).  I have had a couple conversations with her explaining that if it's too hot, I get really sick to my stomach so we talked and agreed on 76. 

As she explained, ""you like 75, I like 77, so we can compromise"". Which I thought was totally fine. Problem is, she just goes and changes it, cranking it back up again to 79, so I wake up in the middle of the night about to throw up because of the heat. To add, my dog also wakes up panting because she is a breed with a thick coat, so obviously way too warm. 

She has a literal space heater if she got cold in her room, and I thought we had agreed on keeping it down. Plus I offered to pay extra ac electricity or something. Am I being crazy??? Is 79 the normal temp?? We dont have any other issues, but this one is serious enough that it's making me want to stay away from my own apartment, because she even turned the ac off when she left and I came back to the house being 84, WITH HER CAT INSIDE. So like..... how can I fix this?? Any advice is greatly appreciated. TIA!",03Sep2020,1
454,"I am considering ghosting a friend. I use the word ""friend"" loosely here, as we have only known each other a few months. First, some background.

I am a high school student, as is my friend. Let's call him Peter. We met a few weeks before quarantine started, exchanged numbers, and eventually bonded in quarantine by playing online games and exchanging memes. Peter was slightly off from the moment we met. Nothing creepy or dangerous at all, just really awkward and socially inept. A little too casual about serious topics, including death, suicide, etc. Didn't have many friends, and besides me, all of his friends treated him very poorly.

I'm a more outgoing type. I play sports, socialize with a lot of people, etc. I never really wanted to be seen as a stereotypical jock, and always did my best to empathize with people. Despite this, I find it really  difficult to spend time and connect with people who are largely worse off than me or have limited social skills/interests. I do feel bad about this sometimes and wonder if I'm too selfish and superficial. 

Though I didn't much enjoy spending extended amounts of time with Peter, I was willing to play games with him for about an hour every day. It was clear that he really enjoyed playing with me and had never been treated with basic respect by his friends before.

Yesterday, out of the blue, Peter revealed to me that he has suicidal thoughts on a regular basis, and has for some time. Then, before I could come up with a proper reply, he was asking me if what game I wanted to play today. He said all of this as casually as if he was telling me that he went to a new restaurant the other night. It's hard to describe, but he basically said; ""Hey man, how's it going? Me? Ah, I just told my mom about my suicidal thoughts this morning. Yeah, I've been thinking about that stuff for a while. I think I'm depressed. Anyway, are you in the mood for TF2 or Fortnite today?""

To be honest, I initially thought it was another one of his morbid jokes until he insisted that he was not joking, and had been considering killing himself for several years. I am not good at interracting with emotional or mentally disturbed people. I'm constantly worried about saying the wrong thing or accidentally making someone feel worse. Fortunately, no one close to me has ever committed suicide. If they did, I would probably feel partially responsible in some way.

My life has been going really well lately. My grades have improved significantly, I learned to drive, I have many healthy and positive friendships, and I'm exploring career paths. I don't have the time or energy to spend multiple hours a day trying to fix Peter's life. At the same time, I would feel absolutely horrible if anything happened to him, especially if I could have potentially done anything to prevent it. I'm a bit ashamed to admit that my first instinct is to lose his number and focus on myself right now. I don't get any enjoyment or pleasure from this friendship, and haven't since the beginning. It would be much easier, and I'd never have to look back. I could assume that Peter would get better, and live a long, happy, healthy life.

And then I feel like a terrible person. Worst case scenario, I'm basically saying that two hours in my day are more important than Peter's life. Maybe I'm overestimating my impact on his life. Maybe it wouldn't make a noticeable difference if I suddenly cut all contact. Regardless, I'm not sure if I want to take that chance.

I'm not equipped to deal with this, nor do I want to, but I also feel like I would be abandoning Peter.

Sorry if I'm overthinking this or if it's just typical teenage drama. I'm conflicted about what to do, and would like another perspective. Thanks if you read this far.

TL:DR: My newest friend is suicidal. I am not equipped to help him in the way he needs, and I'm considering ending the friendship.",03Sep2020,1

461," I was just out of this darkness now I feel as if I’m going back down. But now I’m bringing other people down with me. I’m currently in the days leading up to it part and no one knows. Idek what this feeling is called too... 

What it feels like...

I care but it feels like I’m not caring. 
I hear but it feels like a memory or a dream. 
It’s like an out of body experience. 
Not deja vu. But like a dream. A veil? Almost. 
It feels off. I usually can’t feel anything but mainly my legs and face. I once slapped my self hard enough for it to echo but didn’t feel a thing. 

The days leading up to that I wasn’t hungry so I didn’t eat for a couple of days. Maybe three days. I would want to/ know I’d have to but the thought of eating made me feel sick to my stomach. But I felt fine.

In the middle of not feeling I would just eat and eat and eat and eat. Then just sleep. I went out to dinner with my friends AR and A. And I was just quiet. They had to ask multiple MULTIPLE times if I was okay. I smiled and said of course and made up a random thought that made everyone laugh. I laughed. Kinda. It felt fake. I couldn’t even tell my facial expressions anymore. I didn’t understand jokes I tried too but I didn’t. I just laughed to seem normal or the same. I guess? I just ended up staring for HOURS on my phone sometimes not really blinking until my contacts went out of focus. I didn’t feel it go out of focus but I saw it. I couldn’t even pop my knee I couldn’t feel it pop I heard it but that’s all. And I always pop my knee basically on command. I would hold conversations but not remember most of it. And I kept thinking to myself what’s going on rn. Am I breathing? What are the talking about? Should I just try and get on the subject and talk so I don’t seem weird? All I did was lay down. And sit. And space out staring on my phone. It felt like everything was on auto pilot. I did the same things I would normally do but not remember it or even feel it? I now even have nail marks on my palm from not knowing how hard I was gripping stuff. I guess? I put on a little makeup not even feeling it. I stabbed my eye with a mascara wand and I didn’t even feel it and it didn’t make me tear up. I pinched my eyelid while curling my lashes and I didn’t feel it. I was helping A unload the dishwasher freshly steamed as well and A’s hand turned RED and burned. I held it for a good couple of minutes until I felt the heat. I felt as if I wasn’t there at all. Like my brain just shut off most if not all senses. I pet my dogs and couldn’t feel their fur. Like it was soft but not normal. A and my uncle hugged me and it felt like an imprint or ghost almost. 

For some reason if I stay up drinking two energy drinks and two adderalls and vaping and drawing I started to feel again. I’m sleepy but I’m scared to sleep. I don’t want to not feel again. I missed it way too much. Am I broken?",03Sep2020,1
462,"One of my best friends, and the only girl I have ever felt genuine love for since day one of the 17 years we've known each other almost admited she loved me and I think I fucked it up. I would marry her tomorrow, no exaggeration. 

Below is the transcript of our conversation, what do I do now? 



Me: Hey man, I just wanted to let you know I count you as one of best friends, and have nothing but the highest respect for you. Your the only person Ive felt hasnt looked down on me. If you need anything, let me know, day or night. I appreciate you.

Her:Why would I ever look down on you?

M:Everyone does 🤷 I get no respect from people.
M:Except you oc

H:I can’t speak for others but I can speak for me and that’s I know you better sometimes than you know yourself. You’re amazing and you definitely care about your kids first.

M:God, I love you. Thank you for being you, my life would be much more difficult without you in it. Goddamn im all emotional and shit.

H:I feel in being bam boozled. Like what you just said isn’t real.

Break for 10 min while texting and erasing it multiple times, so I became anxious

M:What do you mean?

After 14 min of constant texting this is what she wrote

H: Just I know you and I know life and nobody is perfect. Things happen and you can’t control everything even with the best of intentions. Unfortunately I feel it’s  us/ those people that want to see better in others, we want t be the one that helps them but when we cant it’s best to not sink to their level. We get abused and taken advantage of. And that’s one thing when it comes to us but another when it evolves our kids. That’s why I’m so set against you just taking shit from (ex name redacted). As a parent We want to believe she’d be there but from the very start she to me seemed like she was only out for her. Before you two actually had beautiful children that btw are super cute I knew she wouldn’t be there but I needed to make sure you made your own choices. But to me she was vile but you have 2 beautiful kids from that so be thankful but because of that you have to protect them. For some reason that is now life.

What do you think? What do I do? I cant ruin our friendship by making a move if she really isnt interested in me, she means the world to me.",03Sep2020,1
463,"Okay so to give a little background, I’m in a relationship with a guy - we were together for 2 years, then I broke up with him for 6 months because he was being too controlling. We got back together last March after he promised to be better. I haven’t seen him since March because of the pandemic, so we’ve been doing long distance. He loves me very much.

I recently met up with a friend, and he brought along another friend. Let’s call that friend Mark. Mark texted me afterwards, asking to hang out at his place to get to know me better. I asked if there would be anyone else, and he said he was thinking of something one-on-one. I told him I had a boyfriend, and he replied with a gif of Barney from himym saying “nooooo.” Lol. He asked if we can be friends, and I said of course! We both decided to bring another friend and continue with the hang out in a couple days. 

I actually met Mark around a year and a half ago, while I was still with my current bf. We went to a bar with some friends, and he constantly told me how beautiful I was and bought me many drinks. When I asked him why he was doing this even though I had a bf, he said he was “planting the seed” lmao. I guess it worked because I’m so confused about how to feel rn.

I love my boyfriend, but the distance and different timezones is really affecting me. I don’t even know when I’ll see him again — it might be in January, or even later. I feel myself getting attracted to Mark.

So I have 2 questions: first, is Mark still into me despite having a bf? Or do guys in general stop flirting once they find out a girl is taken? And second, do you think it’s okay to eventually hang out and get to know him one-on-one? What if my boyfriend doesn’t let me, but I really want to?

465,"This was first posted in r/teachers, but I thought I should post it here too. My apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

I'm a third year university student in the Netherlands (but most of my courses are in English), and in this year we have the opportunity to pick the majority of our courses ourselves. Becoming a teacher has always sounded interesting to me, so a course called ""Scholars in the Classroom"" quickly caught my eye. This is basically a course about the different roles a teacher needs to fulfill, such as a 'mediator' or 'pedagogue.' We also need to prepare mini lessons and present those to our classmates, followed by a visit to our local high school. I didn't really look at the course overview before signing up for the course (which might have been a mistake), I was just happy to have found some courses that i liked and fit into my schedule.

About a week ago, the final course guide was published, so that was the first time I really started looking at what this course entails and what assignments I need to do throughout the semester. This is where my anxiety came in, and it hit hard. I've always struggled with social anxiety, especially around people my age, for some reason, but this is honestly worse than anything I have ever experienced before. I guess it has suddenly dawned upon me that I will actually have to *teach* (aka present, which I hate) during this course.

I have my first class in an hour and I'm scared. My hands are shaking, I'm a sweaty mess, and I have a raging headache. What makes this even worse is that this course is the only in-person course I'm taking, so I can't really ""hide"" by turning off my webcam.

This is where I need your advice: Should I drop out of the course while I still can and find another one that I like? Or should I just persevere and push through for the rest of the semester? Are there maybe other teachers or student teachers who are dealing with (social) anxiety? Any advice is welcome, because I'm not sure what to do.",03Sep2020,1

I've posted about my situation in another subreddit but it got removed and the general comments I got were helpful at first but now I'm back in this hole and I don't know where to go from here.

Basically my best friend and I used to work in the same company and he was accused of sexually harrasing someone. Instead of taking his side, I didn't do anything during the internal investigation - as a matter of fact I helped the girl who accused him to go to HR and give her statement. Later it turned out to be a false claim.

When this whole situation started I told him what I did and why I did it and he said he didn't want to talk to me anymore because I should know him by now. When it turned out to be false I called him and tried to apologize but he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Yesterday I found out that he quit because he doesn't feel welcome at work anymore and he feels betrayed by a lot of people (but I think he mainly means me).

Last time I saw him in person was a few months ago and I miss him. I love having him around me, the things we do are so much fun. I just want the old days back but I feel like I will never have that again. I miss hearing about his thoughts, I want to tell him my thoughts while we sit around somewhere in the city. My life is so dull right now and I hate it. I just feel like there is nothing I can do that would work for us to be best friends again. It feels like I've lost a family member. I wake up and I cry, I can't sleep because I cry. I can't continue my daily life like this. I'm just a mess.

I don't know if you can give me advice at all but I just thought I should ask, what would you do to ease the pain? Maybe there is something to distract me. I don't know.

So one day I got an unknown message from a guy who later showed up to be a relative of my mother's friend. He wrote about how he got interested and wanted to chat with me and meet me irl. I was not doing well at the moment but I was still up to meet a new people.
First I thought that just two mothers decided to ship us or whatever. I found it funny. And after all he had a living place, maybe a good budget, he loved animals and everything looked perfect..except for him. And no, my mom didn't seemed to know much about him. 

It started by him pushing me into meeting at weekend. And even though I found it very badly planned, the very next day he arrived to my hometown, which I picked as a place. We spend time by chatting and even when this was fun, something was off. He wanted to act like a gentleman but I guess I was not used to it. It was late night and when we were about to split our ways, he decided to escort me to my house. I didn't like it at all. In front of my house when I just wanted to go home, he was having this """" flirty """" talk but it felt like a talking with a kid. Then he wanted at least a kiss. Ok. And wanted my phone number, which I didn't give him to this day. 

I said to myself that nothing will come out of this. From that day he wouldn't stop asking me to meet again, to have fun together he wants to chat with me everyday, he gets very upset when I don't answer and after I told him at least 3 times that I don't any relationship will come out of this, he said okay but he didn't stop. Still here stuck with ""When we meet again"" ""Have I done something wrong? ""

478,"Things are doing great for me. The pandemic really changed me for the better. It introduces me to a lot of new hobbies like learning a new language, drawing, watching foreign films, and reading books. Been friendly and productive since.

But when my parents (M57) (F42) suggested me to go online schooling. Right of the bat, I knew it would be a bad idea. I hate online schooling. I'd rather self-educate myself. At least with the topics, I want to learn like biology.

I tried convincing them that I will gonna skip school until the pandemic is over. They won't budge. They say, “School is an important part of your life”, “You think you can live yourself out there by yourself”, “You can’t just sit there doing nothing for 1 year” (Tried to explain that this will not waste my one year cause this will actually benefit my future but of course they won’t budge).

They tried to put me on my favorite college but it was too expensive. I convinced them to just let me be an autodidact but they won't quit. It was really late.

I tried to adapt and just accept I'm gonna do this stupid online schooling but the thing is, the school is very religious. I'm gay (still closeted) and an atheist. I thought I am free to the uncomfortable feeling I always get last 10 years and gonna go to a school that isn't religious and just normal. My last school was also pretty religious, I pretended to be a person that I don't know for 10 years.  I tried to pretend to do their practices. 

Not only that, but my first day of classes is pretty depressing. They've been meeting through Zoom for a week now and I was dumped with tons of homework and that I need to catch up but I can't. That alone gave me depression. Every meeting I've attended to Zoom is shit. I tried so hard to concentrate but I am sitting in my room where my creativity flows. This is where I draw, I read books, I watch movies, and self-educate. I feel too comfortable that I think different things and not focusing on the topic being taught and sometimes thinking different things made me cry cause I also can't focus on my creative mind. I feel like a prisoner in my own room.

I'm not saying that I don't want to learn. I really want to pursue my dreams. It's just, not this way.  I want to be in a classroom where I am uncomfortable, all ears to my teacher, make friends, and maybe some actual chat with the teacher alone if I don’t really get the topic.

I never felt being depressed in my whole life. I skipped my class. I’m always not in the mood to do my new hobbies. It’s just me crying and being overwhelmed that this will be me for one year. I can consider dropping out since I've been only starting for a week but I'm also not gonna be happy cause all the efforts of my parents pampering me to go to this school will be just a waste of time and money.

I just wanna disappear.  If I don't fix this, my anxiety, depression, and procrastination will gonna multiply, thus drowning and suffocating.

For all of these days. I cope with browsing Reddit for cat videos that actually make me happy for all this week, lying down my bed. Frequently crying. I haven't touched my Duolingo app for awhile. I feel like shit and I really don't what I'm gonna do at this point. I joked about having suicidal thoughts frequently and thinking about getting out of this town and just rest and cope in a hotel or my family's friend's house for a month.",03Sep2020,1
479,"His main interest is sports(not playing but watching etc). Spends most of his free time watching TV. He has never played video games or anything like that but my first thought was something along the lines of football manager but he has no computer and from what I understand that is a pc only game(are there any alternatives on console?). Another idea is to get him a used console and fifa or NHL or something like that but I'm not sure he would enjoy it. I'm not interested in sports but interested in gaming, so it's hard for me to imagine if that, or what, would be a good fit for him.

I shut down after that and wasn't even able to message my friends. I cut contact with all of my friends.

My girlfriends found out I lost my dad after about two months. Surprisingly, they were not angry and were very supportive.

6 months after his death, I moved to another country for my studies.

A few weeks ago, I spoke to 2 of my friends about him.

One of them, my (F)best friend told me how when they found out about my dad, my girlfriends came to my house to see me. I was not at home; it was the first time I went out after my dad's death and I was at the movies.

My girlfriends spoke to my mum, who told them I had shut down after my dad's death. 

I never actually realised she had noticed anything.

We never talked about my dad while I was still home and still don't now that I'm far away.

I now realise I need to talk about him with my mum. I realise I never really grieved how I should and want to do that with my mum. She's back in my home country so I only talk via the internet with her.

485,"So the thing is, I really need to stand up to my dad. I have lost people because of him, opportunities, amazing things in my life because he says no and it all just immediately goes away. 
He is extremely emotionally abusive and my mom enables his behaviour and guilt trips me into sharing things with her and being nice to both of them. 
I have recently (because of some things I have worked really hard for my entire life) gotten a very competitive job. I'm still in training for a 30-day period, but its paid training and I am so excited to work here. The salary is good, I work from home and it is one of my 3 dream jobs. 
However, my dad makes me work for him at their firm. Whenever I have something else to do (hanging out with friends, doing work for college, meeting with professors for my dissertation) he will sometimes not allow it because he ""wants to be able to count on me"" for the firm. I must say the firm would do fine without me, there is literally no problem of that, he just wants someone to work extreme hours (up to 12 hours a day) for free or very little money. 
He literally 5 minutes ago yelled at me for telling him that I'm working on my disertation paper saying I need to go to work, saying that he can't ""count on me"" and I need to ""let him know how much work I will be missing"". 
I have to tell him about this new job and figure out what to do if he doesn't ""allow it"". I also have to tell him that I am planning on visiting my boyfriend for a few days (he doesn't respect my boyfriend or agree with him because he s actually a good person who s working his ass off alongside me to get the money so we can move together and I can escape this). 
I am afraid I won't be able to leave this situation unless I learn that standing up to my dad won't kill me. How do I do it? How do I just accept that my life is mine and the choices to make are also mine, whether it's where to work, who to love or what time to come home at night?",03Sep2020,1

Turns out, however, he's been attracted to my very underage sister, and has been grooming her this whole time.

And she's buying it. She told me they're already in a relationship. I found out just now through TEXT. My UNDERAGE SISTER is dating AN ADULT MAN, and I find out through text.

Of course he gave the whole groomer bullshit spiel ""I don't want to fuck you until you're legal"" and shit like that, but I don't believe that for a second.

He's planning to move to a new city by the year's end, but I'd say that's his escape plan. He's gonna lull her into a false sense of security, pull his shit, and leave before she has the confidence to tell me or anyone else.

I don't have proof of them kissing or anything yet, so I can't report him, and I trust that my sister hasn't done anything sexual with him, so no forensics could prove anything either.

491,"I’ve made a few posts in r/raisedbynarcissists and other subs talking about my mother’s repeated emotional abuse towards me (including forcing me to present as female despite knowing that I’m a trans man) and extreme gaslighting. I fully intend to cut her off when I move back into university accommodations for the second year of my undergraduate degree. I have contacts there, people in positions of authority, who are aware of the abuse and who I can confide in and trust to help me. I’ve taken photos of the belongings I can’t take with me, for insurance purposes. I also have some friends who’ve offered to help me find employment over the summer of 2021 so I can earn enough money to get my own place. I also have a long distance girlfriend who’s kindly offered to take me in after I graduate. 

But the point is, as I’m trying to get as much support in place as possible, I am also wondering if I can get local law enforcement involved as well. My mother has also verbally abused me in the past and things turned physical three years ago, when she forcefully shaved off my facial hair and left my skin sore for hours. I am just trying to find out if the things she’s done are legally wrong as well as morally. Forcing a trans man to present as his assigned gender at birth, extensive gaslighting and manipulation and also threatening to take legal action against my girlfriend just because she’d never met her and accusing her of being a pedophile (even though she’s younger than me) are among the things my mother has done to me. 

Should I talk to the police about this? For the record I’m also 20 years old and have some chronic physical health conditions, dyspraxia and am showing all of the trademark symptoms of complex PTSD (will have a proper psychiatric evaluation soon).

Let me give you a bit of context. We are both in our mid 20's, he is a graphic designer and he really likes it. He always like to draw and stuff and he is pretty good at it in my opinion. Yesterday he received a feedback email from a client that was really bad. The email started like ""I looked over what you sent me and closed it immediately. Are you really a graphic designer?""

This affected him a lot to the point that he called his boss and said that he is gonna finish this project and after he should fire him since he is a shitty graphic designer and can't do things right. After he calmed down a bit he talked to the boss again and he agreed that the client was way out of line and everything was fine.

Like I said, he is very passionate about the work and he is very good at it but every time he gets a bit of negative feedback he just looses all confidence in his abilities. I want to be there for him and help him become more confident but I honestly have no idea how. I was always very confident to the point of arrogance so I don't really understand why would you respond like that to negative feedback. I told him that when you do something wrong, get negative feedback, or even fail something you just say ""Ok, its fine, now i know what to do next time"" and move on. But he said that he can't do that, he just gets fixated on the mistake and then remembers other mistakes and then thinks that he can't do anything right.

My brother, for the past four years, believes that the government is actively spying on him and making his life miserable. Whenever he has conversations about this and suddenly hears distant sirens, he'll start writing his words down on a paper for me to read in fear that the government is tapping into his home while he speaks. 

I only believed this to be an odd quirk about him until last night. My dad tested positive for covid-19 and has been dealing with some severe symptoms. I called my brother to inform him and he went ballistic. He screamed at my mom over the phone, who also tested positive for covid two weeks ago, stating, ""I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU. THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO KILL US BECAUSE WE'RE BLACK. HOW CAN YOU GUYS STILL NOT BE SURE."" He apparently smashed his phone after my mom tried to end the conversation.

He came and argued that we were all too stupid to understand how these coincidences keep happening. I'm 21, while he's a college graduate in his 40s, so he constantly belittles my knowledge whenever we debate, even though his arguments don't come with any concrete evidence.

This is going to sound awfully mean, but currently she’s quite reserved, overly-sensible and rather plain/vanilla. However, she has a burning desire to be “out there” and to NEVER be seen as the boring one. We’ve had countless conversations about how she thinks she’s the plain/boring one in our friendship group and she doesn’t want to be that person. 

Frankly she is incredibly plain. She’s so intelligent and got an amazing personality but she really does need a glow up. She’s got the type of her that was once blonde but has turned to a mousy-brown/grey that is incredibly frizzy and out of control. I’ve asked her why she doesn’t straighten it/dye it and she says it’s because she can’t be bothered/runs out of time/thinks it makes her hair flat and she tries to get natural highlights in it in the sunlight. This does not work. It will not work. Even my boyfriend has said “she’s got such a pretty face, if she could change her hair it would be so amazing for her.” I understand that she is perfectly entitled to have her hair her own way and shouldn’t feel pressured to change it but how can I at least recommend a cute hair glow up without being rude about her current hair? May I also add she is already pretty insecure of her hair as well. 

The other thing she could do is glow up her style. She’s not fat by any means but not entirely skinny. She can be very insecure of her body and always dresses comfortably over fashionably. I completely understand this as I have the same issue, however I know for a fact she feels even more insecure that when with my friends and I she is the most underdressed and doesn’t look as good as the rest of us (she’s told me this). On a girls night out, we will all wear short dresses where as she will wear black jeans and a loose white t-shirt slightly tied up at the front. If she can she’ll wear a jacket over the top. There are SO many options of slightly bigger girls to dress up their curvy assets instead of hide them while also being comfortable. Cycling shorts and a matching short, cropped pretty top would look so good on her. A pretty long sleeved kimono too would allow her to cover up if she’s uncomfortable. How can I go about giving her these ideas?? I do feel as though she’d really appreciate the advice but I don’t want to put her current look down in any way.

508,"I know this is probably going to be confusing because most people don’t understand cheerleading levels but I’ll try my best to explain as simply as possible. 

So, each cheer team has a level 1-7. There are two main parts of a routine that are stunting and tumbling. An athlete could have really good stunting skills, let’s say they can do level 5 stunts but they can only tumble to level 3, they might be put anywhere in between depending on the coaches decision. 

Last season I was on a level 3 team that was going to compete internationally which corona ruined. Personally I can stunt to level 3/4 but I can only tumble level 1 and I’m working on level 2. 

Fast forward to this seasons try outs and placements. 

Another important thing to note was I had voiced my concern about being on a team with this one girl who made last season miserable for me which my coaches could see and understood too. 

So, I got put on the level 1 team, no international competition for me. I already can tumble level 1 so I will improve the quality of these but I don’t think I’ll learn anything new. I can do level 1 stunts with my eyes closed so I’m worried my stunt level will decline since I won’t be able to practice higher level. 

There is no level 2 team. It’s literally either be on level 1 or be on a team with a girl that makes cheer miserable for me. 

Originally I was happy I was away from her now I feel like I’m almost being punished. I’m devastated. I feel awful. 

I know I should probably talk to my coaches but I have no idea how to broach it because I feel I’ve already been such a pain because of the situation with that girl.

Getting closer to the date of my wife's birthday my MIL's sister ended up in hospital so MIL couldn't make all the meals that were needed, She didn't tell me or my wife(We didn't find out until after the party this conversation happened)  this but created a Facebook group chat to see if someone could help her with the meals, My SIL agreed to do so, But she even never told me she was help her mother, MIL gave her a few of the meals recipes and SIL bought the ingredients, except the ones that were actually important, I mean this is fucked up really she knows about my wife can't  have regularly dairy it still felt like she could put it in the dish.

My wife,s birthday came around and everyone seemed to be having fun, When it came to eat my SIL told my wife she should try the food she had made for the party so my wife did, 45 minutes later while we had all moved back into the living room I realised my wife wasn't eating and she was doubled over clutching her stomach like she was in pain, When I asked her what was wrong, She looked at her sister and asked her what was in the food, FIL then said. ""I hope you followed the recipe right"". And all my SIL said was ."" I followed the recipe right"", MIL then asked her if she even bothered with the right ingredients and all SIL said was. "" I put REAL dairy in there I was doing you a favour"". I then screamed at her how it seemed right when my wife was down on the floor in a lot of pain, SIL repeated herself again not caring at all she had made her sister sick, both my parents and MIL and FIL continued to argue with her and how this wan't right a lot of our friends also said a few things to SIL about, SIL failed to admit fault and starts screaming people should be thankful she even helped out.

 By this point my wife is practically in tears from the pain so I had to pick her up and carry up stairs to our bedroom and put her to bed so she could rest a bit so the pain could subside.

I went back down stairs and kicked everyone out I was pissed off and this arguing was not helping it was only ruining the party more, as SIL was leaving she kept going on about us being grateful, and I could think was 'grateful for what'

Since my wife's birthday my wife has ignored any rude messages from her sister and blocked her on socials, other family members who weren't at my wife's birthday now know and SIL has stated to them she was trying to ""help"" because even though this is something my wife has dealt with her whole life SIL thinks she will out grow it which is why she did what she did.

I think it's a lie anytime in the past anyone has brought up preparing different meals for my wife at a gathering SIL always says "" she could have out grown it though"".

I feel like she pretty much has poisoned my wife (even though that probably sounds stupid). Would it sound stupid if I wanted to tell my wife I want to NC with SIL after this?",03Sep2020,1
512,"So I need some advice. A little backstory first. My Grandmother had Alzheimers Disease and came to live with us, for several years, before my Mom got sick. I was 16 at that time. Taking care of my Grandmother got to be too much for her so her 3 other siblings stepped in. She would spend one week each month with one of her four children for 2 years until she started to get confused and they decided it was best for her to go to a nursing home. She needed permanency somewhere. During this time, her house was sold and the money was used towards her care. She passed in 2007 and a small portion of the money left was distributed to the four children. The remaining was kept in an account to be paid out little by little to her children, just enough so they didn't have to pay taxes. My Aunt was the primary and my Mother was the secondary. My Mother got sick in 2009 and ended up passing away after 6 months. Well, after she passed, we discovered that the account still had $16,000 in it. We found this out by going to the bank to see what accounts my Mother had for probate court. We checked the account again, a week later, only to discover that my Aunt had completely drained it and never said a word to us. The money was distributed amongst the three surviving siblings and again, nothing was said to my brother and I. My two Uncle's  know that we know about the money, but my Aunt doesn't. I feel like she stole $4,000 from our Mother, and us!! Had my Mother been alive, she would have gotten her portion of the money, so why didn't it go to us? My Mother never would have done this to my Aunt's children!! I know it's been almost 11 years but I'm starting to get more and more angry about it!! When my Grandmother's house was sold, my Aunt got everything!! Her furniture, keepsakes, everything because she said she would ""store it all"", but no one ever saw any of it again. The one thing she didn't get was my Grandmother's wedding ring. My Mother had that, and now I do. My Aunt has cussed me out multiple times about that ring, most recently this past Monday. I think that's why I'm getting so mad. She said my Mother stole that ring when my Grandmother actually gave it to her. My Mother and my Aunt did not get along well!! I have wanted to say something to her so badly about that $4,000 but I've kept my mouth shut and it is eating away at me!!! My Brother was so pissed off about it that he hasn't spoken to our family since 2010!! Also, keep in mind that my Aunt will proudly flaunt the fact that she is a multimillionaire!! I want to say so badly ""You'll get the damn ring when you give me my Mother's $4,000!!!"" So, my question is, would you say something to her?? I'm just so pissed off and she does nothing but talk shit about my Mother to me!!!! Sorry this is so long but having the whole story was important. Thank you in advance!!!",03Sep2020,1
514,"Me (16m)and my mum live together and today she asked me to go and get some money out of the bank

515,So my parents and my siblings have been talking about how I’m addicted to games cant get work done. Mostly because i very careless and forgetful. I feel like me being forgetful has been around the since i can remember. Idk what ro do and im confused about either i should not play games at all or focus on studying which i have a love hate relationship. The hard part kicks in when i think about the sacrifices my parents made to get me here just so i can learn and get a job in future.

516,"I visited a great houseshare last night. The house was really nice, the landlord seemed pleasant, and it would suit me well. I have been in contact to say that I am interested in moving in.

However, I didn't meet any of the three roommates I would be sharing the house with. They were not home. I wanted to meet with them before I signed the paperwork, but because the landlord wants the house to be occupied very shortly, and it's hard to get them all together, it might not be possible - she also said she had other people interested and couldn't hold the room for me.

Should I move into a place without having met my roommates?",03Sep2020,1
518,"I feel like my life is in a downward spiral. I’m depressed, I know I’m depressed. I’m on meds for that but it’s not working. I’ve applied for free counselling but there’s a 6 month waiting list for that. My Doctors are no help. Mental health crisis hotlines just say to go to the hospital if I feel I’m gonna kill myself. I can’t afford to pay for therapy. There’s no help out there for me at all.

I’ve had daddy issues from day one. Drug addicted absent father and a stepfather who didn’t accept me. My mother went comatose whenever my stepfather left her which was often. I spent most of my childhood fearing she was gonna kill herself. My aunt drilled into my head that my mother didn’t love me cause I wasn’t his kid. My uncle who was more like an older brother bullied me and terrified me constantly. I was bullied badly at school all the way to college. I’ve had three previous boyfriends and all three raped me. The first two was when I was fifteen-sixteen. The last one I was with 4 years. Constantly pressured me into anal and then decided to force it on me anyway. Im with a new guy now and I’m making his life hell because I’m so broken inside.

I wake up crying from my nightmares. I have nightmares every single night. I’m scared of my head. I’m terrified to close my eyes. I know I’m a diabolical girlfriend because I cannot support him emotionally. I’m a leech. I don’t work. I’m meant to start university in two weeks. I don’t know how I’m even going to cope doing that on top of everything else. I had a miscarriage last week. I was supposed to be 12 weeks along at that point. That baby was literally the only light of my life at that point. And I’ve lost it. 

I go from feeling terribly cold and numb inside to sobbing my heart out, so loud and hard that my head spins and my ears ring. I’ve had multiple mental breakdowns this week. I don’t think I’ve gone a day this past month without crying my eyes out for hours. I feel so lost. I have no friends. I’m ruining my boyfriends life. My mother cannot support me much more than what she is. 

And the worst thing is I still miss my ex. The one I was with for 4 years. He terrifies me, haunts me in my dreams. But I still miss him. My heart feels like it’s broken still. I feel broken still. 

I know I can probably push to get myself sectioned. But doing that could jeopardise my future career. I’ve been advised that being sectioned would mean I’d be unable to work with vulnerable children in my country. Which would mean my life is over anyways. I don’t want to work in any other career.

I’m sorry if this seems like a rant. I’m not feeling sorry for myself. I just feel so lost. Nothing’s getting better, nothing feels like it will get better. I’m so open and honest to my bf and family about how I feel. And the helplessness in their eyes breaks me. I’m tired of being a burden. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m beginning to feel that’s the only option. I can’t cope living like this anymore. This isn’t living. It’s not.

Just, please. If you have any advice. I’d really appreciate it.",03Sep2020,1

So I am bi and my group of friends knows and accept it, except for two, the youngest guys.
They never said anything to me in face but always talked behind my back, today I received a lot of messages on the WhatsApp chat of the group, it was 10 or so stickers with my face and the word ""fag"" or ""rapist"" on it (note: no I never raped anyone, from what I can understand they always said I raped people because in ugly) anyway some back and forth happened and since they only kept saying it I said ""fuck that"" and expelled them from all of the groups they are apart with us.
My other friends told me about all the stuff that they say about me and said they are with me on the question.
Right now I don't know how I should act, just letting it pass is out of the question since I know that they would just keep going, I tought about telling their parents about it since they are still under their supervision or quite frankly I even considered beating them up, I know it's not the right thing to do, but every time I think about it it just makes me want to do it more and more.

532," 

I (25F) own and drive a motorcycle . I have a long time friend (M27) who's also into motorcycles (and has a license himself) and helps me with any issue regarding the motocycle and whatsoever. Besides this he's just also a casual friend whom I hang out with from time to time. An important thing to mention is that he mentioned having a crush on me at one point, I told him that those feelings weren't in any way mutual. He insisted on staying friends because he valued the friendship more than his crush on me. We continued hanging out like normal times but I did notice he had some trouble considering personal boundries and he got on edge whenever my boyfriend was a topic of conversation.

Anyways, whenever my motorcycle needed work he'd offer to help me out for only the material costs. once he took those costs upon hisself and told me it he was doing me a favor. In return I promised him casual dinner eventhough I insisted on paying for those costs.

Long time passed, we didn't hang out for a while (but we did stay in contact) and my motorcycle breaks down middle highway. So while telling that to him after it happened he offers to help me out again. Only this time he takes his time with the repair and he keeps telling me that he needs me to come over to test drive the motorycle everytime after he tried to fix something really small.

I ask him if it is possible for him to test drive the motorcycle himself considering I have to go out of my way to come over to his place since my only way of transport (the motorcycle) is broken. After this he gets really salty and tells me I'm entitled for not wanting to come over and ""pressure"" him to fix it...

So after that conversations his whole attitude changed and he tells me I can pick up the motorcylce (supposedly now it is fixed) at a set time and when I pick it up I also have to pay for the costs he didnt charge me last time.

I kind of feel like he was trying to make me come over for his personal gain and now that he doesnt get his way he gets mad. So I told him I'm done with the friendship. Also considering the way he acted after insisting to be friends.

Was I wrong to end the friendship because of this situation?",03Sep2020,1
533,"Hi everyone! Please help me with my current situation. I’ve been feeling really anxious these past few days thinking about what to do with my job. I recently received my masters the end of last year and my license early 2020. I got hired for a position in Jan and wasn’t set to start till March Then COVID happened and they pushed back my starting day many times until July. They gave me a two day notice that they needed me to work leaving me no time to prepare. I said yes and was excited to finally get working. I was hired as full time hourly employee with benefits. Since July I’ve been working anywhere from 15-20 hours. I have fluctuating hours and do not qualify for any benefits, PTO, 401k, etc since I’m not at FT hours. Besides the lack of hours, I’m honesty burnt out at the position. I find myself not motivated and even dreading going into work. I don’t really have a support system and have been left alone to figure things out myself. 

So I’ve been searching for other opportunities and found a full time salaried position which would pay $10k more yearly with great benefits. The position would be over telework which is awesome too. After long debate, I’ve decided to take it because it’ll provide me a better opportunity in the long run.

The problem is that after I officially decided to take the other job, I can only offer my current job a one week notice. Which I obviously don’t want but I need time to do the requirements listed of my new position to transition and prepare for that start date. I’m feeling really nervous about it. Do you all think it’ll be okay for one week? Should I do it via email or person?

I FELT SICK. i couldn't believe that in her eyes she thought it was ok and that he was respectful for not asking again. i tried to tell her that this was wrong and creepy for a 28 year old man to ask her that, and that she's still a child. she didn't understand why i was worried. to try to put me at ease she told me it's fine, my friend who is 17 went out with him and he fingered her. i feel DISGUSTED writing this. i told her i still don't like him, and she told me it was fine, that every boy has asked her for pictures at some point and he was better than them for not insisting. i told her 'that's like being the smartest of the dumb, yea hes better but that doesn't make him the best' and i left it at that

this one guy in the building where i live told me i look good and cute. he ask me if i wanted to hook up and ask if i was available in 5 minutes. he just wanted sex. no friendship. no nothing. just sex. i made up a lie saying i was busy. then he ask if i live alone and i never gave him a direct answer to that. he told me that he doesn't want people to know that he's into me so basically he's on the DL. i wasn't interested in sex with a stranger so i declined. then he stopped talking to me. he avoids me. i don't run into him anymore. 

this other guy who i met a week ago. he lives in my building too. he's gay like me. we exchanged numbers. he was looking at me up and down and seemed interested in me. it was easy to tell. we started talking and stuff. i found out that he suffered from depression like me and has anxiety. based off the conversations with him i could tell he was lonely and needed a friend and i felt like if i could help someone through there hard times and be there for them when they lonely then that's nothing bad. then he started making sexual advances towards me. he kept saying sexually things and was being inappropriate. he said that he finds me cute and attractive and wanted to cuddle. he then said if we could have sex on the roof. he thinks just because we are both gay that we have to like each other in that way. just because im gay it dont mean i like him. i dont see him in that way. i told him if he wants sex then at least take me out and lets gets to know each other better. i dont believe in having sex with strangers. i believe sex is suppose to be with someone you love. he thought i was insulting him by turning him down and i explained to him that its not a insult. i'm still willing to be his friend but at least get to know me better before asking for sex. 

i don't believe that just because two people are gay that they have to like each other or have to have sex. im pretty sure there are heterosexual men who are friends with hetero woman and they have no attraction to each other and only see one another as friends. i dont feel the need to have sex with everyone. i lost weight and yeah i look better than before and no i dont consider myself attractive. but at the same time i have standards and i believe sex is suppose to be with the person whos you truly love and not strangers. people only see me as a sex object. im worth more than just sex. i dont know what im doing wrong",03Sep2020,1

Recently, I was using his laptop and accidentally found few nude pictures in his drive. I don't know who is she but whatever, I don't want to let him indulge in such activities.

Till now, I haven't asked him about those pics and trying to think what should I do. I really want him to focus on his career.

I've two options-
1. To tell everything to his parents and let them handle it
2. I myself guide him by handling it alone and not disclosing anything to my uncle

I was talking with my father and he dropped the bomb on me that my uncle was diagnosed a few days ago with a tumor and that today (3rd of September) he was going to go get it checked out and see if its cancerous or not. 

I know its a really sensitive area to have a tumor and it can kill you regardless of wether its cancer or not. My grandma’s nephew died a several years ago because of a non cancerous brain tumor as well.  

My uncle is the most cool calm and collected person you could ever meet when it comes to medical emergencies. 

My dad has a knack for sharing secrets that *he* thinks should be shared regardless of wether the owner of the secret gives permission to share said secret. If my uncle hasn’t told me its cause he doesn’t want me to worry. 

But now that the cat is out of the back I want to call him and talk to him about it. I don’t know if thats the right thing to do.  What should I do? Should I just sit and wait? Should I call him and wait and see if he tells me (this is rather suspicious if I don’t have a question regarding medicine-he was a pharmacist- he would probably guess why im calling him) should I just tell him my dad told me???

About 2 months ago we started to FaceTime every night and it was really fun, and about a month ago she confessed that she had a crush on me but I couldn’t date her as I didn’t want a relo atm which she was understanding and I don’t think it ruined our friendship. 

A few weeks after that we decided to meet up bc we hadn’t seen each other in a long time so we got lunch and watched a couple of movies at her house. At this point everything seems to be good between us and no warning signs. 

Since that day she said she wouldn’t be able to talk to me as she had high school exams coming up which i understood and gave her space not talking to her, the exams finished a week ago and she still hasn’t messaged me we just send streaks. I don’t buy it that she cant talk because of study when today we lost our 💕 on Snapchat so clearly she’s talking to other people.

I really want to ask her why she hasn’t been talking to me lately i want to know if i did anything wrong. The last time we spoke she assured me that I haven’t done anything wrong but she used to be so happy and pop up to me every morning so now I believe i did something wrong.

I have (had?) a really good friend group with ""M"", ""S"", ""V"", &amp; ""Y"" for the past 3-4 ish years. Since ""A"" moved back and we've been going to high school together... I've felt really distant from my main friend group. At first I thought it was because I was on the varsity dance team, and they were all in choir. So I left the dance team (for different reasons) and joined choir because I never have any academic classes with them (I take all advanced classes and they take gradelevel). Nope. They also never text me unless I text them first and last weekend I asked ""A"" if she wanted to hang out and she said ""Idk If I don't make plans with someone else first""

**The Problem:** ""A"" and I are both considered dancers. ""A"" dances two hours a week because her little sister is best friends with the studio owners daughter and it is just polite. I dance at a different studio 12+ hours a week because I am training to be a professional dance/choreographer

""A"" and I both had recital within the same two weeks. (Different weekends). ""A"" talked non stop about how excited and nervous she was and basically recited the choreography for both of her dances. I casually mentioned mine a few times when one of their parents (who know I'm a dancer) would ask me if I was excited or something. 

""A""s recital came. Everyone in our friend group went. I bought her flowers and taffy. I took video for her. We all went home with her and hung out. I came the next day to see her little sisters recital and brought her flowers and taffy too. (I didn't want her sister to feel bad that A had all these friends and she had none)

Then the weekend of my recital came. I texted them a few days before, ""Hey I have my recital (insert date, time and location) and it would mean a lot to me if you would come."" No show. The only people who came where my two friends who don't hang out with that group and live in different cities. They didn't even reply to my text. 

I'm still kind of a bit hurt. And even though it has been a few months, it really hurts to see them facetiming (Online school) during choir, or posting instagram pictures of them all hanging out together... and they only invite me when they are all busy and have no one to hangout with...

There's a potential contractor that seems like they might hire me but the worksite is over an hour for commute. Even though I'm an adult I find driving anxiety-inducing.

Then again, if I don't get into school a few months will be even longer. I wonder if I should look for jobs closer to where I live now but worry that any full time employee would look down on me for leaving after a few months if I get into school.

571,"So I (18M) have a very good female friend who's always kinda been in an emotional mess. She's an insecure seventeen year old who doesn't feel validated by her parents especially her mother. She has one little brother (15M) who gets treated way better. She is quite emotional and there are a lot of moments where she just straight up feels sad. 

She claims that at times she doesn't know why she feels the way she does. But lately, it's been going worse for her to a point where she has cut herself for the third time and it's becoming more of a habit. She lives in a lot of self-hatred, yet has a really safe space around her with the wonderful friends she has.

All of us can simply talk to her and right now, she has only told one friend that she cuts herself. She doesn't say it in a problematic way, she actually kinda laughs about it, but it's messed up. A few of us (her friends) now know and we simply show support and help her when she's sad (she doesn't know that we know). 

In the past, I have been active in self-harm activities as well and she knows this. I did it mainly to feel something, while she does it out of self-hatred. Her best friend suggested her to talk to me, but so far she hasn't and she doesn't necessarily look to have the intention.

We don't feel like simply supporting her through her problems is doing enough. We show her show and support and we take care of her, but this hasn't stopped her from cutting herself. I feel partially responsible to help come to a solution to this, because of my previous experience of the matter. Right now, my plan is to just inform her about my experience and hope that she opens up too so that we can talk about it, hoping that she will feel like someone truly understands her, as someone with my own experience. But I am scared that this could possibly not be enough and that she will get the tendency to cut again.

Her parents love her truly, but they always (unintentionally) made her feel like she is less and I think her mother would respond in a way that would only be more stressing to her and just point her in the wrong direction.

Everyone has their not so good traits, and I understand that and with the strain of this virus, I know that people are stressed and not feeling themselves of late. I’ve run into some issues with one of my housemates. When I sense he’s having a hard day, he tends to kind of just take it out on me. He can be nit picky, talk down to me, compares our coping methods and how ‘well’ we’re doing coping with the pandemic, comments on my eating in ways that irritate me, and just generally can be snappy sometimes. Just to name a few examples. I know full well this isn’t the person he is normally. We’re in a hard lockdown and he is an extreme extrovert. I think he needs that social interaction to destress and the lack of that is taking a toll on him. I personally am an introvert and I really need my space sometimes, and feel like I need to seclude myself sometimes to recharge, especially when he’s treating me this way. How should I approach talking to him about it? Is there a way to do this that won’t make him more standoffish? I don’t want him to feel bad either I just want to communicate that I don’t deserve to have this stress taken out on me and that it can really drain me sometimes. I think he’s in a slight denial about how well he’s coping and don’t really feel like he will accept whatever I have to say.  Or, if there is no good way to go about this, what can I do to ensure I’m not overly affected by his shitty behaviour? I want to emphasise he is usually a super kind and lovely person. I think he’s just cooped up and not realising how much he is projecting on to me.

 My car was in a promotion of 5 years of free service and maintenance and road assistance so i took it to the dealership to check it out. The first time they've told me the sensors are faulty and 1 day later they replaced it and gave me the car back. In the same week the car suddenly stopped at the traffic light, thank god it has just turned green and no one was speeding behind me. So i take it back to the dealership and they said that the sensors needs calibration and it took about 2 days and i take back the car. on my way to work, I was about to enter the parking place, the sensors beeps again and completely stops the car, the car behind me almost collided with mine but thankfully it didn't. I take it back and they said we need to replace the car system entirely and we have ordered the part from Germany, meanwhile we have turned off the sensors and the emergency break feature. i drive the car for about a week and the sensors beeps daily and finally they called me saying they have the part and ready to install. they take about 2 days to install and I take it back today. Just when i left their parking the sensor beeps yet again. I have 5 or 6 or even more videos of the sensors randomly beeping and showed the employees whats wrong. They have asked me to try to film as many as possible while i cant because it is random and i wont have the time to grab my phone and film it.

I've filed a complaint and they said you can take the garage manager and have him sit next to me while I drive to see the issue. I've told them multiple time that it is random and there is no guaranteed chance the sensor will beep at a certain place or time.

578,"I had a rough childhood that translated into a rough young-adulthood, which has become an even more unbearable adulthood. 

My depression has lasted years and years, and it is becoming very hard to be okay with. 

When I dont masturbate, I go through cycles of self loathing, not eating, and existential dread, but when I do, or have, i experience the glow of a life unspoiled by the mistakes of my life, but it soon grows dull and ever more painful to exist without an actual partner. 

I've been masturbating since I was 12, unbeknownst to me the potential side effects. I'm currently 28. I've been fighting tooth and nail to stop jacking off for the last two years, but it always comes back around to being necessary to move past these mental blocks that I just cant manage. 

All I want at this point is a normal life. A chance to smile, and talk about anything, but with this quarantine, and my own habits of self isolation, I'm worried I'm descending into a pit of no escape. 

I smoke weed to combat the depression that seeks to claim my life, but it has burned my teeth and made me even more insecure. 

Now it feels like my life is a hollow shell of the person I used to be. 

I cant find joy in anything.

I've never felt such longing to be with a woman not sexually.

I feel cursed that the pressure of society and my desire to escape it, has molded me into an unlovable wretch cursed to forever walk alone. 

I dont want to hook up, I dont want anymore meaningless relationships. 

I want to be married, I want to be a husband!! 

I want to live a meaningful life!!!

All I feel is sickness, and exhaustion and fatigue, and the indescribable weight I just cant shake off. 

If my parents had loved me, and cared for me, and disciplined me, I could have a life. 

My parents were so polarized by their trauma that they inflicted a life upon me where I will never accomplish my dreams, where I will never be able to escape the pressure of those dreams, where I will always imagine everything to be possible, but only far enough ahead that the pressure to begin that journey is always tomorrow's problem. 

I'm in love with this girl who has restored my humanity, but she doesnt love me, and I dont think she will. She has such a bright future, one that will never be able to have me in it. 

If things had been different with my upbringing and my schooling, I could be happy, with these worldly things I've grown to hate and shun. 

My parents essentially just used weed to subdue all the emotions I had that weren't conducive to their environment, and I feel like I have been savagely brainwashed in to being bitter, resentful, and hateful towards my circumstances and the world. 

When I was little, my mom got sick and was sick for years, my dad lost his job and basically became a raging alcoholic. Which he then began to do his own thing as a construction guy and then he starts taking me to work at 9 years old, which, a couple years ago now, he mentioned to a buddy in my presence that he's been ""grooming"" me since I was 9. This is still my day job.

I remember having trouble in school with a project and my dad being called, he confronted me aggressively and demanded that I say ""I got this"" as if it were what he needed to hear so he could resume his ""laissez faire"" parent strategy that led to me having failing grades across the board. 

Bottom line is, my parents failed me. Society failed me.

 My friends have been so helpful, but its like trying to fill the marianas trench with spackle. 

This woman, has single handedly given me cause to turn my life around, but the ruts of my depression are making it so difficult to make any progress whatsoever on these things I want to do. 

I want to write, I want to paint, I want to make things! But all my creativity, and passion, and ingenuity is trapped behind this psychological barrier of an orgasm??? That's where I feel like I'm at right now. 

I cant be who I am without sex, i cant make progress unless I feel better, and if i dont feel better I'll never get laid, and if i never get laid I'll never feel better!!! 

But I REFUSE to waste anymore of my sexual energy masturbating!!!! I cant bear to ever ""hook up"" again.

I dont know what to do with my life. 

I want to reenter society, but I have no clue how!!

 Facebook is a lie, Instagram is a lie. 

With all this covid stuff going on its like I'll never get to be a functioning member of society. 

Any advice would be appreciated for sure.

I'm sure I could have said more but I have to get moving. 

Thanks yall.",03Sep2020,1
579,"How do you move forward when your partner completely shatters everything and every hope you had of a happy marriage days before your wedding? 

I was having a really bad mental day yesterday and tried to communicate that with my partner. I’ve been having episodes of desperation and feeling lonely. I’ve been working pretty much completely alone for the last 6 months due to covid - our workplace decided to have a Skelton staff. I’ve also been waking up and going to bed alone for the majority of those 6 months because my fiancé doesn’t work as far as I do and therefore doesn’t wake up the same time and also doesn’t get sleepy when I do. I was explaining to him how mu of a toll this has put in my mental sanity. I am craving for more human interactions and explaining to him how lonely I’ve felt this whole time. 

I’ve also recently had some falling outs with people who I thought were friends and even made my bridesmaid. However, when covid came, none of them reached out. When we postponed the wedding, none of them said anything or put any effort into being there. When we moved into our first house in May, none of them even asked if I needed help or asked to come visit. I realized then that these weren’t friends and so I let go of those friendships. 

While trying to explain my predicament I mentioned how I wish I had the type of work environment my fiancé works in and how great it is and how happy I am for him to have that. I asked him to imagine what it would be like to work in my environment for 6 months so that he could empathize with me. 

He mentioned how he’s a little depressed at work too, which I asked him about and he responded saying he’s tired and needs a break. I’m not going to lie, that kinda rubbed me the wrong way because here we were talking about me and I’m opening up about how I feel and he adds that he’s depressed cuz he’s tired of working. Trust me I get that, I’m sure everyone does, but did I think he was being a little exaggerative with that statement? Yes. 

I tried to tell him hey, you’ve got all these amazing things going on at work, you’re really lucky to be where you are (he was pretty much poached, got a raise, has way more responsibility, involved in much more projects, given the opportunity to learn and grow, being paid for additional training in an area he always wanted to be in, is killing it at work and is being recognized for it on a weekly basis, it’s talked about highly amongst all peers, has workplace buddies/best friends etc and did I mention he only started in April). I told him how happy I am for him but idk what he could be depressed about at work? 

Little did I know that this would snowball into something very nasty. He interpreted it as I was telling him he had no right to be sad which I never said. I tried to explain what my intentions were behind what I said but he didn’t want to hear it. All I was trying to say is that he has a great job, works with great people and loves his job. I was trying to tell him to look at the bright side and other people have it much worse so why be depressed over something like being too busy at work? That’s something that can easily be fixed. 

Some how the conversation which initially started out about me feeling lonely and depressed and wanting to talk it out with my significant other turned into something malicious and how I was blaming him for my loneliness. Again something I never said but he took it that way. 

I thought the convo would have died and we’d talk about it at home like mature adults because I didn’t understand where all the hostility was coming from. Unfortunately that didn’t happen. My partner was unable to let go of his anger and chose to bring it home with him. He chose to act of his anger and got very aggressive, emotionally and verbally and was bullying me. 

Many things were said on both parts but the aggressor was always my partner. He decided to be rude and make underhand comments as soon as I got home. He decided to raise his voice and get confrontational first. He decided to shout and call names and say hurtful stuff first. He decided to control what was being said and when I could speak. He decided to corner me to intimidate me. He decided to escalate it in every form possible. 

Finally it got to a point where he heard me out and realized he acted like a complete fool but this was nearly 10 hours later... 

Was all of it really worth it over what I said? Was what I texted that terrible to hold onto anger for the whole day? I understand it may not have seem the most sensitive thing to say but even after I explained myself and how I didn’t mean anything rude or hurtful by it, was it still worth fighting for 10+ hours over? Was it worth making me feel terrible and unloved over a misunderstanding? 

Our wedding it supposed to be this Saturday but my whole body is revolting against it. Idk what to do, idk how I feel. I just feel like I don’t belong right now, I feel empty and I feel like this isn’t what it should be like 2 days before you marry someone.",03Sep2020,1

My assets are around $10k cash and around $10-15k of possessions not including a car that is worth about 17k in its current state that I owe 7k on. 

I hate my job. I am burnt out of it and groan when I have to come in each day. I am stressed on my days off and get work calls when I am trying to hang out with friends. Despite being offered vacation days as a part of my employment, I am not allowed to use them. I live in Florida and have only been to a few other states for short periods of time.

I want to quit my job, sell what I can't carry in my car, and travel across the U.S. to see what is out there and find my place. I don't know if I would do it for a few months, maybe longer, but I need a break from this and I want to explore other options.

How much is reasonable to save before doing something like this? Am I stupid for wanting to bum it out for months, a year?

I am down to live in my car or buy a sleeping bag and tent and camp outside. I would be willing to do odd jobs here and there to help sustain myself.

I had life figured out when I was a minor. I did everything I could to get to where I wanted then but factors out of my control took that from me and I fell into the job I have now for what was supposed to be 2 months and it has turned into 5+ years of climbing a ladder in a career field I hate. I feel stuck and if I don't push myself out I will end up stuck here forever.

I have a girlfriend of a few years that is down to travel with me for a couple months but she doesn't want the bum life. Of course I would go back to work eventually but who knows when.

My classmates have been together ever since we were put into the “Gifted” program.(it’s nothing special, kinda disliked it). When I was younger, my adhd was really bad.

Until recently I was employed as an Assistant Manager at a retail store, having the responsibility of four young children with elderly grandparents I went into self-isolation, at the time it seemed the safest and smartest thing to do for those that I love.   

I informed my employer on Aug 25th that I would like to return to work asap, he told me to wait. 

September 2nd I was terminated via phone call without returning to work.

I started with the company on March the 25th 2019. 

I signed an employment contract with them, and since then the store has been bought by another company. I have not signed a contract with the new company. 

They are going to pay me 2 weeks in notice of lieu, and an extra week if I sign a non-disclosure. 

My employment contract with the original company did have to the ""ESA only going to pay you a certain amount and fire you with-out cause clause""

For now I have to go back to my parents which I'm not sure I can handle. Long story short: they're extremely toxic and damaging to my mental health. They're both addicts and constantly barrage me all day with their garbage. I have a lot of trauma from that house. Not going to lay out my life story but I have complex ptsd and a whole other set of mental problems because of them.

My ONLY other option is to move states over to my other family for now. I would have to board either a plane or a train to get there and I'm pretty scared about getting COVID. Would I be making a horrible mistake to take a train/plane right now? I'm not even sure what to do about healthcare when I'm not in my home state. My family also has a history with heart problems which makes me even more concerned (although it could be a lie from my parents.. not sure anymore) about getting COVID.

2. She never takes no for an answer and scolds everybody.

3. If there is something that can’t be done systematically she would scold us for saying it can’t be done.

There’s nothing wrong with scolding but When she scolds someone, its rarely work related and always a character trait insult (ex: why are you so bad, stop being an assertive person since you’re not smart) Sometimes she acknowledges that she doesn’t have a great personality and vowes to better herself but again starts attacking after a week.

598,"My (21f) sister and I (24f) grew up together and have always had a very strong, deep connection. I have always fit into society’s beauty standards but have, nonetheless, always struggled with my self image, in need of external validation.
She was overweight (society’s fatphobia made it so that she was not considered besutiful) as a kid and then we always wore the same size until a couple of years ago when she started to lose weight and she is now a lot smaller than I am, also because I’m very tall and she’s quite tiny. 

I have been living abroad on and off since I was 18 and that has strongly connected me to my own identity and I’ve given up on my people pleasing tendencies. I am now stuck in my home country because of COVID and, amongst all the other things that make it an unfortunate situation, this became a problem. 

My sister was in a serious monogamous relationship until last week, I haven’t been in one for five years, nor have I slept with anyone in three years, because I never found myself attracted to anyone or got very easily turned off  by the lack of critical thinking I encountered in potential partners. I have met this guy a couple of months ago at a BLM protest I had organised, he is not my usual type aesthetically or physically speaking, but I have been starting to feel some sort of attraction/connection to him in the past few weeks, mainly because I felt like he liked me, then my friend once randomly said she thinks he’s in love with me or something and it made me entertain the idea more. I wouldn’t say I have a crush on him but I think I could potentially end up sleeping or having something with him before I leave again.
He sends me songs and we have a lot in common. 
Yesterday we had a rendezvous at mine’s with other people and my sister arrived after some time, we all had a great time. 

A couple of hours ago, I was on the phone with her and she said “I think he likes me” to which I responded my genuine answer, “I think he’s like that with everyone” to which she replied “I felt a connection, I’d sleep with him if only he were taller”. Internalised gender standards aside, that thing really discomforted me for some reason. The fact that my sister is very feminine and sought after by men is not usually a big deal to me, since I realise we’re very different and the people who are interested in her are people I’d never even consider for various reasons (I.e. rampant sexism); but when she told me this, I felt a significant amount of jealousy which translated into regret for things I do for her, for example writing things that she takes credit for etc... all things that I am very happy to do but in that moment I felt like I had given up on my own prerogative and main characteristic to make her look even better. The fact that I do not perform femininity in such a standardised way, together with my newfound lack of tone or thought adaption to whom I’m speaking with, meaning I say what I think, I don’t care if they asked me a simple question and my answer includes philosophy, physics or some anecdote from some unknown XVI Century war (not in a cocky, exclusionary way), tend to overwhelm men so they perceive me as “the super smart inaccessible girl”, known for being politically engaged, etc... which I most likely am but, for example, to her group of friends, I am discharged as my sister’s sister and treated as some sort asexual weird alien and not even having the right to my own name definitely does not help with my validation problems. 

In conclusion, I absolutely do realise that all of this stems from societal sexism and personal insecurities and that my sister has nothing to do with it, but the fact that she would so nonchalantly assume everyone likes her as if every person on this planet was interested in hyper performed femininity and I were just a brain and pretty face to look at, made me angry and feel doomed to invisibility forever. Once again, I may be jealous of her confidence? 

About the guy, I wouldn’t want her to hit on him, mostly because I don’t want to feel in competition with her, but I don’t know if or how to tell her, since that stance would make an underlying problem explicit on my part; but I don’t even want to censor a potentially beautiful thing for my sister, also because I don’t really feel that much for him, which I also realise makes it all worse since it’s based on the desire to feel desired rather than the actual desire towards someone. she is my best friend and I literally live for her. I guess no one’s the A here, except for my own insecurity, but how can navigate this? TIA",03Sep2020,1
599,"I'm a young person and I got laid off from my job as an office manager and executive assistant back in early July, due to the economic impact of coronavirus. It was a really great job and I was pretty shocked about it, although, I also sort of saw it coming because half of my job was at the office. I majored in business management at a state school and graduated a few years back. Since then, I've taken roles in sales and administrative work (mostly admin work). I'd say I have a solid resume and have tailored and fluffed it up as much as possible to reflect upon my skills and work experiences. I'm a good writer also, but I don't know how easy or reliable freelance writing work is now. I can't take on non-white collar work because it wouldn't pay my rent.

Initially after my lay off, I applied for unemployment and didn't get it in the ""estimated"" 3 weeks I was supposed to get it in. I apparently live in a state that has the lowest rates of pay outs to unemployed. So I got help from my gracious siblings to pay my rent the second month after I used my severance check to pay the first month's rent. I went into an even greater depressive mode after still not receiving my unemployment (which began because of the lockdowns, and other reasons), and didn't apply for jobs seriously until a few weeks ago. I needed a mental break after losing my job to recover. I now realise it was a mistake to take this much time ""off"", which didn't hit me until recently and now my stress levels are sky-high.

I have been applying like mad to office assistant, admin assistant, executive assistant, office manager, and even roles related to my business major that I wasn't able to get before covid, but it's worth a shot, right? I've applied to a good number of jobs

The reason why I'm ultimately so stressed is live in a HCOL of living area here in the U.S. (as a citizen, I was born here), and my parents live abroad. If I can't get a job, I'll have to move back home abroad to an environment that's so strict for women, I don't want to have to do this.

As I write this he is sitting across the room from me, both hands cupped around his phone in an obvious attempt to hide its contents. I used to think that the childish grin he pulls was a thing of innocence. Of softness and care. I see now that its source is somewhere else. A place of malice and deceit. I don't know. 

His efforts at secrecy have not been flawless however. Just minutes ago I was in the kitchen pouring myself a drink and upon re-entering, I caught a glimpse of his screen. I know exactly what site he was on. Not that I use it myself obviously. I know of it through past friends and the like, people who don't value decency and respect I suppose. The sight of it made me sick. Even now I am shaking, my mind gripping the hypothetical driftwood of this ungodly storm. How could he do this to us? To a family that loves and cherishes his company. A unit that is bound in blood and tears. 

My mother will no doubt be distraught, as any moral person would be. She dedicated so much to him. Loved him dearly. Loves. And knowing how soft her heart is, it would not surprise me if she forgave him. She is a beacon of light, my mother. Our gift from God himself. I would hate to see her hurt. The wings of an angel stained with the inky sin of man. No, I will not allow him to do this.

The other piece of evidence that supports my claim is the letters. Seven of them. All of them so perfect, so conveniently placed. As if he knew what they said before even turning them over. And then the way he reads them, his cunning smile pinned proudly across his cheeks. He knows exactly what his actions mean but not what damage they cause. How could a person be so full of spite?

So what do I do? Do I speak to him, call him out on his wrongdoings? Do I talk instead to my mother? Or do I do neither? This game cannot continue, I have no doubt of that. Its end is near.

My mother just spelt out what seems to be her penultimate word.

LOYALTY. How appropriate. Nine points, but the Y sits on a triple. That makes twenty-one.

603,"In January, my bf (the driver) and I slipped off the road. Car was wrecked, he wasn’t injured, I only had a few bruises and my head hurt for a week - went to the doctor and they said it was a neck strain. 

First two months after the accident were okay, a small fear that it might happen again but nothing major. Today, I’m terrified of driving with someone else (if I’m driving I’m not as scared). I’m anxious, overthinking, have sweaty hands, sometimes I get nauseous. 

I’ve talked with my parents about it and they said the more I will drive the faster the fear will disappear.

613," Do I leave a job or not?! Please help!

Work in an educational field as a Vice Principal.
I currently work in a school where I don’t want to stay long term. I don’t dislike my job, but the type of school it is is not what I want to do forever and 

I’m not 100% happy. I applied for a job over the summer for a different school but never heard back. Didn’t think anything of it.

As the school year was starting I got a call for a screening interview at the job I applied for. It went well and they called be to come in for the second round interview next week.

Before this job, I was a vice principal at a school much father from home and then came to this one because it was closer, but still about 45 min away.
The new school would have less of a commute - about 10 min. It would be slightly more money (5-10k), and is the type of school I’d like to work in.

However, the negatives would be that it screws over my current job to leave right near the beginning of the school year. I’d have to start my tenure track over again, and if schools go all remote, I don’t think I’d be able to help watch the kids and would have to keep my current babysitter which is expensive and would be nice to not need during fully remote learning.

My concern is also it makes my resume look bad. It would be me having a job with the same title at three schools, having stayed at the previous two for only two years each.

I don’t know what to do, because this opportunity seems more in line with long term goals/aspirations, but at the same time if I blow up my resume and burn bridges that also doesn’t help with long term goals either.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",03Sep2020,1

616,"I've been living with my current roommate for a little over a year now. I'm 26 with a professional career, and make enough money to live comfortably. I lived in my home for a year alone before my roommate, and 2 years alone in a different location. 

We aren't the best of friends, but we do hang out in the same friend group that I introduced her too. We don't argue, and we've had very civil conversations about living together. There's not really any passive aggression or anything like that. She's not some horrible roommate like Iv'e had in the past, but some stuff really bothers me more than it should. 

Every since she's moved in, I feel like I'm stressing more than I need to. We just don't have the same standards on cleaning and I'm basically Monica form ""Friends"". Everything in the apartment belongs to me, I am the only one responsible for bills other than rent, and I have a very large security deposit in the place. I totally LOVE saving that extra bit of money I get with her from rent, but after a year I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. She had an option to leave last year, but she decided to stay. She was gone for a few months and it really hit me that I just enjoy being alone more, so I feel like I missed my opportunity to get her out. (I am the only one on the lease, so really she has no say). 

 I've tried so hard to be more relaxed, but when I spend all day cleaning the entire place alone, and come home after a long day of work at 9pm and see dirty crust dishes and a roach, I loose it. I come home sometimes and the front door will be unlocked. My stuff is at risk of being stolen, not hers. She wakes me up every single morning at 5am when she gets up. I have ear plugs and white noise, but I'm just so sensitive &amp; she isn't even being super loud. She cooks beansprouts EVERY DAY and goodness it stinks so bad. Some of this stuff is just petty, I know, but I could live on my own if I really wanted to. I'm just torn between being nice/saving money/living alone.

The thing is i KNOW none of this she does is intentional. She's just forgetful. This is her first time being in the real world ""adulting"". Like she doesn't understand living is expensive and you need to be responsible for your own stuff. She's even said she's use to her mom doing stuff for her. Like I was too, but I've been on my own for a while now, and I have higher standards that have been expressed and agreed upon multiple times.

I just don't see much changing. I don't know if I should just suck it up and take the extra money from rent, or if I should ask her to leave because I just need my sleep &amp; a piece of mind. I have been saving an extra like $600 a month since she moved in which will go towards a down payment within the next five years, but I can also afford that $600 on my own. Ill prob only save a few hundred instead of all of that. WHAT SHOULD I DO?????",03Sep2020,1

619,"First and foremost, Im not really a reddit or online person. Im only here because of this stick situation in which I cant really talk about this to my friends so I'm venting here.

This all started at a cottage that I was invited to by my best friend, who had planned a cottage with his high school friends. Ive only briefly met his friends once before so I was only focused on trying to create friendships with his group as he's going to be my best friend for a long time. When going to the cottage, there were 3 couples and 4 single people, I obviously was apart of the single group. Among the singles, there was an extremely attractive girl who I knew I had 0 chance and honestly, I didn't even think we'd really be friends as her environment and my environment were completely different ( she went to a party university while I went to a common commuter university). Before the cottage, my best friend tried to tell me that I should make a move on her since we would all be drunk and I could get some action but I declined as my mindset at the time, and even now is that I was tired of meaningless hookups and relationships that I had experienced all year, I was ready for something real.

Fast forward to the first day, I was the driver and I made a road trip playlist that I knew I'd love and didn't really think anyone else would like, since my best friend was more into rap music but I enjoy throwbacks especially for a road trip. During the trip, the girl (let's name her Nina) really seemed to jam to my music as well and I saw that as something great to start off a platonic friendship. The first day continued, we had fun doing cottage activities and by the end of the night everyone was essentially drunk. Our entire group was in the living room playing games, drinking and generally having discussions when a controversial topic was brought up and there was an argument. I normally don't get mad at anything and I'm usually not one to make a big deal out of something but Nina decided to get up all in my face accusing me of something I for one, did not do and two, actually had a strong opinion for. I got heated and we started screaming at each other at the top of my lungs. Eventually, my friend had to hold me back and I stormed into my room thinking I'd never even want to associate with her for the rest of the trip. I eventually calmed down and went back downstairs with everyone while Nina was in the kitchen cleaning to deal with her anger.

The next day it was a lot more chill, I didn't hold a grudge for anything that happened last night and things went well the entire day. At night our typical shenanigans happened again, while I got extremely high while Nina and some other friends got drunk. I passed out while they were still playing their drinking games so I'm not sure what happened but I woke up to Nina grabbing me and telling me to play the drinking games with them. I agreed but I really didn't feel like drinking so I was distant, and throughout the game she was being extremely touchy, holding my hand, being all over me, even suffocating me to get an answer. Soon, she decided to literally get on top of me, grab my head and try to kiss me. I swerved her. I really can't tell you what was going on inside my head but it was mostly confusion, and a little bit of my moral compass telling me not to take advantage of her being drunk.

The following morning, everyone was eager to know what was going through her head but she didn't remember a thing, and I told my best friend to not bring it up as I thought her making a move was just a drunk move and it meant nothing so I didn't want to bring up an awkward situation. Skipping ahead to nighttime, I got way too drunk with Nina and we shared some great moments, all leading up to our group watching a movie in the living room and me giving in and cuddling with her. As everyone was heading up for bed, I also left thinking that I really don't know if she's still making moves on me because she's drunk or because there could actually be a future, but my best friend came into my room snapping me out of my dumbass state. I mustered up the courage to go back downstairs where she was waiting, she turned off the lights and we began making out. I'm not going to go into details but basically we slept together that night. The following morning, I asked her if this was a one-time thing or if she wants something more. She said she was confused and didn't know

I was also confused as I was unsure whether she actually liked me, and in all honestly, I was in shock/denial that a girl like that would ever be into me. There was confusion on her end since this all happened at the end of summer and she was planning on moving back to university which was around a 2 hour drive away. I still decided to start talking with her on snapchat, and I had a great time talking with her every day and every night. Eventually we talked non-stop and she was always on my mind. She was the first girl I ever wanted to facetime, and the first girl I literally stayed up all night for just facetiming. It was a great time. During this time, we also hang out but it was always with friends, due to my pussy ass not being to ask her out on a direct date, but nevertheless it was still romantic as fuck ( drive-in theatres, cuddling, eating and sharing food together). It was a happy time in my life, and those 2 weeks not only made up for a shitty 2020 but also made me more happy than I felt in years. The only thing that was missing between us was the talk, which we both dreaded as we were both bad with confrontation and feelings.

Side note here, while we were talking, she talked about a previous relationship in which long distance was a factor in which they broke up and also that when she's unsure of what to do, she ends it abruptly without any explanation

The day she decided on a date that she was moving back to university, I decided I needed to have the talk with her even if it was on facetime. I began and asked if we could talk about us and our future, but she said not right now. She ended the call early which wasn't like her as leading up to that day, we usually facetimed/called all night. The following day was extremely difficult for me, as she started to ghost me and when we talked there wasn't the usual spark that was there the past few days. That night our group went out again to celebrate a great summer and basically say goodbye to the people in the group moving back out for school. I asked Nina if there was anything wrong but she claimed that she was distant today cuz she was getting ready for the dinner, so I accepted it. But throughout the night, it was clear something was off and we weren't the same gooey couple we acted like before. We still facetimed and the following day the same happened. I planned for us to go on 1 final date. She really didn't seem too invested in the idea so I scrapped the whole idea and plan to just meet up with her quickly before she leaves.

I apologize if this was really long, but I have all these emotions in me that I don't know what to do with. I'm just not sure if shes lost feelings, or if she's just unsure of what to do with us like she did before so she's just ending it before we get even more attached. I'm not really sure what to ask in terms of advice but, if someone could tell me how I should approach the talk it'd be greatly appreciated.

620," Hello! I feel as if I can’t do anything in the way I should because I  constantly feel scared from the people around me. I’m 25 years old  female. I live with my parents. I’m currently trying to freelance from  my laptop (as a web designer). 

The problem is that my parents and my  sister are used to knowing all of what I do. I always need to tell them  everything. I just really can’t stand this. Every time when I tell them  that I’ve made some money they need to know how much I’ve made and they  always question my skills and what I do. And it’s not only this. I  recently started a diet because I have more than 10kgs to lose. It’s  like I wanna lose the weight and I know that I can lose it but I just  lack motivation and I think that I just eat more because I’m depressed  and all of what they say irritates me. I hate when I get comments on my  weight and what I eat. It’s like whatever I do needs to be commented on  by them. 

I feel so scared because I know that I wouldn’t succeed to do  everything on my own if I stop speaking to them. I have always been  dreaming to just live alone , have a job and not see them all the time  but I seriously wonder if this will ever happen. I also need to say my  father still treats me as if I’m a child. Today he said he will take my  headphones if I don’t stop listening to music. I never even try to reply  to his words because I feel he may just slap me in the face or even  beat me if he gets pissed. I just wanted to share this because It’s  constantly on my mind and I can’t get myself to do anything because I’m  just scared and I lack motivation. :(",03Sep2020,1

625,"i know it sounds insanely stupid, but i’m actually struggling with letting go of the spite i harbor towards my ex girlfriend. we dated for about 9 months and, during that time, she was always nice enough to me. she was kinda pushy in terms of what we did sexually and just generally pretty emotionally immature, but she never did anything crazy. i would always cut her some slack for those things because she had a homophobic brother (she’s bi, i’m a lesbian) and she kinda struggled with making and keeping friends. 

the real issues started to come up around 8 months into the relationship. i started to learn that she was pretty universally disliked by everyone i know. i stayed in the relationship for awhile knowing that everybody had a problem with her but not knowing why. out of curiosity and concern for my friends, i started to snoop around and soon came to realize that she had full on sexually assaulted three people i know before we got into a relationship and had lied to me about her circumstances to cover it up. there were rumors that she had done it to more people, but i never heard it directly from them. 

i obviously confronted her about it immediately, guns blazing, and told her that i was done with the relationship and didn’t want to ever speak to her again. she tried to victimize herself in every way possible, tried to convince me that i could never do better than her because of how fucked up i am, and tried to justify her actions with a tragic backstory that was obviously made up on the spot. a few months later, she went after another one of my friends. 

i’m a pretty justice-oriented person and, due to this, i’ve become consumed with the idea of destroying her life because of what she did to so many people i care about. it’s been four months since we’ve broken up and every single day, i find myself fantasizing about getting some kind of crazy revenge. i know some of it is warranted, but i don’t have the energy to devote so much of my personal life towards scheming about destruction anymore. she doesn’t even deserve to consume this much of my identity because if she knew that i still thought about her every day, she’d probably take pleasure in it. 

how do i let this go?",03Sep2020,1

The situation currently is that she used geo tagging on my facebook profile photos to find my address (currently the best theory we have). She then posted this address to 4chan and online several times, giving out my photo and phone number with this, as well as possibly linking my social medias. Effectively doxxing me.

This situation came after months of her sending me g*re, violent p*rn, threatening messages, (public) photos of myself, grotesque photos of rats, and just annoying messages. I had been blocking all messages and numbers for the past several months, but I figured responding may be the best option. Mind you, this is his ex from two years ago, who is in another relationship.

I made a rather low blow, and referred to her by a taunt people called her in highschool, and I assume that is why it went as far as it did last night. So I understand if I am at fault for this because if that.

She is doing all this via an app called ""TextNow"", so it is not like just blocking her number will work, as she can just create a new number and continue this cycle.

we are all 15, and male if that helps.

ppl in the story:

E : good friend

F: probably best friend

z: kinda friend, but we dont hangout together outside of the group.

background: i met all of them three years ago, both F and Z moved two years ago, and came back earlier this year to the USA. we started a new school with only 8 students in it, so we have alot of time together and get along well, especially me and F.

the problem is i get a sense that they would not miss me if i wasnt there...they all fit rly well together and i sometimes wonder if i am just fourth wheeling. they have some inside jokes, and will kinda say stuff that doesnt include me..

i cant believe i am mentioning this, but one of the new things is if Z puts on my glasses, he suddently becomes infused with raw sexual energy and tries to chase after us, except he only ever chases after E and F. its very dumb and immature, but still. they seem better friends then me and one of them.

and in casual conversation, i kinda sometimes just get left behind sometimes.

we still joke around and have fun, but i get the sense that i am not a big part of the friend group. am i imagining it?? i might be reading too much into minor things, and i know it shouldnt be too complicated if we are good friends, but still. thoughs? do you have any advice to deal with this feeling, or rectify the situation in general?

628,"Long story short, I’ve been kicked out of my house. My relationship with my parents has been on thin ice for a while and even though I always had the intention of repairing it before leaving, they just don’t have it. I’m upset that I’m being forced out of my home and that I’ve upset them this much but I’m also stressed about their strict parenting, lack of sympathy and helicopter policing. I was hoping to pay them back the money they’ve lent me over the years, get a car and then get myself out on my own. 

I have no money apart from what’s left of a student loan that is actually owed to my uni, but I had to rely on to pay bills and transport after COVID. I really don’t want to get further into it. I also have a laptop on credit that’s now been passed on to a debt collection agency and haven’t been able to pay off yet. 

I have two jobs, one as a mobile cleaner at a restaurant and a pharmacy, and another as a worker at Morrison’s. I think I’m being taxed extra though so my last pay check didn’t last long.

I don’t feel comfortable asking anyone for help. My closest friend lives like an hour away and we are definitely not close enough for me to turn up at his crowded parents house. My other friends live on the other side of the country and it’s the same situation.

631,"bleh. So hello! To start things off, I am a 23 year old female, I study ecology and evolution,  senior, I have done research for nature preserves for plants and in Costa Rica for turtles, I love botany, critters, and everything in between and I need advice!!!!!! This is a long boi as there is lots to unpack 

I want to be able to feel unapologetic about who I am, be less insecure and meet good people. I feel like I am a dud human, genetically. My luck is also....disappointing if you believe in that. I feel like there is so much wrong with me that it makes people not want to be around me, and it makes it really hard for me to try and make new friends. I feel like a big huuuuuuge chore to have around. So lets dig in!

 I am late deafened, I went deaf at 12. I just had cochlear implant surgery 3 weeks ago and it has not been turned on yet- which means I am just a lot deafer than usual because Ive got no hearing as opposed to some, and being around anyone is really hard. I consider my deafness to be the main thing ""wrong"" with me (ha) since it is the most prominent and obvious. I do not know ASL and only lip read. My parents pretty much ignored me going deaf, I taught myself how to read lips and just suffered through school until I got my own hearing aids at 16 (so expensive!!!!!!). So in my very important development years, I became very insecure and anxious about who I was because I could not do anything about my disability, and all the sudden I had no friends because I withdrew since I couldn't hear anyone. No more hangouts, no more class convos, no more anything social= not able to build social skills.  And people thought I was a weirdo (I was).  Okay moving onnnnnnn

family background: I am the youngest of 4 and I grew up with very very narcissistic parents, causing each of us siblings to have mental illnesses and relationship issues.  My oldest brother is severely autistic, but did not get the care he needed growing up so it is a lot worse than it needs to be. My sister is bipolar and extremely insecure despite being very beautiful, healthy and charming. She was unstable and explosive growing up- much better now.  My second brother is anxious, depressed and insecure- he handled it with acting out, getting bad grades, dressing very odd etc.  My siblings reaction to the way we grew up was to explode and act out, mine was to withdraw, say nothing, be of service or be nothing at all. I have been depressed since I was very young, I cannot remember a single happy or blissful moment, I have what is called dysthymia- which is long term depression that can get worse or better in waves but has never really gone away. I was very very observant and I learn quick, I watched my siblings and took notes on what not to do, I watched my parents and learned how to please them since I was a toddler. This made me get very little attention-but at least I wasn't getting screamed at lol. This way of growing up has made me \~\~\~\~\~introspective and wise!!!\~\~\~\~\~ as people like to tell me. We never had money for anything except for what my parents wanted. they had nice cars, cool gadgets, great clothes, jewelry, etc. I never had a bra, my own underwear, or any kind of body care product that wasn't used or given to me by my other fam members etc. This is how it was for all of us, so we learned to neglect our needs very young and we all still neglect ourselves without fully realizing it.  I was so ignored that in high school, I won national awards in  art and metalsmithing and none of my family knew. I also have anxiety disorder and PTSD from past sexual assault and abuse. I was also severely bullied in middle school, to the point of becoming suicidal-again no one in my family knew 

I have digestive issues, I can't eat a lot of food so social gatherings, which normally involve food, don't work well for me. I still go to them when invited and eat before I go or something, but food seems to be such a trigger for people? like people will get upset that I can't eat their food. anyway, this is a constant thing for me  

I am terrible at making friends. I am pretty good at being able to tell when people are going to suck, but I befriend them anyway because they're easy to befriend. I do not know how to befriend good people, they're scary and I feel like I am too.....much to deserve good people in my life. I know this is a major part in feeling like everyone hates me, but this would be a great place to add in your advice!!!! hehehe

I consider myself to be a good person, as good as I can be in a country where everyone is technically a terrible person (USA babyyy) I do my best. When I was 19 I realized I knew nothing about myself so I really dug in to self discovery and figuring out what my values are and then enforcing them in my daily life. I hold honestly to my highest principal. I do not manipulate (knowingly, my boyfriend helps me notice some manipulative tendencies I have from childhood, but in a helpful way!), I don't steal, brag, take advantage of people, use people, I won't gossip, and if I begin I stop myself, I volunteer, II shop ethically and as sustainable as possible,  I get great grades despite my disabilities, and I am a really good friend-I just give myself to the wrong people. And im a fK\*n NERDDDDDDDDDDDD and although this post is a downer, I have a great sense of humor. Part of my recovery required me to be able to figure out my good traits, these are those and I do love them. 

3 years ago I began to heavily work on myself in order to stop being so miserable. I read a ton of self help books, started journaling, meditating, exercising, eating really well, counting my blessings and doing more things by myself. since I didn't have people do things with, I did nothing. so doing things on my own was huge, and began helping me feel better. I started running (and winning) races, then 2 years ago I bought a reaaalllllly nice bike to begin training for a triathlon. Then I met my (amazing wonderful great hot smart kind) boyfriend last June,  and the 1 month later I got hit by a car in a hit and run by a car that was on the run. hahahahahaha. Then COVID!!!!!!!!! while I was trying to get treated. This was a HUGE  issue for me because all I can do is lipread and masks make that not possible, so now I can't go anywhere by myself. And this puts a huge damper on my treatment and social stuff. 

So here are the main things wrong with me. Deaf, depressed, anxious, social skills lack, always on defense because my childhood sucked, now I am physically hurt from getting hit. I don't talk about myself much, but when I do it just seems like people don't want to hear it, or people get annoyed of me very easily. I think it is because you can tell I am a very insecure person and easily taken advantage of. I will let people wring me dry if it means friendship. A couple of examples just this last year- My past research partner started treating me terribly when I knew more things than her, so I backed off a bit and let her run the show. then she started being really mean about my deafness, and then lied to a few classmates about me (100% untrue things that came out of a story book or something lol-truly the most bizarre experience with someone in my life). I have a friend who owns a gym and Is a personal trainer- he has a really great thing going, I asked him if he could help me in my recovery from getting hit since he really knows what he's doing, he agreed then ghosted me and now I am on restricted view of all his social media lol. These kinds of things happen to me very very often. People get annoyed of me even though I am very aware of how little I talk about myself. It could just be me having very low standards and having bad people around, or I could really use another round of personal growth and some tips and tricks when it comes to meeting good people. My boyfriend was raised in a very healthy environment and has never had these kinds of issues with people, but he also would never let people that do these things into his life, so maybe I need to learn how to do that????????? Im seriously soooooo at a loss and so lonely. I want genuine lasting friendships with good people that aren't going to be shook by the little bit of extra effort it takes to have me around. Ive got a lot to offer and I am always there for people- plssss helpppp meeeeeeee. Also adding in I am in therapy but only started a month ago!!!! So that could be a a great thing eventually- but hasn't been yet. Thanks for sticking around to read this entire book, Im really looking forward to seeing what you guys have to say.",03Sep2020,1

So i tried to explain everything to her. And told her what i knew.

It is bringing such a large toll on my life since then and I don't know how to really deal with the thought of what happened to me.

tl;dr at the bottom 

i don’t know where this doubt came from. i was so sure i wanted to move to a new state and even have little goals to hit in order to be “prepared” to leave. 

i was going to move 3 months from now but because i worked 12-15 hours days in order to quickly hit my goals, i’ve come to the point where i can actually move by the end of this month. i wasn’t planning on moving till november to make sure i had enough funds but i also didn’t expect to work this much so it’s all really good timing with my finances. 

i never told anyone about this because 1) i really have no friends &amp;amp;amp; 2) i didn’t want anyone’s opinion to influence my decision on moving. 

well these last few weeks have been extremely brutal and lonely. it’s been hard ngl. had 2 mental break downs and took a little bit to recover from those. i really pushed myself to the edge by working these long hours, going to school full time &amp;amp;amp; working out. 

now that i can see the light at the end of the tunnel, i almost feel disconnected from my home, family and town. it’s like i know i’m leaving and whatever i do here is meaningless and i could give a shit less type of vibe. but with all this, i’m really scared. like keeping me up at night scared. i love how much i have saved but still feel like no matter what i do or how much i save, i’m still going to fail and end up moving back home. i don’t want that to happen i don’t want to fail. 

so reddit, i’m desperately looking for advice. for context, please put yourself in this situation. i’ll be as honest as i can be so hopefully something comes out of this post. 

*you’re 28, feel like you have nothing going for you in your home town. you have nothing holding you back but family. have decent experience as an admin assistant so you’re leaving with the thought that it might take 2 months to get a job in the new state. you have suffered with depression for years but manage. you think this is also going to help with that and make some very important necessary changes in your life. i’m scared shitless of missing out on my family and also failing. i can’t imagine me doing all this just to end up right back in my room at my moms. no housing situation but it shouldn’t be that hard to find a roommate (saving first &amp;amp;amp; last to be ready)*

reddit, what would you do? i’m just really nervous/anxious and honestly scared. i’ll be the first in my family to move out of state. again no one knows that i’m doing this

I am honestly swamped with work and stress and have considered leaving the company myself, but feel like if I stay, I can negotiate a higher pay rate or position.

How would one go about negotiating such a pay raise? Would I wait until my yearly review? I receive a yearly raise and bonus from the company anyways, but feel like I deserve more than the standard percentage typically given. What can I reasonably ask for?

646,"There are some extra details I’ll add before I post the full thing. So, we had hung out last week and finally, after building some courage, I asked to hold his hand. I used the caveat of how I hold hands with all of my friends (which is true) and all of the reasons why I love doing it. It is one of my most favorite intimate gestures between friends, and I love the connection it creates whenever I do it. Besides, I am so huggy and lovey with my friends, holding hands is a drop in the ocean compared to what I do with my besties. 

After nearly five hours of hanging out that night, having gone to the drive in theatre again and just talking, I asked if he wanted to hold hands. He took my hand and we interlocked our fingers and I asked if he held hands with his friends. He said no, he never does. So I gathered up all the balls i could and asked if he had been flirting with me at all. He said “no, god no. When I flirt it’s obvious” and I had to feign my relief. So as far as he can tell, we are on the same page. Here is where things get interesting. 

A day or so later I invite him to a bonfire with my friends. My closest friends. He comes and he gets to meet them. I had told him that if he thinks the affection I’ve given him is anything, that he has another thing coming when it comes to these people. My two besties, both guys, hug me and cuddle with me (and each other) whenever we are together. There was a cuddle pile at one point while Alex (his not real name) watched on. We offered to let him join in but of course he declined. So we get back in the car as I take him home (a good 30-40 minute drive) and it had gotten cold out. He tells me “yeah I understand now what you mean with your friends. You’re like that all the time?” And I say “yeah! Isn’t it great!” And he laughs. I say “do you wanna hold hands then?” And he goes “if you want to” and I nod and then there is nothing. My hands were freezing so I say “I actually really do, my hands are very cold” and he goes “ah ok yes” and interlocking fingers come back into play. We hold hands the whole way back. He had to let go for a moment to scratch his neck or something and I do the open-closed squeezy hand gesture to give me his hand back. He goes “I think your hand is warm now “ with a laugh and I say “I don’t care” and he takes my hand again. Smiles. 

We hug goodnight, and it’s tight like the first one. I tell him how happy I was he finally met my friends. He says he had fun. Now comes the most recent development. 

I broke the rules. I’m not allowed to have anyone over during the week and I’m certainly not allowed to do stuff behind my parent’s backs but I did it for him. I had a weird night and invited him over to sit in the garden with me while I had some tea in my sleep clothes. So I offered, and after his shift he came. His car was nice and quiet too. So we walk down the driveway into the garden where I have seats set up. Under the terrace, and even he says he thinks it looks cool/nice. We talk about the fact my co worker asked me out, how it made me feel bad because I had to very softly turn the guy down, and then we just talk for nearly two hours. 

We talk about things, like literally boob sizes. He said that A through D they’re all great. And I go what??? Really? He said yeah, 70% of guys probably feel the same way. And I tell him he’s a great man for thinking that 😂. I tell him about how basically until the end of sophomore year I had a size A cup. He goes “aye, itty bitty titty committee” and I go “truly” and laugh. He talks about his ex with D cups, and I go “omg were they bouncy” and he says “did you just ask ‘were they bouncy’?” With the biggest smile. I go “yeah!” He tilts his head back and laughs. He says I should know, im a girl. I go yeah, but like D cups? Come on. He said yeah, they were 😂😂😂 

We talk about more stuff and then he mentions how literally everyone stares at me at work. I say “what?” He goes “yeah, everyone looks at you. Especially the men” and I go “I didn’t even notice. A lot of the women stare at you too” and he says he never notices. Then he says the men stare at me and this other coworker (a minor) and it makes him kinda mad. I was internally thinking “he looks doesn’t he”. He even said “yeah, sometimes you’ll be ringing a guy out and I’ll just be watching and they are just looking at you in this way” and I’m like “I never even pay attention”. We then talk about physical affection and our friends and he says he is just not the most affectionate person. I say “for someone who isn’t affectionate, you give pretty decent hugs, of course there is room for improvement though” even though there really isn’t. He says he usually tries just to give his friends the side hug and I go “you don’t give me those” and he said “yeah I do, last one I gave you was a side hug” and I go “after the bonfire? No sir it was not.” And he goes “yeah it was... wait, I’m a liar. No it wasn’t, you’re right.” I say “yeah, I am. Come on now”. This hug detail will be important later. 

We even briefly discuss my love of necks, and drawing them (Im an artist) and somehow that warped into discussing choking. I was like 😳😳😳 and He says “are you like... into choking?” And I’m like “AHAH only a little, you?” And he goes “not on me, no” and I go “on someone else?” And he goes “never tried it” and I say he is missing out. That point aside, my lady boner was huge. 

I had told him that because of my height usually people are just smushed right into le titties when they hug me if they are shorter (I am a tall female). He goes “I was JUST about to say, when you our co worker that one time, his head was RIGHT there “ and I say I’m sure he was loving it and we both laugh. So during the conversation we held a pretty constant eye contact, aside for when the occasional sexual thing was brought up. He would sometimes abruptly look away only to turn his head back and look at me in the eyes again. Like we spoke of eating out girls or something and at the beginning he said how he likes doing it and then swiftly turns away before looking back at me and we laugh. Just a little thing I noticed. So then, he feels in his pocket and goes “hey, you wanna hit this?” It’s his dab pen. I go “oh hell yeah” and he says he didn’t even think he had it in his pocket.      A tiny aside - i has made myself some tea, I had offered him a drink of it if he wanted, and he said he probably wouldn’t like it. I told him I put honey in it, and he asked what kind of tea it was and I told him it was peppermint and herbal tea. So he takes the cup and drinks it, says it “tastes like Christmas!” With a cute smile. Anyway, I’m coughing and trying to be quiet and he picks up the cup and in a bad british accent goes “some tea?” And I take it, smile, and thank him.      I hit the pen two more times before he goes. He then says “oh I know the perfect thing to get you for your birthday” and I go “???” Visibly. “My birthday?” And he says “yeah, I could get you a pre rolled joint”. And I go “that is so nice. I’d love that.”  Caught me off guard. 

I ask what he would want for his birthday. He says “alcohol and marijuana” and laughs. He says he wants a whole lot of it. I go “I can arrange that” and I ask if he is gonna have a party. He says “yeah but I’ll probably save it for the summer.” I say “oh :/“ (I will be moving in the spring) and he goes “ohhhh, yeah... Well you and I can do something for it too before then” and I say “really?” And he says “yeah, of course”. My heart exploded. We then discuss how we are when we are drunk. He tells me he is loud, obnoxious, and interrupts people when he is drunk. I ask him what he thinks I’m like, when I’m drunk, if he had to guess. He goes “sad” and I go “NO I’m not sad when I’m drunk 😂” he goes “hmmmm ok tired? I’m giving all my guesses here” and I go “I’m more lovey” and he says “yeah I’m not” and laughs. I say “that’s fine I’m lovey enough for everyone 😂”. I just like to be all nice and huggy and it’s great, I tell him. 

We talk about a few more things but the time for him to leave approaches because I don’t wanna get in trouble and he doesn’t want me to either. 

We walk back to his car, and as we walk we just chat. The full moon is out, the clouds had parted a while before. We walk kinda close. Closer than how we usually walk. I told him I never break the rules like this but it’s fun. As we get to his car he turns to me and says “you probably want a hug now right?” And kinda opens his arms. I back away a bit and say “you don’t have to if you don’t want to.” He says “what?” I say “I don’t want you to feel like you have to hug me :/“ and he says “no, you usually ask for one, so...” and opens his arms a bit more. I smile, and walk to him. My arms over his shoulders. His arms tightly around my lower waist. I had my blanket (I had a blanket with me the whole time) around my shoulders and it draped down my back and it was squished with both of us. I settle into the hug and I thank him. He says “of course” (after I have to repeat myself because I spoke a little softly). I say the hug is nice and he says yeah. We hugged for at least 30 seconds. He was swaying side to side lightly too, and I just kinda rocked with it, and I felt him kinda settle into it too when he leaned his head near mine. We pull away, his hands were gentle but firm where they were. I have my hands on his arms and thank him one more time and he says of course. I wave to him as I back away, and he gets into his car and turns it on quietly. He then leaves his lights off and backs out, and I walk back to the house. 

We then make the arrangement that whenever I know I can get away with hanging out in the garden when my parents are asleep, that it will be an open invitation. And he seemed pretty keen on the idea. Now, we are gonna hang out tomorrow night and wow. 


If you read through that whole novel, thank you. Even though Alex says he is not flirting, it certainly seemed like he was the other night. Offering to hug me on his own? That was a first, especially considering he is not affectionate with his friends in the way I am with mine. Our knees touched a fair bit, only lightly. I would appreciate any advice on how to move forward, or what your thoughts on the whole situation is. I know I sound crazy for putting so many details but I figure they help show how he acts with me and I him.",03Sep2020,1
647,"My mom overfed the family dog with dog treats, which a) made the dog overweight b) gave the dog diarrhoea for a month. I tried to stop her multiple but she would just get mad, telling me she knows better how to take care of dogs. At some point we visited the vet and the vet told my mother that the dog has to go on a diet. Finally my mother agreed and I told her I'm doing the diet plan. 

What do you know, two days later the diarrhoea is gone and the dog is as happy as she hasn't been in years. 

A few days later my mother knocks on the door and basically plays victim. ""Oh my god I can barely sleep because I've got such a bad conscience for overfeeding the dog."", which I ignored. She then kept going ""I feel so bad I could literally cry."" to which I then answered ""Good, you're an adult and you have to live with the consequences, you probably did cost the dog years of her life (she has been overweight for a long time) so a little regret on your part is only fair."" When she noticed that I'm not giving her pity she started crying, saying she is so sorry etc.

Today I go downstairs and my mom is secretly feeding my dog treats she shouldn't have. She tried to hide them, but was unsuccessful and got mad at me when I confronted her.

648,"Whenever I sensed an argument coming and both parties started to become aggressive, I will have that rational brain kick in and tell me 'this isn't going anywhere' and made me just abruptly stop it by replying something like ""well, anyways. That doesn't matter.""

But deep inside me I know I'm afraid of arguing with others... which led me to wonder if I actually tricked myself into believing that I'm just rational enough to stop the arguing, while the truth is I'm just too afraid to continue. 

A real example is just now I ranted about 'my lecture is hard', then my roomie immediately snapped back with 'well who's doesn't' and I elaborated further how hard my lecture is and she snapped again 'who's doesn't'. Like this is just a rant and I didn't compare it with hers and said hers is easy... Her reaction is just so unreasonable. I immediately wanted to fight back but I sensed the aggressiveness in the air and just stopped abruptly in the middle of the sentence. And now I'm still frustrated but don't know how to spit it out...

My mum has always been a drinker when me and my sister was younger but I was too young to know anything about / care at the time. 

Now that I'm 19 and matured a whole lot I have been noticing that my mum buys a lot of alcohol just for herself (around 4 - 5 bottles of wine plus a crate of cider, just for the weekend!) She isn't abusive she is a lovely woman and cares a whole lot about our family but I'm starting to worry for her health when she is drinking this much alcohol, she will also end up going to the pub tonight with her friends getting tipsy coming home and drinking the wine on top of what she has had at the pub and pass out on the sofa at around 2am every night. 

She will drink a lot on weekdays also and still fall asleep on the sofa and wake up really early in the morning to get into bed, it's gotten so bad me and my sister are able to predict when she is going to wake up / when she will fall asleep because it's just in her routine now. I have no clue how she is able to get up for work the next morning without feeling like utter cr\*p / hungover.

This is why I need advice, I want to confront her about it but I know that she will get really sh\*tty about it and say that it is nothing / nothing to worry about, But it is something to worry about since I care about her and her health.

All I'm asking for is some ideas on what to do / how to help her, my dad works away at sea and comes home for periods of time and he also knows about this but no one has done anything to try and stop her and just letting her do it.

TL;DR: My mum drinks a whole lot of alcohol during the weekdays and weekends and I am worried about her health but I don't know how to confront her about it because she will just brush it off or get really sh\*tty and defensive about it.",03Sep2020,1
653,"So basically I bought a Fitbit awhile back, not as much for the exercise but for the silent alarm. I want to wake up at 5am so I get stuff I need to done, but my family wakes up at 8am. 

Since my family works at home late, I can never get to bed until 11-midnight every night, so I end up sleeping until like 11am, and by that point it’s embarrassing. I can going to add a couple more alarms on my Fitbit, is there any advice you all have?",03Sep2020,1

I still wanna do something though, I'm just not sure what or how to go about it. I thought about doing an online Halloween movie night like we all watch the same movies at the same time, or maybe doing like a video chat party where we're all on like a Skype chat.

I finally thought of an online secret Santa, or gift exchange thing but for Halloween where we could all send one person like they're favorite candy and maybe some gifts, but I'm not sure how to go about it? How could I do an online drawing properly?",03Sep2020,1

658,"tl;dr: I don't want to pay an obscene amount of money for a piece of paper, what else can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I'm a teen in the USA, so I'm expected to go to college when I'm done with high school. I'm not sure exactly what career I want, but that's not a good enough reason to argue with anyone about why I don't want to go to college unless I have a good plan, which I don't yet. I dislike going to school, though I still get decent grades. I'm just generally lazy, introverted, and unmotivated, so I only do school out of obligation and so my family isn't on my case. I'm more passionate about other things, like art which a degree probably won't help much with, but I'm doing that more for a hobby and it'd be hard to make money off of it anyway. So for work, I'm considering computer science, but I'm not hyper-passionate about that, at least not right now.

I've heard that getting a degree is almost required for any decently paying employers to hire people like me, but I've also heard that despite their degrees some people just get into shitty jobs anyway and get stuck with debt they can barely pay off. I want to either have a better chance at getting a decent job or getting less debt.

The easiest routes I've considered are going to a community college and transferring to a 4-year or going to a different place like a trade school or a coding bootcamp. Community college + transfer is definitely cheaper than only going to a 4-year, but still takes up time and money. Trade schools and coding bootcamps are also less expensive, are more specialized, and take up less time, but I'm unsure if they allow for job opportunities the same way a bachelor's degree does.

Another idea I'm considering is flipping the finger to the US and moving abroad for college and seeing if I can emigrate, but I don't know how much that will cost. (*I'm just considering that because based on my most likely biased and incomplete research I'm starting to believe there is a lot wrong with the US.*)

I could also just go straight into the workforce and put off college until I've made up my mind, but my family will be pissed and I may or may not (*most likely may not afaik*) be able to move out if I choose a shitty minimum income job.

Lastly, I could go to the military, and I'm not going to because I'm stubborn and am bad at following orders. :  )

I need some second opinions on this. I'd like more information on the different options I listed above, or if you've done something else, tell me about it.",03Sep2020,1

(This is the most [recent ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ia8r15/he_20m_spent_several_hours_with_me_20f_watching/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) update before this one, to anyone interested in reading a whole lot about one crazy girl (me))There are some extra details I’ll add before I post the full thing. So, we had hung out last week and finally, after building some courage, I asked to hold his hand. I used the caveat of how I hold hands with all of my friends (which is true) and all of the reasons why I love doing it. It is one of my most favorite intimate gestures between friends, and I love the connection it creates whenever I do it. Besides, I am so huggy and lovey with my friends, holding hands is a drop in the ocean compared to what I do with my besties. 

After nearly five hours of hanging out that night, having gone to the drive in theatre again and just talking, I asked if he wanted to hold hands. He took my hand and we interlocked our fingers and I asked if he held hands with his friends. He said no, he never does. So I gathered up all the balls i could and asked if he had been flirting with me at all. He said “no, god no. When I flirt it’s obvious” and I had to feign my relief. So as far as he can tell, we are on the same page. Here is where things get interesting. 

A day or so later I invite him to a bonfire with my friends. My closest friends. He comes and he gets to meet them. I had told him that if he thinks the affection I’ve given him is anything, that he has another thing coming when it comes to these people. My two besties, both guys, hug me and cuddle with me (and each other) whenever we are together. There was a cuddle pile at one point while Alex (his not real name) watched on. We offered to let him join in but of course he declined. So we get back in the car as I take him home (a good 30-40 minute drive) and it had gotten cold out. He tells me “yeah I understand now what you mean with your friends. You’re like that all the time?” And I say “yeah! Isn’t it great!” And he laughs. I say “do you wanna hold hands then?” And he goes “if you want to” and I nod and then there is nothing. My hands were freezing so I say “I actually really do, my hands are very cold” and he goes “ah ok yes” and interlocking fingers come back into play. We hold hands the whole way back. He had to let go for a moment to scratch his neck or something and I do the open-closed squeezy hand gesture to give me his hand back. He goes “I think your hand is warm now “ with a laugh and I say “I don’t care” and he takes my hand again. Smiles. 

We hug goodnight, and it’s tight like the first one. I tell him how happy I was he finally met my friends. He says he had fun. Now comes the most recent development. 

I broke the rules. I’m not allowed to have anyone over during the week and I’m certainly not allowed to do stuff behind my parent’s backs but I did it for him. I had a weird night and invited him over to sit in the garden with me while I had some tea in my sleep clothes. So I offered, and after his shift he came. His car was nice and quiet too. So we walk down the driveway into the garden where I have seats set up. Under the terrace, and even he says he thinks it looks cool/nice. We talk about the fact my co worker asked me out, how it made me feel bad because I had to very softly turn the guy down, and then we just talk for nearly two hours. 

We talk about things, like literally boob sizes. He said that A through D they’re all great. And I go what??? Really? He said yeah, 70% of guys probably feel the same way. And I tell him he’s a great man for thinking that 😂. I tell him about how basically until the end of sophomore year I had a size A cup. He goes “aye, itty bitty titty committee” and I go “truly” and laugh. He talks about his ex with D cups, and I go “omg were they bouncy” and he says “did you just ask ‘were they bouncy’?” With the biggest smile. I go “yeah!” He tilts his head back and laughs. He says I should know, im a girl. I go yeah, but like D cups? Come on. He said yeah, they were 😂😂😂 

We talk about more stuff and then he mentions how literally everyone stares at me at work. I say “what?” He goes “yeah, everyone looks at you. Especially the men” and I go “I didn’t even notice. A lot of the women stare at you too” and he says he never notices. Then he says the men stare at me and this other coworker (a minor) and it makes him kinda mad. I was internally thinking “he looks doesn’t he”. He even said “yeah, sometimes you’ll be ringing a guy out and I’ll just be watching and they are just looking at you in this way” and I’m like “I never even pay attention”. We then talk about physical affection and our friends and he says he is just not the most affectionate person. I say “for someone who isn’t affectionate, you give pretty decent hugs, of course there is room for improvement though” even though there really isn’t. He says he usually tries just to give his friends the side hug and I go “you don’t give me those” and he said “yeah I do, last one I gave you was a side hug” and I go “after the bonfire? No sir it was not.” And he goes “yeah it was... wait, I’m a liar. No it wasn’t, you’re right.” I say “yeah, I am. Come on now”. This hug detail will be important later. 

We even briefly discuss my love of necks, and drawing them (Im an artist) and somehow that warped into discussing choking. I was like 😳😳😳 and He says “are you like... into choking?” And I’m like “AHAH only a little, you?” And he goes “not on me, no” and I go “on someone else?” And he goes “never tried it” and I say he is missing out. That point aside, my lady boner was huge. 

I had told him that because of my height usually people are just smushed right into le titties when they hug me if they are shorter (I am a tall female). He goes “I was JUST about to say, when you our co worker that one time, his head was RIGHT there “ and I say I’m sure he was loving it and we both laugh. So during the conversation we held a pretty constant eye contact, aside for when the occasional sexual thing was brought up. He would sometimes abruptly look away only to turn his head back and look at me in the eyes again. Like we spoke of eating out girls or something and at the beginning he said how he likes doing it and then swiftly turns away before looking back at me and we laugh. Just a little thing I noticed. So then, he feels in his pocket and goes “hey, you wanna hit this?” It’s his dab pen. I go “oh hell yeah” and he says he didn’t even think he had it in his pocket. —A tiny aside - i had made myself some tea, I had offered him a drink of it if he wanted, and he said he probably wouldn’t like it. I told him I put honey in it, and he asked what kind of tea it was and I told him it was peppermint and herbal tea. So he takes the cup and drinks it, says it “tastes like Christmas!” With a cute smile. Anyway, I’m coughing and trying to be quiet and he picks up the cup and in a bad british accent goes “some tea?” And I take it, smile, and thank him. — I hit the pen two more times before he goes. He then says “oh I know the perfect thing to get you for your birthday” and I go “???” Visibly. “My birthday?” And he says “yeah, I could get you a pre rolled joint”. And I go “that is so nice. I’d love that.”  Caught me off guard. 

I ask what he would want for his birthday. He says “alcohol and marijuana” and laughs. He says he wants a whole lot of it. I go “I can arrange that” and I ask if he is gonna have a party. He says “yeah but I’ll probably save it for the summer.” I say “oh :/“ (I will be moving in the spring) and he goes “ohhhh, yeah... Well you and I can do something for it too before then” and I say “really?” And he says “yeah, of course”. My heart exploded. We then discuss how we are when we are drunk. He tells me he is loud, obnoxious, and interrupts people when he is drunk. I ask him what he thinks I’m like, when I’m drunk, if he had to guess. He goes “sad” and I go “NO I’m not sad when I’m drunk 😂” he goes “hmmmm ok tired? I’m giving all my guesses here” and I go “I’m more lovey” and he says “yeah I’m not” and laughs. I say “that’s fine I’m lovey enough for everyone 😂”. I just like to be all nice and huggy and it’s great, I tell him. 

We talk about a few more things but the time for him to leave approaches because I don’t wanna get in trouble and he doesn’t want me to either. 

We walk back to his car, and as we walk we just chat. The full moon is out, the clouds had parted a while before. We walk kinda close. Closer than how we usually walk. I told him I never break the rules like this but it’s fun. As we get to his car he turns to me and says “you probably want a hug now right?” And kinda opens his arms. I back away a bit and say “you don’t have to if you don’t want to.” He says “what?” I say “I don’t want you to feel like you have to hug me :/“ and he says “no, you usually ask for one, so...” and opens his arms a bit more. I smile, and walk to him. My arms over his shoulders. His arms tightly around my lower waist. I had my blanket (I had a blanket with me the whole time) around my shoulders and it draped down my back and it was squished with both of us. I settle into the hug and I thank him. He says “of course” (after I have to repeat myself because I spoke a little softly). I say the hug is nice and he says yeah. We hugged for at least 30 seconds. He was swaying side to side lightly too, and I just kinda rocked with it, and I felt him kinda settle into it too when he leaned his head near mine. We pull away, his hands were gentle but firm where they were. I have my hands on his arms and thank him one more time and he says of course. I wave to him as I back away, and he gets into his car and turns it on quietly. He then leaves his lights off and backs out, and I walk back to the house. 

We then make the arrangement that whenever I know I can get away with hanging out in the garden when my parents are asleep, that it will be an open invitation. And he seemed pretty keen on the idea. Now, we are gonna hang out tomorrow night and wow. 


If you read through that whole novel, thank you. Even though Alex says he is not flirting, it certainly seemed like he was the other night. Offering to hug me on his own? That was a first, especially considering he is not affectionate with his friends in the way I am with mine. Our knees touched a fair bit, only lightly. I would appreciate any advice on how to move forward, or what your thoughts on the whole situation is. I know I sound crazy for putting so many details but I figure they help show how he acts with me and I him.",03Sep2020,1

662,"8 months ago, I was removed from a prestigious program because I was unable to maintain a semesterly GPA requirement.... this was due to health reasons. Although I am trying to appeal to get back into the program, there’s obviously a chance it won’t work out.

Since my dismissal, I’ve been quite depressed. I had to transfer schools and basically start all over. I feel like all the hard work I did to get into the program was a waste. All the expensive tuition was a waste.

I feel too depressed to do school now. I’m barely studying for exams and finishing assignments last minute.

663,"Long post ahead, first i'm going to tell you what prompted me to write this. Let me tell you that my cousin and I are from a very southern and conservative family. I live in a more open country area and she lives near a more ghetto area, so i'm completely out of my comfort zone this entire time. So yesterday my cousin invited me to go hang out with her and her friend in town, I was thinking ""Maybe we'll go get some food and walk around and have a good time."" I'm on my way there when she tell me to meet her on top of a parking garage. I thought that was a little weird we could just walk down. I show up and she and her friend are dressed like hookers, bright red lipstick, the lowest cut shirt I have ever seen, and a very high miniskirt. I am shocked because I have never seen her dress like this and we're both 16 years old. Then not 5 minutes after I arrive my cousin (Abby) and her friend (Chloe, not their real names) find 2 random people neither they nor I have ever met to hang out with. They don't even trade names and they just follow us. We walk down and sit at some bench and I've barely even said a word to anybody. Another random dude shows up and sits down with us and for a solid 30 minutes I am just sitting there while these dudes just don't ever stop talking about smoking weed and doing gang stuff. I asked Abby if maybe we could go get some food and she just said ""no"". We go back on top of the parking garage and Abby give her number to this person she met not even an hour ago whose name she doesn't even know. Then one of the guys and Abby start joking about ""Getting in the back seat"" and how ""He wont be able to stop himself if she does"". I am in shock just standing there listening to this dude talk about how he wants to fuck my cousin. Then another guy shows up and this time it's Abby's boyfriend, the other three dudes leave not even 10 minutes after her boyfriend arrives. So now its just me, Abby and her boyfriend, and Chloe. For the past hour Chloe has been asking to leave and go to Abby's house but Abby keeps saying no because her boyfriends coming. I am bored out of my mind just standing there. Why did you even invite me if we're just going to stand on top of a parking garage for 2 hours. Eventually I just leave and I am pissed off because I know this is a common occurrence for her. I wouldn't be surprised to find out she is pregnant or addicted to drugs or something. I cannot sit idly by while she is being so unbelievably stupid. Me and Abby's father are good friends and I feel like I should talk to him about this. Please give me suggestions on what to do because my cousin is like a sister to me and if anything we're to happen I wouldn't know what to do.",03Sep2020,1

So I yesterday a girl I know for more than a year rejected me telling me « it’s complicated for me right now ».

I feel very bad about this, I’m 21 and it’s the first time I go on dates with a girl (and get rejected).


However today she sent me the same snapchat pictures about her life that she sends to her friends as if nothing had happened yesterday, so obviously she still wants to be friends.

666,"TL;DR extreme skin issues made cleaning myself and using hygiene products (even hypoallergenic and natural ones) very painful all through my life, now my skin is better and I realize I associate hygiene with pain. Any advice on how to change this?

Through most of my life I had EXTREME eczema. I hesitate to even call it eczema because eczema is usually something that comes and goes and is in one area of your body, I feel the name doesn't do it justice, it was like I was covered in fire ants on top of a sunburn that never got better. I was uncomfortable sitting still, and in pain even during the slightest movement. I could go on and on about how much it fucked me up physically and mentally.

Now I've been on this incredible ""bio drug"" for less than a year and it's completely changed my life, my body almost functions normally. This introduces some unforseen challenges.

Water is a very irritating substance for my extreme eczema. Most people feel clean after a shower, but I would always come out with red hot inflamed skin (temp of water, hard or soft water, filter or no filter, didn't matter), and it would stay that way through the rest of the day and some of the next day. I'd shower maybe twice a week. Since just plain water is THAT irritating, you can probably guess most hygiene products were out of the question for me, yes, even ""hypoallergenic"" and ""sensitive skin"" products just caused me intense pain. But now my skin is normal(ish) and I NEED to shower, wash face and hands, brush my teeth (moving my lips was soooo painful because my eczema was the most intense on my face around my mouth and eyes, even the feeling of bristles on my teeth felt over stimulating, holding my mouth open to floss has always been out of the question as my lips would literally split open and bleed every time), etc. Now I just have anxiety even though the pain isn't really an issue anymore.

To be clear, I DO clean myself, it just causes me a lot of stress and is more like a chore than a personalized routine. Any advice on how to make hygiene less scary, more pleasurable, and less full of shame would be appreciated, even sharing your routine would be helpful. I am a very feminine (25yo) girl, so I get very ashamed that I don't have all this knowledge on cleanliness, much less how to have glowing skin, great makeup, how to do my hair, etc.",03Sep2020,1
667,"I apologise for the negative and lengthy post but I feel the urge to connect with someone-anybody who can relate or offer me some nurturing energy while I’m currently living through one of my lowest points so far. 

To begin with, COVID has fucked me royally regarding my profession. My roster has significantly reduced from a rough 15-25hrs a week to 5-7. This aside, my employer has failed to provide me security on pervious occasions. I have an employee for 3 years in November, I have begged for hours only to be given false hope again and again, it has been extremely disappointing and has effected my drive towards the work I carry out. Thankfully the world wasn’t in a pandemic when work was an initial concern so I was able to pick up casual work when I needed it. Now I’m not so lucky. 

The reason keeping me from leaving my employer and why I haven’t already is simply because they are paying me for my time to study my cert 4 out of their expense, a certificate that is hopefully my ticket into my bachelor of education I’m ineligible to study currently. I am really unhappy there regardless of why I’m sticking it out and I feel anxious whenever anything work related comes to mind or is bought up, just like I don’t even want to go there. I even handed in a letter of resignation a while back although I was asked to reconsider, approached by management which resulted in me actively continuing my only income of 5-7 hours. Roughly $170 a week to try to live off. 

So, Centrelink right? Since my employer is considered a “charity based organisation” this exempts me from claiming the job keeper scheme. I am also unable to claim job keeper as I am technically still actively working. This leaves me in an extremely unfortunate situation with huge backlash effecting my lifestyle and mental health. Although I am struggling financially worse than ever, my main challenge at the moment is all the time I have to waste and do nothing and trying not to allow negativity take over. 

Now, going into my mental health for the past while. I want to take the time to thank anyone who has invested in reading this far into my post, being heard is all I really want. 

Straight off the bat to provide a better feel for the story, I’ve experimented with almost every drug you can think of aside from heroine or GHB. I seem to have always had the ability to use without it effecting my day to day as much as I can help it, although I’ve been smoking weed since I was 13 and as of the last few years daily. It’s also important to note I have been diagnosed twice with bi-polar 2 and most recently medicated accordingly. (200mg seroquel, 40mg fluoxetine). 2017 was my initial diagnosis and again within the past 3 months. I understand and can recognise both my manic and depressive states, and have developed much more control over how I channel the intensity within me. Despite my progress in managing my issues, I’m ready to openly admit I’ve suffered for roughly the past 18 months whilst diving into a deep, steep decline facing unavoidable depression along with the most extreme mania I have experienced so far, as well as no direction of where to begin looking within myself for clarity and understanding. 

Timing, I understand is a big part of my current circumstance and unfortunately COVID happened at the worst time possible for me, whilst riding one of the most disconnected periods of my life I am unable to distract myself or leave the house to clear my mind and am stuck in my space of negativity. I’m stuck without work 6 days a week, addicted to smoking bongs, and in the midst of a deep seeded depression without any idea how and where to start to help myself. 

I don’t want there to be any misconception- I have witnessed my sister, and two closest friends from childhood all taken by meth. I watched my two closest friends and older sister face the worst possible consequences of this drug, ruining their most precious relationships, stripping their values and identity to feed their addiction. My sister caused irreversible damage to the dynamic of our family which has been previously pointed out by a mental health professional and suggested is potentially coming to surface as PTSD later in my life. there was nothing I could do when my friend was living out of their car for 8 months with nothing to live for. Thankfully I was lucky enough to never lose these 3 people entirely, friend a) who was living in their car is now completely clean 7 months and friend b) who is still using yet is at this stage managing to be a functional addict. Despite the hell I experienced thanks to methamphetamine, I’m thankful it presented itself without illusions so early in my life. 

Now, to add to what’s already difficult to follow... friend b) (still using) has been laying low at my house while they have some shit going on, waiting for things to blow over. Since we were teenagers we have always dabbled in drugs together, friend b) formed a pretty nasty habit for meth &amp; benzos from a young age, amazingly still kicking just fine. So anyway using with him on occasion is pretty typical, I’m usually always down for a big night together as long as it never interfered with my commitments and priorities. For example I wouldn’t join in on a Tuesday night if I had work on the Wednesday. Although throw me a bag Friday night and I’ll get weird no questions lol. 

So between all the factors I just went through it’s safe to say I’m overwhelmed at minimum and have almost accepted my mental health for what it is, i’m lacking fight and motivation to work towards my aspirations, with no clue where to turn or where to start.. I haven’t felt so far from my inner peace for a long time. 

without saying too much friend b) has supply of meth 24/7... I used and talked shit for hours for the first time after reconciliation after a falling out which lasted months. It was a really was a good experience and high for both parties. I began asking/being offered a pipe a couple times a week while my friend had been staying here and after taking the pipe each time its offered I’ve been flying fried each time I used. Loving and hating the experience at once. 

As long as I’ve known what meth was and experienced it’s effects second hand, I told myself I’d never allow it to have a grip on me. I am well aware meth is one if not the most cunning of drugs and I’m really playing with fire here. Please spare me that comment. 

Despite what I’ve seen and told myself surrounding meth, I’m now finding myself thinking of it often, dreaming of it, and when I see photos or videos its appealing to me like I haven’t experienced before. I definitely don’t feel addicted but I have been smoking roughly a point or two roughly every few days. I’m concerned I’m on the path to slipping 
into addiction despite previously having no problem using recreationally. 

I’m living in such a slump and feel as though I’m shoulders deep in the overwhelming amount of building pressure surrounding my current situation. I just want to roll over and accept a very mediocre life for myself because sorting myself seems near impossible and extremely consuming. I see I am so far from myself that I worry of losing myself and pray my zest for life will return before it’s too late. I need to save myself but so lost as to where to start..... it’s near impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel lately. I don’t see much to look forward to. Often I just feel my life isn’t worth the effort. 

This is also effecting my relationship with my family and how comfortable I feel in my own home. I understand this is my own internal struggle although when my mother reminds me  abruptly and insensitively of everything wrong in my life, it clarifies to me I still need to face it despite the strong sense of panic and stress it creates. I don’t think she realises a harsh attack on my behaviour is the worst possible way to approach me currently. I sat to my partner crying for an hour last night after my mum made made a point she and my dad have noticed I have no motivation and basically they aren’t impressed. It really hit me how unhappy I am and I for the first time in a long time accepted I need to work on myself. 

Any advice, someone to listen, not judge and recognise a cry for help as a brave step would make me feel not so alone. Really struggling to find the liveliness in myself that is so desperately wanting to burst and live a life without suffering and doubt",03Sep2020,1
668,The COVID cases are getting worse and worse near me and at my work they are accepting can returns for the deposit back on the can. It is not clean at all people don’t wash their cans or their hands. I was already scared of getting and I lived with my grandparents who are much older. They are also terrified and I don’t want to be the person that gives it to them. I am debating on walking into work and telling them this and taking immediate leave of work for the time being. When it first started we stop taking cans but now that it is worse we are taking them again.  It makes no sense to me but would I get in trouble for this even tho they have me schedule?,03Sep2020,1
669,"So, I was 17 and he was 18. I’m Australian and he lived in New York. He was Pakistani, and we met on that MSN chat thing everyone used to use back in the day.

We’d chat for hours and hours. We exchanged letters and developed a really good friendship.

I never got to know what he looked like, and he never knew what I looked like either. I didn’t care what he looked like - I valued him for his words, and his gentle nature that came through in his conversations with me.

In mid 2001, I was studying and in between this, we were emailing back and forth. On a spur of the moment thing, I sent him a photo of a rope with a knot in it. He asked what it meant and I asked him if he wanted to marry me. He said yes, and I felt like the happiest person alive. I hadn’t worked out how we were going to actually get married, but all the hard stuff could come later, right? 

We were in frequent contact until 9/11. When I hadn’t heard from him in a few days I didn’t worry - he lived in New York, after all. I didn’t know what the situation was there. He may have known someone who died, or perhaps was just so shocked over it that he wanted a break from social media. 
But when a month went by and I hadn’t heard anything, I started to worry. I worried that he’d died in the attacks. I worried that he’d been beaten or killed for being a Muslim. My emails and letters went unanswered, a couple of years later, my emails to him were bounced back, so I had to assume his account no longer existed. 

I’ve checked the list of victims who died on 9/11, and he isn’t among them. That gave me a huge sense of relief, but it didn’t answer the main question - where was he?

I often think of him, and I can’t help but sometimes consider myself married to him. I mean, I intended to marry him, after all. Every time I’ve thought about him over the years, I’ve always thought that I don’t care what he’s been doing or where he’s been, I just want to marry him like I promised way back in 2001. 

I’ve considered that I may have been strung along by someone pretending to be an 18 year old Pakistani man. My gut and my heart tell me that wasn’t the case. 
I wish I knew where he was. I still love him. I always have. 

Should I feel stupid over this? Is feeling like I’m married to a guy I haven’t spoken to in almost 20 years, and never even saw a weird thing?",03Sep2020,1
670,"My girlfriend and I met at college (we're both 20). I'm Scottish, but am studying here because I plan to go to an American medical school in the future.

So, my girlfriend's from Tennessee and I'm visiting her at her parents' house for the first time at the moment. They've been very welcoming to me and I've gotten some helpful pointers from her dad, who's a physician.

There's been a bit of weirdness about the sleeping arrangements though. They've put me in a spare bedroom on the opposite side of the house (it's quite big!). Her mum has joked around about this a little, but it all seems a bit strange to me, given that they must know that I've slept with their daughter loads of times already.

671,"Hello Reddit!

Obligatory mobile warning.

This morning on my way to work I stopped at the same 7-11 I always do. I was checking out at the counter and while I was standing there a young woman ran up to the door crying. A guy ran up behind her and slammed her into the door and grabbed her by the throat. She started banging on the glass and screaming for help. She looked genuinely horrified. I walked out the other door came up behind him and grabbed him around the chest and picked him up, turned around put him down and pushed him away from me. Putting myself between him and her. As far as I know she bolted because I never saw her again. My focus was on him, though. So I can't say for sure where she went. He had vomit running down the corners of his mouth and I could smell the booze on him. He immediately started swinging. He grazed me once on the nose, but other than that I just moved out of the way and stayed between him and where she was (had been?). I was just telling him to stop and trying to get him to walk away. He gave up swinging and grabbed me so I pushed him to the ground. At this point I had gathered that I had about forty pounds on him and was more concerned about de-escalating the situation than I was threatened by him. We grappled a bit and I put him on the ground a few more times. During the latter part of the grappling the clerk had come out and had started calling the guy by name and trying to get him to walk away. Eventually he walked off and I went back in to pay and go to work. The guy came into the store while I was paying. Apparently during the altercation I had broken his necklace and torn his jacket. He was screaming saying I was going to pay for it. I simply told him no and walked away. He shoved me into the counter. I turned and looked around and this is when I noticed I didn't see the girl anywhere and I simply went to work. He followed me into the parking lot calling me names and trying to get me to fight, but that simply wasn't my goal. 

My questions are did I handle this right? This was at 5:00AM and my concern was simply to get him away from her. 

Should I have called the police and waited for them? I figured she was gone and I was the last thing there agitating him so if I leave he should just stumble on home. 

Should I stop by there after work and speak to the store manager? I know the manager and she is not there during the graveyard shift. 

I'm on my lunch now and I'm just concerned that maybe I did something wrong. Also curious about some insight/perspective I may be overlooking.

674,"i had a girlfriend my sophomore year of high school. we dated for almost a year until she broke up with me to get with another guy. she broke up with me 3 days before the one year mark and they got together they day after what our one year should’ve been. that happened my junior year, october 2019. i kept thinking time will heal, but the only thing that has really changed is that i can keep my composure. i dream about her or the new guy constantly. i don’t mean to sound like a crazy ex or something, because i don’t say or do anything to them, it’s just something that’s still bringing me down. i’ve tried other girls, but i just haven’t felt anything like i did with her. it’s almost been a year and i just don’t know what else to do to get over it, other than wait. i’ve tried new hobbies, distractions, but there’s nothing that works. how do i get this out of my head? how do i not let this consume me anymore?",03Sep2020,1

676,"This is my first time posting this so please excuse me if this drones on. 

This first started when I was 17 years old. I met my ex at the library and I was just smitten with him. I'll spare you the details but our relationship was good for a while. He was 23 at the time. He had a carefree attitude on everything. 

I have experienced molestation and a family member raping me beforehand so I hadn't started talking about it until just recently so to me I was equating sex with love. He didn't take advantage of me at all but I ended up getting pregnant with our daughter. After giving him multiple times to get out of responsibility he finally took it and left me on x-mas. 

I was forced to make the best decision for my daughter's future and gave her up for adoption. Ten years go by and I now have a killer work ethic and a daughter with my now ex husband. I work two jobs  so I can keep a good hustle to ensure that I can take care of us both with little to no help.

My first daughter's father finds me to apologize for being a huge dick to me and tells me that he left me to be a hoe. Whatever to teach their own and I don't even blame him for it and I am better for it. I finally love my life and I even thank him for leaving because I have everything that I need. 

Now here is my issue. In the ten years since he left, he is now a felon and homeless. He is exactly the same person that he was when he was 23. I lost my daughter (because of my family and him leaving I was given the choice to keep her and be homeless with a baby or give her up) because he wanted to sleep around but there has been no character development in the last ten years and I just have this anger that I don't understand. He wants to keep a relationship between us and I think that this would be beneficial due to the fact that if our daughter comes looking it would be easier to know where he is and be able to just call him but every single time I talk to him, I just want to yell at him because he squandered his opportunity to live without that responsibility. Losing her doesn't seem to faze him at all and it has shaped me into the hard working good woman that I am. 

How can I deal with this anger because it doesn't seem to matter what i do to process this. I am talking to my TRAUMA counselor and working past my molestation and rape. This is just one more thing on that list.  

Thank you in advance for all your help and please don't start with the negativity because I have hurt myself more than any of you can so just don't waste time.",03Sep2020,1
677,"Well, you read the title. Throwaway because I have people I know on my main and I'd rather not have them know about this.

I'm a freshman in college right now, but back in middle school and freshman/sophomore year of high school, I had a really bad porn addiction. I watched it close to 6-7 times every day for about 6 years. Closer to the end of junior year I started realizing how unhealthy it was and started limiting myself, but little did I know that the damage was already done. The first time I noticed it was freshman year, with my first girlfriend. She didn't want to have sex without a condom, and I was perfectly okay with that, I just needed to buy them, but never really got around to it until a little bit into our relationship. Once I did, I was ecstatic to lose my virginity to this girl, as would any teenage boy who's about to have sex for the first time. We start getting into it, and I pull out the condom, and here's where the whole thing falls apart; in the 5-10 seconds that it took to pull out the condom, I went from hard as a rock to pretty much completely flaccid, and I'm not gonna lie, it was upsetting. I chalked it up to me just being nervous for my first time, and tried not to think much of it afterwards. Eventually she moved and we broke up. Junior year of high school I started dating a girl that I'll call Haley. Haley and I hadn't been dating for very long before we had sex, and it was great; there were no problems at all, and as irresponsible as I know it is, I didn't wear a condom. Since there weren't any problems, I thought this had solidified the previous experience of me just being nervous. But as time went on I noticed that it was becoming more and more difficult to keep an erection, and the smallest things would throw me off track. To give an example, if we were doing the deed and I thought of literally anything else that wasn't having sex, I would lose the erection. Of course there were times where I was really in the moment and there were no problems, but about 95% of the time I would lose focus and therefore lose my buddy. 

Not only is it aggravating, but it's extremely embarrassing to have to tell someone ""sorry, we can't really have sex anymore because I lost my boner"". I haven't spoken to my parents about it at all, and I'm not really sure why. I know they wouldn't embarrass me, it's just weird to open up to them about this. I have always wanted to go to a urologist but I know that it would be difficult to get any kind of prescription to help me because taking something like Viagra as someone who's only 19 can cause problems later on in life. I don't want to call it erectile dysfunction because I haven't been anywhere to get it checked out, but I'm terrified that that's what it could be. While it hasn't killed my sex drive, it killed my confidence to try and get a girl, which I suppose it just as bad. Sorry for the long read, any advice is welcome.

TL;DR- beat my meat so much in middle/high school that it is now extremely difficult for me to maintain an erection, which has killed my self confidence.",03Sep2020,1

So my mother found this ""guru"" guy on youtube who talks about our pagan religion that was persecuted. I myself follow that ""religion "" but the stuff this man is saying is off. He claimed that he was god, or like that our god is ""talking"" to him and telling him what to do.the thing is in our belief, that god doesn NOT talk to us not even the highest level shaman can talk to him so I'm already out off by him. He says a lot of other stuff and pretty much sh**s on other religions gods, saying their dead and stuff and all kinds of other stuff like how our people  will lead the ""path"" to spiritual evolution and paradise. He even said that he was the one who sent the Corona virus.

So obviously I dont like him. At first it was just her watching his videos everyday but then she started parroting the stuff he says and saying hateful things that I dont think she even realises. She wont listen to me even tho I keep pointing out his inconsistencies that dont aligne with our belief. But now shes TALKING to him, shes on face call talking to him and I eavesdropped a bit and he was getting her sympathy talking about how people ridicule him and stuff and shes over here uplifting him and telling him how great his message and videos are and all that. He hasn't asked for money or anything like that yet, but him sorta manipulating my mother to feel bad for him is seriously putting me off.
And what's concerning is that she wants to teach that stuff to my little brother, I wouldnt mind teaching him but the stuff she wants to teach him is nothing more than constantly worshipping this ""god"" and belittling other religions.That was never what our belief stood for.

Another thing, in our belief we have multiple deities and one is for earth her name is ""jer"" and shes a high ranking deity, but my mother is completly disrespecting her saying that shes not ""jer"" but that god instead, hes teaching stuff that goes completly against our beliefs and not only disrespecting other religions but also our own deities.
I had the liberty of not having anything forced onto me, I was even atheist for a large chunk of my life, I just wanted to reconnect with my ancestors beliefs but I dont want anything forced onto my brother. I want him to have that freedom to choose as well and I really dont mind teaching him the beliefs of our ancestors but I'm worried since that man is teaching to hate other religions.

689,"I guess the title is a good intro, but i gladly elaborate:

i went on some travels in my early twenties. After 3 years hoping on and off planes, busses and being in and out of short-term jobs i started to study to become a teacher in languages.

My goal back then was to have a job i can do all over the world and eventually go down the NGO path.

As a traditional Artist, which i did unsuccessfully on the side, mainly because i didn't take the time to do it seriously, i eventually got invited to do an internship at a lesser known designer in one of the fashion cities of europe. I interupted my studies and went. this was in 2017.

I went, but started to have minor financial problems, as i needed to pay everything by myself, eventually returning home to recover from being drained financially, physically and mentally. Working in fashion is simply a draining thing. I returned in early 2018.

During that year a relative got sick and i kinda got forced and asked into taking care of this person. I did it wholeheartedly until they passed away in late 2018.

Taking care of this person with cancer made me rethink a lot. I already faced death in late teens due to a medical condition which i survived but taking care of this person threw me back into the pain i felt then and i kinda went back into a ""not give a fuck"" state as nothing seems to matter anyway.

it took me a few months to come back on my feet. I did a last job (unpaid) at my old internship in 2019 as i thought it might help me get back on my previous track.

I was wrong. I kinda passed the summer sizzling around avoiding mayor decisions until i got in touch which some old friends who helped me a bit with my decisions. I ended up applying for a job in tropical overseas and i got it. I borrowed some cash, did what i had to do and was about to fly off this january.

A few days before christmas and basically my farewell party a fire burned my flat down which i was about to rent out. So i was stuck again. I went anyway for a month to my almost new home, as i had paid for everything already.

Shortly after returning the whole pandemic thing hit and as traumatic as it was, i couldn't but work on a few paintings and write some short stories.

Now i am somehow trying to rebuild my flat which, unavoidably, will make me face more depts. On the bright side i will be able to pay them back within a year, so nothing major.

I would like to continue my studies but only can in about a year. I'd need to move though, so additional costs. Just taking a job around here isn't too easy, as the only few available spots are hospitality and factory work. The job market is really down too. Also it wouldn't help with what i want to do anyway. 

After all this time that seems to be just ""wasted"" there don't seem to be too many options. At least nothing that will last: I thought about hitting the road and continue to write on the way, as it is cheaper to live in another place than here. Also i can live on the rent out money.

Trying my luck as an artist might work, but eventually if it doesn't and i don't have a college degree i will have to do some minimum wage jobs till whenever.

Do i still need time to heal off the past two years? Do i pressure myself too much? Am i acting spoiled? Don't i see the obvious?

Glad if someone could help.

This girl we can call her Aimee he was obsessed with for a good 4 months. She lives in another state and they got really close. Close to the point where he was talking to her whole family. In any case he and her went sour and he continued talking to her family. Her little sister 16 admitted she had feelings for him. He admitted he had feelings as well but nothing could happen because she’s a child/ minor. He talked about the moral problems and the legal. He told me that he plans to take a step back but still be her friend. This was all discomforting for me to hear. That even if he's not pursuing the fact that he has these feelings. I feel like he falls in love with whoever gives him attention. 

I'd also like to preface this by once apparently he went down on his ex gf when he felt the energy was off but she didn't say no. They're still good friends to this day and he's been spending his days trying to make it up her. And I can't forgive him for her but it seems she has....

i'm\[27f\] am at a loss as to where i'm at in life or how i got here. i've been married for the last few years and while i had doubts about marrying him (he's a wonderful person, loves me very much) i always felt like it was the right choice. i guess i've just always struggled with ""what ifs"", like what if there is something better out there, what if i made the wrong decision, etc.

lately, i've been feeling thoughts of literally just running away. starting over. i don't even care how or where, i just want to run away from everything. obviously, this is probably not a wise decision. also, in my culture, divorce is very looked down upon. i do love my husband. he's in love with me. i don't want to bring this up to him because i would crush his soul. and we both got married knowing that divorce wasn't really an option in our culture and we were happy with that. i just don't feel ""in love"" - at the same time, i tend to feel in extremes. i have extreme highs, and extreme lows. i often wonder if i could be bipolar, but any person i've ever spoken about this to in real life has said that i'm ""definitely not"". i don't have health insurance, although i just signed up for an app that includes therapy + medication. maybe this is the route. i don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

i guess i'm just asking: has anyone been in my shoes? where did you go from here? i just want to know i'm not alone, and there's people who made it through and are happier now. but how? how did you get there? what do i do?

&amp;#x200B;

thank you for reading all this. i've been too scared to acknowledge this as a reality.",03Sep2020,1
700,"So to summarise the situation, my gf and I have been trying to visit each other for a year now but something or other ends up getting in the way, the big one being since it started: Corona. The country she lives in are apparently doing better but mine- Not as much. I should mention at this point I have health issues that make me very at risk when it comes to it. We'd been planning for me to come over for her birthday which is in a few days but in order for me to do that, I have to let my doctor know just in general but also for a top up for my prescriptions. 
Unfortunately, i was told I absolutely couldn't leave the country right now no matter the precautions I took as it'd likely mean my life if I was unfortunate enough to contract it and I told my girlfriend who- Didn't take it awfully but... The air is tense if you get what I mean. She said the usual 'its not your fault' bit but also went on to say something else a little passive aggressive, decided to skip out on our first DnD session that evening and the following day (today) ignored my good morning text and my follow up some hours later to see if she was okay, only for her to reply again somewhat passive aggressively telling me she was watching anime today because she was in a shitty mood. I don't blame her but it stings for me too and how she's acting towards me does hurt, I won't lie. I don't want to complain to her because I understand the frustration but I also don't want to feel like I do right now- How can I get over it?",03Sep2020,1

I've (19 F) been having trouble thinking up of where to get reliable underwear that I know wont be falling apart a few months later. When I lived with my mom, she usually would buy me my underwear, and on occasion, would take me with her to the store to buy some. Only issue is that she shops at Victoria's Secret. From what I've heard they can be very pricey and the last time I went there they were mostly selling pieces of cloth that were barely stitched together! The ones I had at the time lasted a long while but from what I've heard their quality has gone down quite a bit. 

When I moved out, I shopped at a local walmart and got myself a dozen new pairs of cute underwear that I thought would last me some time but now I'm down to only 5 pairs that are very quickly wearing out! 


TL;DR: I want to know any places that would sell good quality underwear. I've heard that Victoria's Secret is too expensive for their quality and the pairs I got from walmart barely last 3 months before falling apart.",03Sep2020,1

My energy getting lower and i get worse and worse at my job and the relationship between my girlfriend is getting slowly worse too because of my bad mood and leak of money.

I talked with her, my mom and my firends but they cant help me because they dont know what that addiction really feels.

708,"So our family has a small dog, most likely a Pomeranian mixed with a mini Husky, that we got one day and she quickly became a beloved part of the family. She’s absolutely fearless witch helps her make friends with dogs bigger, she has done things I never thought any dog would do especially for her size! (this will come into play later)

Whenever we got her groomed we would normally take her to a PetCo or something like that to get her a small trim to make sure her floof never too out of control. At some point my mom (the main person who takes care of the dog) took her to a local groomer that all of my neighbors had said was great and had good reviews. When they dropped off the dog she told them specifically not to shave her in the fear it would damage her coat. When we got her back her fur was much shorter then it should have been but my mom tried to stay optimistic in the hopes it would just go back.

Spoiler alert - It didn’t

This brings us to today when my mom took the dog to PetCo and the woman was shocked to see our dog with such short hair! She explained to my mom that they can say for sure she was shaved and that they would attempt to fix her coat with a mud bath and that they would trim up her face a bit although they were scared to. The nail in the coffin was the fact that our dog,  who if you remember is normally scared of nothing, was shaking and crying when my mom had dropped her off. She gets sad whenever my mom leaves but it has never been anything this bad!

Needless to say my mom was pissed. She came home to fill everyone in about the situation then left to talk to the groomer. The woman there accused my mom of asking for it that short, witch is an obvious lie because anyone who owns a Pomeranian knows how bad that would be.

My mom came home and told us and we’re trying to figure out what we can do because if our dog can’t be helped here I want something to happen to them, mostly I wanna figure out what they did to make my dog this scared. So if y’all have and advice or ideas for things I can do please tell me because we got nothing at this point!",03Sep2020,1

So I yesterday a very nice girl I know for more than a year rejected me telling me « it’s complicated for me right now ».

I feel terrible about this, I’m 21 and it’s the first time I go on dates with a girl (and get rejected).



However today she sent me the same snapchat pictures about her life that she sends to her friends as if nothing had happened yesterday, so obviously she still wants to be friends.

But I do feel bad and kind of want to get over her. Should I try to still be friends or should I just tell her to stop sending me those snaps and hope she’ll understand ?
Or maybe should I do something else ?

710,"I am a 27 year old female and about 5 years ago I decided I wanted to get into real estate investing. I knew nothing about it, so I sought out local networking events and talked to people that were doing what I wanted to do. I went consistently for 2 years and eventually spent money I didn't have on a coach to help me do it (put it on a credit card). I then used an extremely high interest loan (couldn't get any good financing at the time) to buy a house to flip and maxed out my credit card to fix it. I did most of the work myself, spending every spare minute I wasn't working at my job to fix up the house. I sold it and made a little profit to put a down payment on two more houses, one to live in and one to rent out. 

I again almost maxed out my credit cards to fix up the rental house and spent all my spare time working on it myself because I didn't have any extra money to hire anyone else to do it. This time is my life was extremely stressful but I persevered and got the house done and rented, then worked really hard at my job to make more money and pay off my credit cards (I work in sales, so if I work really hard I can make extra money).

After two years of working really hard, I have the credit cards paid off and have a nice rental house and a nice house to live in. I feel so happy and proud of my accomplishment, but now my family keeps talking about how good I have it and how I'm extremely lucky to be so young and have so much. It may not sound that bad, but it's getting to the point where I feel ashamed instead of proud of what I accomplished.

Most of my family got married and had kids really young so they have struggled financially because of that so I don't know if that is why they feel the need to criticize me on how much luckier I am tham them. I've told them all the work I had to put into educating myself and making it happen but they usually just brush that off and talk about what I have now. How can I make them understand it's not just luck and stop shaming me on it?",03Sep2020,1

715,"I’m a 28 year old female. I rent my house from my dad. The house Is split in half, so another family lives in the other half, which is a brother and sister they are in their 50’s. The brother is friends with my dad and has called my dad over the four years I have lived here. The few times that I know of was when I went to the store and left the oven on and the fire alarm went off. My door was open so he turn it off, which is cool Bc it could of been an issue. I found it very odd he would tell my dad this. 

We share a back yard and a few times his dog got out, because one of my friends left the gate open and after a while I noticed the dog knew how to get out regardless of it being open or not. He texted me once saying how he’s going to bolt down the gate, which I found to be extremely dramatic. I eventually put a gate on my side to cut off the area. Before this his dog would take a crap on my side and he would always go over and pick it up. He seemed a little offended when the gate when up. 

Durning quarantine I didn’t have a gym to go to and workout on my side of the yard, which is on the side of the house. I usually wear a sports bra and yoga pants, Bc it’s comfortable and he would also be out side and I would get uncomfortable and go back inside or go to an area where I couldn’t be seen. He has texted my dad saying stuff like I’m not saying hi to him or his sister when I just didn’t say anything, Bc I found it weird that they would be outside so much when I was. 

I got an order In the mail it was a big box with a new workout machine. Again he texted
My dad and said he put it in the back yard. I just don’t see why he needed to let my dad know that when he has put stuff that I get in the mail on my door step several times.

722,"Hello all, I am a 23M who was up until recently dating a 23F. We were never in an official relationship, but we were seeing each other. But due to the difficult situations in the world, it’s almost impossible to start a relationship I guess. So about a month ago this girl told me that due cities going into lockdown in the UK maybe it should be better if we were “friends for the time being and revisit seeing each other again when lockdown ends” as she works with children in healthcare and we both have vulnerable family members, I agreed that was a wise decision. 

Since we live a couple of hours away from each other, nothing much changed over the month, we just couldn’t see each other as much yet we still stuck by each others side, so I was happy with it. She told me multiple time’s that she “couldn’t wait to see me again” and that “this can’t go quickly enough” etc. 

But last week I noticed that she had become fairly quiet. I asked her if she was okay on Friday and it lead into a bit of a discussion. I assumed that she was still into me and wanted to wait just a little longer for things to change. But things are just getting worse. She told me on Friday that “due to the distance, and the COVID cases rising, maybe we should just be friends for now”. I told her that “Everything will be okay and as long as we keep on doing what we’re doing, we will be alright” I told her some feelings I had for her. How I really enjoyed the time we had together, in person and in video call. She read it on Saturday morning and replied with. “I wasn’t aware of your feelings for me, and it’s clear to me that we can’t be friends, I don’t want to hurt you more than I already have so I think it’s best if we don’t talk. Good luck with your final year at university” and that was it. I was blocked 😵

I tried calling and messaging her but no response. It was all very sudden and felt like a dream of some sort. I didn’t expect her to do that as it was not like her at all, especially since a few days before she felt fine with me and said she couldn’t wait to see me again. So I admit I lost control a lot. And got angry. I ate quite a few herbal remedy anxiety relief pills, drank some iron supplements and had an anxiety attack. (I have had bad experiences with women before, I have been a victim of domestic and emotional abuse a few years back which has made me hard to trust people). But anxiety attacks are a very rare occurrence. 

It had been a very long time since my last anxiety attack, I had received help and I have been on medication to help me through it, which up until Saturday it really did help. But my Dad saw the state I was in and knew something was wrong, so he sent the girl a text asking what happened. She later unblocked me and sent me a paragraph saying that she “really likes and cares about me, and thought it would be easier for us not to hold back. She knows my history with abuse and didn’t want to lead me on”etc. I sent a reply apologising to her about being pushy and I didn’t want her to feel bad about blocking me (even though it was unexpected and I was angry/upset)

I saw 3 dots”...” as a message was being typed, but I never received the message. That was the last I have heard from her since Saturday. This weekend I was a bit of a mess, but on Monday, I started doing my own thing and felt a bit better after spending time with my family. I left the girl alone as I thought she could probably use less of me pestering her right now. She did seem very upset in the text (she suffers with depression too).

I've been dealing with depression for just about as long as I remember and have had my fair share of suicidal thoughts to go with it. It's been about two years since I last contemplated suicide, but now it's back full force.

Last night, as I laid (layed?) down to sleep, I couldn't close my eyes. All I could do was stare at the wall and picture ways to die. I could see myself hanging a noose and jumping. I could see myself swallowing bottle after bottle of painkillers. I could see my arm slashed and blood pouring out. No matter how much I tried, it wouldn't stop.

It's now the next day. I have a migraine from smacking my head in an attempt to make it stop. But the visuals are just as strong as last night. 

I don't get it. I have a family of my own and extended family that loves me. Im comfortable with finances and in our living situation. But for some reason I'm just not happy. I can't feel joy or excitement. Hell, I can barely feel anything but anger and a longing for death.

I'm not willing to see a counselor or therapist about this. I've been hospitalized previously and it only worsened my condition. Im also aware of the limit im allowed to tell them before they force admit me. I hate the barriers.

I gave her a quick peck on the lips and that was all the night went on as normal but the morning after she started accusing me of taking advantage of her because she was drunk.

736,"we are all 15, and male if that helps.

ppl in the story:

E : good friend

F: probably best friend

z: kinda friend, but we dont hangout together outside of the group.

background: i met all of them three years ago, both F and Z moved two years ago, and came back earlier this year to the USA. we started a new school with only 8 students in it, so we have alot of time together and get along well, especially me and F.


I feel like I am not apart of the friend group. Sometimes I just feel like someone who follows the three of them. 

the problem is i get a sense that they would not miss me if i wasnt there...they all fit rly well together and i sometimes wonder if i am just fourth wheeling. they have some inside jokes, and will kinda say stuff that doesnt include me..

i cant believe i am mentioning this, but one of the new things is if Z puts on my glasses, he suddently becomes infused with raw sexual energy and tries to chase after us, except he only ever chases after E and F. its very dumb and immature, but still. they seem better friends then me and one of them.

and in casual conversation, i kinda sometimes just get left behind sometimes.

we still joke around and have fun, but i get the sense that i am not a big part of the friend group.


 am i imagining it?? i might be reading too much into minor things, and i know it shouldnt be too complicated if we are good friends, but still.

 thoughs? do you have any advice to deal with this feeling, or rectify the situation in general? 

TLDR: feel like friend group would be the exact same without me and that i wouldnt be missed if i wasnt there. am i imagining this?",03Sep2020,1

I live in San Francisco, and I need to renew my car registration, and I typically do that online.

744,"ok so listen in 2016 my best friend got a boyfriend, their relationship lasted 5 days and she even managed to cheat on him. anyways my best friend had to move to a different town and i was very sad. she would come to visit for a couple of days, but she would only be in a good mood when her ex is near. which was so annoying. she whined about him for 8 full months. then she got a different boyfriend from the town she moved to. apparently he wasn't treating her right and she would always complain to me and our other friend. which made us very angry at him aaaaand we kindaaaaa tried to cat-fish him with a fake girl profile, to see if he'd cheat on our friend. it seemed like he had taken the bait, but ultimately he knew it was us and he tricked us, he ended up making a group chat with him, me and my 2 friends, where we all argued, and she chose to defend her so called abusive boyfriend, and she ended up choosing to leave our friendship behind. had i not texted her to apologize, we wouldn't keep being friends... later on she finalllly dumped her abusive boyfriend, but not because we adviced her, it was because a ""hotter"" than that guy, adviced her. and she started dating that ""hotter"" guy. this summer she refuses to come visit me, even though she knows im alone (my only friends are the boys from my neighborhood and they're just... a pain sometimes), and she's alone too (her only friends are me, her stupid new bf, and a dumbass beta orbiter that she has). she said that she can't come, cuz she has no money and so i offered to pay for her ticket to here, which she refused saying ""ohh i can't let you pay for me! that's so crazy!"" and i was like ""ok then"", so i befriended literally the girl that i used to hate. and when i told my best friend about that.... she said ""wow i can't believe you did that? ugh you're having more fun with her than me! so why should i bother coming?"" girl wtf is your damage.... anyway we sorted that argument and we texted for a while, like some days idk. then she stopped texting me. again. again it was just me starting all our conversations. (except that one time where she texted me to announce that she's going on vacation with her bf) and then fast-forward to 1-2 weeks ago where i started dating this one guy, and when i told my best friend she literally had the worst reaction, she said ""are you JOKING? do you seriously like HIM?"". and i kinda get why she reacted that way lol probably cuz i had beef with that guy, cuz i rejected him 2 years ago and he was kinda frustrated about it lol which made him act weird lolol nice then mean then nice and so on. anyway though back to my best friend. so i texted her a few days back, cuz i was a bit sick and had to stay at home and i was super bored, right? so i texted her lol but when i did that, i looked on our past conversations and ahah they were all started by me. so i asked her why she's being so rude to me. and she says. ""why do u think im rude"", i told her that it's cuz she doesn't text me... to which she replies ""oh yeah i'm sorry, i FORGOT THAT ITS MY FAULT THAT IM BROKE AND CANT COME"" okay, major victim complex, i offered to pay for your stupid ticket. then i tell her that being broke doesn't mean she can't still at least text me. to which she replies with ""but i can't come! and i cried for no fricking reason"" funny u should mention crying lol anyway then i say ""if u r so broke, how did you go on that vacation"" and then she's like ""yeah well my bf's mom paid for it"" and then she continues to accuse me of ""having fun and getting drunk with my friends"", then she asks if she's the problem, which idk what it means tbh. then she says ""i didn't write because i was hurt"", then i told her that im also hurt, an she goes ""oh yeah well u don't drink pills and have surgery on ur tail!"" and i just.. wtf lol then she says ""im always here to listen to ur problems!"" no, dude,you're not. bcz this summer i got my heart broken and even accused of stealing aaand a friend of mine passed away lol but i didn't tell you that, bcz ik udc. i asked her if she's so sad, why doesn't shw tell me and she says""cuz i get ignored"" girl u don't even talk to me to even give me an opportunity to ignore u. anyways then she ended it with a ""im always here to listen to ur problems"". wtf is up with her idk but ever since she got her first boyfriend she's been so annoyingly boy-crazy. it's always about them it seems like lol or maybe im weird and toxic lol idk what to do, so hopefully someone bored enough to read this, can somehow help me, or something idk",03Sep2020,1

747,"Hello :)

I'm just looking for a bit of advice on how I can improve my self confidence. I'm sorry if I ramble, but **I'll have a tl;dr at the bottom**

I (17 year old girl) want to learn to respect myself. I'm not someone who would normally talk about their feelings very often, and I don't like to be vulnerable, but I'm willing to admit that I have to start respecting myself. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this and I need to remind myself that I'm not a hopeless case.

Here's my problem: my opinion on myself is (very) critical and I tend to look at myself as...""lesser"" than others. It's as if everyone around me is so important and so real, but I'm just a mistake. I feel like I'm not worthy to be living in the same world as they are. When I think of other people, I think about how they all have free-will, they all have the ability to go so far in life. Wow, they're so smart. They're so witty. They're doing everything right. When I think of myself, I think of how every move I make is a mistake. The things I do in this world don't matter. I'm just as human as anyone else is, but for some reason, I have a hard time believing that I am just as valuable as they are. I know that sounds crazy.

I don't have a lot of self-motivation or drive to do anything, really. I've always wondered why I constantly procrastinated and always made up excuses for not doing work. Recently I realized that it could be because I just don't see the point in doing work if it doesn't make me happy. I think if I started to see the good in myself and see that I am worthy of great things, I could find a reason to work. I'm in high school; I'm about to graduate this year and I'm worried about college right now. I think if I'm able to respect myself and justify the work that I do, I would be able to motivate myself to work hard and have a bright future. I want to find a hobby that I enjoy. I thought maybe that would help me respect myself. Finding something that makes me feel like I'm really doing something to make people happy or even just make myself happy.

I am healthy, but that's just because I'm young. I don't have a great diet. I don't worry about my weight, I'm not underweight or overweight, I'm right where I need to be. I take care of myself, but not as much as I'd like to. I don't exercise. I want to exercise, but every time I consider it, I just think, ""what's the point?"" I don't have a lot of motivation to do anything, like I said earlier. My hygiene isn't an issue, I take care of myself in that, uh, regard. But being a teenage girl, of course, is really difficult to be confident when there are so many beautiful girls in the world. I've never really worried about my looks, I'm okay with the way I am, it's not a struggle for me. But.. I do think that if I *liked* the way I looked, I might be able to be more satisfied with myself. I'm talking about maybe improving my skincare routine or figuring out how to tame my curly hair. I don't have a lot of acne, but my face just gets a little bit red and I'd like for that to go away. I know it wouldn't be too difficult.

Every time I try to pamper myself, I think about how I don't deserve to look pretty or feel good about myself. It seems like reaching satisfaction with the way I look or feel is impossible for me because I'd just mess it all up.

I don't have any excitement in my life. I do the same thing every day. I take care of my mom. I stay at home all day. I rarely go outside. I don't really go out (especially in these times of course) and I don't have a lot of friends. It's not that I have a hard time making friends- it's just that when I do make a friend, I constantly worry about whether or not they like me, or if they're just doing me a favor by hanging out with me. It's hard for me to get close to people because of that.

For the last few years I've really, really improved my attitude towards life and I'm really happy with the progress I've made! I used to be a very negative and pessimistic person, but now I'm able to look on the bright side of any situation. That's my proudest achievement, I think. I'm proud to call myself an optimist. Since I've made that progress, I know that I'm able to change myself. I know that it's possible for me to get to the place that I want to see myself at emotionally. I know that I can respect myself. I know I can do it. But there's a little doubt in my mind that eats away at me and tells me that I can't do it.

I think I need a little bit of a push first.

I know I rambled...a lot. I'm sorry.

**TL;DR: I have a hard time with the way I see myself and the way I criticize myself. I always see other people as more valuable than I am. I want to be able to respect myself.**

So, I was wondering if you guys had any advice on how I can get started with learning to respect myself? Maybe I could change up my daily routine? Maybe I could be more active? I need to find a way to have a different (more positive) perspective on myself.

I just want to find a place to start, you know.

Thank you so much for you guys' help :)",03Sep2020,1

What do I do? I have no clue. I’m living on borrowed time. 

This is gonna be a lengthy one so please bear with me. 

To preface this, I live in a town of 5000 people on the Canadian border of the US. 

1st of may of 2019, me and my father were evicted from our apartment on the grounds that the building was being renovated.

Long story short, building got demolished. 
We’ve been living in a 5th wheel pull behind camper for 1 year and 5 months. No running water. No electricity besides a generator. For a year. I haven’t been able to shower. For. A. Year. I sponge bathe myself with cold bottled water. 

I can’t work as my dad works, and I have to guard our camper because meth heads regularly (daily, bidaily) come out and rummage through the junk spread across the lot were on. 

We barely have $3000 saved up. We have no vehicle, he’s an alcoholic, and I’m a high school drop out who would’ve graduated 2020. 

The last year, I’ve almost committed suicide more times than I can count on 2 hands and 2 feet. I can’t see a single way out. I have no friends or family here. None of them will take us in where they do live. 

My girlfriend of 3 months also broke up with me yesterday. So needless to say I’m all kinds of messed up. 

I have been basically dormant since a year ago. 
I just got on Prozac today. Idk if that’ll help or if I’ll even make it past the 4-6 side effect period. 

I dont know what to do anymore. We’re so poor. We have nothing. Nothing. There’s no hope. At all. I can’t get on welfare. I tried every option I have. 

Please. Someone just please suggest something. There’s nothing I can do myself and my dads very limited in his options right now as well. We’ve tried everything. We’re stuck.

Hi, I want to share my story because I don't understand it and I'm hoping that someone out there can either relate and tell me I'm not alone or tell me what happened.

So back in 2017 I was regularly smoking with friends and it was always a good time, I never smoked alone and we never really smoked an excessive amount. One day my friends had the idea to go and smoke a whole blunt each to top off summer vacation. We rolled up and began the session, the setting was not ideal, we were in an abandoned house in the basement with no light source except for our phones. I also should admit that I was struggling with an eating disorder so I really only had a small burrito to eat that day. So I had gotten maybe a quarter of the way through my blunt and I started to feel very dizzy. I remember sitting on my girlfriends lap and her friend was taking a picture of her doing something but then my memory cuts to me waking up in a very awkward position with my girlfriend screaming at me and crying. Her friend was just trying to calm her down. I tried to talk to them and tell them that I didn't feel well and I was gonna pass out again but I think I was incoherent. I passed out again and woke up the same way, at this point I am freaking out and barely able to stay conscious, my girlfriend was making me move around a lot and sway my body because the moment I stopped I would slip out of consciousness. Remember we are in a pitch black room and the only light source is the flashlight on my friends phone which she just kept shining in my face. My experience was a feeling of helplessness, the best way I can describe it was the scene in the movie ""Get Out"" where the mom of the family hypnotizes him and he is sort of falling down this endless black hole. Eventually I was able to walk and we got upstairs into the light. I was still feeling very tired so I was fighting that feeling while one of my friends went to get some food. The food didn't sit in my stomach for long and I don't think it was in relation to my eating disorder but that is always a possibility because it was a very subconscious issue for me, I didn't enjoy it. I don't really remember much from the rest of that day but I do know that now any time I smoke I don't have a good time. It makes me sad because I used to look forward to it but I have pretty much stopped because even one puff can get me in a panic. I know this is a lot to read but I would love to hear some feedback.

Part 2: I also have an issue when I smoke or eat edibles where I almost feel like my brain lags. I will speak to someone but as I am speaking I am not hearing myself, I hear what I have said after I stop talking. This lasts for about two days after I smoke or ear edibles, does anyone else experience this? It bothers me quite a bit.",03Sep2020,1
760,"I’m not entirely sure how to start this off so I’ll start with some background info, my liking of my cousin has always been a little low, it started when he traumatized me and made me near deathly afraid of men, I cut him out of my life a few years back because I couldn’t  take the ongoing sexual abuse, he had taken advantage of me at a young age and I felt like I couldn’t say no, and because I was conditioned to not be able to say no for such a long time, it went on until I was around 15, I’m 18 now and still not over it, however I decided that since he’s seemed to change around the rest of my family I’d slowly let him back into my life, but I’m starting to think it was a bad idea now, as if recent months I’ve noticed him slowly but surely take on aspects of myself, it’s not like we hang out every day and he’s just adapting to a new environment, no I talk to him like once a week, sometimes less, I saw him in person only twice after I allowed him back into my life(in those two times he almost tried to start what I had put an end to years ago until I told him that if I cut him out of my life again it’ll be permanent) he’s copying things from my likes and dislikes to my favourite things, to my hairstyle and even my fucking clothing style, the thing that bothers me most is my scarf, he’s always hated them, but after I started wearing mine he’s always drawn himself with one and now he has one and wears it the exact same way I do, my scarf has extreme sentimental value to me and I hate than he won’t respect that, it was given to me by my best friend when I ran away from home due to an abusive step mother, I’m almost never seen without it now, and with the likes thing, he never liked Steven Universe, always said he couldn’t get into it, but as soon as it became my favourite show, it was his, when I stopped talking about it he said he didn’t like it anymore and gave me a copy of the movie, then there’s Jojo, his favourite part was always DiU mine was Phantom Blood, but as soon as I made that clear, he suddenly loved it even though he expressly stated he did not before, then there’s games, his favourite Mario game was always 64, he was literally telling me this a minute before I said galaxy 1 was mine, then he instantly changed to that and has stuck with it, he never liked touhou, now I live it and suddenly he does, and now it’s gotten to the point where he copies my speech mannerisms and the little things I do because of my autism, he is not autistic, when it came out that I had bed depression, so did he, anxiety?

So as a test I told him I was asexual still, so was he, a week after I said straight, so was he, I finally gave in and just admitted I’m lesbian and now so is he??!? Sorry that I keep saying he but it’s obvious he’s not actually wanting to transition, he only ever talks about it around me, he’s convinced his friends that it’s all his identity, everything from the style to the mannerisms, it’s such a devastating thing having something so sacred like your entire self being taken away by someone you can barely tolerate, but I’m afraid to cut him out again because my family isn’t the most understanding in these scenarios, and um also really close with my uncle, his dad, he has no clue this is happening because of custody, he only has him for the summers, my uncle is someone I could turn to when I could t even talk to my dad, however he sees my cousin as some little angel who can do no wrong.

765,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. What I find weird is how his ex still hangs out with him Mom and sister. They paint together and I’m almost positive that the Mom wants him to be with her. They reason they broke up is because she cheated multiple times, which I think the mother knows nothing about. It gives me such bad anxiety going to the moms house not knowing if his ex will be there. He hung out with her behind my back at the Moms when we got into a fight because he said he had to know if there was still feelings there. I’ve heard that she doesn’t want to get back together with him until he grows up. I no longer know how to feel about the situation or who to trust. Help advice please?????",03Sep2020,1

767,"I’m not entirely sure how to start this off so I’ll start with some background info, my liking of my cousin has always been a little low, it started when he traumatized me and made me near deathly afraid of men, I cut him out of my life a few years back because I couldn’t  take the ongoing sexual abuse, he had taken advantage of me at a young age and I felt like I couldn’t say no, and because I was conditioned to not be able to say no for such a long time, it went on until I was around 15, I’m 18 now and still not over it.

however I decided that since he’s seemed to change around the rest of my family I’d slowly let him back into my life, but I’m starting to think it was a bad idea now, as if recent months I’ve noticed him slowly but surely take on aspects of myself, it’s not like we hang out every day and he’s just adapting to a new environment, no I talk to him like once a week, sometimes less.

I saw him in person only twice after I allowed him back into my life(in those two times he almost tried to start what I had put an end to years ago until I told him that if I cut him out of my life again it’ll be permanent) he’s copying things from my likes and dislikes to my favourite things, to my hairstyle and even my fucking clothing style.

the thing that bothers me most is my scarf, he’s always hated them, but after I started wearing mine he’s always drawn himself with one and now he has one and wears it the exact same way I do, my scarf has extreme sentimental value to me and I hate than he won’t respect that, it was given to me by my best friend when I ran away from home due to an abusive step mother, I’m almost never seen without it now.

and with the likes thing, he never liked Steven Universe, always said he couldn’t get into it, but as soon as it became my favourite show, it was his, when I stopped talking about it he said he didn’t like it anymore and gave me a copy of the movie, then there’s Jojo, his favourite part was always DiU mine was Phantom Blood, but as soon as I made that clear, he suddenly loved it even though he expressly stated he did not before, then there’s games, his favourite Mario game was always 64, he was literally telling me this a minute before I said galaxy 1 was mine, then he instantly changed to that and has stuck with it, he never liked touhou, now I love it and suddenly he does.

and now it’s gotten to the point where he copies my speech mannerisms and the little things I do because of my autism, he is not autistic, when it came out that I had bed depression, so did he, anxiety? Him too, suicidal thoughts?(I’m better now) him too, and now he’s even copying my identity, I’m all  for people finding themselves and being who they really are, but he’s done this shit before, when I was still figuring out who I was I was non binary and asexual for a few months, and suddenly so was he, this was when I still had him in my life before cutting him out the first time, now I’ve found who I am, I’m a girl and I’m a lesbian, been for years and I’m super happy, but now that he knows about it suddenly he is too?!!

768,"I’m 17 and I live with my gran and aunt. My mum lives down the street from us and i visit my dad on weekends. My mum is an alcoholic and a drug user, and she lives with her junkie boyfriend and constantly breaks up with him and comes to get helped by us and then when they get back together ditches us completely. Recently I found out that all the times my mum said she’d stay at her friends, she was staying with her boyfriend, and she even quit her job that she was about to start to spend the day in Edinburgh with him. 

It’s been stressing my gran out a lot and I can tell cause she doesn’t sleep till really late at night. She constantly has to look after my mum whenever this occurs and my aunt always criticises her for patching us to help her. In a way I get it, she’s 38, unemployed, has a son and drinks her life away, but at the same time it’s her daughter and it’s my mum. 

I got back from my friends house on Saturday as it was his birthday and found out my mum had gone kind of crazy. She said she was seeing things and kept saying how she was gonna kill herself. Her boyfriend left her again and she was going mental and pushed my gran which resulted in her punching her. When I got home I found out my mum has been taken for a mental institution overnight. I thought it would be upwards of 6 weeks but she was released the next day because it was a substance abuse problem but that night I barely slept. I woke up and got asked to put a bottle of booze outside her door because she’d been throwing up, shaking uncontrollably and even wet herself from being 12 hours sober. That night she got taken to hospital and stayed for 2 nights. My gran hasn’t slept much lately either and my aunt hates her and doesn’t care. 

On the other end of the spectrum, I’ve got my girlfriend who for the past few months I feel has been kinda shitty to me. She calls me names like gay for talking to my friends that I’ve known for 10 years and usually I wouldn’t care but after 10 times it gets pretty old. She always says that I ignore her and creates these circumstances where she victimises herself which I can’t stand but I don’t say anything. She claims to have depression and suicidal thoughts and honestly I feel like I’m being anchored down by that because if I do anything wrong then that gets brought up. 

To give an example, I went to an island with her and a few friends including my long term friend Rhys. He offered me a cider when we were having dinner cause He brought a few and I said in a bit. She called me a wee Alki and I responded with “please do not call me that”. She said it again 15 minutes later and I told her not to say that in a more stern way. She asked why I wanted a cider and I said that I liked the taste of it to which she replied “that’s what an alki would say” and I freaked tf out. I didn’t say anything abusive and I’m not proud of it but if I wasn’t taught that hitting women is wrong I’m fairly certain I would’ve punched her cause god knows I would have if she was a man. I didn’t speak to her much and she told me that I had to right to be annoyed at her because in the morning I apparently didn’t say hi to her. 

I asked for a break with her and she said that the break has made her more depressed and how she needs me in her life. She’s now started calling me Olivia though (my names Oliver) because I haven’t had a hair cut (I usually get one every 6 weeks and it’s been 7). I said when I wanted a break that I have stuff in my life that I need to sort out and she tried to interrogate me and I just said “it’s alki stuff” to which she replied “I shouldn’t have said that”) more than a month after she actually did say it. 

And now cause of my mum I think I’m starting to get anxious. I don’t want to victimise myself but my left hand has been shaking for days, I can’t sleep properly and I’m finding it difficult to breath normally and require deep breaths when my chest feels tight. 

I dont want to tell my gran cause she has enough stuff to worry about. My aunt is pretty traditional so I don’t talk about my emotions with her. My dad has gone through enough shit with my mum and doesn’t deserve to hear more and more about it, he’s happy and that’s all I want for him. I don’t want to tell my girlfriend cause it’s just another thing for her to say she’s stressed cause I’m stressed. And finally my best mate shouldn’t have to worry about me but he does. He knows a lot of what’s happened but I’ve kept a lot of details from years ago hidden. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. Therapists are really expensive and I don’t trust the school. I just don’t know what to talk to",03Sep2020,1

771,"My (19F) college coach (M40) used to be a prison guard, he also has a degree in communication. Because of this, he is very good at manipulating my teammates and I into doing what he wants us to do. Especially since he is very large and intimidating especially once he starts to raise his voice. At first I didn’t realize how he was treating us but after he accused a few of my teammates and I of smoking weed without any proof all while going behind the schools back I was able to see just how wrong he treats us. (I go to a pretty strict school so smoking weed gets you on probation) He continuously makes us go over to his house so that we can bond as a team and he forces us to be friends even though forcing someone to become friends will not work in the slightest especially when some of the girls are trying to stay on his good side so they throw you under the bus. While going over to someone’s house isn’t a big deal, having to go over there when you are uncomfortable with your coach who is a grown man is not ok in my opinion. The first time he made me extremely uncomfortable was when we had to have a meeting as a team because there were issues between some girls on the team. It was my turn to speak my mind when my coach kept interrupting me. I let him speak and then asked very quietly if I could speak because I was already very anxious. He didn’t hear me the first two times so I had to repeat myself again this time a little louder. He thought I had used attitude and so after the meeting he held me back and screamed at me. He told me that the last person to give him attitude the way I had he grabbed by the neck and threw them against a wall. After that incident and him later accusing me of smoking weed, I have gotten panic attack after panic attack whenever I am around him. I am not the only one who is uncomfortable with him and I don’t know what to do. I am considering changing sports if they can give me the same scholarship but if they can’t I’m sol. I’ve thought about reporting him but I feel like it is my word against his and nothing will happen. I have such bad anxiety rn that I throw up every time I eat and I’ve already lost almost 20 pounds in the last week and a half. I know what a coach is supposed to be like and he is not it but I feel as if I have no options because every time I want to do something my anxiety makes me freeze and not be able to do or say anything.",03Sep2020,1
772,"So I'm 14m and currently clean rooms at a hotel for work. I've been working there for about 2 months as of now. My home life is not good. My step dad is by far the biggest piece of shit I know. He verbally and mentally abuses me and my mom both.

Him and my mom constantly scream at each other about me and stupid shit. My mom keeps saying that she's thinking of breaking up with him but never does. She knows how much this bothers me but refuses to do anything.

To get to the point on where I need help is that my friend was Looking thru old papers of rooms we have to clean (also 14m), and sent me a picture of one of them from the very beginning of August. The papers we get to clean rooms have the room #, what size it is, and the name of the person who checked into it. The picture had my moms name and it was a single king size bed room. We live in a very small town so I doubt someone has the exact same name as my mom. And it was a stay over so it wasn't just one night she stayed there.

I don't know what to do. I'm really worried for my mom and If it actually is true I want my step dad out the second I find out. I want that fucker out for good.

775,"So I've been texting this guy for a little over a year. Eventually we confirmed that we both liked each other. Great, yeah. However, we've only ever TEXTED despite us being in the same classes. At school we act like complete strangers. The most we've done is wave to each other that one time.

He makes it hard to continue a convo because he uses 1 word replies(dreadful). I'm guessing it's his way of ending the conversation, so I respect that. But when I try the next day it usually ends the same. We can go weeks without talking because I figured he needs his space(we have a system where if he seens me he starts the convo) . Understood.

We're both super shy and have different friend groups. We only have one mutual friend. And like 3 other girls like him. Going up to him alone is not an option because ~shy~ and he's always in groups. I figured I could wait until a friend goes to talk to him then I join in but again ~shy~. Plus I have friends that make it really obvious when you like someone.

Not to mention we've both never been in relationships and I doubt either if us want to. I'm the type to reciprocate feelings. If he doesn't like me, I don't. If he does, I do. So it's a guessing game which I hate because I'm often in the grey area.

779,"My father skipped out on us when I was 2 and my younger brother had just been born. We were raised by our mother and an amazing step-dad. About a month ago, my younger brother and I learned our Father who had skipped states actually came back and was about half an hour from our house. We were curious to meet him, see what he was like, talk about the past and why he left, Etc. My mother warned us that he was manipulative and nothing was ever his fault. He would try to blame his failings on other people in his life. It kind of caused us to hesitate. 

Well, in the end we actually met with him. It was awkward and uncomfortable, we learned a little bit about him, why he left, his side of the story. He was a cross country truck driver, who had left because he felt pressure from his father in law (our grandpa) to stay closer to home and be with his children. My Father was afraid things would turn violent if he didn't quit his job, so he left. (my grandpa hasn't hurt anyone a day in his life. So I don't know where he got these notions. But I was 2 at the time.) 

He spent a few years in jail for sleeping with a minor (don't know her real age, he said 16) and had to register on the sex offenders list. When he got out, he tried to reach out to me on Facebook (I got a friend request from a blank account that had his name) and our mother called the cops on him because sex offenders aren't allowed to be on Facebook in Virginia. That sent him ""spiraling into drink and drugs."" He met a longtime girlfriend who got into meth, alcohol and weed with him, and they had a daughter who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Shortly after she was born our father gave up drinking and drugs, and her mother didn't so he kicked her out.

Now he says for the last 10 years he's just been looking after her in a trailer park, playing video games and fishing. He says she knows about us and would like to meet us someday, but I'm not sure if this is some way to pawn her off to us so he can run, or if he's actually reformed and wanting us to meet her.

TL;DR: supposedly manipulative deadbeat father met us, wants us to meet his disabled daughter. Not sure if he's reformed or just trying to pass her along to us",03Sep2020,1

782,"So first of all I'm just gonna point out some facts.

1. I'm Mexican, born and raised but moved to Canada

2. Even if I'm Mexican I'm not dark skinned but I wouldn't consider myself to look white at all. If anything I look Arabic I'd say

3. I had 0 racist or mean intentions. I'm just a goofy guy that enjoys having fun as long as I'm not bothering other people.

So I'm 21 years old and I recently started my first college semester (I took some years off after secondary school). All my classes are on zoom and I've seen a lot of memes about them and how people change their backgrounds. I saw someone using the Piper Perri meme as a background and thought it was hilarious so I decided to use it as my background when classes would start. Since I live in Canada (Quebec to be precise) even if I go to an English college I have to take French. Only of the only classes available was one that talks about how the African and other black people cultures mixed with French. I thought it would be really interesting so I took it. Day of this class came and I had used the Piper Perri background on every single class and had gotten good reactions from both professors and students. Well not my French teacher. A few minutes after joining her class she told me I was not registered in her class and kicked me out without letting me speak. At the end of class, I kept trying to join and she wouldn't let me so I ended up using a fake zoom account so I could talk to her. She is a black woman who graduated in Black Studies (which I found out a few days later). When I talked to her I had no actual clue why I was kicked out and when I asked she mentioned that my background was very unprofessional, which is correct it's a meme and if she would've told me to take it off I would've. But she kept talking and then mentioned how she saw my background in the news and knew exactly what it meant and how it was offensive. Then she started saying that I was very close minded and not open to multiculturalism for someone that lives in a multicultural country. That it would be a long road for me to become open to different cultures and more accepting. She then said that as soon as she saw my face she knew exactly what kind of person I was and that this class would be difficult for me.

There was more arguing and obviously I responded although the conversation never turned into insulting each other. So I am asking help from you redditors. What should I do? I feel incredibly angry. I was going to drop it but next class she took 5 minutes to say how in her class discrimination and non respect are not tolerated (talking about me obs).

793,"Basically as the title suggests I don’t know if I should quit my job or not. Last month my (27F) boyfriend (26M) and I moved in together, to make it easier on both of us I took a month off of work so I could organise and get the apartment somewhat normal and lived in. I had money saved for my portion of the rent and bills for when September was to roll around so I was okay with doing that. Not only that but since my job was one of the many affected by Covid-19 I still receive unemployment. Obvs since they took away the extra 600$ I don’t make as much as I was before but for me that was fine since I’m good at managing my money and have had money saved up since before COVID. 

However now that September has started I’ve been feeling a strong urge to quit my job. Where I used to live I was 5 minutes away and only had to wake up an hour before my shifts to be there on time; however now I have to wake up almost 2 hours earlier and drive 30 mins just to get there. I already don’t like that. I’ve been with this company for 5 years and never intended to be there this long but all of what’s been going on with COVID and my moving to another town is really forcing me to see my life in a different perspective. I want to quit to just focus on finishing school and hopefully getting a much better job but I am honestly terrified to quit. 

Growing up my family was homeless for awhile and a lot of times (unbeknownst to me) we had barely any money for food or to even get a hotel to shower. Because of those things I guess I have some trauma of being broke and homeless due to my wanting to quit. The idea of not going to work to get money causes me to have a small panic attack and I get super stressed out but I genuinely hate my job, I hate the way the company says one thing and does another, I hate almost all of my managers cause they think just cause they have to put in 12 hours a day then so do you even though that’s illegal, they expect all of the other full time and part time associates to give their all and basically make this job their life while they barely do anything. 

On top of that they allow the worst people to continue to be full time at this place just because they’ve worked there for 9+ years. They won’t even give me full time even though I know every department and am the best with customers. All in all this job not only drains me physically but it’s draining me mentally and emotionally. I feel no happiness from it yet like I used to but I’m scared to be homeless again. 

I know I can apply to other places and I have but the thought of continuing to work there until I get hired elsewhere just makes my anxiety even worse. I honestly don’t know what to do because the fear of being homeless again really stresses me out therefore I overwork myself but the overworking and just having to go to this job basically everyday is also stressing me out. I feel so lost and torn on what to do.

TLDR: I want to quit my job but I don’t want to be homeless however said job is affecting my mental health and causing me to have anxiety. Some advice on how to approach would be appreciated.",03Sep2020,1

I was looking at a post in relationship advice about a guy worrying about his girlfriend addicted to bionicle      toys ever since she lost her job. The top comment said ""It sounds like She's regressing to a time things were better. It's a symptom of depression anxiety."".

This has really hit me, all I listen to on YouTube is Paramore, Nickelback, Avril Lavigne, Taylor swift and Miley Cyrus. Nothing else. I also browse spongebob memes and sometimes play the old games. It depresses me that it says ""10 years ago."" on most of the songs I listen to.

I also don't get today's slang. Yeet, deadass, flex. I have no idea. The last time I remember it was Yolo,         swag, Harlem shake, vines and Miley Cyrus turning bad. I don't know any of these ""social influencers."". I remember Ray William Johnson and Smosh though.

798,"Okay, so for about 6 years I have been navigating my way up the corporate ladder starting at a position around 40k and working my way up to a little over 100k. I have moved from company to company and position to position leveraging the use of my previous experience to gradually work my way up to my current position (which is what I’d personally recommend to anyone attempting to get into a specific position or salary range. Don’t spend too much time at one company starting off).

Both my Partner and I have taken a similar route of climbing the corporate ladder and our total household income is now around 200k. 

Our income has jumped so quickly and drastically that while we don’t ever really have to “worry” about money per say, we also don’t have much experience managing our money in a fiscally mature way. I put away anywhere from 250 - 300 per week into various easily accessible investments but still feel that as a household we are not saving or investing anywhere near the amount that we should. 

Although my fiancé and I are similar in the way that we have advanced our careers, we are drastically different as it pertains to savings and investing. My fiancé’s opinion is that we should enjoy life while we have the chance and doesn’t really think about planning for the future and thus very rarely puts away any savings and certainly doesn’t have the knowledge to make sound investment decisions.

Assuming my partner and I can get on the same page regarding saving and investing, anyone on here with experience have any suggestions as to  how we should break up our savings and investments going forward?",03Sep2020,1
799,"I work at a restaurant that is somewhat struggling right now and short staffed. The owner is very anti covid and thinks it’s all a hoax. 

I’ve been working all throughout covid-19 until I got sick in April. I took a couple weeks off just to be on the safe side. When I came back to work - everyone kept calling me a hypochondriac and gave me shit for taking time off. It kind of pissed me off because I gave up two weeks of pay... for them! I didn’t want to be responsible for spreading a virus to my coworkers. I would have gladly worked - but I didn’t want to be part of the problem.

Well... it’s happening again. I’m currently sick (started with a bad sore throat and now I’ve got a pretty bad cough) and my boyfriend is now really sick to. I don’t have insurance, so my bf went to the doctor today. They urged him to get a covid test to see if he had it. He gets his test results in two days.

I texted my employer and he basically brushed it off and told me to just wear a mask during my shift. I told a coworker (that I work very closely with) and told him to keep his distance until we get the results back. He basically laughed in my face and just said “ok” - as if he didn’t believe me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m tired of my workplace treating me like I’m some type of hypochondriac just because I take the virus more seriously than they do. I TRULY do not think I have the virus... but I don’t think there is anything shameful about trying to be safe. ESPECIALLY because I’m Asian - If it turns out I DO have coronavirus and gave it to my coworkers - it would just add to the stereotype and stigma. What do I do?

809,"important: I’m not a native speaker

I’m (16F) in a relationship with a guy (20M). He has BorderlinePD, which sometimes make him very tired and in these episodes he isnt interested in me. I know all of these, and I accept it, except when I fall down emotionally, and everything feels wrong and I feel like everything’s against me. I hate coming home, I hate being at school, I feel like everyone rejects me, everyone hates me. I cry every afternoon since school started, I cry til I go to bed. He says he loves me from all of his heart, he wants to be with me always, I’m he’s only one. My rational side of brain believes this and knows this, but when my emotional side becomes dominant, every act and word seems fake and I start a fight with him, which lasts for hours and it follows a certain script probably from a childhood trauma. I’m at therapy, but I feel like it doesn’t count, because I’m just not able to control my feelings and my acts when it’s about my emotions. I hurt him when he doesn’t deserve it. I hate myself, but also feel like hate him too. I also feel like I want to destroy him, because he hurts me, but at the same time I know that he never wants to hurt me on purpose, but I often doesn’t care about this side of my thinking.

I have low self esteem, which makes me jelly sometimes (not always). Today he met one of is girl friends, he sent me a picture of them having a good time. You should know, that a few days ago he planned to come over, but he cancelled it, I don’t know why. Then I started my school year, I was very anxious when I got home, I asked for help (he is really wise due to his therapies at the psychiatry), but he started telling me things which just don’t help, I expected emotional support. Then he became mad at me, in these situations I like my feelings are wrong, my thoughts are wrong, everything about me is wrong. It wasn’t the first time when he blamed me because of my feelings. Other times he is really understanding. Then after this day, I got home, he was really dismissive and I felt like our relationship is going on a wrong way. I watched a video about a girl during her maniac episode and it made me cry so bad, that my emotions came to the surface, and I told my bf that I feel like he isn’t interested in me, he doesn’t love me anymore, and he hates me.

So today I was jealous, it made me cry and since then I have kinda suicidal thoughts, my life feels like a big big mess, I don’t feel like I have enough energy to solve them. I cut off everyone around me, people who love me, people who doesn’t want to hurt me, everyone. When someone tells me something, I’m always afraid of a hidden meaning, a hidden and offensive meaning, I’m afraid of being abandoned, I feel missing out, I’m crying over little and meaningless things, then I just can’t control things around me and in me. I feel like I need help, but everytime I’m in a bad mood, I just push away people and don’t accept the help, even if I’m asking for it.

This is how I overthink things and I just can’t stop these. I have these feelings since age of 11, I was always rejected at school, I was always rejected at home, my dad insults me everytime, my mom says she loves me, but I just don’t feel this. 

It may look like I have a crazy puberty phase, but it’s too hard for me, and can’t help falling into these illusions and paranoia. Things just don’t really work out good these years, and don’t know if I’m the wrong or everyone else.",03Sep2020,1

I have messaged them on more than one occasion to ask them politely to let me get some sleep for work but they usually just ignore my messages. A night ago I had to leave my home just to get a decent night's sleep because their kid was screaming racial slurs again and I messaged them the next day telling them that it's really not okay for them to be so disrespectful. Today I was just trying to hang up a painting and they started banging on the wall ( they were awake already and it was the middle of the day so I'm assuming they are just doing it because messaged them the other day ) so I decided to let the landlord know of the situation.

My brother is the copy and paste of my dad, looks personality, everything, in a way I am as well, we all have that stubborn personality. Basically my siblings and I (me being 16, sister is 12, and brother is 9) were exposed to my dads verbal abuse to my mom and the long depressive hole my mom was in, it was a shitty time, he also started to manipulate the shit out of me starting like at age 6, always trying to make me feel bad for anything, not to mention he’s a working alcoholic stoner. We’ve gone through a lot of ups and downs, my siblings and I, during these times my brother just had my dad as a male figure, it was always my mom, sister, and grandma, my dad was never here, and when he was he was arguing with my mom or talking shit to me. My brother grew up obviously siding with my dad, and even with him going through the same shit and arguments and screams that started the moment my dad came home after “working all night” (drinking), he sided with my dad. its been 6 months since my dad left and my brothers attitude has been straight up evil and ungrateful to my mom. She cannot tell him ANYTHING, she cant offer to help him with school, nothing, he gets defensive, I was like that when I was younger and I still in a way am, Im afraid that I taught him dad like my dad taught me. Any time my sister, mom, and I tell him he’s being rude he says “thats because you are girls”, any time my mom doesn’t understand what he’s saying (he kind of has a speech impediment and Im almost sure he has ADD), “its because your a girl”, its his only excuse when he doesn’t get what he wants it makes me so mad. It makes me afraid that he’s gonna end up hating my mom and my sister and become a sexist, when he doesn’t realize that everything he has is because of my mom and grandma, my mom has always been very close with us all (especially me) and she is ALWAYS there for us and understanding, which lead her to be more of a friend than mom with me, and Im afraid thats going to happen with my brother but worse. She lets my brother disrespect her FAR too much, she tells him something yeah, but she never screams at him like he does, and then after she and him forget his words like it never happened, and she goes on to baby him because her excuse is “he’s just a kid”, it infuriates me.

814,"I've been wanting to write this for a while, and made a throwaway to do so. I have depression/anxiety. Maybe a little ptsd, I havent been diagnosed with that though. I dont know if it's pertinent. My major is Medical Laboratory science. I enjoy the biological aspect of it, but the chem is killing me. Ive managed to float along and barely make it through the chem classes, but know I'm in Mechanistic Organic chem (organic chem 2) and I dont think I can make it through this class. The professor keeps saying ""I wont go over this, you should already know. This is survey of chem stuff, gen chem stuff, etc"". Which I get. It's an upper level course, he doesnt have time/shouldnt have to go over basic stuff. But I dont know what's going on. They might as well be speaking a foreign language, I really just dont even know what they're saying. The students all seem to somewhat know what's going on. And even if I pass this class with a C, I'm worried the MLS school wont accept me. The baseline gpa is 2.5, and while I have above that, it's nothing to gloat about. They have plenty of people applying, i might not get in. And even if I managed to get in, the first semester is classroom work, so I'm sure more chem problems. I live on my dads property, and he pays for my schooling. Ive tried mentioning before how bad I am at chem, and he just tells me to get a tutor, either through school or he'd pay for one. There have been many tears and arguements about how badly ive done. But I went to a school tutor for my gen chem 2 class, and 1. I got really lucky with that tutor, he was one of the only helpful ones there. And 2. Even he had difficulty teaching me and making me understand chem things. I just dont think im cut out for it. I really just want to drop out and run away to a different state where I dont know anyone. The only thing stopping me is 1. My cat. I love her so much, I couldnt stand to leave her behind with someone else, but she cant handle/dislikes car rides. And if i did this I imagine I'd be living in my car for a bit. And 2. My dad. I love my dad. He's a rougher guy. He cares about me, but has never been great at saying it or being kind/understanding with his words or emotionally. Hes a typical blue collar guy. He also tends to blow up pretty harshly. Right now he's off in a different state for work, so it would give me time to pack secretly. But i couldnt just ignore his calls and wait for him to come back to my note. But if I messaged him my plan he'd come back early anyway. And idk if his heart could take it. One sister is in jail, and my other one was murdered. So he really just wants me to do well ans succeed so he doesnt have to worry about me. If I just told him I wanted to change my major he'd be furious and cut me off though anyway, Ive been in school 3 years and have 2 years left. He's already paid so much money. But this chem shit makes me miserable, and I can't imagine making it through. The only reason I chose this was because i was interested in biology but didnt want to interact with people much, and the job growth suggests I'd never have trouble finding a job. My dad just wants me to be comfortable and not have to worry. Which I do too. if I did say I want to change my major, idk what I would change it to. And if I did change it, it would set me back even further. A bunch of people around me are already getting houses, married, babies. And while I dont particularly want to get married or have children right now, I feel so far behind. I really just want to change my phone number, grab my money and some clothes and just start driving. Im in my college parking lot right now having a mini breakdown about it lol.

818,"I don’t know if I’m thinking too much about this...

Today I went grocery shopping with my roommate, originally it was just gonna be me by myself and I was gonna buy some stuff that I needed along with some stuff everyone used (milk, eggs, etc). 

When I asked my roommates if they wanted anything in particular besides the communal things, one of them said she wanted to get more veggies because her dietician told her to eat more of those. She said she would come with me and I was like okay sure.

Usually when a whole group of us go to the grocery store we each pay for what we individually wanted, which makes sense to me, because, outside of the communal things, why would you pay for something that you wouldn’t have bought otherwise? Unless it’s a special occasion and you’re trying to be nice, but over and over again?

Anyways my roommate and I went to the store today and I had a list of things I wanted to buy along with communal things most of us used. I got those stuff, and then my roommate got the veggies and some other things that she wanted. 

This is the second time we went grocery shopping together since the school year began, and the last time I went with her I assumed we were splitting the grocery bill (with what we each individually wanted). But then she just started swiping everything in and I ended up paying for everything, which cost like $50. (please keep in mind we’re college students and not exactly the richest people around)

I wasn’t very happy about it, but I felt rude if I didn’t pay at the time, so I just went with it and brushed it off as a one time thing. I told myself next time I went shopping with roommates we would split the bill. 

But today I guess she assumed it was one of us who was paying for everything again, while I assumed we were splitting. When I started handing her the stuff she wanted she said, “Oh, are we splitting?” 

I said “I guess, unless you don’t want to.” And she said something like no it’s okay and we just split things. 

But she seemed kind of unhappy about it (I think), and then I started to worry that I was being mean for splitting the bill. For context she didn’t just get a few things, she got a lot. I just didn’t want to pay $50+ again for a bunch of things I wouldn’t even use. 

Also having one of us paying for everything is not always the norm — the other day I went shopping for plants with one of my other roommates (not the grocery one) and we split the bill like I expected, there was no misunderstanding.

Was I being mean?

Long story short, he said he will turn off internet for the rest of the day, then wanted to put it back on. I stopped him so he threw a fist, and then I threw a hand.

Due to me being older and way stronger, I overwhelmed him and held him down. He would threaten me out of anger and basically towards the end, I broke down, talking about how I try to better myself as a person so I don’t become a dick towards the people around me.

He calmed down because of that and we went to separate rooms. He apologised and sent me a heart-breaking text, talking about how he feels like I am better than him. How my friends make fun of him and I laugh (in my friend’s defense, they don’t make fun of him, they say what he is doing wrong, e.g. screaming loud enough for neighbours to hear). 

He says the worst part is that whenever he makes a friend and I meet him, he becomes a shadow of me, never better, just following in my footsteps.

I think what makes it worse is how I always talk about how I excited I am for my passion and always insist on him finding something he loves because he doesn’t have a clue. I feel so dumb for not realising how much everything affected him.

It’s really confusing because he tells me he does want to move out and he sounds really happy about it... but then he has his moments where he says he kind of hesitated to move out and his reason is always because his 70 year old father is unemployed and he needs to help him and his mother back in his country with money. He keeps switching back and forth from being happy to saying he can’t because of his family. Every time I look for a room, he always says that we could get something better or he tries to make an excuse. He says he loves me a lot and he doesn’t want to lose me, but I feel different inside. I feel like I’m just there and he doesn’t really like commitment. 
He also proposed to me and told me not to tell anyone. He didn’t even seem happy when he proposed to me. 

Today, I asked him if he was going to move out with me or not. He told me that he couldn’t because he needs to help his dad and his family back in his country financially. Am I wrong to feel this way? My heart is breaking and I can’t concentrate in school. What should I do?",03Sep2020,1

824,"I live with my wife and 2 kids in a state where neither of us have ever been too happy. We love our life and family but our surroundings offer nothing but memories of the past and no real sources of fun or activity outside of the places we have been time and time again. 

I had always had plans to move my family away from this place once and for all, that is, until 2 years ago when I fell ass backwards into a great job that has only gotten better with time and may soon open many doors into an industry that I have dreamed of working in. I love my job but my wife isn't happy here and honestly neither am I. 

What I need advice with is, should I continue to work towards my goal of eventually working in this industry here in my dream job that could really give my family a higher quality of life OR move them to a new state now and just start over from the bottom if I'm even that lucky just to make them and myself happy now? 

Any advice would be appreciated.",03Sep2020,1
825,"Ever since I was 13 I always dreamed about joining the Criminal Investigation Department in my country. After having the opportunity of doing an internship there that was organized from our school I was sure that it was something I wanted to do later. 
I introduced this idea to my mother and she wasn’t amused. She forbid me doing so and said that since she’s a doctor she knows a lot of people working there and that they’re not satisfied with their job. She even introduced me to one and I’m sure that she told him what to tell me so I stop wanting it. Being the naive 15-year-old child I was I believed her and tried to move on. She always wanted me to become a lawyer or doctor but I was never interested in that kind of profession.

Currently we’re in a big fight since now I’m doing something completely different: I want to be an architect. 
I have a boyfriend and after being together for one year he told me that he wants to join the Criminal Investigation Department. And that’s what he’s doing right now. Every time he comes home (we’re living together) he tells me how much fun it was and what kind of things happened at his university(he doesn’t now that it was my dream). And I notice how envious and jealousy I am all the time. My studies start one month later then his so he’s currently going to his university while I’m home. I’m starting to get nervous, thinking that architecture might not be it. Before applying for architecture I watched a lot of interviews and documentaries about architecture students. Now looking back at them they weren’t that happy they seemed rather exhausted (I know that architecture is really time consuming and exhausting).

I know that if I tell my mother that I want to join the Criminal Investigation Department again she’ll be very mad saying that I’m only doing it because my boyfriend is doing it. I know that she’ll stop supporting me. 

I feel like my life is wasted since my mother wanted me to do something I never wanted and now I have to listen every single day what I’m missing out..
How do I deal with this kind of situation? Talking with my mother will do nothing. I know that she’s against it and it was painful enough to try to persuade her into supporting my architecture courses and pay the fees.",03Sep2020,1
827,"So a little background, my husband and I recently moved into a new condo-plex and over the last few weeks our neighbors' kid have gotten louder and louder.  It is mostly her just running around and thumping/jumping.  This is an old building so what may not be that loud on their side, is very loud on our side.  Best I can guess, they are unaware of the noise level on our side. 

So my predicament is that I need to talk to them but I am awkward lol.  I completely understand that we are quarantined and she is a toddler but the noise goes on for hours on end (happening right now) and into the late evening/night.  For instance, last night, it went on from 9:45am to 10:45pm almost nonstop - just loud bangs and thumps and random intervals.  

I don't want to come off rude to them since I understand that having to entertain a toddler all day has to be trying. However, the noise is really disruptive during the work hours (I WFH) and in the late evening when we are trying to relax/unwind.

I also am nervous about creating waves since we are renting and they are likely owners. 

What is the best way to approach this?  I definitely would prefer to speak with them directly and keep it neighborly versus a letter or note as they can easily be misconstrued.  Please help!",03Sep2020,1
828,"  

I don’t know how to even discuss this. I hate even having to get to the point where I’m even posting this. 

My mom is slowly slipping into obsession with conspiracy theories. I want to clarify, that this is not related to delusions, psychosis, or any severe mental health episode. I am seeing this as a curiosity that turned into an interest, that’s slowly turning into an obsession. We aren’t at the point of it being an obsession yet by any means, but it’s getting to the point where it’s very hard for me to navigate.

I have tried addressing the issue in every way I know how. At first I just brushed it off, told her I don’t believe in any of that and tried to change the subject. That turned into her saying that I’m just blind and I should care more about what’s going on. Once in a while this gets a little bit hostile, stating that she is disappointed that I’m choosing to live blind. I have tried being nice and just hearing her out and politely expressing that I don’t like hearing about that stuff because I already hear enough negativity at work (I work in corrections). That turned into her sending me more links and videos and telling me that I’ll see that she was right in the future. I have tried redirecting her and telling her that constantly researching negative stuff impacts your mood whether you’re aware of it or not, and I tried encouraging her to get back into her several other hobbies. That turned into her getting defensive saying that she needs to know what is going on in the world, and it’s not unhealthy. This morning I spoke to her and I told her that she just shouldn’t look at that type of stuff daily because its unhealthy, and that I love her and I’m just worried about her lately. I thought it went well, she was very nice and seemingly receptive, but then finished the conversation with some completely random theory out of nowhere, and said she can’t not think about it, because she needs to know what goes on in the world. Wasn’t rude, wasn’t hostile, but it was just sad that it immediately went back to the thing I’ve been avoiding for days.

Most of the time its completely fine and it just blows over without issue. She doesn’t get rude or hostile hardly at all, but she definitely gets defensive and I end up just letting it go because I know I won’t win. But it’s getting more and more frequent, where we can be talking about some unrelated subject and she’ll briefly interject some quick point. I can tell she’s thinking about it entirely too much. I’m an adult, and I haven’t lived at home in years, but I have always had an extremely close relationship to my mom and dad. I speak to both of them (live together) almost daily. I absolutely love both of them, and they have done so much for me throughout my life – I would never be where I am without either of them. I love my mom, but it makes me very sad, and extremely scared seeing her take on this new interest, because it is slowly starting to consume her. She even started posting the stuff on Facebook and arguing with people about it, which is very embarrassing. I pray that this is just some fad or interest that will just fizzle out, as some interests do for all of us. 

I just don’t know what to do. I am internalizing how I truly feel about this, because it worries me more than I can put into words.",03Sep2020,1

Last year he was in a minor car collision, he crashed into the back of another car. Very minimal damage, no damage to his car and only small bumper damaged to the other car. He has this all on dashcam footage. 

He called his insurers and explained what happened, he also reported it to the police in the event of a legal claim. His insurers said they would be in touch if it was reported to them.

He heard nothing. 

A year and a half later he is looking for new cheaper insurance and a different insurance company tell him there is a claim on his account for £2,801. This is from the collision last year.

(1) there is no way the damage he caused was £2.8k. Maybe £200 at the most. [nb: not sure what type of car the other driver had, I didn’t think to ask my brother]

(2) his insurers never called him to query this. He told them he had dashcam footage. They paid this money out without talking to him or asking what the damage on his car was if the other driver was claiming £2.8k

What are his options here? Note we live in U.K. so any advice is great

So far we have planned for him to call the claims team of his insurer provider tomorrow to ask why he wasn’t informed about this claim, why they paid out when he didn’t admit fault, why they paid out without getting his dashcam footage showing minimal damage to the other car.",03Sep2020,1

838,"Hi, so I basically wanted to know what I could do when my dad puts my pc in another room and locks it. So basically i started grade 11 and I love playing video games however he only allows me to play 1 hour then locks the room for the whole day, I would like to do other things on it like studying and listening to music and what not but i have a laptop so he just says to study on there. He doesnt trust me to play at the time I want to play. He usually lets me play based on his mood or grades that I get. If i get decent grades-or not the best grades in the class it means that i have been playing too much and locks it again.

This annoys me even more since when he locks my pc or takes my electronics i feel like i dont want to study or go outside or do anything productive. if he allows me to play at the times I want then i feel like i have to choice of being productive and motivates me more.

I never fail my classes and the worse i get is decent to average grades however he wants the top 5 % class grades while taking everything and controlling me which makes me put worse effort into my assignmesnts and tests. What pisses me off is that it doesnt effect him and he is carefree afterwards however if i want to spend my free time on my pc its locked in a room i cant get access to. Then if i want to go the gym or do anything productive i feel like i am being forced and being manipulated into doing things then i jsut end up mindlessly browsing. I guess this is rebeling or whatever but i feel its unjust that he does this.

As well as at night he makes me give electronics at 10:30-11 pm however i am a late sleeper so i usually sleep at 1-2 am in school nights and like 3-4 pm on the week ends. he says if u cant sleep just read books till 1 or 2 am. This is extremely dumb logic and i would just bore my self to death

So for the past year I’ve been talking and getting close with a boy online from America.

We play games, just talk, watch movies together, and do nfsw things together. But in all that time, I haven’t been at school. Next week I’m starting school and I know that means I’ll hardly be able to talk to him, since he’s 7 hours behind me. The thought of that makes my heart break and I start to cry everytime I think about it. I love him but I’m not going to be able to spend any time with him and I’m scared it’s going to make me want to drop out of school, or just make me depressed. I don’t know what to do. I know having this relationship online with someone 7 hours behind me probably isn’t healthy, but he makes me so incredibly happy and I can’t stand the thought of not spending time with him.

Basecly my whole life just feels like a mess.
I'm pretty deppresed and just tired sort of, mainly it comes down to a few simple things

- My looks/appearance
- Dating/girls 
- Current ""conditions"" or issues

Before I sound like big incel I want to say while I was in the incel community actually for a year, I left and don't agree with most of their ideas and agendas. ( That's why I left mainly).

First of my looks are just straight up bad and I hate them. I'm around 5,3 ft tall, thin blonde hair, weak feminine face ( I'm 18 ), small frame, just as said bad face sort off. I just genuinely hate it and want to look better and well a fairly small you know what

In relation to that I also have never gotten laid and never think I will, because of my looks. 

Third, I got several issues. An incurable permanent scalp condition Wich causes a super dry and messed up scalp and hairloss, rly bad posture and possibly mild scoliosis, social anxiety, no friends or social circle, and some other things. 

Now I don't blame girls of rejecting me at all, I could actually go deeply into it because I have a very specific and special view on looks, attraction and dating, but basecly I don't blame girls I blame my looks/genes. I don't hate girls, I hate my looks. 


Anyhow, I just don't know what to do. I just hate my life, feel helpless and just want it to end. Btw yea I do try to care of appearance, be healthy and so on, but I'm very pesmistic, run into issues and mess up. Oh and also I feel like nobody aside the incel or doomer  community gives a shit about me or tries to understand me. Everyone else seem to either blame me one way or another, deny whatever I think, not care or like forexample FDS simply think off guys like me as genneticaly inferior and weak who shouldn't breed and dying alone just being natural selection.

849,"At this point, I (27/F) am desperate for any and all advice any of you may have to offer my. This is a year long story, so I will try my beat to condense it to only the important details. 

Last October (2019) my boyfriend (28/M) sold his house with the anticipation of purchasing his childhood home the following July. Since we live together, the agreement was that we would temporarily live with his mom (in childhood home) until the mortgage was due for renewal. Then, we’d take over the mortgage and she would move out and find her own place. 

Of course, living with my MIL was not the ideal - but I looked at it as an opportunity to save up some money. Plus like, I could justify it knowing it would only be a few months. 

During covid I lost my job and all subsequent income, which burned through all of my savings. I also attend university so any extra money that I had saved up has to go to books and tuition. Because all of my savings have been burned through, we cannot afford for MIL to move out until at least next May when I finish school. 

While I was apprehensive to make this agreement, I know having her stay here is what’s best for us and will allow us to save up more money. 

The problem, however, is that MIL has no boundaries. She constantly tries to parent/coddle me and makes little jabs and comments about how I do things all of the time. She’ll make appointments for me or nag me about needing to do certain things (ie, If she knew my car needed an oil change she would nag until I mad wan appointment) She inserts herself into mine and BFs relationship and expects us to drop everything instantly if she needs a favour. These are only a few examples of things she does, and, despite BF now owning the house, she makes it seem like this is HER house, and to be honest, I feel like a guest in my own home. 

I am trying to maintain a healthy relationship with my BF and MIL but it’s is next to impossible when his mother is always inserting herself, making little comments, or micro-managing whatever I try to do. 

We have tried to talk to her about these things, and she often takes them personally and gets really upset and will pout for days... yes... pout. Or, she will change her behaviours for a day or two and then go back to doing the things we’ve asked her not to do. 

I feel like talking to her has become hopeless as she always reverts back to what she was doing or just gets upset. I feel like her moving out is not an option as we cannot afford our house without her. I know she is coming from a good place and means well, but I lived on my own for a long time, I’m almost 30 and I know how to be self sufficient without her help. 

I am unsure on what else could we do? I feel like I am sacrificing my own sanity and happiness just so we don’t have to live pay check to pay check. It is hard to have foresight.",03Sep2020,1

My sister and her then bf had a history of breaking up and making up so it was pretty much doomed either way. 

But this guy had no business jumping into the situation even though he was friends with my sisters ex.

The neighbor said he could not find someone and would let us know what he would do. We did not get any updates and fast forward to today the neighbor is getting the shingles on the whole right side of his house replaced and said we can expect a $3000 bill.

 I have a son that is now 8 as well. She treats him the same. Now my girlfriend states that her daughter loves us but there is no indication that this is true because she only tells her mom this when it’s just the two of them.

 I’ve spent time with her. Taken her out to eat or to the park when her mom needs time. Taught her to ride a bicycle, bought her art supplies/kits and sat on the floor and played with her. I’ve watched her do the same tiktok dances over and over again but none of it gets me to a place where she isn’t shitty toward me.
 
 Her dad is only in the picture now because when he would promise to do something and flake out I would hate to see her “crushed” and stepped up (moms get primary custody in Texas so I don’t have my son but every other weekend) since it seemed like the right thing to do.

 No change.

Her mom, my girlfriend, just sits back and says I need to have patience but when my evenings are spent being sassed, harassed and listening to her mom ask/tell her to do certain things over and over I decided that it was no longer the scene for me and broke off the relationship.

 I cared for them both and girlfriend talked about us getting a place together but it was not getting any better/changing and at times I felt like I had to be the adult/parent and was always reminded that it wasn’t my job and girlfriend wouldn’t take advice on how to stick to what you say and follow through without using physical disciplinary methods.

859,"A friend of mine, let's call him Mike, introduced me to a friend of his, we will call him Dennis, a few months back. Dennis worked freelance at a callcenter and had a job for me under him with the same contract he had, the only difference was the he wanted to earn 10 euro's per sale on me. I agreed to this, because I would still earn a lot for my age (19) and I couldn't go straight to the real bosses for the contract he had, since they weren't offering that anymore. He got 85 euros per sale and I would get 75 (I verified that this was indeed what he got). 

Mike warned me that although Dennis is a good guy to have in parties, he cannot be trusted. Hard-headed me obviously didn't listen to him and all the other people warning me, so I went to the callcenter to sell energycontracts. I would first have a trial period as to see if I could even do it and my  selling skills turned out to be alright, but definetly nothing above average. I worked three weeks and got 10 sales that went through for which I would get commission. This week was the time to sign the contract, but I eventually realised that I was screwing over people on the phone for money, and didn't want to work there anymore. People in this country have 14 days to undo any purchase or contract and all the people I sold were still in these 14 days, so I wanted to call them to please undo the contract I made them sign. I told my parents about this plan, but they where worried about retribution from the callcenter people since they know where we live. So I eventually did not call those people back.

I told Dennis I didn't want to sign the contract and he said OK and that I would get the money I worked for, approximately 800 euros at the end of september. 

A week later I got a call from him saying that the money couldn't be paid in cash, but it would have to be in Amazon coupons, because;

1) I didn't sign a contract with them so we would be breaking a law if the money was paid.

2) I didn't get some callcenter certification (for 200 euros) which is something every callcenter freelancer needs to sell energycontracts, or the energy companies will revoke their relationship with the callcenter

3) tax purposes

I thought alright, fine, definetly not ideal, but OK.

A few weeks go by and I get a call from my friend Mike. He said he broke off communications with Dennis because Dennis told Mike with pride that he would not pay me, or at most a hundred euros. I can't be mad at this, because I was warned, I screwed people for this money and maybe this would be the cost of my wrongdoings. I wish that was the end of the story, but it isn't; Dennis called Mike yesterday to threaten him and that he will break his window because Mike blocked him on everything. He has done this before. 

 If you still have doubt about what side to take since I screwed people on the phone aswell, so what makes me different from him? Well there isn't much I can say to prove how sorry I am for what I did, I could have continued working there, earning 8000 euros a month, approximately 9000 dollars, but I didn't, and for the bad I did to the 10 people I sold a contract to, I am eternally sorry. You might still not think I earn your advice. That is fine but maybe you could help get this guy for what he is and did and does, not helping me, but getting this guy. I might motivate you with this thing he did: Dennis got an elderly lady on the phone from 1941 or something. Every person above 75 after signing a contract by phone will get a call back from someone else to make sure they weren't lied into signing, since this age group is vulnerable to people like Dennis. Dennis was lying to her the entire conversation about the prices (which is illegal) and didn't want her to get a call from someone, so he manipulated her into saying that she was from 1945. She was still doubting to sign the final form to make it official, so she said to Dennis to call her daughter. He did and lied to her aswell, but this time he couldn't hide behind ""they said this, so it was legal"" so after the call he got rid of all the contact details so the conversation would never be found if the family would ever make a problem out of it (all phonecalls are saved for 7 years by law). What he doesn't know is that I happened to have written down the time and date of his phonecall and I know in which employee account to look, so it can actually be found. 

In summary; he doesn't want to pay me, he threatened my friend and he broke laws to prey on an elderly lady. Those are the things he did which I think are illegal. I don't even want the money back, I just want my friend not to worry about Dennis' threats. Everything beyond that is a bonus.

Do you have advice?

P.S. to anyone from this callcenter who knows who I am and is thinking about doing something funny to me; trust the fact that the media along with everybody hates preying, Wolf of Wallstreet like callcenters, and that the media will grab every excuse to expose this callcenter, which they have done in the past. This will cost more than 800 euros.",03Sep2020,1

864,"Due to COVID I opted to live off campus due to being higher risk and also because are school protocols really did not make much sense.   It is my last semester so a 'gap' year or semester wouldn't of been a great choice for me.  I do not get to utilize any on campus resources when living off campus.   
 They raised tuition and opted to have a 14 week semester split into two seven week semesters so we are cramming in an entire semester of a class in seven weeks which is extremely difficult to do with a math class and a business math class (both which I am taking).  It is a private college.  I think in times like these where people haven't been able to work and finances are tight they should be somewhat forgiving.

EMAIL BELOW: 

Hi,   


I am wondering why we are charged $810 to live off campus?  I understand it is usually charged but it seems inappropriate for that fee to exist in the current economical situation.  First off, we aren't using any campus resources when living off campus.  Second, since I am living off campus due to medical reasons and COVID so in order to protect myself it was my only option.  Third, tuition went up, times are hard and we are not getting the same learning experience as we would on campus.  We also did not get the $1,000 housing credit from last semester when we left early; we only got $800 (see attachment below of original email sent out).  That $810 is almost two rent payments for me.

Hi, I’m 20 (F) and I’ve been struggling with my mental health for some time now (I usually don’t talk to anyone about this as well, people who know me DO NOT KNOW that I have this problem lol I’m so good at hiding it) and it’s just been all too much and I really really just need to talk to someone right now. To start things off, I’m on my last year in uni and I live with a single mother (my dad barely supported my education, he only came back like during my 3rd year of uni where he decided to share with my mom in paying my bills for edu) and since then, he has promised to pay for my tuition until I graduate. Luckily for him, I’m now down to my 2nd to last term (yay) and he’s only paying like $200 for my next term since its practicum. My mom is a financial advisor in one of the biggest insurance companies and shes been there since I was born.

Growing up, we always had financial problems since my mom put my older sister and I into really good schools (way over her budget) because she wanted us to receive education better than hers. I am eternally grateful for that because certainly, going into these schools have really shifted my perspective in academics and I have gained a lot as I believe I have a promising future ahead. However, living poor and being sent into these good schools usually make me feel insecure and inferior towards my peers (most of my friends have really good family backgrounds, both parents present, very wealthy) while for me, I have been living in small rental apartments together with my mom and sister for several years already. One time I even lived in a studio apartment with them while in high school (I did not even know this since my mind was in social media, I guess it never bothered me at the time). Now that I’m older, I have reassessed my life situation and I’ve been also exposed to different families (had an ex who was extremely wealthier than me) so I was shocked with how great their life seemed to be just because they had more money than I do. My mom lacks leadership skills and only sees herself running around the wheel, as she is perfectly fine being in the rat race. On the other hand, I am the opposite since I decided to leave my own mark in uni and have a really good reputation with regards to organizations and academics (that’s why I got to hide my true form from my peers). Living as an independent, self-asserted woman made me realize my purpose and I guess I held so much pride up to this day because I realized I can make that happen just because I have the ability in me to do so. I am a responsible young woman and my peers even think I am rich (like them) because I also have the new Apple gadgets and I speak like them. But in reality, I just adjusted to how they are.

During the lockdown, my mom has been nagging me to join and help her in her financial advisor gig. I am actually under her but I just don’t seem to see her as a leader type, even though she is someone I look up to, because of our lifestyle and living conditions at home. Don’t get me wrong, but I am very grateful that she chose to put her children first than her needs but I guess it’s hard to realize that when you start comparing yourself to other people and start to question why you are different. I always tell her that I will help her (I am good at marketing and even making concepts digitally) but I always seem to put it off and now I’m scared because my mom might lose her position because she is lacking clients. She always told me to message people since she is the one who will discuss the plans to them anyway but I just never do it. This week, I’ve had some introspection going and I finally decide that I want to help out. But I guess, I look down on myself too much that I don’t even think I can do it. Please help me change my life around and please tell me what to do/how I can get over this self-sabotaging phase I’ve been in months because I just can’t do it anymore. Please help me.

TLDR; I live with a single mom and shes been telling me to help her in her work but I look down on her and I always put it off. Please help me get over this and find motivation to finally help the both of us get out of this poor lifestyle",03Sep2020,1
868,"Hello. 

Idk if i’m looking for advice or just approval that i’m doing the right thing...

I renewed my lease at my complex in march so I am here until April 2021. Someone moved in below me in February. She has a pretty big dog. I love dogs I have one of my own and that doesn’t bother me..But knowing the breed, a little too energetic to be an apartment dog, in my opinion.

Around March and thru April I started noticing her dog screaming and crying...this poor guy has major separation anxiety. I felt bad at first, but then even with music or the tv on the dogs scream overpowered everything. there was so peace and quiet. i started to feel like I was losing my mind so I took some videos and sent it to the leasing office asking what to do. they said it was part of the lease that you can’t have a dog bark excessively. 

I ended up with the woman’s phone number because she wanted to apologize. she said she knows he has separation anxiety and she will just bring her dog to work with her (must be a nice job lol).

It was nice and quiet until around late May she started putting gates up around her patio, blocking the path way behind my apartment. she has now created a backyard for her dog at this apartment. it wasn’t too bad at first because it was only here and there she had the gates to let her dog run around. In June/July it became almost everyday. 8am to 10pm at night. her dog would run around out there and bark SO LOUD. to the point she would put sheets over the gate to stop him from seeing people so he wouldn’t bark. at this point, i’m working from home due to covid. my poor dog is so anxious bc he hears barking all day and I can’t even concentrate. she leaves the poop out there or puts it in bags and leaves those out there in the sun. so there’s flies galore. it’s becoming unbearable to live here. especially now that I started my online masters program. My dog can’t sit out on the balcony because he gets so anxious about her dog and he will just bark at my dog the entire time. I can’t sit on the balcony because he is so loud I can’t relax. After being in  quarantine 6 months and I can’t even sit on my own balcony to relax...

Yesterday, so 3ish months of dealing with this, I finally had enough. I emailed the complex and said I don’t feel comfortable telling her myself. but this has to be violating the lease. the leasing office said they will send her an email and if it happens again, to say something. Now i’m afraid she is going to hate me. 

Am I doing the right thing. should I have gone to her myself? I just don’t feel comfortable and it’s a weird position to be in. Just need to put this out there and get others opinions.",03Sep2020,1

882,"This is something that’s happened the last 3 or 4 times I’ve tried to be friends with a guy; we talk a few times, start talking a lot, become pretty good friends then they start hating me all of a sudden. I have absolutely no idea why, and it’s one of the hardest things I have to deal with when it happens. I think to myself, “okay, cool, I’ve made a new friend!”, then 1-3 months into the friendship they start hating me. This is particularly hard for me because I’m a very passionate person so I take friendships and relationships very seriously. Once I feel that I’m officially friends with someone, I have no problem with buying them food, asking to hang out, etc.. I’m pretty nice and I like to think of myself as a good friend but I don’t know why me being a good friend isn’t resulting in a long lasting or mutually beneficial friendship. Sometimes I can tell when they’re distancing themselves and I panic. I may give them space or check on them to make sure they’re okay (or to make sure I haven’t done anything wrong), it never helps though. Other times there’s a very distinctive switch, and the person who was really sweet and responsive is now extremely cold and vague. I get ignored for days then when I confront them I get a bullshit excuse like “I was busy,” when I talk to people while I’m busy ALL THE TIME. An entire conversation isn’t even necessary if you’re busy, a simple text like, “Busy today, but hopefully we can talk soon!” would give me some much needed reassurance. Every time it happens, it seems to sting and eat away at me more than it did the last time. It may not seem like that big of a deal but I’d like to become friends with a guy before I date or marry him but if I can’t even get passed the friendship stage then I’m doomed.",03Sep2020,1
883,"I have a group of 7 close girl friends. We share the same classes, always talk on our group chat and always hang out on weekends. Besides the main group chat, we have one that includes only five of us, as we shared a stronger bond. We would consider ourselves sisters and, although it took some time to be able to say so, I trusted them. Well that was before covid. Surely the group chat was still active, but we weren’t able to see one another for months (something we hadn’t done in years).

Last weekend I found out that 4 of my closest friends had seen one another (more than once) in the last two months. Two of them have beach houses that are close and one of them (the girl I trusted the most) even took two of friends, in separate weeks, to her house and they all met. 
They have been acting as if they didn’t meet, as they have been facing a 6 month isolation and missed everyone, talked about how they longed meeting each girl from the group. They never said a word about their meetings, as one of their mothers told mine. Apparently, their mothers told them not to go around telling what happened, but I see no reason for the lying.

I feel lied to and betrayed by the friends I cared the most, by the people I trusted. I feel that I am not worth their full friendship. My most trusted friend’s mother offered her to invite me to their beach house or their apartment, but she said I had been following self-isolation too rigidly and wouldn’t accept. 

On the other hand, a friend I started calling my friend during quarantine thought I was too lonely and knew that I wasn’t in the best place mentally got me something I really wanted and delivered to my house so I would see a friendly face after 6 months. I feel like someone that has known me for far less time cares more about me than the people that said they saw me as a sister.

I have been dealing with trust issues for most of my life, so the people I called friends lying and saying they cared about me as they did to the other girls really hurt me. I feel like when I end up trusting others, they break that bond. I can`t just pretend that it didn`t happen and I don’t feel like talking to them about that will solve anything. 

I know full well that I am probably taking it too seriously and turning it into something bigger than it really is, but I wanted another view on the subject. I’ve always felt like I should respect my feelings, but maybe I am the wrong one in the situation.

884,"Hi there, 

Been feeling really down these past few days thinking about this issue and need some advice. 

I’m a 19 year old guy and I’ve had the same 6 or so main friends since I was about 14. I’ve always struggled somewhat with making friends, especially the older I get and so I’ve never really been able to find many people I just ‘clicked’ with. 

Anyway, long story short I recently went on a holiday with one of my friends and 6 of his friends. We spent a week together, and it was honestly a lightbulb moment in a way reminding me that I’d forgotten what a friendship was supposed to be like. They clearly all really liked each other’s company, had a laugh and never once fell out. I just feel such an immense amount of jealousy that I’m not a part of a group like that. 

With my friends, it’s almost like we’ve just tolerated each other since school. We regularly have arguments and rifts, I don’t particularly root for them to do well in life at all and I can say with certainty that they don’t for me. It’s so clear none of us gets anything out of friendship with the other except perhaps a lack of loneliness and it just pains me so much that I’ve messed up so bad and left myself in a position where I’ve got no one I feel I can really turn to. 

I’m not the most outgoing person either as I said earlier so I would find it really difficult to make new friends, but any advice would be much appreciated. 

Thanks.",03Sep2020,1
885,"I've had stomach pains for around 2 months. When they started, I thought they were period pains and just dealt with them. I took medicine, had baths and just carried on. But lately, they've been getting worse. I went to the doctor, they prescribed me some medication for IBS. It didn't work. I had to go to hospital, the doctor said I had an abdominal sprain and I just needed to rest. I've been resting for around a week now. Literally, bed bound. Only times I get up are when I go to the toilet, shower and get food.
And the pain is just getting worse, even with the painkillers, the medication and the ice packs. I want to call again but I'm just scared to tell him that I need to go back to school soon. That I can't stay in bed all day, and that I'm not trusting his judgement.

890,"Ok so first off I just want to make it clear that my mom loves hamsters and animals in general, but in this case, she just doesn't understand how to take care of a hamster properly, even tho she doesn't mean any harm.

My family got a hamster around one year ago. My mom has had a lot of hamsters in her life and acording to her, she is ""experienced"". But I wanted to do some research anyway on hamster care and their behavior. Turns out the way my mom think you take care of hamsters, is insanely outdated. For example she bought a small cage for the hamster. It's just above the legal bare minimum. Her excuse is that ""they don't have that big of territories in the wild anyway"" which is no way true, as most cages that are out there, aren't even half as big as the natural territory of a hamster. She also puts barely no bedding in the cage, which gives the hamster no space to burrow at all. There is also no sources of entertainment that can stimulate its brain, which is really important for hamsters well being.

I've tried everything to convince her that the way she treats the hamster is wrong! Showing her reliable sources that even SHE says she usually trust, I've tried asking the staff when we are in pet stores, who have proved her wrong several times, I've tried telling her that I can pay for literally everything for the hamster, I've even told her I want to move away to my dad (seperated parents), because I don't want to support her bad ""hamster care"", but nothing works. It always result in hour long arguments that end up in me literally crying because she gets mad and aggressive.

How do I get her to change opinion? I feel so bad for the hamster and I really want it to live the best possible life.


TL;DR My mom doesn't know how to care for out hamster properly, and she won't give the hamster what it needs, just because she thinks she is right, nothing I do convinces her. How do I get her to change opinion?",03Sep2020,1
891,"My question title is angry because I’ve dealt with loneliness my entire life, and it’s ridiculous. The only periods in my life that I haven’t felt alone were in middle school, 7th grade, when I had a best friend that was with me the entire school day and in 8th grade, when I had friends with me the entire school day.

My loneliness only stops when a friend/person I actually like is physically with me very often, and that’s just not going to happen often, nor is that sustainable. My emotions seem to choose to ignore my online friends or the friends I have that are just busy at the moment. I try to repeat, “just because I have no one to talk to right now doesn’t mean I’m not loved,” which has helped somewhat. The only thing that stops the feeling temporarily is distracting myself via video games or college work.

It’s recently become a worse problem because my girlfriend expressed that I basically rely on her too much, and it stresses her. I’ve made new friends since then, but either they aren’t there enough or I don’t like them much. Loneliness is also a dangerous feeling for me; the two times I’ve been hospitalized on suicide watch, it was after feeling abandoned by friends and extremely alone. Since starting an antidepressant that actually works, my depression is nearly gone, but it pops up again when I feel very alone.

How can I finally stop feeling alone when I’m not logically alone? Or at least take steps towards it? I’m fed up with having the same problem for years and years.",03Sep2020,1

893,"Hey guys so basically I’m going through it at the moment cos life’s a bitch and whatever. I feel like the only way to get anything out of this is to tell someone, but because of my upbringing and my pride I would never share this with anyone I know personally.

I’m a 20 year old student and I’ve not had the most idealistic or conventional life up to this point but I’m still grateful and appreciate everything my mother has done and sacrificed in order for me to have a “happy” life. Never been spoilt in fact, the opposite and also was overly protected. My mother was brought up in a third world country that is very conservative where mental health is never talked about or even considered and seen as a thing that westernised people use as an “excuse”.

I’ve always been an over thinker and such but recently I swear I’ve gone through 5 years of mental trauma in a span of 5 months. I’ve been using weed and ketamine as a gateway as I do not know how to deal with these thoughts, and now that I’ve ran out of weed all I can think about is my life...

894,"The reason why I feel like I'm shooting myself on the foot is that I'm afraid I will have to continue depending financially on my parents for the next two years. I would not be able to pay for the MBA myself, but I was hoping I could get a job (have been unemployed for more than a year) and basically have them pay only for my studies and pay everything else myself. 

I was interviewing with an IT company that claims to be big on flexible scheduling, but when I informed them I got admitted to the MBA, which would require me to attend classes every other Friday and Saturday for 10 months a year, they ""advised"" me to freeze the recruitment process in order to not let the opportunity to do the MBA go to waste, and told me that if I decided to contact them in the future they would be happy to pick up were we left off since they always have open positions. However, they are open to continue interviewing me if I decline the MBA, and told me that ultimately the decision lies on my hands. 

Looking back at it, I realized that I made the decision to apply in a rush. We were right on the peak of covid in my country, and I had recently had an argument with my parents because they made me clear that they would not let me seek a job while I'm living with my older sister, who is in the high-risk group, so I thought I should better do it then. I was hoping to do my master's abroad, but my parents would not be able to afford that, and at that time, the curve in my country was just reaching its peak, and a vaccine remained a distant possibility, unlike now, where it is becoming more of a possibility to have a vaccine for next year. I though I was going to be in it for a long time, and therefore it was worth it to do it and be done with it.

I have to admit one big reason I want to be independent is that I want to get a little bit away from my family, which is loving but very, very controlling. Pre-covid, they took an issue with my going out almost every weekend. Both my parents have a strong stance against alcohol, opposing even moderate consumption. They call me often to check what I'm doing even if I live at least 500 km from both of them (they are divorced), and since I live with my older sister, little white lies are not an option. Whenever I go out to party I must inform them and when I come back as well, and my sister won't let me go out without telling them. Now with covid, I have been able to see my friends very few times even long after the stay-at-home orders have been mostly lifted. I understand why this happens, but I still feel depressed because I look at my friends , they are financially independent, and they are able to do what they want, and go wherever they want, without constant arguments and nagging fro the family, and think that if I were independent, I could be like them.

I'm currently almost 29. When I finish up the MBA I will be 31, and I feel that by then, my best years will have passed me by and I will no longer be in my prime. Therefore, although it might seem shallow and trivial, I feel like right now is the time to enjoy and be carefree while I still can, and when I finally get my family's blessing to move out (probable after I finish my MBA), it will already be time for me to settle down, i.e., too late. 

Should I just take it and continue with the MBA? Or is there any way to decline admission without looking unprofessional and burning bridges?",03Sep2020,1

903,"Please bare with me for this long story. I really need to vent it out somewhere and I really hope this is the right place.

Let me preface this by saying that I am a gay women who has been in a relationship with my partner for 2 years. 

A couple months ago I (24F) was looking for a job and had a friend (24F) who was working in a microbiology lab at the college I went to. She said they were looking for a second technician and suggested me to her boss. The job was exactly in my field of work so I agreed to meet up with her two bosses ( both female college professors).

I met up with them and they both seemed very impressed by my resume and I thought I had made a good impression. They said they wanted to hire me but would have to push some paperwork through. I was then asked to just start work and that they would get the paperwork through by the end of the week. 

So I started work and learned the ropes from my friend ( its a solitary job without any involvement of the two bosses). Friday comes around and for some reason the paperwork didn't get pushed through. My friend got a text from boss 1 that said something along the lines of ,"" The boss 2 doesn't like her and we don't want her for the job."" Naturally, thinking I wasn't going to get paid, I went home for the day. The next Monday, my friend got another text from boss 1 saying that she was just testing me. I decided I didn't like that the bosses couldn't confront me directly about this so I called them and politely declined to work there. I just thought it was so odd that they wanted me so badly and then got cold all of a sudden.  My friend also didn't understand what happened as she knew the position was perfect for me and most people get along with me.

Fast forward a few months later and the friend had to go on a trip with the two bosses. They shared an airbnb and she overhead them talking in the other room. My friend told me that they were making fun of gay people and calling them a bunch of slurs. Apparently my name also came up in the conversation with some not so nice slurs.

My friend was upset and later asked boss 2 why she didn't like me.  Boss 2's answer was: "" well, you know shes 'different'"". My friend asked what that meant and boss 2 just said it was okay if she didn't understand. 

My friend thinks that they discriminated against me for being gay, which is why they all of a sudden decided they didn't like me . I am really not sure, since I wasn't there, but things aren't really adding up for the whole situation.  And also how would they know? did they google me? I don't think it's obvious that I am gay.

I feel really icky about the whole situation. I didn't think these things happened anymore, especially in the academia world.  Am I overthinking this? What do you guys think?",03Sep2020,1
904,"Haven't been on social media or reddit for years now, so I decided I'd make a new account. 
This is gonna be a long one so hold tight.

I just recently turned 22 and have been unemployed for almost a year. My last job was as a mover and I was working 12 hour days regularly and wasn't being properly compensated. I got into an argument about something stupid with the owner one day and he took me off the schedule for 2 weeks so I just left. Shortly after that I broke my wrist and was out of commission for a few months. Luckily, I was able to collect state benefits like healthcare and snap which has been helping me scrape by since the incident. But my extension on those benefits has just ended, so I'm completely fucked if I can't find a job soon.

My mover job wasn't my first shitty job experience but just the last time I realized I ever wanted to do anything for anyone else. Before that, I worked 3 weeks at amazon, where we were treated like caddle with only a handful of brain cells between us. And way before that I was a delivery driver for a fast food chain (those were better times).

But by far the most traumatizing work experience I had was when I used to do demolition work for a small restoration company. Long days, salaried for some reason, if I called off sick my pay would be cut lower than it already was, not able to wear propper PPE half the time because they didn't want to pay for it; And one day I was driving the company van in stop and go traffic, and I got into my first accident (I was 19). No one was really hurt except the guy two cars ahead was complaining his ""neck hurt"" which was an obvious lie. I was a mess and that same guy tried to calm me down and told me ""it's fine, just let the insurance companies handle it"", so I did what I thought was right and called the police, got the information from the other two guys involved, and sat tight. But low and behold, my employer had no insurance (AND expired registration) at the time, so he wanted me to give them *MY* insurance. I declined and he later yelled at me for giving them the expired card that was in the glove box. I quit shortly thereafter because that company was just so fucked beyond belief.
Fast forward a couple months and the guy whose neck ""hurt"" is trying to sue me for damages because he never got compensation from the insurance company. I just redirected them to the company I worked for. I am still getting letters from this guy threatening to take legal action to this day. This has made me so anxious and depressed that my mother has taken to dealing with it for me because I can't help but zone out completely from stress at the mere mention of the subject.

I am terrified of going back to work. I'm scared of labor jobs but I don't really have any skills. I don't want to go back to working for some asshole in some company that couldn't give less of a shit about me. I'm terrified of answering my phone. I'm too scared to open my emails. I'm paranoid that the next thing I try to accomplish in my life, the next job I take, the next person I meet, will only serve to fuck my life in the ass harder than the thrust before it. But the savings my mother has left for me are running dry, and I can't afford to survive. 

On top of this, I am extrememly isolated. I mentioned before I haven't been on social media in years, but I also haven't done much socially irl in all those years. I'm quiet, don't make many friends, and people generally scare me. I play guitar and have been trying to get into music, going so far as to even pay 13k to learn how to be an audio engineer from a professional at a studio but I just can't get it. I thought maybe finding a girlfriend could help me and tried some dating sites but in my current state I'm not exactly ""prince charming"". All of this nonsense has just made it so, so much worse, and I feel like my life is completely unsalvagable. I know that I am smart and well capable of better things, but I see the state of my life and the world at the moment and my heart just sinks so deep it can't be fished out. The worst part is that I'm white, and generally seen as pretty well off. So it almost feels unfair that I should have all this privilage and let it go to waste.

Anyway, I'm going to keep ranting if I don't put a sock in it now. Sorry for such a long post.",03Sep2020,1
905,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancé and I were set to get married at a courthouse in mid October with just our parents because of covid and our small budget. We have been engaged for over a year but no one seemed to care or want to help so we made our small unassuming covid proof plans and were happy with them. Until a few weeks ago, my fiancés mother decided she wanted to participate and started making all of these plans with her local connections to get us a venue for free to have a ceremony and reception. She spoke with the owner of a local venue and told us we were good to go with a max capacity of 25 people, so we were able to assemble a small wedding party, wrangle food, and invite guests all in a week or so. Now today we are being told that the venue has been assessed a fine from the town for not following covid protocols in the past. We can still have our wedding there but it essentially has to be undercover, we cant bring our own food, we cant even reserve a space. we just have to show up and hope they have space for us on that day. We don't want to do any of this but our only other option feels like cancelling the whole thing and going back to just us and our parents again. we already asked our closest friends to be in our wedding party, I bought groomsman gifts, she bought bridesmaids gifts, we have received wedding gifts from people that would now need to be UNINVITED. I invited my grandma who I assume has already booked a ticket to come here and I honestly don't know how much longer she has. I feel like the only responsible thing to do is tell everyone that the wedding is off but I'm mortified to have these conversations. I have to get psyched up just to make normal phone calls. I don't really think any of you can help me but I've been sitting at my desk at work just worrying all day and just kind of wanted to scream into the void. We weren't even going to have a wedding, then we got forced into planning one at a break neck pace, then we got it done and have to cancel it. I'm just so upset.

She’s abusive towards my pets and has threatened me before, I feel like she will be so pissed something bad will happen to me. I don’t know how to properly plan this. If I tell my counselor/teacher, will they just call my parents? Are they obligated to tell my mom? If I call CPS, how long will it take for them to actually check it out? Should I be out of the house whenever they are there? My mom is great at convincing people everything is fine and how good of a parent she is. What will happen to me if they agree she is abusive? I have no one to stay with-I don’t know anything about this whole process and I really need advice on what to do. I’m also never home alone, my mom is disabled and we live off child support &amp; alimony. I was never planning on telling adults in my life because of how stressful this whole situation is and was planning on waiting until 18 to move out but I don’t think I’ll be able to make it to then. Also would like to mention that I am extremely worried about my pets. I have 4 dogs and 2 cats who I love with all my heart and have had pretty much my entire life. They are currently being physically abused by my mother and I don’t know how that would work out either. Thank you if you’ve read this far I’m just so fucking scared for all of this and for my safety and I really need advice.",03Sep2020,1
907,"I apologize if the formatting is funky, I am typing this all out on my phone. 


I was raised Christian my entire life and I’m 19 years old and female. I considered myself an atheist from about 12 years old to about 16 years old. During those times I also considered myself a Laveyan Satanist, but then I later learned the leader of it was a fluke, so I dropped that and never looked back. 


I want to find something that confirms or has the same ideas, morals and beliefs I already have. I don’t know how exactly to “find” that though. I know I can look through popular religions, but there are so many and there are more unpopular religions I might not know about that could be for me.

913,"I'm currently a high-school senior. I'll (hopefully) be graduating in may and heading off to college in the fall .

Anyway, with COVID currently going on and with certain respiratory conditions I have, me and my parents decided that it would be safest for me not to play football in the fall this year. We made this decision a couple of weeks before the season started. And since our school offered the option to do all virtual, we also decided to do that.

Now, before school and football started, I thought I had made peace with this decision. But as school started and I saw most of my friends going back to in-person learning and seeing each other, I started feeling really lonely, and this only got worst when the football season started. It's hard for me to put into words how incredibly depressed I'm feeling about not being able to go out there with my friends and teammates to finish out my last year of football. I didn't realize how much I loved playing until I saw everyone else out there on the field. This year was it, it was the last chance I'll ever have to play in high-school.

I really regret choosing not to play and not to do in-person learning so much. I hate myself for not trying to convince my parents to let me play and go back to school. I feel stupid because the more I check out the news about covid-19 right now, the more people are saying it's looking safer and safer, so I feel like I threw away my entire senior season for absolutely nothing, and it's too late to try to get back on the team. On top of that, me and a couple of other kids that choose not to play kind of had a falling out with the rest of the team, so it feels like I pretty much lost all of my friends too and it'd be awkward around them.

All of these feelings have just made me incredibly depressed and bitter. I hate myself, I hate this year, I hate doing school, and I hate getting ready for college. I'm trying my best not to distance myself from my family or any social contact, but it's hard. I pretty much spend my day waking up at 7:30 to get ready to do online school, getting off at 3:00, spending 2-3 hours doing homework, and the going to bed. And that's literally I'll I've done for the past 5-6 months.

My mental health right now is horrible, and I'm incredibly angry and depressed; not at anyone in particularly, but just at myself and in general. I feel like I'm starting to become so lonely I'm going crazy. I have not motivation to do anything productive for myself or anyone at all. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to get out this season of life? As much as I'd like to reverse time and choose differently, but I made this fucking bed, and now I have to sleep with it for the rest of my life. Are there anyways I can start to make peace with my situation? I could really use some advice and encouragement.

Thanks.",03Sep2020,1
915,"im a comic artist and an illustrator by trade. i posted a comic about toxic friends kind of in response to something that happened recently. pretty nasty of me but i was drawing on multiple people who had made  me feel bad in the past and was try to create something helpful out of  my pain. ""friend"" posted a close friends story the next day with these  posts and i saw them when i woke up. ( the posts essentially said that narcissists get mad at you for getting mad at them and narcissists discard anyone that fails to support their view of themself as wonderful. ) i wanted to go back to get the addresses of the specific posts but  when i went back, she had taken down her story immediately after i had  seen it.

backstory (optional):

i  actually cut her off last year. we are in a group from high school but i  effectively told her that i didnt feel comfortable being friends with  her because i would feel tired after interacting and i was moving away  from home town anyway so I thought i could sever any loose ends i didnt  need. she was graceful about it and accepted it well. fast forward to  quarantine, im back home in my room. ""friend"" reaches out a bit on ig  and she's nice so we talk it out. She says she wants to be friends again  and that she would be willing to change to for me. I want to give her a  second chance so I accept. I think we dont get along because we both  like to talk a lot, especially about ourselves. but whereas she is the  kind of person where her stories are all about herself, I try to at  least ask people about themselves because I am very aware of my  narcissistic tendencies (ive question many times if im a narcissist).  she is the type to call people out and say whatever is on her mind but i  am much more reserved, therefore she believes I am dishonest. i think  this subtweet just hit particularly hard because i struggled with the  idea of narcissism as a child. here's an example of what she is like:  last week too, we went as a group to eat korean barbecue. i drove and it  was an hour away. i wasnt grilling the meat a lot because everyone else  was jumping to do it and i was kind of tired. in the middle of the  session, she asked me why i wasnt grilling the food and i just felt kind  of bad.

any  advice?? this is the kind of situation where im doubting myself a lot  and it just feels like im getting defensive because i dont want to see  that im the bad guy",03Sep2020,1

I do have my drivers license, I managed to do well enough the second time around to pass, but it was in a very low populated area and there were pretty much no cars on the road.

We recently moved, so the only person I know in my area is my dad, and my dad is absolutely not a patient instructor. He's one of those driving teachers where if you do something wrong, he yells and/or grabs the wheel; as someone who already has high anxiety with driving, having an instructor who little patience is detrimental and makes me absolutely not want to practice. Now that I have my license, if I want to go somewhere and he doesn't, he just tells me to go; no matter how many times I tell him I need to get more experience with him in the car (I'd rather have a driver who knows what they're doing in the car to catch me and hopefully prevent an accident, even if that other driver does also make me anxious.) 

The driving schools around me are *expensive* and they also tend to be geared toward people who don't have their license yet. I just need more practice with a patient driver. Like I said, I don't know anyone else in my area.

920,"A few days ago I saw an offer on Letgo about a man in a city in Maryland close to me offering 2 free Alienware laptops as a celebration of his daughter being cured of breast cancer. I contacted him and found out he was in North Carolina instead, offered the choice to pick up or ship to my place. I chose shipping and he obliged as long as I paid for it, no problem.

He asked me for $37 on Cash app for shipping, I never used Cash app till now so I downloaded it. I withdrew the money directly from my bank and sent it off to him. This is where the problem began, he kept saying it failed on his end and he sent another $37 request. I was skeptical and thinking okay maybe something happened and sent $37 again. At this time $37 was withdrawn from my account twice and was marked as pending.

Next day he sends me a picture of the package with shipping label, recipient being me and it reveals that he spent $150 on overnight shipping and he wants me to pay the difference. He received one of the $37 payments and sends me a request for $113 on Cash app. Note that he did this on his own and I never asked to pay for overnight shipping, I assumed he was just going to do the regular shipping.

I probably fucked up here but I withdrew $113 from my bank and sent it to him... he says the payment failed again and sends another request. I demand a screenshot from his app showing the payment failed and he does, indeed it shows it failed. I have no idea what to do at this point because Cash app shows it went through on my end and the money is taken out of my account.

I suggest using Paypal and he gives me his friend's Paypal email address, I send $113 to him on there. For some reason Paypal did a 24 hr hold on it so we wait. Next day I ask if it went thru, he says no and tries to get me to do Cash app again. I am not doing Cash app again because of the trouble it gave me. I end up calling Paypal support to see what was going on and while waiting, this man demands I record a video showing our text message convo and then showing my Paypal transaction to him. I am hesitant about this and told him I am contacting Paypal support.

The next day he is completely unavailable and makes me think I got scammed... so I go on Cashapp and try to refund everything I sent to him. The next day he responds and apologizes because he says his daughter is in the hospital. He is demanding again about the money and I told him that Paypal released the payment to his friend so talk to his friend. But his friend keeps claiming the payment is on hold. Then I say tell his friend to contact Paypal because on my end Paypal has already released the payment. Then he demands the video from me again.

So recently I discovered dog droppings in my yard, not just near the side walk but sometimes up near my front door. So I checked my doorbell cam and found out it was this neighbor. They would drag the dog into my yard and allow it to shit, at one point he even pissed on my tree in the front yard, this is the neighbor not the dog.

I confronted him and even showed him the video. His response was ""Who the fuck cares, get over it."" So I called the police, they gave him a trespassing warning and since then he has stopped going in my yard, but he lets his dog run over into my yard from his yard, and the dog does the business in my yard.

I showed the police this and they said they can't cite the dog for trespassing and that this was something I would have to deal with myself since sadly the only leash laws in my town don't apply to housing areas and only city areas.

So... how do I deal with this person. He refuses to clean it up, is doing it on purpose and well beyond me cleaning it up and throwing it back in his yard I can't figure out how to deal with it...

922,"Hello! I’m semi-new to reddit, and I wanted to share a problem that I just realized yesterday when I talked to my boyfriend. Any help will be great and I will try to provide as much info as I can while trying to stay somewhat private.

Now, I will admit that I absolutely hate confrontation and never want to start any fights with anyone, especially my mom. I always think that I should just submit and tell white lies to say what my mom wants to hear and never truly speak my personal opinion, so she wouldn’t be angry at me. I’ve seen her angry with my sister, and she can stay angry for weeks, even if things are minor. My mom is very passive aggressive too and will “jokingly” say things about stuff I need to work on about myself that she knows I’m sensitive about. I’ve talked about my severe depression and anxiety with her, but I’m never truly comfortable with saying everything. While I can tell she is trying to be understanding and listen to me, she basically says “stop trying to think about it,” and “get over it.”

I know she loves me with all her heart and soul, but I’m starting to think of how controlling she is over my life as well. She forced me to move back home from my university campus (my college is taking the proper precautions and rules with COVID, and I feel completely safe) after all my classes moved online to save money. When I told her I wanted to think about it, she said that I needed to come home now. I can’t go anywhere without her knowing, even if it’s for a simple drive. I can’t say no when she tells me not to go somewhere, even though I’m an adult. I want to tell her that I can make my own decisions and have my own opinions, but whenever I do, she always tries to twist the narrative to make me change my mind and side with her, making me feel guilty in the process. My mind basically tells me to not make her angry in anyway, otherwise she’s not going to happy with you, which is the worst possible outcome.

I don’t know what to do. My heart and mind are conflicted, and I just want to live in a place where I’m not walking on eggshells with my words and opinions. I’m looking at therapy and counseling options at the moment too to try and help me with this. Again, I will try and provide more info if need be.",03Sep2020,1

In the past months, my anxiety attacks have gotten worse and more frequent than ever, and for me they come in the form of disassociating, isolating myself, a lot of general distress and a feeling of being overloaded.
Even when I'm not in an attack thoughts worry me all the time and harm my normal functioning.
My then boyfriend tried to be as supportive as he could and he definitely was in distress when I had attacks and he tried to help his best, but he always insisted for me to tell him why I had an attack.
He was so sure that there was always a reason for my attacks, that he did something wrong, and when I told him that they come randomly most of the time he was so sure that I hid something from him. It stressed me out a lot and I had to make up stupid reasons to keep him content.
Eventually, he got too frustrating with the fact that ""I am hiding something from him"" and he broke up with me. If I dealt with the breakup part, I did.

So one of my friends has started sleeping with a girl who I know happens to be addicted to several drugs such as mdma, cocaine, and ketamine, and possibly opiate painkillers. She thinks because it is only “once or twice a week” that it isn’t a problem. Well she’s been taking these drugs for years and has never stopped. I’m sure she recently tried again to get him on these drugs and I don’t know if he gave in to the pressure or not

My friend is not that aware of the dangers of these drugs and has severe depression. Sometimes when he gets low he drinks until he passes out multiple nights a week, alone in his bedroom. He is not an alcoholic -YET- but if he continues he will become one. Put that together with this girl and she will ruin his life. I just know it. 

Yes people experiment but some people shouldn’t even try it in the first place. I’ve lost family members to addiction, and have never touched anything beyond weed because I refuse to end up like them. 

What can I do before she ruins his life?

Afterwards we became fwbs, and for ages it worked, we constantly reminded each other there were no feelings. Then quite literally overnight things seemed to change. I had gone to his which had become quite typical at this point and somehow we both fell asleep and I stayed the night at his and then I noticed a change. I suddenly couldn't find a single flaw in this boy, looks wise, personality... everything. The crazy thing was even though he never said it, I knew it was the exact same for him. Every second afterwards we spent together all came so naturally, our jaws in agony from laughing, late night walks to the beach, kisses goodbye on the cheek, him making me dinner even buying each other presents and our parents talking about us... we knew everything about each other. As people that suffer mental health we really bring out this carefree side of each other that no-one else does. One night when I was asleep he texted me saying I love you and I replied saying it back and I really did but nothing was ever mentioned since. (we both find it hard to talk about feelings).

930,"I [21] talked with her [21] last night and basically told her that this isn't working. She told me that she thinks we should just be friends and I said alright I agree. There are so many times where I wanted to say that but I ended up just not. It was really hard experiencing it rather than just thinking about it. I've broke up with women before but it's so much harder now even though I was already so emotionally checked out. In an unfortunate turn of events, I asked her out shortly before quarantine in my state and it made it really hard to talk with her. Due to the separation in quarantine, it really pulled us apart to the point where we wouldn't talk to each other for long periods of time. The stresses on the relationship made me forget why I liked her in the first place, but now that she's come back a few days ago I remember all of those reasons.

In an even more unfortunate turn of events, we now live in the same house with 5 other friends for the next year. As I was lying down last night and thinking about what just happened and why I was upset I realized that it was how much I was just looking forward to cuddling and watching movies with her, falling asleep next to each other etc. It wasn't really that I felt like I lost some connection necessarily, it's just the feeling of acknowledging that for the next year? year and a half? 2? I won't have the ability to start dating again, and I won't be able to have a relationship with anyone past friends for that time. Which means no cuddling and watching movies, physical closeness, etc for that time.

The question I want to ask her is if she wants to watch movies and cuddle every now and then since neither of us can see anyone else. Is that weird or creepy? 

I don't know if she can ever just be a friend that there's no tension with; ever since she's got back she's been so distant and I think it's just because things between us have been really shaky and undefined. I haven't spoken to her yet today but thinking about it makes me uncomfortable because I don't know what I could possibly say to her that could lead to us talking and being friends like we used to be.

I pay rent, cook, do a ton of chores, I pay for my own tuition, supplies, and hobbies. However recently it's become difficult to live with my mother. We argue but recently she has been less and less willing to treat me like an adult. She takes anything that could be considered a negative statement about her deeply personally.

934,"So I work in a very small retail store while I work on getting my degree. Besides the managers, there are only 6 employees. But they are hiring more people for the holiday season since we get really busy around Halloween, New Years, and Christmas and we have to change so much in the story in a small time span. I've been working here for a year now. Before the pandemic, I was getting paid $8.75/hr. But there was an error when I came back where I was making $10.50/hr. I made that for about three weeks until they brought me down to $9.50/hr and told me that they fixed it. 

I'm thinking that I shouldn't ask for a raise because I've asked for fewer hours since the number of new corona cases per day is still high in my area which makes me feel like I would be overstepping for asking for a raise while also asking for fewer hours. However, the reason I feel like I should ask for one is that the new seasonal workers are starting at $9.50/hr, same as I'm making now. Since I've been here a year and know what is needed for the holiday season I feel as though I should be getting paid a little bit more than the seasonal workers. What do you guys think?

935,"Ive cross-posted this to get as much advice as possible... 

I was laid off back in March due to the pandemic and have been looking for jobs ever since. Since I have asthma I’d been looking for an online, work-from-home position and primarily looking on Indeed. I found a sponsored post for a remote admin assistant that seemed good. I did look up the company and it exists, so I applied and didn’t think more of it. 

After applying I got asked via Indeed message from the company posting the job asking me to send my resume to an email that was something like “firstnamelastname133@outlook.com.” I thought that was a bit weird but some people have their own companies using outlook email addresses so I went ahead and sent my resume anyway. Lo and behold I get an email back saying that I was perfect for the position. 

When I read the email I thought it sounded a little too good to be true. $500 a week for 10-20 flexible hours of work, eligible for benefits, and of course work from home. I was excited and emailed back to accept but I didn’t sign anything. 

Two days pass and now Ive gotten another email where the “recruiter” stated the start date as well as some conditions for employment - these were to purchase a few things, including a computer, printer, VOiP phone etc. The recruiter asked me to send my name and address for a check to be made payable to in some ridiculous amount near $3000 USD in order to purchase these things as well as my first paycheck. Then next steps would be sent over as soon as the check “cleared” in their wording. The recruiter made some weird and unprofessional typos in the email, such as saying “sign paper works” and omitting necessary punctuation like whole periods after sentences.

I decided to google the recruiter and found a Linkedin page for a freelance recruiter with the same name, but the email in her profile was something like “Flastname@comcast.net” (as in first letter of first name). Didn’t seem to be affiliated with the company that I had applied to.

936,"Hi. This is a side account as I don't really want this on my Reddit history for my main.

I'm a 13-year old girl. I received a spam email. I *know* that it's almost impossible that it's real, but i'm still scared. I'll put the email at the end, but will explain and make some stuff clear:

I do watch porn pretty often, but I stick to safe sites. The only exception I can think of was when I made an account (using a side email, separate from my main one which I received the message on) on a dumb hentai site as i'd never watched anything before and was desperate. I realize that was really stupid now but this was about half a year ago. So.. someone, please give me some advice. I get panicked easily and my heart won't stop racing no matter how much I tell myself this is stupid. Everyone thinks i'm some innocent little girl and if this ever got out, it would ruin my life. I can't talk to anyone about this, not even my closest friends. Stripe12 is a password I used to use a lot, too, which spooked me. (I've moved on to more secure passwords, don't worry.)

Thank you for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

The email:

""I know stripe12 is one of your password on day of hack..

Lets get directly to the point.

Not one person has paid me to check about you.

You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?

in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).

When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.

immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.

after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.

Best solution would be to pay me $1051.

We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.

My -BTC -address: 1GySySb58TDsQVahT8SPRkUef3YcdokMvc

\[case SeNSiTiVe, copy &amp; paste it\]

You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.

You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).

if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.

I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.

if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.

Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.

If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.

it's a nonnegotiable offer and thus please don't waste mine time &amp; yours by replying to this message.""",03Sep2020,1

I have her again this year. I can’t change my schedule, I’ve already asked.I only have this class as honors, and can’t change it.  What do I do? I’m so stressed about this, and am so afraid.

They are fully aware of all my efforts and the fact that my ex-fiance left with no regards of taking proper responsibility especially after legal aid and the cops inform her not to leave the state till this is situated. Not even a week and she left here. (NY.)   


I did great the first 2 months. I stayed calm, hoped the best and know it'll work out as I'm doing everything I can and rightfully so. As time went to this 3rd month of not seeing my son.. Well, that strength chipped away at sonic speed. Depression and Anxiety hit. I know any parent or caring folks would understand completely but it prevents me from working. I do not have the luxury of not working - especially now. Yet here I am too distress to go into work for the 3rd week.   


It has helped stable me. I realize I have much more time to take care of the things I need to so I can get my son back and all. I'm willing to risk that peace of mind than financial aspects but of course that is only supported from the car I'm selling which will pay for bills till I can't.   


Financially  I need the help.   
Mentally I need the help.  
Physically I've been exercising to keep the depression/anxiety away. Slack here and there but more active than I've been in a long time.  


I feel so lost even though I'm doing everything accordingly. Except not going into work, my boss is understand but HR is being distant and not communicating with us accordingly so might lose my job there.  But my sanity depends on this small amount of peace at home, I feel on edge 90% of time.    
I've been holding too much in - and not because I want to. I'm really good at taking the right protocols to go against depression/anxiety.   


 The great amount of stress is not the financial aspect.  It's the fact that she did this out of pettiness and brought our son into it rather than responsibly doing the right thing.  And is slandering my character online and to people she randomly talks to. I only worry about the harm that may come from that by strangers taking action. I can only hope people aren't fooled so easily.   


It breaks my heart to think my son will not remember me..He just turned 2 and I wasn't able to see him for it. It took him so long to feel comfortable with just being with me alone - and once he did he wouldn't leave me alone! Knocking on the door, running into my chair soon as I get up, sitting on my lap and passing out just watching me play games/watch videos. Yelling ""Papa"" just to get my attention and then hand me everything in sight for whatever reason.  To think he'll see me as a stranger when he's back in my arms or feel uncomfortable.. The anxiety he may get or underlining damage that might be caused stops me in my tracks on a daily basis.    


How would I go upon getting help professionally (Mental care) without it financially burdening me as I have higher priorities with the low budget that I have?",03Sep2020,1

942,"This is long. I put a tldr at the bottom but encourage you to read it. Sorry if structure is not great, I’m on mobile. 

I’m only here because I could use some genuine advice. It may seem like a silly thing to be bothered by but it bothers me because I took a leap of faith and it has since greatly discouraged me. In reference to the purpose of the group I am incredibly passionate about the purpose and was all in 150% on it. 

I am normally a live and let live kinda guy but this one particular subject still really REALLY bothers me and it’s been over a year since we created this thing and now have thousands of members (closer to 10k than 0). I cant help but wanting to somehow come to peace or some sort of justice or something because if it weren’t for my efforts in the beginning there wouldn’t even be a group. 

The issue is when the group was created it was under the understanding that we were to be partners. I would be able to express and create in the way that I was going to anyways. Initially the “creator” didn’t even want to have anything to do with it in the beginning for private reasons discussed via conversations so I took the lead in actually getting things going. I’ve always been super passionate about this and this was me stepping out of my comfort zone and trying to see if I can make something from it. 

So I pounded the pavement on the weekends. I reached out to people. Sat there for hours with signs trying to get local people to come see what I was working on. Shared what we were planning to do. A local magazine got involved and did an article on us which I set up and arranged. I went to local businesses to identify my target market. I spoke with the businesses to collaborate some potential sponsoring of events and to create awareness. I connected with people in the industry. I had a great number of things in the works for the benefit of the members. 

I hosted the first event. It was an absolutely wonderful evening. We started in the early evening and went on until 2-3 am for some. I created the idea of coming up with various events that were around a particular theme. For example the first event was just a cook your favorite dish. We knew that we had something special. We picked up a third person to help lead so we could essentially have a voting system in place which I was ok with. 

Within the next few months there were times for personal reasons I couldn’t attend a couple events due to picking up an extra job to help handle some additional expenses and some personal stuff as well as surgery. I communicated well before hand what was going on. I still maintained communication and tried to help where I could. Traditionally too I’ve never been extremely active on social media, I often delete things more than I post anything. A traditional lurker if you will trying to break such a habit and be more social. I mention that because it came up my lack of social media. I’m a firm believer in delegating ba

I started noticing little things like any idea I proposed would get shot down. What I would say in group chat would seem to get mixed. We had a few conversations around expenses and operating costs. Keep in mind I was more than willing to contribute my share of expenses because I was super passionate and really wanted to make this work and willing to invest into it. I’d always say how much do I need to contribute? But would never get any straight answers. Told I didn’t need to pay anything and I’m like I want to because this is mine just as much it is yours and I want to pay my fair share. But it essentially became a 2 on 1 situation. 

All the while they took my idea and ran with it. Pre COVID our events were filling 20-30 spaces usually within minutes from announcing it. Now to be fair, I will give them credit for a lot of the hard work they did. They didn’t just sit idly by by any means. And I genuinely admire and appreciate all the effort they have put into it as well. They put a lot more time in social media. So please don’t think that I take full credit for its success. 

What bothers me now is that the group would not have started without me. I clearly shared many ideas and what I was wanting to accomplish with the “creator” in the beginning so that they could back out if it wasn’t what they wanted to do. Everything was good to go as they were excited to see what I could do with it. I wanted to work with someone local on this as I was new to the area and I know connections are important. 

Nowadays I keep involved for personal reasons but they take full credit for everything and won’t even acknowledge me when the group gets any type of media exposure. Part of me wants to straight call them out and share conversations that were had that supports my claims which I have plenty of. Part of me wants to just move on.

I’ve talked to friends and family and have gotten some advice but nothing more than what I’ve already thought about. I’m posting here because I have never had anything bother me for this long. I’ve never had someone steal my ideas and run with it and then just throw me to the side like I don’t even matter. So tell me what you think I should do. 

TLDR- helped create a social networking group. Other person “created” the group and with someone else pushed me out and ran with my ideas. Group exploded in popularity with coming up to 10k members. I’m no longer recognized as anything other than a founding member and they have greatly benefited from this.

It was Terrible. I’ve since waiting out the side effects and am doing better. Still a little anxious but not as bad. But during the times it was the worst, I quit a good job because they wouldn’t allow more time off for my mental illness and to adjust to new meds. So I quit.

948,"Please stay with me. It's a long story: 

A few years ago, I started regularly going to a diner near my apartment before and after work. After I got a new job, I started going there only on Saturday mornings. It turned into an episode of Cheers: everybody knew my name. I met some great people and employees there, and we just about ran into each other and enjoyed breakfast at the coffee bar every time.

This is how I met Grey. Grey was in his early to mid-50s, and I was probably about 25. We bonded over movies, and I thought I'd never see him again. I ran into him the next Saturday and the next, and suddenly we made it a point to arrive at the same time so we could spend the next two hours just talking and having a good time. There was never anything romantic or weird about it. I'm the type of person who has friends who just graduated HS to friends in their 70s. 

I cherished being able to discuss my favorite passion, movies, with Grey. He seemed happy to have a friend. One day, something happened: a little girl sat next to him, and he asked the mother to switch seats with her. The mother said it was fine, he insisted (politely) they switch, they did, and that was that. But it struck me as odd, and I decided to look him up. His name is in my state's list of sex offenders.

I spoke to our mutual friend, our usual waitress, and she told me to ask him. If I did, he'd be open and tell me what happened. If she was okay with him, then it couldn't have been anything more than him pissing outside, right? Or maybe he was 18, and he had a 17-year-old GF or something, right? I didn't know how to broach the subject, so I never did.

Well, last night, his face (amongst others) was circulating on FB with his full name and address, stating he was an offender. As a friend, I let him know and suggested we finally talk.

Grey said twenty years ago, he molested a friend's ten-year-old daughter. It happened a handful of times and ended when he kissed her, she told, and he was arrested. He's in therapy; he has regular meetings with a PO; he has to take polygraphs, and so on.

My initial reaction was to cut him from my life, but he's genuinely someone I consider a good man and friend. I feel like shit for even thinking about remaining friends with him, but would I be a bad person if I did?

January of 2020, I got a new, high position at my company but at a different location, about 20 min's farther.  I took the position, I met this absolutely stunning, most beautiful girl ive ever seen in my LIFE. Shes 7 years older than me which kinda blows. With my new position (which was in the same department as hers) i felt like a straight BALLER. I was on a fat salary at the age of 21 (at the time), working full time, going to school full time. Probably the biggest flex of my life. Ive tried to get to know this girl, But most of the time i just sound stupid because she makes me extremely nervous around her even tho im a pretty smooth talker in general. We went out drinking with some of our co workers, she had someone with her who i assumed was her girlfriend? (Come to find out shes not). But that night, I could feel her eyes burning into my head. Just the way she looks at me makes me want to literally die dude. I ended up staying sober half way thru the night so I could be a good person and drive everyone home to make sure they all got home safely. She was the last to leave my car and grabbed my arm to tug on it so I could turn around and she can thank me. She also texted me 10 min after i had left thanking me again and to text her when i got home safe. After that night idk i just feel like im in love with this girl who i know nothing about. There are other situations where we've gone out and shes been giving me ""those eyes"" or at work she'll be extra playful. There was another time she saw me in public at a nature trail where I was hammocking and texted me saying she saw me! I asked her why didnt she come join me and she said because she didnt know if it was for sure me or not, I then told her im here all the time and to let me know if she wants to hangout! She said ""next time"" so i kinda feel like she curved me in a way haha. Every time at work when I can tell she's stressed out, I try to take the load off her so make sure shes not over worked. Im not sure if thats a sweet gesture or not, or that im trying too hard... Some of our co workers has grown up with her in school and said shes never brought a guy around and never dated any guy? 

My question is... How can I find out her sexuality? I feel like its rude to ask someone that and can make them uncomfortable which is the last thing i want to do. Lets say she is Bi... How can I ask this girl on a date? Maybe just coffee or a drink??! I dont want to cross boundaries as we are co workers...

I have never done this before and I felt uncomfortable but I wanted to step up, as I never really put myself out there at work. The site was on a large college campus and I was basically scooping poop water into vials, again not even relatively in my job description. We were just told to wear masks and gloves and use hand sanitizer. 

Fast forward to this week where I see on the news that they have tested for Covid in the sewers at this same campus the day after I was there. 4 or them tested positive.... I was never made aware by my employer that this is what I was possibly testing for! I feel really used when I was made to do this job without knowing the hazards. I’m blaming myself thinking that I should have said no in the first place but I trusted that the company would look out for us to some extent. People who work in the office have the option to be safe and work from home and they are making me sample COVID shit water without proper PPE. I’m not sure what to do or what my options really are here. I’m tempted to hand in my two weeks over this just because I feel so blatantly disrespected.",03Sep2020,1

We’d been sort of romantically involved for a couple of months, nothing too serious due to commitments but we both had feelings for each other. I took a break from everything (social media, texting) for a week about a month ago and when I got back to everything I found she’d got feelings for someone else and wanted to be with them despite other factors. Possibly unreasonably, I was quite upset as I felt a part of our connection was lost. We still talked over message frequently but whenever I see her in person I almost feel sort of anxious to be around her. Recently though we’ve been talking less and but I still struggle speaking to her. She initiates pretty much all conversation, something I feel kinda guilty about. However even though I still do have feelings for her I also still feel kinda upset/ annoyed with her about everything and don’t feel as motivated to speak to her anymore.

969,"Good morning!
I want to start by saying this is a pretty sensitive and emotional situation for me, so any kind advice/direction would be great

I am in college (3 1/2 hours from my moms house) we have two dogs, one who has bonded with me the past 9 years (I’m his favorite). He is a yorkie and was acting very bad the past few years (non stop marking in the house) so we had to start kenneling him. When I moved to college, I started to just feel awful for him. I mean, he was kenneled while my mom was at work and let outside in the yard to run around mornings and evenings. I don’t think he was unhappy/depressed (he ate/drank normally, slept, and ran around the yard) but I felt bad that he was kenneled so much. I decided to pay my apartment fees and deposits to bring him to live with me. He’s been here a week now, and I think we are both having adjustment problems. I am pretty active, work 8 hours Monday-Friday, have a social life and a boyfriend who lives in a different complex, so I’m always in and out. There are many times where I am home alone at the apartment and have plenty of time for him, but sometimes it’s been overwhelming. If I sit down to do something he may whimper and cry that he wants something (usually to go outside, even if we went out 10 mins earlier). There are moments he cuddles up and acts so good that I cannot even imagine bringing him back to my moms, but then part of me is having a really hard time adjusting. I love the little guy with my whole heart, but I don’t know if I was ready for the responsibility/loss of freedom that came with it. On top of it, I can’t tell if he’s super happy here, going from a house to an apartment, and a full backyard to just leash walks. My boyfriend feels like all we’ve been talking about is the dog, so a little bit of strain in the relationship at the moment. 

I graduate next June and will be moving back home in August so, I’m trying to tell myself he will be okay without me for a year if I take him back. My bf even has been saying if I take him back, to him it’s not a big deal and was just a week vacation from his usual routine/schedule. But for some reason I get so much guilt even thinking about taking him back. 

Would love anyone’s feed back.",03Sep2020,1

972,"  From the statement of my title, you could guest why I'm asking for advice. 
  I'm a sophomore in College, and so is my roommate. We've been friends for almost two years now, and we've lived together as roommates since freshman year.
  I do like my roommate. However, recently I've been seeing her drink soda all the time. Almost every hour, she's drinking soda. Last year she would do the same, but I haven't really taken notice. She drinks so much Mountain Dew, Coke, and Pepsi that there is a pile of bottles in the recycling bag. She goes through two or three cases within two weeks, and always buys more, despite saying she doesn't have a lot of money. 
  I'm mainly concerned because recently she's been drinking soda instead of water. She complains of headaches and is always tired, and I'm kinda torn inside. I want to tell her that drinking so much is bad for her health, but she doesn't like confrontation. I sometimes wake up at two or three AM to hear her draining another can of soda. I tried to mention that maybe if she drank water, she wouldn't feel thirsty, but she says that water is horrible and not the same as soda. I'm scared for her. I really think she's addicted to caffine/soda. 
  Should I say something or tell someone, like my RA, about my concerns? Should I tell her directly and hope that she'll listen to me? 
  Thanks for listening to me. I really would appreciate any advice that I can get.",03Sep2020,1
973,"This morning while waiting in line at a bank, I decided to get some water from a convenience store outside. As I was walking past by this construction site, I distinctly overheard two workers saying something indirectly towards me (I'm 6'0 about 240 so pretty hefty guy, by the way this is somewhere in southeast asia where average height is 5'5  so I really stand out) the insult roughly translates to large or large beast, I immediately looked back and saw one of them still laughing abit looking at my general direction but as soon as they noticed that I was staring at them , the facial expressions suddenly turned straight. I stood there for a bit incredibly pissed but realized my bank appointment was more important than these two losers and decided to confront them after. 

As I was going home I yelled a loud ""fuck you"" as I drove past them. I had to pick up my girlfriend first and take her home then I told myself to come back and confront them. 

When I got back at the construction site I had a clenched fist ready  for a fight, I asked the two of them what their problem was etc. But he kept saying that it wasn't me they were talking about etc etc. I told him I'm no idiot I know what I heard and they were looking at me when he said it. As I was berating him in front of his coworkers I could see he him fold already and he eventually raised his hand as a high five and apologized, the other guy apologized as well. I knew he was disarming me seeing how incredibly pissed I was. I eventually took his apology and left.

991,"Happy first ever reddit post to me! 

I'm 28 and I have been borderline depressed about my life, crying the last few days all the time (**first-world problems alert, apologies in advance!)**. I don't live in my home country, I moved for education when I was 19 and now I am in one of the best biggest best cities in the world (so they say). I'm doing a PhD in a lab which later I realised I hate, but I am pushing through another 1-2 years so I haven't wasted my time. The PhD journey has been bumpy,lots of unforeseen things happened that set me back. Also a couple of years ago I realised I love coding, so I am developing this skill when not doing the PhD. I would love to get a job in software development, but I worry I am ending up with some weird half-ass skillset that willl make me highly unemployable and after nearly 10 years in education, I'll be waiting tables somewhere. I am working on getting some direction with the skills development, but there isn't much time left from all the lab work (that I hate).. This whole PhD thing sets you back in life so much, financially especially, while friends who went straight into work are buying houses already.

I worry my parents are getting old (early 60s), and I am far away from them. My country is not in the best state so there is probably nothing for me to go back there, but I am so sad I am missing on time with my parents. These kind of things you don't worry about when you are younger. So I feel immense pressure being torn between my work and flying home when I can. 

Finally, I always imagined by this age I would be at the very least engaged. I'm a family-oriented person, I want to one day settle down, have the whole family picture with the house and kids and all that. Instead, I am as single as ever, and pretty much have been since I moved to this ""amazing"" city 3 years ago, apart from one on again off again relationship that didn't work in the end. It looks like here it is full of self-absorbed workaholics looking for hook-ups, it's a transient city, people come for career or to have fun, but not for a relationship. It looks like you have to drop your standards, morals and expectations to a bear minimum to 'trick' someone into seeing you (not really dating). Still many of my friends found suitable partners, good for them, but it gets pretty lonely now since they are always busy. I also have a few friends who are moving in together with their partners at this time, and honestly I am feeling bitter and jealous about it. I know it is bad to feel like that, I swear I am not an evil person, I just can't help it, I even stopped contact with one of them.. I'm a pretty sociable person, I have a wide social cricle, a few hobies I do when I have the time, but now due to covid obviously most things are closed, so it is hard to meet people. So I finally joined some dating apps (before I was resisting), and it is pretty horrible so far, it is so exhausting. I worry my clock is ticking, that after the PhD I'll move somewhere else, at 30, alone, and have to start all over again.. I know my parents would love to have grandkids and I feel like I am disapponting them with my stream of failed relationships/dates. Often I catch myself looking at social media photos of people I know who already have the whole family picture (partner, house, kids), and feeling kind of sad. 

The relationship part probably weights the most on me, because I feel it is the most out of my control. The rest is just making time and putting in the work. I didn't realise what sacrifices you make when you make a life choice, how a great opportunity can turn also into a big limitation. 

If anyone has felt similar at some stage of their life, any advice on how to handle this will be appreciated. I know it sounds dumb because there are people with real problems out there, and here I am crying because at 28 my life isn't where I want it to be. But I can't help it, it's weighing on me so much over the last year but especially now for some reason.",03Sep2020,1

Bit of backstory:  I grow up in Ohio in a poor family where we were lucky to have enough to pay for the water bill.  And my siblings never to college and my single mother injured herself working 3 jobs to support six kids.  As the youngest and *""Gifted""* kids they all expected me to be the one to make it.

I’m a freshman in college, and I stayed local. Very local. 10 minutes from my house kind of local. Naturally, I’m commuting, and thanks to covid I’m not on campus for more than like 2 or 3 hours on any given day. I’m paying $12k this year to go here, and that’ll stay that way if I maintain a good GPA so all my scholarships renew. I’m in a program that’ll let me skip my last year of undergrad and I’ll get to go right to law school a couple hours away. This all sounds great but I actually hate it. Here’s why:
-i (already an introverted person) am having an incredibly difficult time making friends. This is a huge reason why and is the root of many other issues
-I’m commuting, so that doesn’t help my case for the above, and it also means I spend all my free time with my family. At college. My day normally consist of waking up, attending a couple classes either at school or online, depressedly doing homework until 4, stop doing homework in defiance of having been doing it all day, go to work at 5, get home at anywhere from 9:30-10, repeat.

My girlfriend of 3 years is going to a huge school in a big city over 5 hours away, so I’m officially in an LDR. She’s making tons of friends and is loving it there, and it feels like she’s really all I have left right now. Will make another post about her shortly.

So, bottom line is that I feel like I have no friends because I’m never on campus. Even if I were, it seems pretty hard to make friends during the day, when people are out doing things. Living on campus would be a ridiculous waste of money, but living on a campus sounds like the fix to me. Which is why....


This school that I’m attending wasn’t my first choice. I went here because it’s incredibly economic. My first choice was actually Toronto. I don’t know why, but I’ve always loved the city and the school, and I’m pretty sure I would be able to get there because I’m a dual citizen (US/Canada). I have a place to stay for 2 weeks a couple hours away from the city for quarantine. I would be giving up my program and all the economic benefits of the school I’m currently at, but I feel that I would be much happier living on my own on school grounds in a big city. I’ve also been considering enlistment to pay for it, but I’m not sold on that one way or another. My current plan is to give this school a year, maybe my relationship will stay intact while I make friends here. Maybe I’ll want to go even more. I don’t know.

1000,"This is a relatively new revelation of mine and therefore I'm trying to maintain the hope that I'm mistaken.

As I write this he is sitting across the room from me, both hands cupped around his phone in an obvious attempt to hide its contents. I used to think that the childish grin he pulls was a thing of innocence. Of softness and care. I see now that its source is somewhere else. A place of malice and deceit. I don't know. 

His efforts at secrecy have not been flawless however. Just minutes ago I was in the kitchen pouring myself a drink and upon re-entering, I caught a glimpse of his screen. I know exactly what site he was on. Not that I use it myself obviously. I know of it through past friends and the like, people who don't value decency and respect I suppose. The sight of it made me sick. Even now I am shaking, my mind gripping the hypothetical driftwood of this ungodly storm. How could he do this to us? To a family that loves and cherishes his company. A unit that is bound in blood and tears. 

My mother will no doubt be distraught, as any moral person would be. She dedicated so much to him. Loved him dearly. Loves. And knowing how soft her heart is, it would not surprise me if she forgave him. She is a beacon of light, my mother. Our gift from God himself. I would hate to see her hurt. The wings of an angel stained with the inky sin of man. No, I will not allow him to do this.

The other piece of evidence that supports my claim is the letters. Seven of them. All of them so perfect, so conveniently placed. As if he knew what they said before even turning them over. And then the way he reads them, his cunning smile pinned proudly across his cheeks. He knows exactly what his actions mean but not what damage they cause. How could a person be so full of spite?

So what do I do? Do I speak to him, call him out on his wrongdoings? Do I talk instead to my mother? Or do I do neither? This game cannot continue, I have no doubt of that. Its end is near.

My mother just spelt out what seems to be her penultimate word.

LOYALTY. How appropriate. Nine points, but the Y sits on a triple. That makes twenty-one.

I didn’t mind that B started drinking and smoking. Heck, I love that stuff too. We got wasted a couple of times together but I don’t think that was necessarily bonding. Then B made a new friend. B’s friend didn’t seem to like me very much. Idk B seemed to keep all their old friends except for me. Then, B got boyfriends. I admit sometimes it felt like B was babysitting me. But B never told me B’s problems. B always fixed my problems but never let me fix B’s. We never dated but once we stopped being friends it felt like a breakup afterwards. I hope this doesn’t sound like I romanticized our friendship too much. I just secretly miss them so much. I just don’t know how to tell them. I keep seeing B in the hallways or in class and B looks miserable. Damn I sound sorta desperate to revive this friendship. I never had a BF. I never thought I was dependent until I started reflecting on things. I know within these 2 years we changed a lot. I wished deep down that we would change together but we never did. Separate. Maybe I’m making our friendship seem deeper than it is. Maybe B never looked at it that way. I guess you really don’t realize what you have until you lost them. I wish you guys could see what we had. Why do I always feel the need to catch up with B? How do I become less dependent on people? Is it worth salvaging this friendship? Am I imagining them being miserable? Sometimes I wonder if in her eyes I was problematic?",03Sep2020,1

1005,"A while ago My friend Earl had asked everybody on his relationship situation here and they had told him to get rid of this girl and never speak to her again. Him of course like an idiot didnt listen to any of his family friends or even random strangers from Reddit. 

He ended up getting back with her and they had a few fun nights. It ended with a fight and after Earl was being attacked for an hour by her He finally ended up back handing her which bruised her eye. 

At first she refused to cooperate with police but now ontop of co-operating she started lying to them about situations that happened between them to make it look like He was abusive towards her. When she was the one who would always get physical where as He would just restrain her. 

Now My friend Earl is here asking for a different type of help. 
Hes due to stand trail and aswell as being scared of her. Hes scared He will get found guilty of these lies she has told about him being a domestic abuser. Yes He hit her in this last situation and he feels so bad even now about it. But He feels he has been over charged and feel like everyone’s out to get him. The prosecution and her family. 

But my friend Earl was also involved in an illicit business. Which his ex girlfriend actually didn’t speak about or tell on him for. Therefore Earl feels like he can’t tell the full story in case she ends up telling the police the full story of what he used to do for money. Therefore having him by the balls. 

He haven’t got enough money to pay for a good lawyer so He is stuck trying to use a government appointed free lawyer. 

Tldr: what should or can He do when his ex prostitute girlfriend has lied to the police in order to get him in trouble; But hasn’t told them about his business he used to do.",03Sep2020,1
1006,"I'm really confused about my bra size. I got measured at lasenza a while ago, and I was a 36D. I've lost a fair bit of weight since then and my bras are a little on the big side as I've lost some size in my breasts. I can tell they're a little smaller, but not terribly smaller and my old bras still fit, my breasts just don't fill the cups perfectly anymore. 

With covid going on, I don't want to go in to get remeasured even if they are open which I'm not sure they are, so I tried using the bra size chart on the website. When I put in my old measurements, it says 36D, when I put in my new measurements it says like 38A. Which really confused me because not that small boobs are a problem, but my boobs aren't so small as to only be an A cup.

I took my measurements just like how the video explains to do it, and like I said my old measurements matched up with my old bra size. I'm just really confused but I'd like to figure out what bra size I am so I can buy some new bras online. Does anyone have some advice to help me figure it out?",03Sep2020,1
1007,"I’ve had this work-from-home desk job for about 3 months now. About a month ago, my supervisor assigned me a new task in a brand new position.

(I’ve retyped this paragraph about four times because I’m having a hard time keeping it confidential) Let’s say you apply for food stamps. A month or so goes by, and you get an email saying you were denied for the food stamps because you did not qualify for them.

That’s what this “brand new” position was. For eight hours a day I send emails to people who requested “food stamps” and tell them they’ve been denied. Other than making me feel like shit for being the one to tell them no, the work is unrewarding and completely mind-numbing.

I decided to ask my supervisor if I could write a script that would send the emails automatically. He said something like, “I don’t really know, but I can ask upper management.” I have not heard anything about it since.

Despite never getting an answer, I made one anyway and have been working on improving it everyday. It is ~95% accurate in everything it does, and it constantly has my full attention in case it slips up.

I guess what I’m wondering is, in general, is what I’m doing okay? I constantly feel guilty while I watch it do my work, but at the same time the work is mindless. It’s just copying and pasting a canned response along with repetitive paperwork.

I’ve never had an office job before this so I’m still learning what’s acceptable and what’s not. Any responses are appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read.

My fiancee has depression, anxiety, she's also a highly sensitive person and has ptsd. I had been bugging her for months to get a job since we are starting a life together. Especially for the summer since she wasn't going to be in school. It took her forever but she finally got one (I was very proud) at a mental health for youth facility. When she first talked to me about it I told her that she should be careful with a job like that because it's going to affect her mental health she told me it wouldn't.
So a couple days in to her training she said she didn't like the way they were instructed to do certain things. So I told her I know it sucks but you have to deal with it. Plus trading was only a week long. So the second to last day of traing a grip jumped from the second floor balcony on to the ground level head first. While she was working there and she lost it. She was traumatized. She calls me trying to talk about it but I wasn't able because I was in car full of people heading home from work. I get home we talk about it and go to bed. The next day she said she didn't want to go to work ( understandable). She said she was going to call out. I told her I'd stay home with her too if she wanted to which she said no. So I get home everything seemed fine. I asked if she called out she said no. She told me she just didn't go. I was extremely frustrated but I didn't say anything due to the fact of the incident that happened the day before. So I waited 2 days and broad up the fact that she 1. Hasn't been to work in three days 2. She was a no call no show for those days 3. We just got an apt together and need money to pay bills and buy things.she gets angry at me telling me I don't care about how she feels, I have no empathy a lot of other things.( Yes sometimes I don't feel empathy towards something's because of the way I was raised not to have any emotions towards things.... I know it isn't right but I am trying to change ). But for this situation I was there for her. So we get in to an argument and I told her that everything in our apartment was mine and I was the reason we go it ( because I was the only one looking) she gets angry and hits me ( not the first time but since I am way bigger then her I just take it ). We get in to a huge fight I tell her to get out things got thrown at me and stuff. So it's been like 3 weeks Im still not over that and im starto to not want to be in this relationship anymore. I'm trying but idk what to do.  I love her but idk also she doesn't try to get help. I know it's hard for people with mental health problems to get help. But at least try right ? Idk I'm just hurt.

1021,"I (23m) recently hooked up with a girl (23f) during a party at my house. My family’s fairly wealthy so it’s a nice house and part of me wonders if that’s why she’s doing this. I had just met this girl that night and she and I had a good conversation for 10 minutes or so. One thing led to another and we went to my room and hooked up. It was pretty standard sex and wasn’t anything too crazy but she apparently finished a few times so she seemed to be enjoying it a lot. We talked for a bit after, she asked if I hook up with a lot of people, which I thought was weird, and I said not really so I asked her too and she said not really as well. We both went back to the party and she stayed another couple hours then left. We didn’t talk too much afterwards while she was still at my house. The next day her friend calls me, who I’m also good friends with, and she tells me that the girl I hooked up with says I raped her and that she got a rape kit and “has an ongoing case”. I’m completely at a loss for words and literally have no idea what to do. I want to text her and ask what In the world is going on but I’ve been told not to text her as it can be used against me... which makes me even more worried that this is a reality. Is it just her word against mine? I’m sure a rape kit would show that we did hook up, although I didn’t actually finish If that means anything.

But ever since this thing started, I realised how truly lonely my mother is and want to beat myself up for not realising sooner. Me, my brother and even my father all have friends and just people we're really close to, except for my mother. I've realised that the only people she spends time with is us her family.

 Shes had ""friends"" but always complained to me about how shes the only one who ever reaches out to them, noone ever talks to her first. And the only other people she talked to are my fathers friends, neighbours and parents from school,  they're all just acquaintances. Plus, the only close friend she had was really toxic and just terrible to my mother. Im the one closest to her but I'll be leaving home soon.

I want to help her find friends, GOOD friends who actually reach out to her first and that she can spend a lot of time with, but I dont know where to look. Internet friends are fine but I want to find people she can physically spend time with since she doesnt like staying at home all the time.

1. Find new job (I have one now which pays extremely well, but I don’t like it and want to find another one)
2. Rent out house (I own a condo, id like to rent it out for some passive income)
3. Live in high rise apartment complex in center city (I feel like I would be much happier in this location)

5. Fix posture
6. Improve my style (in terms of clothing)
7. Stop smoking 
8. Get real estate license
9. Stretch
10. Improve nightly skin care routine

1035,"Overwhelmed. Depressed. Lost. Need a reality check?

New to this page, and new to posting on Reddit in general. I’m just laying at rock bottom and feel so helpless on where or even who to turn to. 

So, to start I’m 24 (F), in a relationship with 25 (M), and we have 2 toddlers (2 and 4). We’ve been dating since right out of high school, I was 18, he was 19, and we got pregnant 6 months into the relationship. Now before getting pregnant we had decided to get clean from out drugs of choice, and we were successful, still sober going on 5 years later. 

Things were all fine, he was supportive about the pregnancy, but never showed any effort to help me with all the new things that come with being a parent (good job, items for the baby, doctors appointments). Now, we both do suffer from mental illnesses. He’s diagnosed bipolar, I’m diagnosed BPD, PTSD, and anxiety issues, so I chalked a lot up to that. 

We didn’t cope well after the birth of our first son, the relationship started to shamble on both ends, but we held on so tight to each other because we had nobody else after getting clean, we refused to be around the same people, with our son giving us even more reason than before. We managed by, got out first apartment, I turned 21, then BOOM baby number 2, come on through. April 2018 we become parents to our second son. Things get more stressful, but we’re managing. 

So we’re in 2018, he still isn’t working, doesn’t clean, just wants money and to see his not so great friends that I don’t like around our kids. 

I find out that a close female friend of his has been exchanging pictures with him. Somebody that I had housed, fed, helped before helping myself, and gave up my children’s first room to rent it out to her and her boyfriend. I felt absolutely betrayed. I still do if I’m being honest. He was mostly mad at me for finding out, I never got an apology. Now, where this seems to make me the most upset is the fact that we already argue about the amount of porn he looks at. Like, I get guys watch porn, but EVERY time you’re alone? I felt so inadequate for him. This person I poured more love into that I did myself doesn’t even seem to love me, at least that’s how my brain played it. As somebody with PTSD stemming from sexual, mental, and physical abuse as a child intake small things like that in relationship close to heart, and something just snapped in my head. I felt like shit about how I looked. Really bad, that’s when the suicidal thoughts started getting bad. We start arguing more, he’s never hit me, but the arguments start to get physical (grabbing me, keeping me from leaving, also name callings and insults start way more often and have become a daily thing in 2020) 

A whole ass year and a half goes by, we’re robbed 3 times at our first apartment, move into a nicer place, he’s working, things are good. Then of course, BOOM “you’re fired on some bullshit”, my job that paid 95% of all our living costs is gone. I feel like shit about who I am now. I just broke. I started messaging other men online, sending them pictures of myself. Just to feel good about myself honestly. He finds out a month into me being a total jerk honestly. I had messaged dozens of men at this point. We separated. He relapses on his DOC, then tried to kill himself. I’m so numb and emotionally empty at this point, I just don’t care. Move in with my mom, get a job, figure MY shit out...while I’m still talking to guys. 

I come to my senses in February and just stop it all together. Get off social media, and ghost the world really. It’s not worth the pain I’ve caused my partner and my family, no excuses what I did was wrong. 

Fast forward to September 2020 (now). I’m taking care of the kids 5-7 days a week by myself. Working. Stressed to the fucking max lately. I love him so much, but he can’t be bothered for anything. If it’s not something he wants to do or he’s not gaining something from a situation he won’t do it. Take the kids to school, to the park, but them clothes, etc. He’s always saying he’s stuck where he’s at in life because nobody ever helped him learn, but I’m in the same boat with that. I get up and FIGURE OUT how to make the things I want happen. He won’t. He just refuses to. He’s mean to me every day, and I just try to take it because I know I was unfaithful, but he was unfaithful at one point too. 

My family says to leave. That I deserve better, that my kids deserve better, but I have some kind of mental block on everything. I’m so emotionally overwhelmed I’ve been going through the motions for months now, living apart from my partner for 5 years, back with my mom. I’m 24 and I feel like I’m worse off than when I was 18, but I have 2 kids now. I feel like I have nobody to talk to for emotional support, when I try to see my friends I either cancel or my S/O makes a big deal about it and I can’t go, I’ve seen my friends 3 times this YEAR. He works with his best friend and sees his other good friend 3-4 times a week. 

I’m tired of being told I’m terrible things just to hurt me. I’m just so scared to cut ties and leave. My heart and my head are working against each other so bad lately. 

I just need some advice. If you manage to find yourself reading this and have anything for me, please help. I’ve ready racked up 15k in medical debt trying to fix my head. I have a lot of trauma from when I was a kid and I think that it ties into a lot of the issues I have in the relationship. I’ve never dealt with my childhood and I’m angry under the surface about it all the time. 

Please, advice, kind words, anything. If nothing else at least I was able to jumble all these random thoughts into a decent rant about the situation. Feel free to ask me questions if it’ll help you with advice, I’m a little ADHD and all over the place.",03Sep2020,1

Uh, hello there.

I don't usually post in this subreddit – I merely read through the posts and see what some possible solutions are/ what I can learn from them – but I figured that asking for some advice would be pretty helpful right about now.

So. My parents have recently decided to get divorced. I had seen the signs, I knew this could happen for a long while. I had even considered if I should bring up divorce as an option since neither seemed willing to go to some sort of family therapy. I didn't do it of course, as much as I like to think of myself as considerate, I was selfish enough to want them to stay together. I could see my mother's behaviour towards my dad hurting him, but she needed him and he loved her.

To make a long story short, it's been a week and I am feeling very conflicted. They can't have a divorce yet because of legal reasons and laws, but it's already so.. Weird. 

My mom is kicking my dad out of the apartment we live in, and he asked both me and my brother if we want to go live with him. I was almost completely sure I wanted to go live with my dad after a week of contemplation, but I talked with my mom about their reasons (since I wanted her POV aswell) and now I don't know what to do.

My dad has told me and my brother than my mom had cheated on him before, and that she was actually currently talking to another man already. He said he had caught her repeatedly and the last time sparked an argument which led to this. I.. I had my suspicions if I'm honest. Not to that extent, but she is of course very secretive and protective of her devices.

My mom has started trying to get us (me &amp; brother) on her side. Already much more attentive than she has been for a long while. She makes us breakfast, asks about schoolwork, asks if we have enough pocket money, and she has actually started to cook. Which kinda led to the realisation (or I guess the sudden slap in the face) that she usually made things she would like to eat herself, or made things in a way she herself prefers her food without thinking if we'd like it that way. And that she doesn't care if my dad gets to eat any of the food.

I can tell that my mom is keeping things from me and my brother, but her parents' dicorce was horrible, and ended with her pretty much raising her siblings despite her parents being present. I am assuming her silence is because of her pride, need for privacy/secrecy, and her worry about making the same mistakes her parents did.

On the other hand, I can tell my father is being mostly truthful, but some of what he says is either exaggerated, false, or just fueled by spite and anger.

I know that my father will probably take better care of us, but my mom is more financially stable. 

My dad is going to do anything he can for us to live comfortably, while my mom is obsessed with going back to our homeland as soon as possible (often times disregarding the fact that me and my brother are still in school, and how long it took us to integrate ourselves to this new system and language).

Both of them love us dearly, that is no question. But I don't trust either to raise my brother by themselves. My brother is only now starting to go through puberty, and he is gay. My father is more accepting and willing to talk witj and listen to him, but they both have a quick fuse and are quick to start yelling. My mom blames my dad for the way my brother is and is disapproving of how much he 'appears gay' and his liking towards wearing fake nails. She insists its all in his head and that hell grow out of it, but also kinda stands up for him when my dad seems to be a tad homophobic.

My mom has also made it quite apparent over these last years that my dad only seems to have value when he's bringing home money and buying her things so she doesn't have to use her own money, since her demeanour was always harsher from the moment he lost his job until he found another one. 

My mom has an obvious favoritism towards me as her first child. My brother was not 'planned' per say, but she kept him because my father insisted. She might not see it, but she has an obvious weakspot for me.

I deeply care for both of them, and I don't want to hurt them by choosing to stay with the other. What I know is that I need to stay by my brother. Otherwise they will leave him with more trauma than already gained.

As if this wasn't enough, school has started again and I have to deal with two more large problems: my self-sabotaging behaviour when it comes to homework, and my crush on my already taken best friend.

This whole ordeal has left me with a jumble of emotions, a lot of overthinking, and the role of the therapist as I try to keep things calm, civilised, and functional in our house. My school performance is suffering because I keep spacing out in an attempt to sort my thoughts, and my consistent headaches. I am constantly in the verge of tears; unconsciously faking a smile all the time.

I honestly don't even know where to start. I know going to a professional would be best, but I just can't seem to have any time. I don't even know which problem to sort first. School, personal, or home life.


**[tl;dr]** My parents are divorcing, I don't know who to live with, I don't trust my little brother with either of them on his own, I have a crush of my taken best friend (hopeless, most probably) and I have a self-sabotaging way of dealing with school &amp; stress: I just don't. I feel like crying all the time, and I can't visit a professional atm.

Any advice, please?aybe on how to even start sorting this out?",03Sep2020,1

1039,"I'm in the military. The department I work in is split into two different jobs. We work in a very small room. If you can grab one of the seats for a few seconds, you're lucky because most of us just stand around all day and wait for a seat to open up. One of my coworkers is a single mom and you can tell by the way she acts that she hates her life and her job in fact she downright complains about our command in front of everyone. I normally try to joke around with her since we came into the command about the same time. She used to joke back and all was good between us, sjust some light teasing. For some reason, now she is just plain insulting. She says stuff like ""whatever, it's not like you have any friends to hang out with"" and ""you're such a child"". I used to take this as a test and a sign that she was probably interested in me but now I realize she's just a toxic person. I'm a little younger than her and I think she's resentful because I don't have any kids or responsibilities while she is stuck in a job she hates and with a kid to raise on her own. I feel bad for her for that but what she did today really pissed me off.

Today I was sitting in my chair (finally got a seat) and she came into the room. She was pissed apparently that I had taken the last chair or something. This seat is in a corner of the room right next to the corner spot. The person in the corner asked her to come over to the corner for a second and so that meant she had to slide past me. There was a small gap between my chair and the desk behind me. This women literally came up to me and said ""move, little boy"". I didn't budge because I wasn't going to comply with someone who talked to me like that. She said ""watch out"" rudely so I moved forward in a miniscule way. I was pissed about the little boy comment. She then threw a little temper tantrum and just pushed her way through. When she got between me and the desk, she PUSHED my chair forward, squeezing me into my desk. I was completely shocked by this, not gonna lie. I didn't even know what to say. All I said was ""Jesus Christ"". I feel really dumb for not ""standing up for myself"". But I literally couldn't even think of what to say. The rest of my coworkers were gathered around watching. I probably look like a total wuss to them now. Like a minute after it happened, I said ""someone has an attitude problem today"". And then I sat in my chair the rest of the day.

Coworkers are hard to deal with because you have to be civil with them and let them know you aren't going to take their shit at the same time. But this little scenario caught me completely off guard. I know all see her tomorrow and if she calls me a child or something like that again I'm going to get nasty. Any advice on how to deal with a toxic coworker like this? She is the type of person that literally sucks the life out of you.",03Sep2020,1
1040,"I’m a bit torn here. So a couple months ago I got this new job as a fraud call center specialist for a bank, it pays $21 an hour and I take phone calls from customers and banks that are dealing with fraudulent activity on an account or debit/credit card. It’s an relatively easy job but the worst part about it is the fact that the customers and even bank employees aren’t easy to deal with at times and some customers will even swear and threaten you and it gets my anxiety up. Try telling someone they can’t access any of their money, I promise it’s not an easy convo to have at all. It’s been so bad that I have been contemplating going back to my other job full time, which was a grocery store supervisor that paid $13 an hour. In this new job I’ve only been taking calls for a couple of weeks, but should I really consider jumping the gun and leaving and I don’t like it this much? What would you guys do? The money is a lot better than my old job but at the same time the challenges at my old job are smaller, but it comes with an $8 an hour pay deduction.

1043," I've been part of a club for over a year now and this year we decided that we would all get hoodies. The hoodies are not meant to serve any purpose other than generally represent the club and look good. For some reason, the person who is in charge of the club this year keeps on presenting really bad designs. Before you begin to think that I am just an opinionated asshole, please have a look at what she(the leader) has suggested: [Missing Fingers](https://imgur.com/SFJzBQV), [Gaps in Hand](https://imgur.com/avTCiS0). The first design my brother and I protested and, much to our surprise, we faced some resistance, but they ended up moving off of the design for other reasons. The Club just voted in favor of the second hoodie, 7 to 4. While I suppose it's possible that I'm just being crazy, I really do think these designs are just bad, and I wouldn't want to wear them. I want to bring this up to the group, but I'm worried about seeming like I'm picky. The hoodies are being paid for us by the club money, so I wouldn't be paying for it, but I don't want to waste school money on a hoodie that I wouldn't wear. It's also not like the designs were worked on hard by the club leader, they are stock CustomInk images that you can just drag and drop in. I really want to bring up the design, and how I would not wear the shirt if I got it, but I don't want to be rude. How should I bring it up?",03Sep2020,1

The last two years have been tough, we’ve been fighting and we’ve been to the point of breaking up many times. The reason of the break up is weird. Every now and then - particularly when he was struggling with anxiety due to exams or work - he used to “disappear”; to stop answering to my messages and my phone calls or to talk to me as if I were a stranger. He used to tell me he was not ready to feel as committed as me in our relationship. That he would feel the same about his friends and his parents. That he struggles in general to be emotionally involved in anything. Then he used to apologize and everything would come back to “normal”. This would happen almost every month. Now he is leaving me because he says he is confused, he is still immature and not able to “accept” my love, that he finds “overwhelming”, and the fact that I am important for him. I am confused. I guess the fact that I accepted being treated like this for all these years reflects my insecurity. Nonetheless, I still have feelings for him.",03Sep2020,1

1050,"Im a 16 y/o male and I’ve been having some weird thoughts and emotions, some of these emotions aren’t all that describable but they’re there. Just a quick note, I do NOT suffer from any mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or any of that (as far as i know) I’m usually pretty happy and don’t exactly feel sad too often. However heres where things start to take a weird turn. Ive been having these weird moments in regular everyday life where i just start to question everything, i kinda zone out and nothing feels real. I was bussing home today and randomly i started to think about what would happen if i killed myself. Now again, im not suicidal, i have no intentions of it whatsoever, but it does cross my mind often. I know that seems kinda contradictory, but trust me i would never. But these thoughts i randomly get, i just feel like everything would be over, i wouldnt have to worry about school, or being attractive to females or literally anything that has to do with me potentially failing and whatnot. Sometimes i just look out the window and think “what if this is the last time i see the sky?” Or “what if this is the last thing i eat/drink/see/do?” Its the thought potential death that randomly comes to my mind. Now i dont exactly know why i think about any of those things, i said it before im genuinely happy most of the time, and my life isnt horrible, its good! Out of nowhere, reality seems to shift and a grim emotion falls over me. Its nothing severe its just in my head, it doesn’t manipulate my life or how i feel for the rest of the day. Its more like an in the moment feeling, just randomly and then i move on pretty quickly, and it doesnt exactly make me sad. Maybe its the fear of not being able to find someone to care for me (that isnt a friend or family member, more like a girlfriend and such) my mind tends to wander when i start to think about it. Im in my last year of highschool and ive been single my entire life (obviously its no rush to get a significant other, im still only in highschool) and maybe im just feeling a bit lonely.

1051,"A little background: I got into an accident where I got rear ended on my scooter. It was pretty scary and even though I didn't fall off, I'm really hurt and have to go through physiotherapy and a ton of other stuff. I can't participate in the sport I love for a while, work out past what my physio tells me, like really light core work and stretching, and I can barely participate in my solitary and relaxing hobbies anymore without headaches or other pain/discomfort.

Exercise and my hobbies were pretty much the main things that helped me overcome being a total shut-in a couple years back. I legitimately didn't leave the house, not even for errands like groceries, more than maybe once every couple months. I managed to overcome that and actually become an outgoing, more sociable, and functioning adult. Now, I'm pretty scared of reverting back to that. Physical activity was also the main thing helping me deal with my ADHD. I'm back to feeling unfocused, spazzy, and forgetting everything again constantly. Honestly, I feel pretty robbed of most of my progress.

Regardless though, I know the fear of reverting back to a hermit and ADHD stuff will improve once my condition improves. I know I just have to be patient and deal with it so I can get better and get back to normal, but I can't even really sleep properly anymore. I don't know what to do if I can't even do that.

If I'm not in too much pain and discomfort to go to sleep, then I'm probably waking up randomly throughout the night every 2 hours or waking up teary and/or out of breath from nightmares at least once a night, so far up to 3 times in one night. I'd really like to improve my sleeping troubles at least cause I think being incredibly exhausted is just fueling how awful I feel and maybe even slowing down my physical recovery. Maybe I'm just being a baby, but I feel pretty lost at the moment.

So, is there anything I can do to at least improve my sleep? Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What helped you the most? Any input is welcome.",03Sep2020,1
1052,"I’ve been thinking a lot. Lockdown was rough, I got through it. Deleted social media, got invoked with a lot of craft stuff that would require my attention. That helped. But now that lockdown has passed and I’ve taken up social media, and going back to work I have felt more lonely than I ever have. And I have no reason too. I never ask people to go out with me, yet expect an invitation. I understand this is a two way street.
However the past two weeks have been increasingly hard on me, specially mentally. I had just finished sixth form and completed my A-Levels. I got my results on the 13th of August, I had failed my A-Levels. I wasn’t put down, I have contingencies in place. I motored on. I went to work, kept my head down, kept busy. It was healthy. And then my granny fell ill, she was 85 years old with dementia. They had thought she had a form of ovarian or uterus cancer but due to the dementia she couldn’t go for the surgery without them putting her to sleep. But the issue was she couldn’t be put to sleep because her heart was beating so slow that she could die at any given moment. We continued with our life, she was still alive and I couldn’t do anything because due to the virus there could only be one visitor per every two weeks. Then it was my dads birthday, and we had a few friends over within the restrictions on the 15th. I must have gotten my amended results on  the 17th or 18th of August, my grades went up which was good. Then my granny died on the 19th of August. I didn’t cry, I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t cry. The woman practically raised me, I was named after her, I stayed with her over most holidays yet on the night she passed I couldn’t cry. I couldn’t cry for a few days. I kept myself busy, I baked, help make the funeral arrangements. Granny came home on for wake on the 23rd of August, because we couldn’t have a proper one at a funeral home due to the pandemic. And she was buried on the 24th of August. I never sat still, I was greeting people, and talking to them, making teas and handing out biscuits and sandwiches. I cried once we started to follow the hurst, only for a short while I cried then didn’t cry at the cremation. And then on 26th I got word that I have been accepted to my course at university. 
I’m having a very hard time dealing with all of the above. It’s a lot of highs, mixed with a lot of lows. I just feel overall a lot more down than what I was. I actually feel as if I’m going crazy because I keep seeing butterflies everywhere, which is supposed to be a sign that someone who has passed is letting you know that all of their suffering has ended and that they are at peace. 
The room where the wake was smells of death, I cannot get the smell out of the room. I have opened windows, doors, lit candles. I cannot get the smell out of that room, and it is driving me insane. 
And the other night I thought I heard someone else in the room, like beside my ear breath. I didn’t feel a breath, I didn’t feel a person. It just sounded as if someone was watching my breathing. 
I feel as if I am on the brink of a complete emotional breakdown. I feel that I’m going crazy, and no one wants to talk to me. I feel so alone and so isolated. How do I stop this?

I don’t consider myself a creative person but when something hits I just won’t stop. After doing all those jobs I found myself in music. I’ve actually thought about starting earlier (it’s been two years since I got into music) but every time I wanted to do something a thought would hit me: “Nah man it ain’t for you, just find yourself a simple job and be happy, cause there are already people who do it and they do it good, at least better than you’ll ever be”. That was my thought process when I was 16. Sometimes I think about those words and I just start to overthink it: What if I’m not good enough? Do I have what it takes? Is it really what I want to do? And at the end of the day I just forget about all that by writing music. I’ve never ever had people who support me, when I told my mom that I want to be a musician she just laughed and shrugged it off. I guess that’s why I’m here, to find some comfort in your words, maybe some motivation. I know I can be great, everybody can be whoever they want to be, you just gotta work hard but it’s just unbearably difficult without any support and people who are close to me not being interested in what I do.

These girls told me that I could hang out with them and since I had no one else, I said I would.

They explained what they heard I did and it was extremely twisted and changed from what actually happened. I tried explaining this to one of the friends who has been ghosting me but she doesn't believe me and says that the rumours are true since there are more people saying them and theres only one of me.

I am slowly gaining a few friends back but my main friends won't talk to me and they believe the rumours that were spread about me and I don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR: Lost friends due to stupid mistake and friends believe rumours about me.",03Sep2020,1

Hey guys the past few days I’ve been struggling to sleep just because my mind is constantly thinking about this woman who is my coworker. She did tell me to pretty much to F off and that we can be cool at work but nothing outside of work and to lose my feelings for her. It is hard when she’s my coworker . At this point I’m not even sure if we’re friends or just coworkers. She does joke around with me and stuff but I don’t know she expects me to just lose my feelings for her. Yesterday I found out she went up north to visit her ex boyfriend . In the past she was heart broken because of her ex boyfriend. He blocked her on every social media and her number and wrote her a letter and mailed it to our work and pretty much told her to F off. He fooled around with other girls , talked shit about her and stuff while she was still stuck on him and she’s keep hurting her self . This time that I feel like she’s going to repeat the same thing and hurt herself and it sucks that I care for her a lot but I don’t know how to move on or not even care. Any advice?

At one point we did have feeling for each other but at one point it stopped on her end but I didn’t catch it ...",03Sep2020,1

Tomorrow will mark my first day off in three weeks, including weekends, and I’ve been working at least 12 hours every day. I’ve begged for more support and more staff, but receive no help. My boss insists on adding more to my plate and says I’m not doing enough. 

To keep a long story short, I am overworked, underpaid, and under-appreciated. I don’t find joy in any aspect of my work anymore, and I am just so tired. I think I’m to the point where I will be ready to leave soon, even if I don’t have something else lined up. 

I have a TON of vacation time banked from the last year and now more for this year (over two weeks). I know I want to be gone by December. How can I make the most of my vacation and benefit time before leaving for good? Do I take some vacation days now, then later put in my two weeks and do vacation for most of that? Can I do like a month’s notice and use my vacation mixed in with working?  I’ve never quit a job before without a reason (moving, etc) before. I’m not sure how to get the most from what I’ve earned.

1062,"I'm gonna be a senior in high school next week. About 8-9 months ago, I was checking out my crush's Insta in a classroom when some dick took a pic of me. The pic was badly timed, with my eyes closed and mouth open, and it looked like I was masturbating.

He sent it to one person, and that person sent it to some more people, and from there it spread.

I confronted the kid about it, and he said he only intended to see something funny, and wasn't trying to hurt me or embarrass me. He apologized and admitted to doing something stupid after I told him my side of the story, how angry I was at him, and how much time I spent during quarantine just thinking about it. A week later I felt like a victim, so I confronted him again and forced an apology out of him again. I confronted him about this at least 5-6 times, and he apologized 4 times.

I'm really pissed because stuff like this is unnatural, and he is such an asshole. No one else at my school probably has to deal with drama/conflicts with peers, and encounter situations where someone did something mean to them. Yet I had. People like me and George Floyd were victims of an injustice.

I still feel really angry with him. Any ideas on how I can humiliate him senior year without getting myself in trouble and have some plausible deniability?",03Sep2020,1

To make it easier let’s have my normal friend be E and my best friend be T.

So I have online friends. Over the year they’ve come and gone, but one stuck. Of course my parents don’t know I talk to strangers online. Anyways the one that stuck is who I consider my best friend. So yesterday my mom asked if E was my best friend. I said no. She asked who it was. I said T. Now she’s like “You’ve never talked about a T.” And she’s all suspicious. I create a story that “T is someone who used to live here then moved.” And she’s even more suspicious asking me if he’s my boyfriend or something. I said no and that we actually talk all the time. Now I think I’m fucked.

You see T may be only a couple years ahead of me but I’m at an age where this friendship would be considered weird. I don’t tell them about him in case they think he’s a sexual predator or something. This happened yesterday and I’m not sure if I’m just paranoid or if its worth worrying about.

Now I don’t know what to do if she asks again. Also I’m a weird child and maybe if the excuse was good she might just think I was acting crazy. Please give me advice.",03Sep2020,1

 1- everytime she gets around males she disrespects me
2- she changes her whole personality and rhe way she treats me around guys 
3- one time i had a fight for her, she left me in the middle of it and went to hang with a random guy and i was just arguing with a girl and embarrassing myself in front of everyone for nothing ...

I really had it, today we were with guys and this guy was really making me feel uneasy and he was making disrespectful dirty jokes, i tried to pull her aside and tell her but she wouldnt even listen to me, she told me it was disrespectful to talk alone when we're with people MEANWHILE the guys have been whispering to each other all day long.. she told me that she wasnt gonna text these guys since they were disrespectful to Me..
then we get home and she tells me he texted her. i look at the convo and i see that theyve been talking for 30 mins and she has been entertaining the convo and stuff. 
this is not something new, she always does something to me that i would never ever do to her. if this was a one time or two time thing i would let it slide but this happens everytime. i confronted her about it everytime and every time she made excuses and talked about stupid details that werent even slightly important. i am starting to grow this hatred towards her. what should i do?",03Sep2020,1
1065,"Okay so, the day before I went on discord and made a new account, the first person I added was my (male BTW) classmate. I just joined this new server called Divine sister, it's an lgtbqia+ server I discovered from Roblox. Then I told him I finally found a server that's recognizes demisexuals(and is Roblox related) and he was like.
 ""Ew""
Then I was confused about why he was saying that, I told him I didn't get it and he was like..
""I don't talk to lesbies""
I was confused NGL because I'm heterosexual too, then I was like ""I never said I was lesbian"" and then he said
""I don't talk to people like you""

So the back story is that we liked each other but he didn't want a relationship anyway, I was pretty much a simp to him and he enjoyed it. But then I stopped having feelings for him but I still cared about him, I thought he would be heartbroken if I just told him like that.
So instead I told him that I don't like guys anymore, and he started raving about how he knew I was always a lesbian, I didn't feel offended at first(because I'm straight). But when I tried to explain he just didn't talk to me anymore.

There are 0 lgtb rights in my country.

There's a death penalty for being openly lgtb in my country.

So maybe it wasn't his fault, maybe he thought I would get him in trouble. Or maybe he wanted me to be like the 'other' girls that gossip, talk about boys, fashion, etc and he didn't want to be friends with a demisexual anime weeb. Or maybe its my fault for even falling for him. Well he was a good friend and I trusted him with all my secrets and we shared everything together. Idk what to do at this point

My room is now my nephews (it’s okay) and her baby daddy was my boyfriends cousin. I have a horrible relationship with my mother because she projects all her overweight and relationship insecurities on to me. I have no support or friends or family due to everything I went through because on the outside it looks like it’s me that’s the problem when in reality I just had too good of a heart and let everyone walk over me because I already hated the fact I felt so alone. I thought if everyone got what they wanted maybe I would feel some happiness. My baby kitten I found outside my job and raised homeless (as so myself at the time) ran away after the year I moved in back with my mother because I am a type one diabetic that was working full time 55+ hours as a line cook, homeless. I had lost so much weight because the state of health I was in. I now got diagnosed with wilkie’s syndrome which is 0.3% - 0.013% of having and along with GERD and a paralyzed stomach. I sold my car and had given the money to the man that had laid hands on me so I had to rely on him to stay alive while I was homeless. I now weigh 94lbs and I used to weigh 160. Nobody talks to me because they all tell me I put myself through this when in reality I was trying to survive. I struggle to make relationships with people because I’m afraid of almost everything now. How do I heal from trauma I’m aware of. It’s almost like PTSD. I’m a natural woman I am a woman of the most high. I have been on head drugs and hated them. I quit smoking weed and nicotine just last week. I can’t put wait on to save myself. My current problem is that I need help on healing trauma that you are aware of... like the physical reaction I can’t control.. I also loved food so much but now when I eat it taste like shapes and objects. I feel so detached and confused. This is all still happening. I have no job because I’m so ill and no one or no mentor to help me. I’m willing to do the work but I have no direction. How do I re- introduce foods to my body? I haven’t eaten in 5 days, I only eat to treat my hypoglycemia’s. I feel stoned when I’m not. Am I not eating from quitting or from my wilkie’s syndrome. My doctor is refusing my surgery and keeps telling me I need a RD but I went to college for nutrition and I was a body lifter hence why I once weight 160lbs, I was slim thick but now I’m twig sick. He makes me feel like it’s a eating disorder but I’m sure it’s a deeper issue. But if so what foods can I easily eat and re-introduce to my body. I know the answers to my problems but nothing seems to work.  Would toast, fruit, veggies be easy? (Yes) but it isn’t?

My dog is 12 years old, she has Addison’s disease and because of this takes a steroid every day and gets a steroid shot every 8 weeks. She almost died several years ago from an intestinal infection. After being at the vets office for 2 days they decided to send her home because she didn’t make progress other than when I went to visit her. 
5 years ago she almost died from her Addisons getting so bad, this is when she was diagnosed. Since then, with careful monitoring and steroids, she’s been doing really well. 
Now she has chronic kidney failure. Vet says my options are euthanasia or leaving her at the vets office for 2 days to be flushed with IV fluids and maybe she would be okay for a while, but he said the odds are slim. He thinks about 15% chance because the kidney damage is so bad. 
I should have caught this earlier and now I have to try to find a way to live with myself. I suppose my question is, would I bring doing her a disservice if I chose to euthanize? I’ve had this dog since I was 11. It is the last thing I want to do. She’s a fighter, but she’s also very very attached to me. I worry that she would feel I was abandoning her if we chose to leave her at he vets office to do IV fluids. I don’t know how to do right by her in this situation.

I finished college while living at home and I honestly hated every second of it. Part of me resents my family for pressuring me to not only pursue college when I wasn’t ready but now they’re pushing me again to get place in town and give up on my “silly childhood dreams” that I only put off for years to finish college. Joining the military and later using that military to either go back to school or pursue a career in federal law enforcement. Both of which are being delayed by COVID. Everyone around me is telling me I need to just end the pursuit already, and there’s no shame in giving up and doing something else, something easier and something that wouldn’t take me away from home. It’s getting harder to fight them off, each day I wake up with dread in my stomach if where I am in life,  the choices I’ve made to Make others happy over myself, and this nagging feeling that I’m kidding myself and am destined to be another townie with a job and life I don’t want but “that’s part Of being an adult” as I’m told. I want to leave but can’t find any places near me that I can afford, I’m in a good amount of debt, I’ve never truly had “fun” in the sense that I’ve done nothing but work and go to school trying to get myself out of this hole I dug. I feel like I’ve wasted my youth, but also that if I don’t keep pushing then it’s the first step Of giving up and all the work will Be for nothing. I see people Complain about how much life sucks and it seems inevitable that I’m on that path. Still I try to keep pushing but I’ve been punching a wall for years, had no fun and currently feel Like I have nothing to show for it. How is everyone else holding up right now?

The American student agrees with me but is being too nice and doesn't seem like he wants to address any of the issues with them. When we arrived we were greeted by garbage and moldy food everywhere, and the whole place smelled like garbage. They saw no problem with it. We cleaned up a little but they just make more messes.

They also don't wash their hands, which is disgusting and worrisome since we're in the middle of a pandemic and also on a college campus. I know for a fact that they don't because (a) there was no soap in either bathroom and when I put some in both of them, the one in the other bathroom was unopened after a day and (b) I have heard them flush the toilet then open the bathroom door and leave without using the sink. Along with that, they pee ALL OVER the seat and floor and leave it. I literally need to wear shoes in our own bathroom because of this.

I have other issues with them such as them being loud gaming at 12am at night, but the first issue I want to address is the cleanliness. We already tried to talk to them on the first day about the mess and 2 of them just walked away.

1079,"I'm sorry this is long, I'm wordy. Skip to the end for the TL;DR. 

Ok, so here's the story: My wife and kids (both kids are under 3) were looking for a week away at the beach this year, but with COVID it just wasn't in the cards. I have (had?) a 2nd job as a DJ, both for private events and a regular gig at a local bar. Because of COVID, I've already lost about 20k in income due to the bar closing and all events having been cancelled over safety concerns (valid, but still ouch to my wallet). 

My Aunt and Uncle offered their oceanfront condo for us to use during the last week of September into the first week of October. Thankfully, where I live, the weather will still be nice and the water will still be plenty warm. And, since both kids are so young, I'm not at all concerned about nightlife, since we won't be able to go out anyway, but the week off of work and days in the sand will be more than worth the trip, plus the almost 3 year old LOVES the ocean. 

Here's the thing: My aunt and uncle offered me their condo at the ""family discount"" rate of, let's just say $1,000 for the whole week, plus cleaning crew fee and parking pass fee. They sent me the link to their building and some photos that they put up when they used to rent the place a few years back to show us the views and where to park, beach access, etc... 

When I typed in the condo website, we were taken to the VRBO rental search site for that condo building instead. Being curious, I wanted to see what other units were available that week and what they usually rented for, because who doesn't want to make sure they're getting a bargain? The prices were several hundred dollars BELOW my aunt and uncle's asking price. 

Now, to be fair, in peak season, the price they gave me was fair, if juuuuust below most other similar condos rental price. However, last week of September into October is most decidedly NOT peak season, and every other rental unit is priced accordingly. Hell, every other beach rental site on the Eastern Seaboard agrees that those weeks are NOT peak season price. 

I am asking for advice on whether or not there is a tactful way to point out to my aunt and uncle that I think they're asking a little too much for the week we want to go? Would I be a complete shithead to tell them ""Thanks for the offer, and I know I said I'd rent from you guys but when you sent us the condo site, we found a unit in your same building for $300 less than you asked us for, and I could really use the break in price considering everything going on. I'd much rather hand you the money than some stranger, but I also don't want to offend you by coming to you asking to pay less than what you offered."" 

Did I just answer my own question? I hope not. 

Please tell me y'all have something better for me.

TL;DR: Uncle offered to rent me his beach condo for $1000/week, found similar units in his same building, also oceanfront with exact same BR/BA layout for $700/week and want to ask him to come down on price without showing up on r/choosingbeggars. Please advise.

I (22f) got a friend request yesterday from an ex teacher (42m). Back in school when I was 15/16 I suffered from some crappy mental health issues and although all my teachers supported me, he stood out with a few others. I always felt like everyone was following a script and walking on eggshells around me, but he just treated me like normal and also told me about some of his mental health struggles. Of course, this is unprofessional, but it was nice for me at the time to be treated like a friend and be understood. He was also a great teacher who helped me a lot with his subject. 

After I left the school we talked over WhatsApp as friends, although he began to over share his personal issues such as suicidal feelings and I didn’t really know how to deal with that at 17 years old coming from an adult. At some point in that time he got fired and banned from teaching due to sending inappropriate messages with another student (17f). The messages obviously aren’t great but they’re also not the terrible stuff you read in the news.  I haven’t spoken to him for at least 4 years, but from his social media I can see that he’s kicked an alcohol problem and taken up running and seems much happier. 

Sorry for all the long context, but basically what I’m asking is - do you think someone can make a very bad judgement call, and still have healthy friendships with someone younger like me? Or is this behaviour predatory and a friend request all this time later a big red flag?",03Sep2020,1

Hi everyone, well, how do I start this?

We are both pretty young me being 15yo (16 next week!) while she is 16.

She is my longest-term friend, we've known each other since we were 5, and I've always admired her more than any other person I've met. Some little things made me think that she was the smartest person ever! I never felt attracted to anyone, personality-wise, and appearance-wise, however, I somehow always noticed how pretty and incredible she is.

Recently, we've been hanging out and talking a lot more, and, ditching the title, I'm pretty sure that I indeed am in love with her, and there might be a chance of her liking me back, but my biggest fear is that it is not reciprocal, and if I lost my friendship with her because of that, I would never forgive myself, plus, I'd also lose most of the connection with all my friends since they're all her friends as well.

Should I tell her how do I feel or should I just let it be?",03Sep2020,1
1094,"I’m from the uk so it’s 12.30am here, I just went to the kitchen to get a drink from the fridge and saw a tiny red light that looked like a pointer laser light flash into my fridge (large windows are on wall opposite my fridge) I got a bit freaked out but couldn’t see anything and wondered if I’d imagined it. I went back in the kitchen 5 minutes later to turn the heating down and saw a white flash that looked like a camera flash through the same window when I was stood right next to it. I looked around again and couldn’t see anything, I’m so freaked out!",03Sep2020,1
1095,"Basically, we became ""friends"" around 7 years ago freshman year of high school. Most of this story takes place in high school. I was new to the friend group. I remember I always got bad vibes from her though. For example, we played this ""game"" where we all went around and stated things about each other that we didn't like. However, most of the game was just us saying, ""I don't really have anything to say"" or we would state genuine problems that we were having with each other. During the game, this girl mentioned something about me that she didn't like. I wasn't offended that much, but I will admit that it did seem weird to me because it was so small.

 Basically, I had just joined a sports team at our high school that she was in. I joined late so I was never added to the group chat. I didn't even know there was a group chat until later, but because I wasn't added, I didn't know if practices were cancelled or not. So, whenever it was raining, I had no idea if it was cancelled. If I didn't know, I'd ask the girl. 

During the game, she basically said, ""can you stop texting me and asking if we have practice"" and I was like yeah sure. My only issue was that it seemed like she was trying to push me away? It seemed like she was basically saying, ""hey, stop contacting me."" I understand if she didn't want to tell me (for whatever reason) if we had practice when it rained. However, she could've simply texted me saying, ""hey, there's actually a group chat where the coach texts us and says if we have practice. I can add you to it!"" or ""hey, how about instead of you texting me and asking if we have practice when the weather is bad, I can just let you know if the coach says anything!""

Then, she ended up distancing herself from the friend group and I ended up becoming extremely close to all the girls. I forgot about her for a while. I do want to mention though, that during this time I dated an asshole, and he apparently snap chatted her while with me. I was obviously angry at him, I was less angry at her. But we did have mutual friends, her best friend was also my best friend, so she KNEW we were dating and she still snap chatted him. Regardless, I didn't care because it wasn't her fault. I broke up with him shortly after though. I only mention this because maybe it adds to her reasoning?

She then started hanging out with my friend group more and I saw her a lot. However, she still did things that made it seem like she didn't like me. She would talk badly about me for very small things, similar to what she said about me before. For example, I have a pool and once she legit yelled at me for not allowing everyone to come over and hangout in my pool. Like, really odd things.

THEN my brother entered high school and she became obsessed with him. Once, everyone was over at my house and my brother asked me to drive him and his friends to CVS. I said no because my friends were over. However, this girl volunteered to take him. However, it didn't seem that she was trying to do my family a favor or anything, I think she just had a crush on my brother. To me, it came off as her trying to get close with my brother because she cared more about him than me. 

THEN she did the same thing with my cousin. I'm super close with my step sister. I'm super close with my step sister, we are only a year apart. However, she lives 2 hours away. 

We are all in college now, but she goes to school in our hometown. Whenever I am home, I text her asking if she wants to do something and she ALWAYS has an excuse. She also never seems interested in hanging out. However, once my step sister was visiting while I was home and this girl seemed to care way more about seeing her. She texted my step sister asking, ""why didn't you tell me you were home?? I miss you so much wtf is wrong with you."" Also, whenever she sees my step sister she gives her a HUGE hug. Whenever she sees me for the first time in months, she just says ""hey."" Not even a hug? I also want to note that this girl only hung out with my step sister THREE times. They don't text. They don't video chat. They don't talk. Wtf???

There is also this new app that was popular for a few months. You download it and add your top 10 best friends. This girl added my step sister but she didn't add me?

I'm just confused by this girl. Does anyone know why this could be happening? Like, she is oddly extremely friendly to my family yet acts completely disinterested towards me. Not only disinterested, she always has some sort of criticism.",03Sep2020,1
1096,"yeah so my ex and i broke up roughly five months ago. i feel more secure on my own and much happier without him but he still takes up a fuck ton of my headspace and i still think about him a lot. he comes up in my dreams at least once a week. he blocked me on social media and as far as i know, he has a new girl. i really want to let go of him and we haven’t talked since, and i feel like it would help to talk to him to get some closure since things kind of ended abruptly and he moved on so quickly. my friends say that i should reach out to them, but others say that i shouldn’t. i kind of don’t believe in talking to exes, to get closure but nothing seems to be working for me to get over him.

TLDR; ex and i broke up months ago, can’t get him out of my mind, don’t know whether or not to reach out to him to get closure",03Sep2020,1
1097,"Hi all, thanks for listening. Suffice to say, my father would never tell us, and asking isn't really an option. I guess I'm supposed to be there for him in some capacity, but that's never gone well in the past. I guess more than anything I'm ashamed of the fact that there's nothing I can do. I should be sad, and I am, but what weighs more heavily on my mind is how to handle whatever reaction my father will have, if any.   


I understand the overtones that my post must convey, but rest assured, I'm safe. He is a volatile man, and I can't use kind words to describe him. But I don't find myself to be in physical harms way.

1098,"I tell myself I don't give a shit about other people's opinions, but deep down I really do. Maybe it's because I got bullied as a kid, but who the hell knows.

1100,"this year has been the first time in my life where I have accepted my sexuality (gay) and I became happy with it, although not out yet I still felt better about it. But I’ve came into a problem and it’s shaken my understanding of my sexuality a bit. 

So I am sexually attracted to boys and boys only, I have no sexual attraction towards women but I seem to only get crushes on girls and not guys. This has really confused me because when I’m older I want to settle down with a BOYfriend and can’t see myself with a girlfriend.

1101,"This has been tearing me up for months. 
I have a bestfriend ( we are both girls)  and we've been best friends for about 2 years now and Ive always wanted a friendship where youre close enough to someone to kiss them on the cheek. she has friends like that but me personally I havent anyone close like that

One day i asked to test the waters and ask something along the lines of would you kiss me ? and she said no but you can go ahead and kiss me if you want im just not gonna kiss you. I asked why she said because she used to like me so she thought it would be akward.

For context,  a year in our friendship she started liking me but ended up getting over it because I was in a relationship myself( im not in a relationship anymore) shes been over me for around a year now.

So she thinks things will get akward because she 
used liked me a year ago :P
honestly now im alittle taken back about kissing her because I dont want to make her uncomfortable for my own desires. 
but im a bit torn what should i do 
go for it anyways or just leave it be ?",03Sep2020,1
1102,"I cannot Tell you what I'm feeling at any give time. Well okay that's not completely true, some feelings I can identify, but it's hard, I always second guess myself or just straight up don't have a word for what I'm feeling. Most of the time I can tell if I'm feeling good or bad, but sometimes I can't even do that. 

I also have a hard time knowing how to react in situations.

For example: my cousin and best friend since I was two all the way until 7th grade, texted my sister that she was going to commit suicide and that she was sorry. My parents and sister rushed over to her house and I stayed behind and watched my little brothers.
That whole time I kept telling myself that I shouldn't cry, but should I have? I ended up just staring at the show they were watching Trying not to feel anything. They brought my cousin to our house for her own safety, I was relieved she was okay and alive. I should have been happy she was okay, I WAS happy she was okay, but I still went upstairs and cried in my closet for a while. Why was I crying then, I didn't really make sense, it would have made more sense to cry earlier when I was unsure if she was okay, not after we brought her to safe environment!?

Bc of stuff like this I find myself wanting to ask people how they would react in certain situations, I even occasionally copy others reaction when I don't know how to respond properly.

I also don't like to display any thing besides happy, and occasionally sarcasm. This is pretty un fair to people around me, who don't understand how I can seem so happy one minute but completely break down the next, it's bc I push any negative feeling away until I can't anymore and I break down in tears.

Yeah so idk even know what I'm asking advice on, I think I want to know if this is normal, or is there something wrong with me. If so what do you think it is, why do these things seem so easy for other people but for me it takes extra effort 😭",03Sep2020,1

1105,"Alright, so, I don't really know how to say this without sounding like a complete ass, so I'm just gonna tell you like it is, I am a really good looking guy. Whenever I walk into a room all eyes are on me, sounds like a dream? Well it's not. I know whatever I do I will always be the center of attention, I try to tell myself the well known story of how nobody will remember what you do, but that does not work for me. I try to tell myself that nobody pays attention to my mistakes, but I know and notice, almost everyone does. Please, don't get me wrong, I love being me, and I am so so very grateful for my looks, however, i just can't relax around other people. I think I have some sort of social anxiety but I can't help but feel like people expect me to be perfect just because of the way I look. If anyone has got any experience or advice, please.
