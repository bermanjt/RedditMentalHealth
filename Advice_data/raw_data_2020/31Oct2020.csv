 I (19) have been dating my boyfriend (21) for 10 months. For background, I got on tinder in September 2019 after getting out of a two-year long abusive relationship and I was a freshman in college. My previous boyfriend was the most toxic person I’ve ever met, he cheated, lied, manipulated, ruined friendships, spread rumors and still continues to do so a year after our breakup. I had a rough childhood and a not-so-great family whom I still live with. I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD. 

My boyfriend had just got out of a two-year long-distance relationship earlier in the year. We matched on tinder and talked occasionally but we didn’t really start texting until December. One day he said “we should exchange heartbreak stories,” and we ended up FaceTiming and telling each other the basics. I told him about my ex, and he told me about his. Some people might think that’s weird but I loved it and I wouldn’t have had it any other way. We developed feelings for each other, met each other, and have been inseparable since. The first few months were rocky because of me still getting over my ex but we have never actually left each other.

His ex girlfriend, we’ll call her “A,” was from a different country and he told me she wasn’t that great. They met on kik through a friend in 2016 and started dating in 2017. From what he remembers he said she didn’t let him play video games, didn’t like his female friends, wanted attention but never reciprocated, cheated on him to get a rise out of him (including talking to his friends), didn’t support his future career choice and was just a bad person all around. She gave him an ultimatum saying that she wanted to meet him by the beginning of 2019 or they would be over. He bought the tickets and everything but his grandfather became sick and he told her he couldn’t go. They broke up but weren’t really “over” until (ballpark) April 2019. He had another little thing with a girl he met on tinder but she was more interested in partying and smoking weed than actually meeting him and being with him, and ended up cheating on him and breaking up with him.

He told me in the beginning of our relationship that he had no hate towards A, that they were dumb kids when they dated and that they had both matured and were friends now. I had no problem with that but as the months went on, my feelings towards her started to change. The more he remembered and told me about the more I wondered why he was so okay with her treating him like that, and why he was allowing her to still be in his life. It wasn’t until one day while I was at his house that she ASKED him to buy her something that I was like, “Yeah, no. That’s too far.” I told him that’s disrespectful and he agreed, but he kinda brushed it off and said it wasn’t like that. I don’t think they talked to each other after that.

I knew he still had pictures of her, and the other girl, and I told him it made me uncomfortable. He said there was a lot of pictures on his phone and he didn’t feel like going back and deleting all of that. I understood, as I am lazy too, so I just left it for him to do whenever he wanted. As more time passed, I hated her more and more and his feelings started to change too, I’m guessing since he had me pointing out everything wrong with it. I could tell he was just numb to the situation but I couldn’t tell if it was because he just didn’t want to be effected by her or if he still secretly had feelings for her. He became vague when talking about her and brushed off my feelings on the matter for a while. The only relationship problem we had was him being numb and seeming emotionally unavailable. We got into small arguments here and there and we still do, and he tries his best to be as present and mindful of his actions as possible.

After months of seeing her pictures pop up in snapchat memories, having her post on her social media’s indirectly talking about him, and hearing about her, I was sick of her. I was jealous that he put her staying in his life over his new girlfriend. We sat down and had a long talk about everything and he ended up blocking her on everything. The details are hazy but I’m pretty sure by that point he just wanted her gone too, so it’s not like we disagreed on that. Once she was “gone,” though, all her pictures were still there, and of course everything that had led up to that had already left its mark on me. I felt like I was worth less than she was, that she was his first love, she was prettier, you know I was just heavily insecure. 

We decided during the beginning of quarantine  to build a pc for me out of two old ones he had, and with that came all of his stuff, and with that came pictures of *her*. I don’t think he really thought about that until AFTER the computer was already at my house, but he asked if I wanted him to wipe it and I said no because I wanted to keep his modeling pictures and gaming stuff. While cleaning out the drive I found some.. unsettling things, to say the least. Nudes of her, love letters he planned to send her, selfies, edits, just lots of things that gave me a real view into their relationship. This was nothing like what he told me, and to me, it felt like he had been downplaying how much he cared for her. He told me he was always just trying to make her happy, he was afraid of losing her, all that. But the previous thoughts still stuck with me.

Shortly after that I was at his house and he got up to go to the kitchen, leaving me with his phone. This wasn’t abnormal, we both trusted each other with each other’s phone password and didn’t mind going through phones as we had nothing to “look for.” I opened his phone to play a game I regularly play on his phone, but I noticed he still had WhatsApp (the app they talked on the most) and out of curiosity, I clicked on it. Her messages were there, so I clicked on that too. I didn’t scroll up much before I broke down. Even after the breakup, even after meeting me, he was still super nice to her, like to push-over level. My heart was shattered. When he came back and saw he asked me how far I had read, and we got into an argument about it. He said he wasn’t comfortable with me reading the texts because it wasn’t the him that he was now and it was cringy. We left it at that. The next day though, I open his phone, and WhatsApp is gone. We got into another argument and he told me he doesn’t want me to read anything between them.

Im not one to give an ultimatum, but after the months of feeling the way I did, being brushed off, and everything I had found out on accident, I told him I needed to read those texts or I couldn’t continue. She was interrupting our relationship so much and I told him that it was his fault for letting it get that far, and he agreed. He asked me if he could have some time to read the messages himself and get ready, and I said of course. I’m not sure how long the time was between that and when I actually read them, but we talked a lot about it during that. After he read the messages he cried, told me he felt like a wall had come down, and he started treating me a lot better than he did before. He reassured me he had absolutely no feelings for A and that he was so sorry for letting his baggage get in the way of our relationship. I felt like, because a “wall” came down after reading the texts, that he did actually still have some unresolved feelings towards her that he just didn’t want to tell me about. But I was just happy it was over.

As much as I wish those things could just ~go away~, they don’t. Nothing just goes away like that. The insecurity and jealousy never went away. The past few months she’s talked sh*t about me and him quite a lot on her social media, and recently she called him from a new number. He didn’t respond and blocked her new number. 

I go days without even remembering she exists, but some days I have dreams or intrusive thoughts about her. I think about the pet names he called her, what she looks like, what they’d be like if they were still together, everything. It hurts me a lot and makes it hard to build up my relationship with him.

I think my biggest thing is just that she was there first. She hurt him so much and I hate her for that. She got the innocent, teenager Him that didn’t deserve an ounce of heartbreak. I got the aftermath. 

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? Can anyone give me some advice on how to handle this and recover from this?

TL;DR - Boyfriend dated a girl from a different country for two years before we met and he made me extremely jealous of her on accident. I still can’t get over it because it was dragged on for months and he never really solved the problems until recently. I have intrusive thoughts about her and their relationship constantly.

I posted about this in a few subreddits yesterday and the comments I got were unbelievably rude, so if you’re just going to say: 
“You’re not ready for a relationship.”
“He didn’t do anything wrong.”
“You need professional help.”
Or anything like that, save your time, because I’ll just delete your comment. I’m looking for advice and support, not your idea of our relationship. We do not want to leave each other, we want to work through this together. Thank you!",31Oct2020,1
1,"This has been going on for a few days, but it started when I walked out to the hallway which smelled from my neighbors (straight across from my door) smoking indoors. So, I just cracked the staircase hallway's window a couple inches. 

I came home to that window being duct taped shut. I was really confused and I checked my doorbell camera to see if it caught anything. It was the guy living straight across from me. It didn't really bother me, just thought it was odd to do that instead of just closing the window. A few days after that (today) on my way in from work I just took down the duct tape and didn't think anything else of it. 

Later that evening, I was expecting an amazon package and checked my doorbell camera to see if it got delivered. Instead it's just this guy, getting angry, re-taping the window and spitting on my door and staring really creepily/threateningly into my ring camera for about a minute.

I'm unsure what to do from here. If I leave it alone will he just hold some kind of grudge about this? If I go to the apartment management will that just cause more problems? If I write a note could that leave more room for miscommunications and cause him to become more aggressive? 

Any advice would be appreciated.",31Oct2020,1
2,"My question is, how often should a stranger attempt to contact you in order to define their behavior as stalking.
In my case, three years ago, someone had found my personal informations and coordinates (phone, address.. ) on a CV of mine that was published online. He tried to contact me by email, phone, whatsapp, messenger, and was even checking my LinkedIn but I ended up blocking him each time. The thing is that, he’s not being aggressive for the moment, but every six months or so, he resurfaces. So in three years, I can say he tried to contact me less than ten times, but  he hasnt stopped yet, and apparently, he even tried to reach one of my friends. 
I d like to mention that I have no prior knowledge of this person, no connection or whatsoever, they live abroad, but apparently come to my country occasionally since he s from here, and he has already asked me to meet him. 
When I looked up online stalking behavior on the net, it is more attributed to someone who is obsessively and repeatedly trying to contact their victim. For me, I dont think I have a case with the very few evidence I have, but I dont feel safe either, knowing that this person has my address and knows my workplace",31Oct2020,1
3,"Hi,

It takes me weeks, sometimes a month to make a decision.

For example, I am in search of a new phone. I've been eyeing a few for a few weeks now. When I finally made a decision on the phone I want, it went out of stock and I need to wait a few more weeks for it to go back in stock. My second choice went up in price and I can no longer afford it. This happens to a lot of things in my life. It even happens in job offers. I take too long and the company offers it to someone else.

How do I make fast, snap decisions?",31Oct2020,1

The problem is that I have no clue what to say, how to act, what should i do?? 

When I’m around them I feel almost guilty to be or talk about anything happy. I don’t know how to be when I’m around them anymore, all I’ve been saying is “I’m here for you” and stuff like that but it feels like im failing as a friend... help :(",31Oct2020,1
5,"Hey y’all, 15(M) here.


My family went out to do some errands and they left me home alone. We’re not in a particular dangerous neighborhood and we’ve never had something like this before. I went to my bathroom and I saw a car parked out in the back so I wondered who could that be. So after the car took off I went downstairs to check the front porch and sure enough there was a dude slightly turning the doors to see if they were unlocked. I turned on the front lights and didn’t say anything and he scurried off.

I really don’t know what I should do here. I got a full glimpse of the guy but nothing much. Should I give my family the benefit of the doubt and leave it be? Or what should I do here?",31Oct2020,1

11,"Just to clarify, I'm religious so I can't keep a girlfriend but I just used that term so you would get a jist as to what our relationship is. She's more my future wife. I met her in school about 3 odd years ago and we just started talking daily since then. I really enjoy her company but her friends are the problem. I have ignored them for the longest time but now it's really agitating me. They manipulate her by planting seeds of doubt into her mind, and make her question my loyalty and trust. 
This is really tiring for me.

Her friend group consists of 10 people. Initially I would also hang out with them and it was fun, we would go out to see movies every friday and also would go bowling and just socialising frequently. After a few weeks she became my best friend and I would hang with her and I even introduced her to my friend circle and family. IDK why but her friends expected me to make it official or something, like say oh we're dating or something and then whenever I would hang with them they would always just single me out and say how I'm such a gaslight or I'm such a player or something and how I'm really selfish for not making it official???????? She would try to get them to stop but they just shouted over her everytime. 

I just ignored them as I was busy anyway with sports. I would get invited to the hangouts but couldn't attend due to my new busy schedule. They misinterpreted this as me being stuck up and stubborn, that I thought I was better then them. When in reality I was just busy. I would meet her twice a week and she started getting more and more dependent on me. She said how she doesn't feel wanted and that I don't make time for her? That I reply back slow and I only send 1 snap every hour????? I barely have time to check my phone. I literally just specifically send that snap every hour knowing she's waiting. Anyway. 

She started constantly asking 'what are we?'. I told her how I want to marry her when I get my feet on the ground and that I have feelings towards her but we can't kiss or do anything intimate because of my religion but she keeps saying how she's frustrated and needs intimacy. I have heard her friends a countless number of times try to convince her to leave me, how there's better guys out there and she'll be so much happier. They have these group chats and they do video calls and I hear them all the time just backchatting and slandering my character.
They hate me for literally no reason, I have never hurt their feelings or ever spoken to them negatively.

She has this one guy friend and I think he has feelings for her. He pushes her to stop talking to me the most and says how I'm so toxic and is 24/7 always just saying I'm cheating with other girls. He always tries hanging out with her. Her friends are thots and I think the guy friend is just jealous of me tbh. I've blocked all her friends bc I don't like drama and I also ignore them inrl. She tries sticking up for me but she always gets manipulated in the end. I'm tired of being accused. I sat her down and explained to her for a solid 40 minutes what my plan is and what I'm trying to do and that there is no one else and I even let her search my phone. I told her that I'm never going to explain myself ever ever again as I hate having to explain over and over again. 

Her friends really monitor everything I do. I can't even hang out with my friends anymore. If I happen to be in a 5 mile radius of a female then that's it. I must be cheating. I can't even turn my phone off anymore because then obviously that translates to me cheating somehow. I can't see myself dealing with this anymore. I'm not sure what more I can do?

TL:DR Gf (20F) constantly being manipulated by toxic friends and I (20M) feeling agitated.",31Oct2020,1
12,"My family has never really been inviting of me being a talker, especially since I had bad anxiety and depression as a kid and a lot of the time I was being angsty and angry. Sometimes I think of my mom's words "" if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all "". I have some trouble understanding the extents to that phrase and find myself shutting off from others from fear of being misunderstood, especially when it comes to humor. I want people to like me, I have trouble making and keeping friends and fear that when others get to know me for who I am, they'll leave me.
I'm a guy, I'm 19, and when I'm comfortable I can open up pretty easily and talk pretty easily, but after a lot of conversations I find myself beating myself up over how I was talking just in general. I feel wrong a lot of the time. I feel like my words hurt others even when I'm just having fun, messing around or other things. I think it's all about how I feel insecure about who I am and I don't really believe that I am a rude, distrespectful person.
Personally I don't feel that way towards others.
My ex told me a year ago when we were dating that sometimes my comments were rude, but to be honest a year ago I was still angry. I'm a lot better now in general but I always have this pit in my stomach... What do I say, what don't I say...why do I bother talking at all...?
It's pretty stupid to ask strangers if I'm a ""good"" person or not, none of you know me on a personal level, but still I'm trying.",31Oct2020,1
13,"So I recently matched this guy on bumble and we started talking. When I first said Hi to him he asked me what should we do? And basically we made plans to meet up later in the month of November as we are both busy atm. We talked some more after that and he seemed really engaged in the conversation. However the conversation ended and we stopped talking after that. The following day we didn’t talk at all until I sent him another message asking him whats up? He said whats up (my name)? And we had another conversation again however the conversation also ended. Today we haven’t talked at all and I understand that we don’t always have to talk but it seemed like he was interested in me because he asked to hang out, but now im not so sure. Should I try to start another conversation or leave it be? Also was he just fucking around with me when he asked to hang out or am I just overthinking everything?",31Oct2020,1
14,"So, my friend texted me at 9am, right at the beginning of a meeting, telling me her neighbor is looking to rehome her cat, Onyx. I'd been considering getting a puppy, but a second cat would be great if I was able to integrate it into my home (which I spent the whole day researching) so my cat could have a friend.
I get to my friend's place and the lady doesn't respond for two hours, so I leave. I rang her doorbell, texted, and called her. The thing is, she has *a lot* of cats. There was a gorgeous boy sitting outside that my friend claimed she'd seen eating part of a dead squirrel once and another, who she said was the father of Onyx, who was roaming around the car park.
I spent the entire day thinking of Onyx. I'd begged my fiancé for his okay on it, told my mom and three coworkers, and had been so excited over for eight hours until I left work. And she doesn't respond.
I got angry and went to the Humane Society and PetCo to see some cats - not to get any but to meet some and fill that void I'd created throughout the day - and I even teared up a bit from sheer disappointment on the drive home.

Here's the issue: the cat is in a home filled with other cats, some of whom are outdoor cats (which I don't believe in, out of fear), and my friend described the lady as the crazy sort who rambles on forever. If she ends up coming back to me and asking me to take the cat, should I?

My current cat is so well-behaved and knows how to ""play"" without claws and is so talkative and I'm worried that a second cat will mess that up. I can't get a dog because of my and my fiancé's schedules. Should I just chill and accept that we're a one-pet home or should I consider waiting a bit longer?",31Oct2020,1
15,"Hello reddit, this is my last resort as to check my own mental state and my views on life. I feel like I'm losing grip on reality. I need help.
Also I am in a very undeveloped country in the EU which is corrupt and nothing is functioning as it should.
With that out of the way let's begin.
My life was great until 2.5 years ago when my dad revealed to me as the oldest child (having daughter/my sister who's 13 and my brother who's 4) that my mom cheated on him for 10 years. This devasted the poor man as he is hard working and brings food to the table. She never worked and never wanted to. I was upset, wanted to beat her up because I knew of all the stuff we would loose because she was idiotic. Anywho push comes to shove. She admits to it, but he never harmed her as he became religious recently (for the past 4 years, prior to that he was gambling, owned bars, small casinos etc.)
They agreed, she can stay there for the sake of those 2 small kids so they don't suffer from parents being divorced. Also we had finally bought a flat and we were neck deep in shit because we had debts and we had to save up money and stick together to have atleast our own flat to live in. 2 months after she started to act weird. Having fake panic attacks, not wanting to cook, clean, feed the 4 year old, not caring, daydreaming etc. While me and my dad would break our backs since we do hard work and would transfer 10 tons worth of materials on almost daily basis with our bare hands all alone. Just 2 of us. 
Lastly after almost a year of her bs my dad had enough, said fuck it you're going back to your own parents. Basically they separated (even tho it's not official they are separated).
Aftermath was a shit show for all of us except for her. 
I realised we basically threw almost 50 000 euros for nothing because we had to sell our flat to cover up other financial issues, basically saving our business. 
She left wanting to take kids with her (even tho her family is manipulative and same as her/ they don't care for anyone except themselves and only want money). She wanted part of the money from the flat we had to sell. Now we are all living with my grandma and my aunt. 6 of us in 1 bedroom flat. I have 0 privacy. I can't call anyone, I can't voice chat with my friends, I can't play games at night, can't study much as my sister is also very similar to my mom being all for herself and not caring etc. I can't earn money anywhere because I can't work anywhere as I have gymnasium. I can only carry stuff around. I do that for my dad almost every day of the week but he rarely ever gives me any money.  Last week I did financial report on myself, looking how much I spent and what on. I spent 15 euros in 1 month. Mostly on coca cola (I love coke) and food (I love chips) , hell it became so bad my gf started paying when we go out. I feel so embarrassed as to someone else paying for me. That's something I never wanted and would never allow. I am repeating first year of faculty because I was struck by covid and this shitshow at the same time. I had to work instead of my mom, I had to carry stuff. I had to unload all of stuff from our flat all by myself. Basically waking up at 6 going to work coming back at 4 and unloading stuff until 12 am. Eating only one meal a day. For 2 weeks. It drained me. It was gulag. I started caring less about stuff in general. I do kickboxing, was doing martial arts for 10 years but this brought anxiety and rage into me. Now even tho I could flip most guys my age out, I feel so scared inside whenever I run into someone shouting at me acting tough. I know I can handle them but there is something that crushed my will and made me feel weak. My dad whenever I fuck up would call me gay, weak ass, being selfish, not being good for nothing. Man I don't smoke, don't do drugs, dont drink, if I get 5 euros this day. I would spend 3 on my brother and sister buy them like candy or something to surprise them and save up the 2 to have so my gf doesn't pay for me. I can't afford anything and I don't want my auntie buying stuff for me or my dad, cuz if I fuck up in work, like drop my bag while carrying it and it spoils the contents worth of 10 euros, they will say we buy you clothes feed you for nothing, you don't give nothing in return you are bla bla. I'm sick of it. I want my own money. I don't have many friends since I don't like fake ass friendships and backstabbing people. My word doesn't mean anything to anyone because I stand by it. If I promise something I will do that. That isn't worth a dime now because most of people I became friends with are just good acters. I was always a lone wolf. Recently I day dream alot about the past. How life was better because I know there was a sudden boom or change in culture in mid 2000s and as a kid growing up I saw it first hand. Atleast here there was that boom. I daydream about my siblings. They aren't being fed at my moms place. Law could send her the kids, that's what I'm afraid of aswell. I think about life. I want normal life. I like electronics for example. From my experience most of guys my age have wayyy more stuff than me. They live like kings, driving around going to college eating exotic foods or pizzas everyday spending money on clothes phones computers food drugs etc. I can't do any of that. I would never do drugs but I added them as they are expensive. I can't get anything, I forgot when was the last time I ate at a restaurant or fast food. I don't go out often. My gf is nagging me about going somewhere together and seeing stuff. I am sad because I can't afford that. I am sad because she is missing out on alot of stuff because of my broke ass. I am giving my best but I can't get any money. I can't unfuck anything here. Everyone mostly blaims me for shit. My sister gets a free pass and she is very manipulative and doesn't even clean up after herself. You can imagine the rest of the picture. I feel like the more of an asshole you are the better you'll end up. It's hard to be a decent person. Everyone is angry, doesn't have a minute to talk or doesn't care etc. They are like yeah you helped us and help us by carrying tons worth of stuff weekly to help us out and even carried everythinf from one place to another, here have 5 euros. That's low in my opinion. That's like throwing small chunk of meat at the dog and saying you were a good boy today. I don't need your money. You very well know I can't do shit with 5 euros these days as even coffee dates are worth more than that. I'd rather have them compliment and be nice, then to be like this. I want to move out and they have one more small flat but they say it's cursed (again they are religious a bit) and don't want me to move in. Man i can't get sleep because my sister keeps pushing me off the bed. I can't have privacy. I'm broke cuz there is no job. No one notices my hard work. No one cares. No one thinks like an adult. Is it me or is this world a shit place with shitty people in it. I'm sorry for being vulgar but I am on brink of breaking apart or killing my dad or mom or both for this mess. My dad doesn't want to find another flat cuz he's okay with what we have. It's gods will he says. I dunno. I need someone to clear up things for me. Trust me this is just the tip on the iceberg. There's alot more stuff but I don't want to be dreadful. My gf claims no one cares about me. I don't know. I want to be a normal person. Free and to live life. To have money, I honestly even wanted to break up for sake of my gf so she gets someone later on who is more stable than me. I know it sounds weird but I want the best for her. She deserves to see stuff, to enjoy stuff and not my problematic broke ass. Honestly I would like to go away from all of this forever and never look back. I don't want or need pity, I hate that. I need people to share their opinions or ways to improve my life since everything I tried wasn't cutting it. Hell teens my age with even less education and skills are going for politic races and stuff. It's crazy. I have certified Solidworks diplomas etc and never even thought of politics. Most of them don't even have any diplomas and don't even speak any other language than our mother language etc and run for candidates. I am sorry if my english is broken af, it's 2 am here and I am very sleepy and wanted to talk to someone and vent myself out. This board seems like a cool way to share my shit life with you. Sorry if I was a bore or something just try to understand me, I've got nothing to give nor anyone to talk to except my gf who started to ignore me because of my family problems.

I have a  friend that has this sort of issue with life all the fucking time. We talk a lot online but he always brings this issue daily. We both go to college, so it's expected for us to do a lot of work especially for a two-month class. I tend to do fine in college, although I will say that I deal with depression and severe ADHD. Although, I have for sure struggle with my mental health I tend to do very well on my grades even with my mental health not been the best.  I  don't complain about the work I have to do because honestly, I don't have another option. 

Well, my friend has normal mental health, they have everything fine. Although this year they have complained endlessly about their homework. They keep commenting things to me like "" why do I have to get a degree and do insignificant homework? and go to a job I hate"", ""I sometimes think that dying would be easier than to do homework"", ""Every time I think about homework I am in pain, I don't like it"".  I don't know what the fuck they expect me to do. They also tend to ask me how do I function while having ADHD and depression. To which I respond, I don't know dude I guess I have high functioning depression.  I have told them that if they have suicidal thoughts to go to a mental health professional to which they respond to "" I just want endless money, they are not going to help me with that so why go"". I think the problem is that they get stressed out about the thought that we all have to work and make money to live. They don't want to work or even put effort into a college degree. I am so fucking tired of them complaining to me. I am not a  mental health professional to help them. I made it clear that I feel uncomfortable with their complaints and that I am here to support them but no for this problem for there is no much for me to do. 

I don't know what to do, I can't take so many complain about how they don't want to put the effort into their life because that's something I can't solve. What I am concerned about is why do they try to reach me? again I told them to seek a therapist because I am not trained to deal with this. I stopped having contact with them for a while because I can take so man complains before my hair turns gray. They are a good friend deep down but I feel like once ill talk to them again, they will drop those complaints to me.   I personally think there is no much to do, but I thought that maybe I am wrong.",31Oct2020,1
17,"One morning a woke up around 12 to my roomate telling me to come outside. My car that was parked on the street was completely totaled  by a man who served out of nowhere across lanes of traffic directly into it. He was a 50 black man with a pegleg and had a woman in his car with sores on her face from drug use. My neighbor said she though she saw her head being lifted up from his lap when they crashed, thinking she was a prostitute giving him road head and him Cumming made him crash. I called the police and waited 3 hours for them to come, and while doing so the man showed me a handful of pills with a half smoked blunt for some reason and we spoke about how to work this out. He didn’t have insurance or a license but agreed to pay me 1700 for the damage and I let him go because the police hadn’t showed up for hours (big mistake). The police got here a few hours after and said they couldn’t do anything because I had let him go so it wasn’t a hit and run and said they couldn’t file a police report since they couldn’t hear his side of the story (I think that’s bullshit and they just didn’t want to do it) over the next few months I kept calling him and he said he needed more time. This morning I called him and said if he didn’t pay me I would sue him. This sent him into a rage and he said he wasn’t going to pay me anything now and started threating to come to my house to assault me(the accident was outside my house he knows where I live). I looked up his criminal records in the sheriffs website and he had multiple counts of felony aggravated battery, crack distribution/possession, and a load of charges related to skipping bail/violating probation. If I sued him I don’t even think I could get anything since you can’t garnish wages from a drug dealer (he also offered me heroin as compensation the day of the accident). I’m wondering if it’s pointless to sue him at this point and would only waste time and money, and put me in danger. Considering he’s been to jail for battery I think he would seriously show up at my house to try to do something if I did. I called the police to report what happened and they are supposed to show up at my house but it’s been hours and they aren’t here, they are useless to protect me. My car is worth 3000, which I would sue for, but I seriously doubt I could get anything at this point. Is there anything I can do?",31Oct2020,1

Of course i knew there would be a lot of work which i dont mind but there was more that I dont think its worth risking. For example my time with family. Having to work on birthdays, weekends, holidays and the pay would not be good. They told me i could get injured and to expect mean people. I was like well this is not how it was explained to me. So i ended up turning the job down. I graduated with my degree in psychology and i just feel like i dont know if i made the wrong decision.

I believe what he will do, as he has done before, is leave it to the next lesson and address it there if I am lucky, which is useless to me as I need a response before.

Due to all that stress, I cant focus, Im easily overwhelmed and any criticism/insulting towards me makes me bummed out.

Im sad that I cannot meet him, comfort him. Im also scared he will have the corona and his fealth/life will be in great danger. It makes me wanna cry.

28,"Hey everyone and thank you for taking time out of your day to read this post. 

Long story short I work in a restaurant as a bar manager. In this restaurant, though it is not legal, we are allowed to enjoy shift drinks. At first it was 1 drink a night per employee, and this could be any drink whether it be a cocktail, beer, wine, sangria, etc. Obviously this got out of control real fast, to the point where teenagers and minors are drinking occasionally, and the staff is having as much alcohol as they please. This includes myself. However, my manager, who's name I will not say, drinks the most out of all of us. Like a lot. It's also worth noting that she is now the 4th manager in that restaurant with a drinking problem. Normally it does not bother me, but a few months ago after she had been drinking she told me during an argument that it was a good thing that people I know have killed themselves. This angered me so I went to management, and they did nothing. Yesterday I missed a shift because I was not on the schedule, and I did not check the schedule change saying I was supposed to work. Today I was asked to sign a written warning about the situation, which I refused. She didn't get a written warning, so why did I and why should I have signed it? I angrily left the restaurant and called the person above her who is ignorant to the problematic drinking and spilled the beans about everything. Tomorrow I have a meeting with him to tell him everything that has happened and has been happening. Should I go through with the meeting and let him in on everything? Or should I let it slide and move on with my life. All answers are appreciated.",31Oct2020,1
29," 

My husband (29M) (lets call him Y) and I (36F) have been married for 7 years. We have a kid(3F).

Yesterday night while my husband and i were having a drunk argument he revealed that he perfectly manipulated my ex girlfriend into believing that i hated her and was already cheating on her so that he and i could be together.

8-9 years ago I used to date a woman, (lets call her G). We used to work for the same company. We were an extremely unstable couple. we used to always fight on the least important topic, used to taunt each other on small things almost everyday. it was an extremely toxic relationship, but when i dated her , i loved her nonetheless. i was dating her for almost 4 years. I saw a future with her, adopting kids yada yada. But yes our relationship was toxic. and people knew about it.

Like everyone knew how unstable we were but except some close people no one spoke to us individually about it. And one of these close people was my husband. I knew my husband ever since he was a freshman in college. he and a few of his college kids used to rent the the apartment below me. He knew a lot of people from my office because he was 1, opting for an internship there and 2, my ex was always at my place and colleagues used to come over every now and then.

Now that i can connect the dots properly, he used to talk very intimately with me , too much caring and was slowly poisoning me about my ex. with my relationship on the edge with G i started to feel caring and protective about Y. But i never cheated on her. This went on for a while, when one day finally G broke up with me with absolutely no solid reason. all she said was something like "" we both know we're toxic for each other lets end it for the better."" nonetheless I was devastated. Also became mentally vulnerable. thats exactly where my husband and I hit off.

For the longest time i know my husband is manipulative. he does it to his friends, colleagues , anywhere he can get a profit. he's pretty vocal about it to me. it never occurred to me that he could have ever done this with me as well.

After he told me that , I remember going silent for 10 secs or so. I was in a phase. i screamed at him at the top of my lungs and a few more throat tearing arguments i barely can remember since im sober. i remember that he cried. i dont think i was in a mental condition to cry. I left home that night and was at my friend's place. . numerous missed calls i didn't pick up. i went back home the very next day. i cannot stand a moment without my daughter. but i really havent spoken to him at all. im just silent.

I love him. I really do. but now i feel like our entire marriage is based on nothing but lies and traps. what should i do.

*english isn't my first language so pardon, accidentally deleted the post too, reposting*

I’m 14 and my dad is really quite drunk and when he gets drunk he can get pretty let’s say dangerous? I was heading upstairs and as I walked past the front door I saw him shut our new cats who haven’t ever been outside. I grabbed the cats and shouted at him because you know if they ran off they probably wouldn’t come back. He got really aggressive towards me as usual when he is drunk or sometimes not and went and took my PS4 as usual shouting abuse saying he will kill himself and it’s my fault or that I am scum etc. Then he kinda got in a physical fight with me (he is a lot bigger) but I am fine but he is damaging himself so much. He went and locked himself in the office laughing like a maniac muttering you aren’t any son of mine and it scares me so much because I don’t know if he is taking an overdose or about to have a heart attack. I tried really fucking hard to open the door but it didn’t work but he let my mum in. I am not sure where he is now but about 5 minutes ago I heard him in the kitchen laughing crazily but as every time he sees me when he is drunk he goes crazy and wants to kill me kind of my mum luckily stopped me as I was pumped so hard with adrenaline . I was trying to get her to go down and check on him but she believes it is better to leave him alone, she is probably right but I feel as though I have done the wrong thing but I don’t see what I should have done in this situation. Also because of this before and my dad nearly killing himself before hand sometimes I wonder if he is mad because when that happened he was shouting that he will kill him self and that I will laugh over his grave and that he wants me to feel guilty for the rest of my life. I just want some advice because sometimes I get so pumped up I can not control myself and shout for my life at him to stop but it is unreasonable to even try to talk to him. Also of course after this has been happening recently I am really on edge about him dying and I have sleeping issues now because of it and I wonder if there is anything I can do to sort this out because it makes my life a lot more miserable however my number 1 priority in life right now is to keep him safe from himself.

On weekends I wake up anywhere from 10-12 and then stay on my phone until my parents ask me if I want to go to the store or some other place, or just go on to do the other things I've listed, sometimes even do some homework.

The problem is that I feel like its a waste of time although I don't have much to do. I would like to be with my family but usually we end up watching TV without really interacting with each other.

I (16M) was forced to move from the UK, to the middle of nowhere in Ireland, just before the whole coronavirus pandemic kicked off, so I didn't go to school from March until September. Even back then I hated living here, I had no say in the matter. I liked my life living in the UK, school was going well, I had lots of friends, life in general was going great. Then I had to move to Ireland, something I was opposed to from the start. It wasn't too bad from March until September as I didn't go to school was stuck inside my house, and spent all day lounging about playing video games,etc.

Then I started my new school, I've been here for two months now and still don't have any friends, I wasn't the most talkative person in the world before, but now I find it really hard to talk to people, I'm always too nervous to go up to groups of people, it feels like I'm intruding and shouldn't be there. There's no clubs either due to covid so I can't make friends that way. I've been in the worst place mentally I've ever been in, and when I tried talking to my parents about the fact I hate it here and don't have any friends, they almost seemed angry, and told me to snap out of it.

40,"Interesting phone fwb relationship with an ex

Ok. So flashy title aside.

I have been broken up from my ex for 12 years. We were high school sweethearts that didn’t work out, hated each other, and then became acquaintances again. 3 years ago he started messaging me when he was drunk late night conversations. Which turned into mild sexting (were both into the same things sex wise that’s not very easy to find someone else who’s into it)

During the beginning months of the quarantine we got closer. Like talking about actual life shit, and being friends. Still sexting but adding a whole new element to it. 

Recently he has started asking me to actually come over (which is doable and I’ve agreed) he ends up flaking and apologizing asking for a rain check. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’m not worried about it. But the other night he calls me, very drunk, which is normal. We start the conversation off jokingly and light hearted, he then starts spiraling into being sad. Which starts him talking about when we were younger. Asking me to come over just to cuddle with him. Be there to take care of him when he’s drunk. But then it got weird. I had commented that I was hurting physically and couldn’t sleep. He asked what was wrong and I told him I wasn’t comfortable talking about it. He asked if I was pregnant and I said no, I can’t have babies. He then said “but you were pregnant with my baby” and I was like uhh yeah, I was.... which sent him in a swirl of “what if you hadn’t lost it, think of how different life would be....” and being overly sappy. 

I snapped him out of it and we moved on. 

He called me babe, baby, boo. (Which is something I do to him but I also do it to everyone) and told me he loved me before hanging up (along with blowing me a kiss)

My question is, if “drunk mouths speak sober thoughts” should I have something to worry about here? I’m not trying to make anything out of this, and I figured we were on the same page about the dynamics of our friendship (maybe I should actually have a conversation about it)",31Oct2020,1

This dude got in my head unfortunately. The super irritating part is we’ve both shared the same dream twice and I don’t know if it’s a telepathy thing or a coincidence or what but the dreams were so vivid to the point and the similarities between our dreams were way too strong. It was just showing me a future where we had kids and I was best friends with our son and my husband mentored our daughter with school. The dream was pretty detailed.

I talked to this dude when I was in jail. I’ve talked to him for countless hours when I’ve been on my ass with absolutely nothing.

He’s said that I would strongly prefer our son over him and that our son would like be really connected to me. A couple years back, I started recording videos of my life in general because I was like if I ever do have a kid, I’m gonna be such a shit storyteller. I think that’s how the bond forms. 

There’s a lot of strange stuff going on here and a lot that I would rather not get into.

So the day was normal went to school finished my day and went to the gas station with my friends, when we were walking there I saw one of my other friends whos not really the best influence, so I go up to him I'm like YOOOOOO what's up? we talk a little bit and he's with a group of people who are shit faced drunk barely walking and stoned as fuck.

Anyways he's like yo check this shit out, and pulls out a can of mace and pretends to spray me with it we laugh whatever, this is when shit starts going down hill, so he was with my friend, we'll call her Sarah, now Sarah has a big ass bottle of fucking vodka, and she's shit faced and stoned asking me if I wanna take a couple shots, I say no.

Anyways we get to this place where people usually chill and do their drugs you know, so I ask my friend with the mace, we'll call him Jack, I ask if he can get someone down here with an eighth of shrooms, he says aight I'll text my guy and I'm like bet. 

So Sarah asks me one time to drink some Vodka and I'm like fuck it, I take two big ass shots, this was my first fuck up, underage drinking, and this was some hard vodka so after two shots I was pretty fucked up, anyways my friend Jack says we have to head over to his plugs house cause he's gonna buy some edibles and re-sell them, so I go with him and a group of other people.

On the way there I start hitting Jacks vape and getting a headrush which made my drunkness get more like intense, I was wobbling in like the middle of the road and stuff just fucking around and stuff, he gets to his plugs house and waits me and the group of people walk away so the plug doesn't think he's about to get jumped.

He buys his edibles and we go back to the chill spot, it's called Narnia, anyways there's camera's around this area which is important later in this. Anyways once we there I take another shot infront of one of the cameras, and this guy shows up, we'll call him Danny, he's a chill ass dude.

He gets there with this like 14 inch steel pole that he uses for ""self-defense"", and I'm just fucking with this pole, I'm hitting garbage cans with it denting the metal, hitting out wooden fences, and I'm sure all of this was on cameras. Anyways we go over to this skate park near this place just chill.

Now Danny goes to where some construction is happening and takes a stop sign, like the entire and stop sign with the pole. And I take the pole and I'm hitting just random shit with it, and there's someone in a car watching me. Anyways people are skating in this skate park and I ask if it's okay if I throw the pole in the deep part of this like skate park pool thing, they say it's fine and no one's skating in there, so I chuck it in.

After I chuck it in a see a cop car pull up, and I was thinking ""FUCK THIS"" so my first thought is to fucking book it, but Danny said don't it would make shit worse, so I stay the cops come up to us, there was 3 of us I forgot to mention we were with this dude, we'll call him David, so the cops walk up to Danny first.

They tell him to put his hands on his head and turn around, so he does this right away because he already has 3 felonies and was threating to crack some dudes head open with the steel pipe and it was on camera, the cops search all of us, and to look innocent I offer the cops to search my backpack and they do.

Anyways they tell us why they're here ""We got a call that someone was chasing after a car with some sort of Baton and that you guys were missing with that pole thats in the skate park"" we all say something along the lines that we didn't see anything and I say yea I was missing with that pole being an idiot sorry I can put it back the cop replies Yea you can but that back in a minute.

Now I'm FUCKING SHAKING alright I'm still kinda drunk and I've vaped way more then I usually do, so I wasn't really prepared for this, the cop starts asking questions about our names school phone numbers and addressed, once they get to me I lie about my first name, my last name, my age, my address, I tell them I don't have a phone or gmail, and they point out how long it takes me to answer and I say ""Sorry nothing like this has ever happened to me before and this is like really scary and stuff ha ha"" I don't remember what he said after but then he just told us to leave the area.

Anyways we leave and go to a bench and chill and wait for my shrooms, we talk about it and they tell me I shouldve just told the truth and I barely did anything and I basically fucked myself over, and whatever.

Anyways this was a day ago and I want advice about what to do :)",31Oct2020,1
50,"My Mom is starting to get really upset with me recently for absolutely no reason. 

I usually stay in my room all day and hardly leave, because i feel uncomfortable in the place i am due to currently moving. But it seems like whenever i do leave my room my Mom always has something to yell at me about. 

She puts me down for literally every flaw i have. Whether it be something simple as in calling me fat and how i need to lose weight. Or it could be her and my dad making fun of a speech problem i have.

I typically speak loudly and a bit slower than average speed, i have no idea why. But whenever i try to speak to my parents they either yell at me because I’m too loud or mock how slow i speak. I been trying to fix it for years with no success. So them mocking me doesn’t make me feel any better about myself. 

She always used to do this, but it’s getting worse by the day. I stay in my room and don’t leave unless i need to use the bathroom, eat, or i run off with my friends somewhere. 

I don’t know if she is trying to help by calling me names, yelling, and mocking me all day. But it really hurts and I literally cry myself to sleep every night. 

What should i do?",31Oct2020,1
51,"hi everyone, i’m pretty sure i’ve posted about this roommate on here before. i need advice on a situation happening tomorrow and how to deal with it afterwards. for context, we are all students at a christian university that does not approve of drinking and parties, and this roommate likes to wave that at us at every opportunity.

my roommate (who tells every single prospective roommate that “this is not a party house”) is throwing her second party in a month. there are five of us living in the house and after her first party we are all uncomfortable with the idea of this party and have told her as much. she had several people really, really drunk at her last party and many of them left cars overnight, which inconvenienced our entire culdesac because, well, cars. we sat her down after the party and told her it got out of control and would not be happening again and she agreed. 

she’s throwing her party tomorrow night and has basically omitted information or toned down her party ideas to get us to approve, though we’ve all voiced concerns and she’s basically ignored them. she’s inviting 15+ people, providing alcohol, having a DJ, pong, and a fog machine inside the house, and we’ve overheard her on the phone acknowledging that the house doesn’t approve but she’s doing it anyways. 

because of her being sketchy, we never told her a hard no, though we very much should have. none of us like the idea of this party and, based on her track record, it’s going to get out of control. i’m going out of town and i’m incredibly uncomfortable with leaving my pets home while this goes on—one is a frog and the other is a leopard gecko and i’m very afraid that the fog machine will harm them, or party guests may trash my room. i told her as much and she said “it won’t hurt them fog machines are safe” but my research is making me very nervous for them.

my question is what should our next steps be? i don’t know how to tell her to cool it and prevent this shit from happening again. she’s moving out in december and her mindset seems to be “i don’t care i’m leaving.” i’m planning to sit her down and have a serious talk with her about respect for roommates and her blatant hypocrisy on a lot of things, not just the party. we pay rent here too and every single conflict we’ve had has been because of her. i’m also considering contacting our landlord to protect the rest of us from any possible damages, and roommates who will be home are going to have the cops on speed dial. 

if this party goes badly enough i may also talk with other roommates about kicking her out. we’ve kicked one other roommate out before for drug problems and it was a majority vote.",31Oct2020,1

Well anyways, my dad is really scary. He's overweight by about 50 pounds, and he has a big potbelly, thick thighs, and a chubby face. When he gets mad, his face turns red, his hands form fists, and he stomps around. He blames me and my younger sister for everything, even though usually it's not our fault. He yells really loud, and he lectures me non-stop. 

He also tears me problems all the time. He would purposely make a mess in the bathroom right before I have to brush my teeth or take a shower. He also stares at me in a really confrontational way, and I get nervous and uncomfortable when he does that. Or he would take a drill and deflate my car's tires 5 minutes before I have to leave the house. I don't know why he does that.

He has terrible anger issues. Whenever he's mad, he throws things around the house, and he burps and farts very aggressively. He releases loud stinky farts, and his burps smell like rotten eggs. He walks around with a baseball bat, and I just don't know when he will use it on someone. His guts are really squeaky, and he has really jiggly calves, which look creepy.

And he is super gross. Every time he eats, he eats with his bare hands, and drops food and sauce on his clothes. He often shoves food down his plate and into his mouth, and he burps every 5 seconds. At other times, he would make really disgusting faces. His face gets really wrinkled, and it looks like he just drank a whole gallon of lemon juice. He then talks in a really weird tone, and he complains about me under my breath, even though he's the one who has the hygiene habits of a 2 year old.

The worst part is that my dad wears just his underwear. His underwear has a ton of holes in them, and he has horrible breath. When my mom asks him to put on some more clothes, he just yells at her, jumps up and down, pounds his chest, vibrates his head violently, and farts around 80 times.

My dad wastes my time non-stop. I have a heck lot of stuff to do, but he clogs the toilet, breaks the shower door, and damages the microwave everyday for no reason. He then forces me to fix them, which I can't because I don't have time for that garbage. When I say no politely and calmly, he flies into a rage, and he punches giant holes in the walls, and he threatens to send me to an orphanage.

68,"


So today I decided to end it with my (25f) boyfriend (23m) of 6 months. I desperately want to go back on the decision, and I know he would take me back in an instant. 

My boyfriend/ex (I’ll call him Ben) is a gorgeous, affectionate and loving guy. We are compatible sexually, fancy eachother to death, and have the same love language (physical touch.) Ive never felt that level of affection and warmth from a man before. He’s a true feminist (not just for clout) accepting of my extremely high body count with no sign of slut shaming, and supportive of my career in online sex work. He adores me and babies me (which I love.) He’s super supportive of my mental health and isn’t jealous like lots of men are 

Unfortunately Ben has some extreme issues, including social anxiety and stubbornness, but worst of all is irrational and over the top anger to minor things on a daily basis. I don’t know what causes this, he had an abusive childhood, and has depression and anxiety, which has probably contributed. He flies off the handle at any change in routine (I wonder if perhaps he’s on the spectrum as he can’t handle change) and gets extremely paranoid and upset about things that most people would not be bothered by at any stretch of the imagination. 

Here is the the situation that went down today that resulted in my ending the relationship (for the millionth time): We were in the supermarket and he was saying he wanted a cake. He looked at the cakes and said he didn’t like the look of them. I pointed to one and said ‘what about that one.’ He then flew of the handle saying that I wasn’t listening to him, something along the lines of ‘why would you suggest a cake on the isle when Ive said I didn’t like the look of any of them, do you never listen your so annoying.’ 

I have tried to walk on eggshells to get round his ridiculous anger but I don’t see how I could possibly have avoided this situation. When he calms down, he knows how ridiculous he has been and apologised profusely. In the moment he genuinely believes his anger is justified, as his paranoia makes him think I’m being rude or undermining him when I’m not.

He is very aware that he has severe problems, and is making an attempt at getting anger management help, although due to his depression he lacks the motivation to commit to this properly. I’ve tried everything to help him, gentle encouragement, attempts to calm him down with affection and speaking calmly, trying to arrange therapy for him, but nothing is succeeding yet, although he is on a waitlist for therapy. While he isn’t violent for the most part I’m unnerved by his outbursts and moods, and still triggered by one incident when he threw stuff at me. I also struggle to deal with the impact of his depression and anxiety (for example I get very upset that he ain’t spend time with my friends) 

I know calling off the relationship is the right thing to do, and Ben doesn’t argue that as he feels I would be better off without him. But I’m devastated, and he’s devastated. We hate sleeping in bed without each other and neither of us think we will find anyone we like as much. Can anyone advise?

TL;DR me and my ex are very much in love, and I’ve never liked a man as much. However his anger issues are too much and I’ve ended the relationship. How do I stay strong when I want to go back?",31Oct2020,1
70,"I may have to cut off communication with my two older siblings, one of them a year older and the other 7 years older. They have toxic tendencies, are very arrogant and disrespectful.

And then there was Richard (fake name) we were friends sort of went to his house once. Our friendship lasted from elementary to the beginning of Middle School his parents were very bad people they smoked constantly around him he was born a few months too early because of it too he was small I had to take up from sometimes. But when he left the rest of our friend group started out casting me they no longer wanted to talk to me I never knew why.

I was told from young age that I was smart very very smart but I hated school with a passion. My hatred was Amplified when I reached first grade my first grade teacher always gave me shit and made fun of me. Left a very bad taste in my mouth entirely.

I found our im middle school that the little friends I have all talk shit about me behind there back this turned out to be a big tenancy for all the friends I made do you know how hurtful it is when you hear you're supposed friend group talkin about how they all hang out at each other's house when I talk about their group chat when you see and hear people talking about outings they had with their friends even though throughout your entire pathetic existence you were never invited no one ever asked you to come no one ever invited you every time you wanted to be included you had to pry fucking teeth and still then you were treated like an outcast. You may think hey this guy is just bluffing he's just insecure I haven't talked to one of my supposed friends since covid-19 started multiple months no words I could have died in a fucking car accident right after the school shutdown was enacted and no one would have noticed.

Me and the boy I know for some reason he's the closest thing I have to a real relationship because I know where he stands we are Frenemies one day we be shooting the shit making jokes the other day we will be beating the shit out of each other in the parking lot and then one day after a week of escalation a fight broke out in our class but the thing is all my inner resentment and Hate boiled over if it wasn't for a kid in my class I honestly thought I was going to kill him L I was tempted to head but the kid that was holding me back I just saw red. Throughout my years I learned to fake emotions I learned how to lie I learned how to do everything that involved faking friendliness and forcing a smile so we are forced in counseling.
To drive home the fact how much I hate school the kid that I got in a fight with was dragged out of the classroom by security Personnel screaming out to the top of his lungs that he wanted to fucking kill me and said this to the Vice principals face
And then we went to the counselor's office and this is where everything turned South the counselor said it was my fault I was instigating the whole time (bullshit)
According to her I looked way too smug and I sounded way too smart she thought I used big words that no one knew for the sake of sounding smarter than everyone else I don't try to I don't even think I'm better than everyone else I'm constantly sad I wake up every day knowing it's going to be the worst day of my fucking life cuz it constantly whittle's down the little hope and my happiness I have left and the drive home the fact how much I hate this fetch my friend has been in multiple fights he has been caught selling pot in school I have nothing on my record cuz I was smart enough to not get caught and then at the end of the day I got two days of in-school suspension he got two days of out-of-school suspension he considered it a fucking vacation how is that fucking Fair

I don't know how many more there's just so many things wrong with my fucking life right now and there is so many things fucking wrong with it I can write you a fucking book if I wanted to and I know this is going to get fucking buried anyway that's my life all work no outcome",31Oct2020,1

90,"My (22F) mom (60F) is recently divorced and an  immigrant and has been overworked her entire life. She refused to take anything from the divorce (pride, abuse, etc) and is a teacher teaching way too many classes and sleeping 3-4 hours a night max with no outside support. There's also no way the school could ever offload the number of classes she teaches because they would just replace her with another teacher if she asked to have her classes reduced. 

She can't stop working because she has no financial savings and has only started a real full time job with a 401k five years ago. She also has no other family in the states besides myself and my little sister. I'm so worried about her but am in a different state starting my first job out of college and can't do much else besides try to facetime her and tell her to take care of herself. She would also never in a million years take money from me if i offered to support her (again, pride and immigrant grit). 
Lately she's been sleeping so little and working so much that she tells me she can barely stand up without getting dizzy and she gets random bouts of vertigo or feels like she might pass out. I have no idea what to do and I am so worried I'm going to lose her really young.",31Oct2020,1

She also has a child like complex and has a 'know it all personality', she always wants to look at my phone, she once took my phone went on Instagram, which I have 0 posts on, I never ever post because I am insecure about what others think. She was asking 'why do you never post' and I said 'I just don't like to' and she went 'well you have a post now' and posted a picture of us both, I deleted it straight away as this was only the first week of us dating so I didn't want EVERYONE to know about itbin case anything went wrong, I did have a profile picture of us both tho... I feel as if this was because she wanted everyone to know I had a gf and didn't want any girls messaging me, but I think a relationship should always be about trust. Were both 17 and young we haven't had sex or anything yet so I haven't been using her, I buy her flowers and gifts all the time so I've treated her like a gentleman but I'm just not attracted to her.

I have moved schools right as the pandemic started and I am not allowed to be close to people as I have to social distance, which makes making friends really hard.

So my mom has recently moved back to Texas for her ""free daycare"" well she wanted me to watch the kids for her instead (due to COVID concerns) and since I wanted to get out of my exes I obliged. Well we started off really rocky, mom developed a drinking problem that got worse and worse as we went on. Any time any of her friends or me told her we could start seeing a problem developing she would just brush us off and say"" well I'm allowed to have a drink after a long days work"" but it never was "" A "" drink. It was always almost a whole bottle. Well eventually her drinking slowed down but one night about a week ago, me and my sisters and my daughter all got loaded into the car to help mom with her work one evening. Well she stops to get a liquor bottle while were out and about driving, naturally I don't support that decision but she says ""It's fine I have it under control"". Well the night goes on and she tells me she has also taken half a Xanax, we started arguing about something, so I just shut my mouth and kept quiet while I was on my phone while she was talking to me. We almost got into a accident and I look up from my phone in terror cause we have all of our babies with us and my mother says "" Yeah that's what I thought, wake the fuck up""....almost like she had fucking planned this shit. The night goes on she ends up slapping me in my face and hitting my arm... by the end of that night i was already making plan to move cause I knew that our relationship was to toxic for both of us to continue living together. So I devise a plan, and tell my mom a week later "" Listen I don't think we should live together anymore because we have both grown increasingly toxic towards each other"" she comes back with "" I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW, I JUST GOT A BRAND NEW JOB, AND YOU WANNA BAIL ON ME?! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR BEING THIS SELFISH, 90% OF THE TIME WE ARE A PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING FAMILY""..... like okay... but what about that 10%? I should just brush off the fact that we got physical the other night? … the night gets worse when she starts drinking... then even worse again when she decided to start taking Xanax  … I have video proof and voice recordings of her acting ABSOLUTELY FUCKING PSYCHOTIC.... VIDEOS OF HER SHOVING MY DAUGHTER ACROSS THE ROOM AND YELLING AT HER TO GET THE FUCK OUT. She ended up calling the cops and I had every decision to send her to jail that night but my sisters would've had nowhere to go. The cops leave and we are supposed to stay separated until my ride gets there and she comes in and starts beating my ass, I have scratches all over me, bumps on my head from her bashing my head over and over, and bruises all over my body... What do I do from here? I have already left but I am DEATHLY AFRAID for my little sisters... I don't even have all of my stuff and I definitely do not want to be around her at all. Nevertheless my main concern is my sisters, my mother attends counseling at a rehab ( clearly out-patient is NOT working out for her) . Do I call her counselor? Do I get CPS involved? Do I just forget about my sisters safety and move on with my life?  I'm just not sure what to do 😥 I should also express my fear of an investigation being launched on me as well if I do call CPS.",31Oct2020,1
95,"So me and some friends 2 girls  where meant to go to a Halloween party this Saturday and we’re looking for some cute outfits, now these girls are 3 years younger than me so I kinda did all my constant partying 3 years ago when I was there age going out every week and drinking now that I’m a lil older I don’t really like to party as much and drink as much . 

So they said let’s go out this Friday too and I’m just thinking why do we need to go out both days why cant we just go out Saturday for Halloween.

So I kept saying I’m busy Friday not sure I can come and they both acted as if I never said I was busy and that I’m coming so for the whole day they kept saying what are you wearing? What time are you meeting? And I’m thinking I’m not coming so I told one of the girls I’m not coming out because I want to save my money for Saturday because I’m having serious financial problems (not that they cared they just cared about going out...but you’d think people would understand) I just don’t see the point going out for both days and I also said to the other girl both of you go out and I will see you tomorrow.

So both girls go out and I messaged one of them on Snapchat earlier on around 11:00pm and said have you bought you’re outfit for tomorrow? (For Saturday Halloween) and she sent a voice note in a sarcasm tone saying “nah haven’t bought my outfit don’t think I’m coming I’m going to see my mom tomorrow anyway so I’m stopping at home” bare on mind these 2 girls where raging about how excited they were to go out Saturday and now all of a sudden because I didn’t come out last night? (Friday) they’re now being petty and airing my messages and saying they’re not coming out tomorrow....

Like why are girls like this? Why do people force you to go out after you tell them you want to save money or just don’t want to go?

Like thank god I have another set of friends that are all up for going out tomorrow because I would of bought a whole outfit for no reason

About 2 months ago I broke up with my ex because he wouldnt change his habits of making fun of me in public or humiliating me and my goals.
He also sexually assaulted me while in our relationship (nothing major, not to downplay assault but because for ME it wasnt that bad, it‘s just another thing he did that I didnt want, he more or less talked me into it so I gave in bc it was slightly my fault for agreeing after he asked 1028271x in a row)
After that he clinged to me and tried to be friends. I always told him off but kept light contact because he didnt really harm me (bad idea)
Over time he got more and more jealous of me and my best friend because we were really close in a short time and suddenly his behavior changed, he started yelling at me, making me feel bad about my decision and tried to guilt trip me into a relationship with him, when I refused he got mad and started to try and get my friends against me and by mixing into the community I‘m active on. I repeatly told him in a calm way to leave me alone but he wont. I‘m really scared because we just had a major argument where he told me what a bad person I am and that it‘s all my fault, that his behavior was okay because he was cheated on in the past and he needed to make sure I stay under his control. 
I called him a monster but he just shrugged it off and said that I can tell myself whatever i want.
I would block him BUT he still got my ds, which was very dear to me aswell as some money + a whale figure i gave him. And he‘s still using artwork I made (i‘m an artist, it was ab commission) which he hasnt paid for but is using it. 
I‘m confused and emotionally completely down, i want to cry and scream because my life turned out rlly good since I broke it off but now it gets back to me. I cant go to my family nor the police etc bc if I did that I would never be able to go out again or meet anyone because my family would forbid it.
I want him to delete everything about me and just leave me alone but idk what to do.

104,"All my life I’ve always wanted to be an actress/singer. I’ve always loved movies and music and they both just fascinate me. I’ve learned a lot about the industry over the years and what goes down, both bad and good, and it’s nerve-wracking but it’s still about the only thing I’ve ever truly wanted to do for the rest of my life; even if it seems like my “head is in the clouds” (my mother’s own words). I have big dreams, but I like to be realistic as well. Sometimes too much to the point where I doubt myself and think that it’s impossible to achieve (I’m prone to overthinking). There have been periods where I’ve put this dream on the back burner and I chose a psychology pre-major, over using my first two years of college to learn more about acting/singing, in order to have a “safe degree” or a “backup.” Since the pandemic has made a lot of us stuck in the house, I’ve gotten to the point where I’m sick of ignoring what I truly want to do because it’s always there in the back of my mind and I’m never truly happy unless I’m doing something that pertains to acting or singing. I like psychology a lot and I’m good at it it’s just not what I wanna do, so I’ve been contemplating changing my major to film. I don’t know how to decide to do what I really want to do while also being completely fearful of failing and ending up so broke that I wind up with no where to live. I’m terrified of failure, and I don’t care so much about living somewhere cheap and getting by. I’m terrified of not making enough to get by at all while working towards my goals and ending up homeless. That’s been one of my biggest fears for as long as I can remember. It’s hard to shake and I want so badly to hold onto my determination, but I’m afraid I’ll ruin this for myself because of my fear. I know failure is necessary for success and for learning, but the entertainment industry is very competitive and not guaranteed. I’m sure there are many of you who have felt this way before, choosing between financial stability or your passion. How have you figured it out?

Anyway there’s a girl who’s friends with a few people and they are known as the “drama squad” and I never approach them myself cause I get a bad vibe from them. Well, yesterday the one girl let’s call her Rose, mentioned that she and her boyfriend broke up (he works there to) and I guess it ended just short of three months. And I casually say “well at least you guys are being civil” and she mentioned that it’s not. That there’s problems going on. But today she mentioned after lunch that she wanted to punch him in the mouth to “get even”. 
Now me, being someone who’s been in a physically abusive relationship for four years, I didn’t like that. I mean, hell, in just a three month relationship what is there to be so upset about to get physical? 
Well I ended up going to HR about it because she said it so casually and I don’t know her, but I didn’t want to take chances if it happening or whatever. 
So I went up to him later and pulled him aside so she wouldn’t see me talking to him and I told him what she said and that I reported her to HR. And my god he looked relieved. And thankful. He mentioned she’s hit him before and he doesn’t feel like she’s joking. 
I know I did the right thing but the whole rest of the day I felt super jittery and upset. Partly cause I don’t even like the topic of domestic violence.

The only thing he expects us to pay for (since we have jobs) is our personal stuff like clothes and jewelry and gas and stuff. 
I was talking to my mother today after she was ranting about how she wants to open another bank account so that my father can’t take her money to pay for her credit card expenses. and I told her that if she wants to spend all of that money, she should be able to afford to pay for it herself (which she can, she just doesn’t want to spend her own money) and she said that her cleaning the house and cooking food was equivalent to my father paying for all of the bills and everything else in our house. She started getting mad at me for pointing out that she spends too much money and that she is disrespectful especially since my father makes so much money and she wastes so much of it. 
My father bought this very large home for my mother and he bought her a very nice car and everything and she still acts like we live hand to mouth and that he’s stupid for not doing more in his life than becoming a higher up for a very well known company/brand. She treats him like absolute shit even though he works so hard and she doesn’t see that she is just selfish and doesn’t care about being a good wife. 
The way my mother treats my father behind his back hurts my heart so much and there is nothing I can say to stop her from being so selfish. Her behavior makes me feel so sad and depressed. Advice on how to handle this type of situation. 

Summary: My father pays for everything and my mother always acts like he’s poor and that her life sucks because she has to pay for her own personal bills.",31Oct2020,1
122,"Ok, a little context here, I live in Shanghai where covid is pretty much not a thing anymore, so that's why kids are allowed to go out trick or treating. 
 I am a 15 year old guy who loves going out on Halloween.  The problem is, I look older that I am and I'm pretty sure I can't go trick or treating anymore.  I don't want to stay home, 
 so I decided I would wear a cloak and a scary mask and go out to give candy to kids.  The thing is, how do I tell children that I have candy to give out without breaking out of character?",31Oct2020,1
123,"I am lazy. I want to loose weight and be a better person but I choose to consume my day but helping everyone else around me. I need help, to be held accountable. I'd pay money, download apps and am even at the point where I'd follow toxic rules to obtain my goals (yes that within itself is lazy, would cause more harm in the long run and I should be seeking better but I'm so low that I'm willing to accept what I can get.) I choose to care for two people who suffer from various mental and physical disabilities because things work out better when I help them. One is my partner and one is my little brother. We all live together.

I need help. I need guidance. I need to be better. I'd pay for guidance. I'm in my late 20s. No kids. I work. I'm so desperate to be better: loose weight, speak less (always causes me issues ever since high school), present myself better,  accept people telling me my faults better and not addressing others issues in retaliation and in general saying as little as possible...

124,"I work in the service industry and I own my own business. The other day I got offered by this woman to do services for her wedding which would be happening on an airplane. I was, of course, very happy about this. I just recently started doing my business full-time (after about 4/5 years of doing it with a part time job), so this job would’ve brought in a significant amount of money to be able to actually put food on the table next week.

The lady asked me if I could do her engagement as well as her wedding. Her engagement, she said, would be happening as soon as he got off the plane after landing back in the states. They’d see each other for the first time ever and get married only two months later. Incredibly sweet stuff but it’s a massive leap of faith. The woman even described it as such over the phone- she was clearly in love with this man.

When we discussed pricing, she was perfectly ok with my quote because she said that the man was “extremely set” financially.. telling me that I’d absolutely be paid. However, there came issues when I told her I’d need payment before I actually service these days. Turns out, the “army guy”  actually has some sort of issue with his bank account that’s making it so he can’t send her money. I’m not going into the -why- for the sake of some privacy for the woman in the very small chance she reads this, but she’s struggling to pay bills at the moment after some unfortunate circumstances. However, she’s able to pull money together to send her S2B “cards” or prepaid cards for communication and for travel back home. Major red flag here obviously for the Army man. Since the woman didn’t have money, she couldn’t put down a deposit for the booking days.. which means I cant do the services for her per my policies. So, I asked the woman for his phone number to see if he could pay me via online invoicing and she actually gave it to me! I was very surprised when he responded via text. I’m not sure how advanced number spoofing can be, but I really did text him first.. and his area code is in my hometown. He told me just as he told her.. he wasn’t able to access his account until he made it back home. The war camp was dangerous and he “couldn’t access his money” due to issues with his bank account.

To me.. this is incredibly obvious the woman is being scammed. There is a slight chance that this entire thing is legitimate and I could look bad. Being a business owner I need to be careful, but I’m also human as this woman is. Does she deserve to know from me, or do I let her find out the hard way? It’s impossible I could get scammed from this situation because I have a deposit requirement, so this is really all about this woman I feel so sad for. She’s grabbing straws of a relationship that feels like a fairytale but really has a dark center to it.

Extra question:
Is there a way to track a phone number down to see who owns the number..? I know you can google it, but that didn’t really work with this number. Is there a database for military? Any sort of way to confirm this to be fake 100% and figure out who’s doing this?",31Oct2020,1

And yes I am in high school(ik the stereotypes I watch sitcoms, yes I can see you eye-rolling) if that helps, and a freshman. And yes I have traveled to other subreddits but that didn't help since it is quite hard to meet new people since social distancing.

I am exercising and eating healthier, and I do feel great but afterwards I still suck. It is definitely better than before but still sucks. Also I have a VERY hard time to open up emotionally like the only times I get emotional is in my bed with my head in a pillow. Another thing which happened was that I commented on some post, and someone replied with ""Some chick that hot would never talk to you IRL"" and for some reason that broke me, I cried(discretely), and I have no idea why that comment would break me. I'm fine now, but whenever I think of it, a little bit of me dies inside. And when texting someone(not a close friend) I always re-read what I typed and get scared after I send it.

For the most of highschool I faked my report cards and got really bad mental health while trying to keep up the facade of an semi straight A student and failing on every way possible (i moved states to go to highschool because my native state schools are trash, therefore I pulled it off quite easily). At the end they my parents found out and it was really bad. Still, they are great people and agreed to let me finish highschool and enter University, i picked a career (that after a year and a half I don't like as much anymore) and succeeded on my first semester. Last semester got interrupted by COVID-19 and with the coming of Online clases i messed up and started failing again, this semester I tried hard to fix my issues but alas I'm losing interest in my career choice and I'm failing three of my six classes. Today my parents found out I was failing again and are rightfully angry as all hell. Now. I'm from out of the states, however I am an American citizen with perfect english, i need advice beacise nobody I know wants to speak to me anymore, I'm planning on ""escaping"" with my savings and move to another country (USA) and cut all connection with friends and family as to not disappoint anyone anymore.

I know that I’ve grown up with that mentality that I always have to be better than the girls in my group, ALTHOUGH I KNOW ITS A WRONG AND BAD WAY OF THINKING, its just an automatically thought that comes up when I have to deal with girls in a group. :/ (I’m trying to change that now because I don’t really think it’s correct seeing other girls as my competition.)

The question with my best friend is that she always had everything I wanted (makeup, loyal friends, a bedroom for herself, pretty clothes, and now she has a car, she goes to the college and she has a good job that pays her well.)  

I’ve been thinking about this quite a lot lately because although she has almost everything I wanted I don’t really know if I feel jealous because I really like her, we are best friends since 2017 and we talk like everyday and I really want to see her happy with her life and wish her the best always.

sometimes she is kinda cocky, like “I’m the cutest ever, there’s nobody like me” and it kinda makes me mad. (Idk if that’s normal for not liking her cocky side or if it’s jealousy) 
And when she talks about the things she has and I realize I don’t have any of it, even being older than her :/

134,"I really struggle with consistently brushing my teeth. As a kid, the practice wasnt pushed, and the one time it was my very abusive mother told me to stand on a singular tile and brush my teeth till she told me to stop. I brushed for the duration of a movie. There was vomit on the tooth brush, my gums were bleeding, it was a REALLY bad experience. 

Due to it, I actually stopped brushing entirely. I was taken by cps when I was 10 and had 10 teeth pulled for cavities. While youd think that this would instill into my brain that brushing = good and not brushing = bad, I somehow came to the conclusion that brushing = bad and dentist = bad and they both had teeth in common ... so teeth = bad.

Ive on and off brushed my teeth in the 10 years following. 

I tend to neglect it when I am in a hurry, or when Im depressed. I need to be better about this but I need help on where to start. I try to have set plans and set time aside to do it but in the end that emds up failing.

I'm very childish. I have obsessive tendencies (not over people.) For example, I still watch cartoons. I love Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I have and know everything that has to do with them. I still want to dress up and Trick or Treat for Halloween, but I'm too old, and have no friends. 
I am dealing with a serious case of unrequited love. I've been in love with someone I can never be with for about 2 years now. I need to move on. The problem is, I can never tell them how I feel because of the circumstances. If I could do that, it'd be easier to let go. But I can't. And I also cant avoid them to have space for a while. What do you suggest I do to move on? Its painful hanging on for so long and I no longer want that pain. 
2) I am struggling in school. I have no shred of motivation to complete any work. I dont know why. I know it's for my future, and there will be punishment if I dont do it, but I just cant bring myself to. It's not that I'm dumb either. Even when I do try, I always cant focus.

So far, my grievances have been: finding dog shit (multiple times), trash, alcohol bottles, a broken baby crib, an actual homeless person, food, and cigarette butts in the stairwell, a punched-in hole in the wall, getting charged $15 for a light bulb change (which I would have done myself if I knew they were going to charge me), towing expired-plated cars in the garage (I didn't have time to get them replaced between having an essential job and Covid), broken pipes leaking in the hallway, broken door to the outside that anyone can use to get into our ""secured"" building, broken elevators, screaming neighbors that pound on the doors, including mine, eggings, thefts (someone had their deceased mother's jewelry stolen out of their car in the ""secured"" parking garage), someone getting shot in the alley right behind the apartment, on top of so much else. I have felt unsafe here multiple times. Not to mention the area is surrounded by homeless people. The only amenity it has is a tiny gym.

After, they did quiet down for a bit and there were still loud noises here and there but I didn't want to make a fuss about it again. I thought they were genuinely trying.

However, tonight, they're are even louder than they were before (probably because Halloweekend). I plan on sending this to management again as I already recorded video evidence for tonight.

I don't want to go upstairs and knock because I admit I am non-confrontational but at the same time I don't feel like they were being sincere with their apology letter and don't really care that we already filed a complaint. I don't think that direct confrontation would do much and they would continue being loud &amp; obnoxious afterwards.

That being said, I live with my S.O. and we're very quiet people. We are both non-confrontational and we do not know what to do. 

If I send this to management, what are the chances they actually take this seriously?

The only place I’ve ever worked is at a grocery store as a part time cashier, but I’m planning on working there full time. 

So my main questions are:

If anyone has an experience working at Ross as a cashier, what is it like?

What is the dress code for female cashiers?

Any advice for the actual interview would also be great. 

Is it difficult getting used to working there? Like as far as their registers are? Are there any quirks as far as working there goes? (Like weird rules about being late, how you act, etc.)

Thanks in advance",31Oct2020,1

159,"Hi all first time posting here. On mobile sorry. (Also keep in mind I’m pregnant so no drinking)

So last year all my close friends cancelled last minute on me so I had to cancel it and sobbed to my bf the whole night. Real depressing. Told myself for this years bday (my 21st) I’d do something special and big for myself. 

My original plan was to go stay in my city’s famous hotel with my bf in the famous haunted room (I’ve asked this for my bday every year, haven’t gotten it as it’s pricey which is ok) go to a Van Gogh exhibit my city has rn and then wanted to do a wing night with friends. 

Before full lockdown we were only in a semi lockdown so we were going to go to my bf’s parents place and see his fam for a wing night. 

Unfortunately due to a spike today we’re in full lockdown &amp; my bf and I have to stay in, I thought I’d buy all my fav foods &amp; snacks (and cravings lol) and we’d go for a nice walk. But other than that I’m not sure (also not sure if bf has any ideas/surprises he’s keeping from me) 

Any ideas appreciated as I easily get emotional and the waterworks don’t stop easily with these hormones and I don’t want to get like that again on my bday",31Oct2020,1

161,"I'm (21m) currently living with my mom (49f) and brother (24m) in a one bedroom apartment.

My brother is intellectually challenged and even though he's 24 physically, he has the mental capabilities of about a teenager. Over the past 2 years he's been prone to having outbursts of rage caused my him to either verbally or physically attack my mother and I when he doesn't get what he wants. 

My mother has been a struggling alcoholic since high school I guess. But it wasn't really apparent to me at that time. I knew she drank and I would come home to her being drunk (ignorance is bliss I guess). Since covid began in the states it hits us hard. 

I dropped out of college last fall semester because of my mental health and got a job. I'm going to go back but know I need to focus on myself first. Because of covid, I lost my job and moved back home in August. I thought I could help my mom move out of her current place and we all could get a much nicer, bigger place. But there's not a lot of options at the moment.

For these past few months the days and nights have been filled with nothing but dredd. My mental health has since declined further. My brother and mom keep getting into yelling matches that tend to get physical. Making me call the cops on several occasions. Everytime my brother says he's sorry and that he'll change but he same things keep happening. He refused to take medication because it makes him drowsy and feel like a vegetable. He's taking edibles and that helps but occasionally won't listen when we try to regulate him. He's only supposed to take 1 but takes 2 because he doesn't realize it takes awhile for them to kick in.

 Also my mother is constantly drinking. She said she was weening herself off the alcohol and I am supportive of her. Although, she isn't keeping to her word and is getting drunk everyother day. Causing her to yell at my brother and I taking shit about us. I can hear her crying at night about how her life sucks, that we suck and she wished she didn't have us. She makes fun of me because I don't know how to drive and how she stole her mom's car at 14. Idk it's just become very toxic since being here. I've cried more these past months than I have these past few years. Even when my brother is doing fine with no problem she yells at him causing him to get mad and basically a fight ensues. 

Also I think politics have heavily affected her drinking and toxicity towards my brother and I. I mean this year's not great. Not one bit. She's accused me of going to vote for trump saying I don't care for her or my brother's rights. I'm not and I'm disgusted by the fact she thinks I will. Granted I don't voice my political opinions out loud like her  but I am not a trump supporter. Never have been. 

I mentioned I'm thinking of moving out next year but that was a mistake. She yelled at me saying, ""I'm not going to wait for you to make up your mind. When I move out I'm gone. Now, you and your dad will need to figure out what to do"". My dad's not really in the picture. He and my mom haven't been together since 2007. She hates him basically. We only saw him on weekends. My brother is close with him but I am at a distance. We had a falling out last summer and reconnected in January this year. 

I want to move out but she says I'm leaving her with a problem and that I'm taking the easy way out. I know I'm not the best brother and that I can/should do better. I know my brother isn't at fault. Not entirely. He sees and interprets the world differently. But between his outbursts and her drinking/constant yelling... I can't take it. 

Honestly, don't know if I explained my situation very well. There's a lot to unpack here since it's been building up for years but because of covid things are imploding. 

Tl;dr: basically my family is falling apart. Brother is intellectually challenged prone to outbursts of rage. Mom is an alcoholic with a toxic personality. I want to move out but don't know what to do. Need advice.",31Oct2020,1
162,"21 M. I understand I have my own issues, sometimes being too critical/ sometimes bad at getting other's mood, etc.

I've kind of reached a last straw with my mother. I don't hate her, it's just like her behavior is something I can't handle. I'm in last year of college and living with her since COVID allowed remote learning and save money at home. 

My parents moved to a new house and my mother took up my older sister's room (who's not living here), just living in there. I was trying to talk to her about harder topics, but she just thought she was being attacked. 

*I can only help myself.* 

Not going into detail but I tell her to stop and she just keeps talking, angry about anything. And then I closed my door and she kept banging and screaming against it, I thought she was going to hurt herself so I opened the door, and she talked at me for like an hour or two. 

I love and respect my parents but I'm also healing through my own hurts so I can't handle the behavior.

My mother took it personally so she think it isn't her responsibility that life is this way, or the victim mentality ""everything is my fault!!"" if she will continue to berate and talk over my viewpoints and talk to me like an object, then that's not OK. My father may take it personally too and view it as me cutting away from the family. It's just that I might need them but they hurt me too much. I know I did the same sometimes but at least I'm reasonable. And I did tell my mother I couldn't live here and she forced me at first. She just thought she was right, and if not it was other's responsibility to sit with her and hold her damn hand long enough until she 'understood' with her inhibited empathy. 

I need time and resources to heal myself.

My mother took an argument personally and isn't supporting the rest of my final college year, but that isn't the main worry since I have money in savings.. it's more like mentally having to face myself. Having to find sources of support in different areas. I have trouble like finding people I could trust and harder issues I would discuss with my mother or father in the past. Just not having that anymore, is going to be hard. It makes me feel like my life until this point was kind of a lie, and I guess that's what happens going through personal change. 

So how to take care of myself when I go away. I'm definitely going to be easily hurt to begin with. So I'm moving out like next week, I've tried and failed before. I can't help around here, not responsible for what happens. Trying to make right from wrong.",31Oct2020,1

I understand that he's overweight and lonely, so feeling liked by a girl probably means the world to him. But this is just.. It isn't good.


He's spent almost $1,000 dollars on a girl he's never even met in real life, he won't sleep and his mother is worried sick, he'll lose it if you say anything bad about her, and if I say something then I'm sure he won't talk to me. He won't listen to anyone, even though his friends have brought their concerns to him multiple times.


Another note, he's very lazy and unhealthy. He eats way too much and does way too little. He's told his friends his heart skips a beat when he does too much, but he won't listen to anything about that either.

After that for few days she wasn't replying properly, like she was only giving 3-4 replies per day. It continued for a week and on the weekend, i asked her what she wants and to reply to me. She said she doesn't know anymore, she said she doesn't know whether she loves me or not, she said she doesn't feel or think anything. she said she was tired of everything, including me i guess (she's always busy with projects and assignments too). When she said she doesn't know whether she loves me or not, i panicked that she'll leave me and i started begging and crying for her to not leave me, and i promised her I'll change myself too.

She doesn't feel neither sad or happy, she said she's tired of everything. she doesn't think or feel anything anything, she doesn't have motivation or drive to do anything. i asked her if she still does her assignments, she said that's what she always do even when she's lazy because she doesn't have a choice. i asked her if something happened in the family or with the lecturers but she said nothing happened. No matter what i ask what is going on she says nothing is going on. i offered her to help with her assignments to lessen her work multiple times but she keeps saying it's fine. she stopped replying after that. i keep saying i am here for her and I love her and I'll help her with anything. is this depression or what? please help me. i feel so much pain when she ignores me but i see her posting on IG. i know she doesn't feel like talking but i want to talk to her and be with her. what should i do? how should i help her? she doesn't have anyone to talk to or share things besides me, but she's not talking to me or sharing anything to me. im worried about her mental health. and im also worried about her. i feel so anxious and im also scared she'll leave me. but i want to be for her and help her.

She shares everything to me. Who her crush is, how her school friends treat her, and how abusive her family is towards her. Tbh, I am afraid that she will find this and ask me if she is really that of a bad person and do something to herself.

She has shown me the texts with her crush but that could easily be photoshopped, right? Why didn't she sent me a picture with him? Why does he 'respects' us and doesn't say anything when we are talking on the phone and he's beside her?

Thinking back I had asked Jane to close all the checks while i was doing some closing work in the kitchen. She had apparently taken that opportunity to take my tables money, delete the check, and pocket the cash. 

The problem here is there are no cameras in the restaurant so there is no way to prove what happened. We share all the tips and use the same code so we both have access to all the tickets. 

Now I'm worried my boss won't believe me and I might lose my job because someone else was greedy.

182,"This is a throwaway account. I’m a 24 year old autistic man. I am on the lower end of the autistic spectrum. Currently I’m going to college and hope to be independent soon. But for now I live with mom and dad. The autism does affect my social skills and cause me to act strangely sometimes.

I walk around my hometown (population 5,000) daily for fitness. I tend to walk fast and with my head down. Generally I avoid others so I will cross the street if I’m about to meet somebody. I also don’t like meeting cars at an intersection. So if a car comes to the stop sign the same time as me, I’ll walk the other way then when they’re gone, I’ll turn around and walk back.

I’ve had the police called on me a few times during my walks. I’ve been detained by police and questioned. I always get so scared. I don’t want to hurt anybody or steal from anybody. I’ve never intentionally broken a law on my life. They ask me what I’m doing and ask if I’m on probation. They run my ID. Then they let me go. I’m afraid it’s just a matter of time before I get arrested.

It’s so scary! I can change some of my habits, but many are a natural part of my autistic self. I don’t mean to act “suspicious,” it’s just how I am.

How can I avoid having the police called on me?",31Oct2020,1

185,"Hello!
So I’m not sure if i’m overreacting or overthinking everything. But I need advice on how to approach this. Sorry for the long read.

We were assigned to groups by the instructor, which is one of the things I hate - it’s always a hit or miss. Anyways, I don’t really mind it but some of the people of worked with in group projects are horrible. I made a group chat with the 4 of us on FB after we were assigned to groups to get us to start talking. If I didn’t I would probably completely forget about this assignment, until the very last moment. I’ve been trying to do my best in school so I’ve been trying to be on top of everything since this is an accelerated program. 
I’ve been messaging to try to get started on this project, because the main thing is to pick a topic and decide who does what. I’ve tried to pick weekends that we don’t have much due, or after exams to message about the project. But it’s stressing me out that they read my messages and reply to some messages but then leave me on read. 
There’s one girl (A) that’s specially reading the messages but not replying whereas the other two agreed when I asked to call over the weekend, on Saturday. (Side note: I asked if they preferred texting or calling or in person.) I thought maybe that one girl is the type to agree to plans after the plan is made so I asked one of the girls (B) to pick a time since she had a preference. She read it and there was no reply. I was available for the whole day assuming maybe they would pick a time. At that time, I understand that the project was still due in over a month and a half but I knew of other groups who already started and finished (because it was easy).
I constantly try to think of what I did wrong and why they might not be responding but it’s stressing me out. I don’t even message them every week — once every two weeks at most!!! 
During the in-person labs, all I can do is feel angry at girl A, which is causing some tension but I could feel that she knows!
I talked to girl B because she eats with me and a couple other people and I asked if she could message the group last week and she said she would. She didn’t.
This week we have 4 exams so I was going to message them next week after all of it is over, but I thought that maybe the problem last time was because it was so rushed. We made the “plan” to call on Saturday, on Friday. I also thought maybe this isn’t the best platform for them to answer on. So, I decided to message them yesterday - to ask about changing the platform and to say that I was just messaging to maybe start setting up a future available date. 
But there’s only been one answer from girl C.

It’s due in ~20 days with nothing done. This is a program that is full of people of different ages and backgrounds. Not sure if it’s because they just graduated from high school and their work ethic might not be as extreme as mine? I recently just graduated from university so I think maybe their viewpoints are different in terms of work.
But I can’t stop thinking about what I’m doing wrong and if I’m doing something wrong? This project has been such a stressful burden, I can’t stop thinking about it.

TLDR; Non-responsive group members for a term project. I’m the only one initiating anything (given I’ve been occasionally messaging every so often to try to start on the project since September, with the project due in November).

188,"I have a super outgoing friend that has basically disappeared off the face of the earth. After a month of no one (multiple friends) hearing from him I decided to contact his brother there has been other efforts as well and we all get the same response of he's ok and he'll get back to us. Sorry if this is a bit all over the place. I'm worried and I don't know what to think. He is the most outgoing person I know and literally everyone is concerned any advice would be great. 

So here are the facts that have made me suspicious:

. Last time anyone I've been able to get a hold of him was September 26. He also called me that day and was upset and told me he'll be taking a step back from everything for a while after dropping out of school. He was very nervous and hadn't told his parents.

. His phone is disconnected and his sisters phone has also been disconnected. 

. A few months ago one of his family members found out he was gay and he comes from a country where people are often killed by others or imprisoned by the government for being gay. Nigeria

. One of his friends told me that he was told by the brother that he was in the hospital. They decided to call 5 hospitals in the area and couldn't find anything. 

. His brother seems to be dodging my questions. [text between his brother and I.](https://imgur.com/gallery/hSR0rZF) today was the first day I contacted him. I called him and he told me he was ok. When I asked if I can see him on video chat he told me he was at the grocery store and would call me after. I didn't get the call back and texted him instead. He didn't claim it was a family affair until I asked. 

. Apparently a friend of his attempted to do a wellness check on him and was greeted by the brother that wouldn't let him in. 

. Today I had the sheriff do a welfare check on him. There was no answer at the door and of course they call the brother and he tells them he's fine. And I'm told if the family wants to disclose they will. 

So my question is what should I do next? Is he in rehab? Has something happened to him? Should I higher a private investigator? Can I file a missing persons report?",31Oct2020,1
189,"My mom and this guy were together for roughly ten years. First five were great, last five were on and off after she found he cheated on her with his ex.

During the last year they were together, I (14M at the time, now 22M) helped with his email and found a notification from Zoosk.

This ate me up for weeks. I was scared that he was going to retaliate like he did with my younger brother in a similar situation. But luckily, I didn't have to say anything because they broke up anyway soon after. That was in 2012.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while, he disappeared from most of our lives for like a year or so. Then slowly, he and my mom made amends and became friends, which I didn't have a problem with. But as of lately, they've been spending the night at each other's places and my mom randomly asked me what I'd think if they got back together.

I told him if he couldn’t control his dogs they needed to be leashed. He yelled at me and said they were his dogs and he didn’t need to. Long story short I told him he was breaking the law and he said he couldn’t guarantee what happens. 

He always puts up Halloween decorations. This year he put a box over our porch lights to make his yard darker. He didn’t ask we just came home to a light that “wasn’t on”. He also draped some curtains or something over our iron fence that had just been painted a few days ago. Our contractor even told him not put anything on the fence because it would take a few days to cure. He’s rude and entitled and the fence is completely ours. 

I don’t want to start anything because as I mentioned he’s rude and belligerent. Our contractor also said he’s come over to rant a few times about political things and he doesn’t social distance and he just reeks of booze. If I start something, he has nothing but money and time but I’m tired of putting up with his letting his dogs poop on our lawn and just generally disrespecting our property.

191,"The past couple weeks, I've been using a study room/lounge room at my old university to do some work, and I've been chatting with a custodian that I used to see when I attended the university. He is so kind and I've enjoyed getting to talk with him while he gets water or cleans the trash. 

I've been using the room a lot recently, I think I'm 1 of 3 people that have used that room in the past couple weeks, and I wanted to give him a small gift to thank him. I'm not sure about other cultures, but I live in Hawaii, and before, it was quite normal to thank people by gifting them a small, yummy snack. Gifting food was a small way to show appreciation and build a connection without being too extravagant. However, I'm hesitant to offer him any food because of the pandemic, but I'd still like to thank him. 

Do you have any suggestions on something I could give him to show my gratitude? Is there something besides a gift that I could do to show appreciation or make his job easier or his day brighter? Thank you!!",31Oct2020,1

193,"Title says it all, kinda. 

I work in a group home and I have one overnight shift a week that I love. It works with my schedule and I’m trying to pick up more as I work on getting into grad school. I got this shift because the employee who worked it retired.

Today that employee announced she is coming out of retirement and plans to start working with us again early next year. My boss confirmed that she was all set to do so provided covid doesn’t throw things off, but didn’t give any details about her schedule. 

I’m worried that because she is coming back, has seniority over me (she was originally in a management position), and is well-liked, they will give her that shift back and put me on day shifts, which I don’t like and they don’t quite fit the availability I’m working towards. I used to work days so I’m trained in the responsibilities that come with them, and they need day staff, so that adds to my worry. 

Can they do that? How can I advocate to keep that shift without nagging?",31Oct2020,1

202,"I'm 25 and a fine artist and graphic designer. I've been designing professionally (For clients) since I was 15, and doing fine art seriously for the last three or four years. I'm absolutely talented, and I've pleased all the clients I've had and am usually pretty happy with my work, but I've never ""taken off"". My design business has always been either very bottom of the barrel work, or one good project every few months. It's been far from consistent no matter how hard I've worked. It's literally never been a stable living for me. And my god, I've been busting my ass for 10 years trying to drum up business. I've never been above the US poverty line.

As for fine art, pretty much nobody gives a fuck about what I make. No attention on it, networking is impossible for me (feels like people just don't wanna connect with me) and it rarely sees any traction. Again, I work insanely hard at my art as well. 

I spend probably 10 hours a day honing my craft and trying to either get work or get better at what I do. I'm so defeated lately. I can't get an ounce of attention on any of my work, and it feels like nobody wants to work with me, despite having a lot of really good and credible work (I've done stuff for Fortune 500 companies and trending brands). 

I read all the business books, do all the classes, watch all the YouTube videos, and follow all the instructions and I just always fall flat. It's starting to feel like it's just not meant to be. I can't even get a design job even below my worth or ability. 

I have several friends that have tried a new art project or business idea and they love it and it takes off in a month. It seems like people just find the ""right"" thing and their passion carries them exponentially forward and upward *quickly*. That's never been the case for me.

Is it time to give up? Should I just put this to the side and try new things? It's hard because my dream is to be"" the 21st century Andy Warhol"" (AKA hyper popular artist with a team or employees and collaborators), but man, it just feels like that's never gunna happen. I've worked so hard and so much and for nothing. 

How do you know when it's time to give up? I don't want to keep wasting my time and life if there's something else out there that I'm meant to do, because I'll never find it at this rate. But I also don't want to give up if I'm somehow on the right track.",31Oct2020,1

I’m worried that what happened to me wasn’t violent enough for anyone to care. That reporting it was a mistake and I should have moved on. 

It’s becoming a nightmare. I’m under scrutiny from investigators, they seem to think I overreacted and I’m doing this to punish the guy. 

What should I have done? Was this just a big waste of time? I need outside opinions. I’m inclined to think that it is.",31Oct2020,1
219,"Me and my boyfriend have a good relationship. its all great when there are no conflicts but it gets really bad when we fight. I have an INFP personality, so i hate conflicts and I avoid confrontation which can be an issue. I don't know what my boyfriend's personality type is but he is definitely a thinker and is more practical and honest with whatever he does or say. He cannot sugarcoat things he has problems with and sometimes even though he has good intentions comes off as bluntly honest. I am a very emotional person, sometimes a little too emotional but I am working on it, but sometimes when we fight or argue and when he gets mad(he is a bit short tempered) he says things he does not mean and I understand that later. But in the moment I take things too personally and get defensive and start fighting back, trying to defend myself and sometimes completely forgetting the point of the argument. When we get calmer, we talk it out again after like a day or two and then I understand what he was trying to say, cause then even he gets calmer and it does not feel like he is attacking me anymore and instead trying to explain me. But till then we both have already said some pretty hurtful words to each other and some damage is already done. I am a very peaceful person most of the time and I always avoid fights. I know my boyfriend has trouble controlling his anger sometimes and I feel like when he is mad, he tries to avoid talking to me but I for some reason feel so attacked by whatever he says that I push him more to talk to me in that state of anger and I feel like I basically push him to say hurtful things in the moment of anger. I don't know how to control this. I don't even understand how I take things ""personally"" sometimes and get so defensive until later. What should I do or how should I think to avoid this. How do I keep myself calmer during such situations to avoid such fights?

tl;dr : How do I not get defensive and feel personally attacked when fighting with my boyfriend. He is someone who has a bit of a hard time controlling his anger and I feel like I kind of push him to talk to me in that angered state just because I feel hurt and get scared of the worst. I kind of fail to give him the space to calm down and he ends up saying hurtful words which he doesn't mean. How do I control my feelings and stay calmer during these situations?",31Oct2020,1

So really what I'm saying is it's hard for me to relate to anyone who isn't as...damaged?...as me. 

The pain I've faced and continue to face has hardened me, and I'm not sure how I can get back into the socializing mindset.

However, the minute I come home I am in a negative space where the thoughts and overthinking come rushing in. I second guess every single sentence I have ever said and overthink every social setting to the point where I think I am obnoxious or annoying (and maybe I am bc I am compensating for something). I feel like the simple solution is to understand that I am enough and trust my actions because I always am genuine and authentic, but I cannot shake off the thought that I am a failure in every single social setting.

224,"For context, I am Korean American born and raised in the US, early 20s female, and diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. 

My ability in speaking/reading Korean is intermediate. My vocabulary is a little weak as there are many Korean words I don’t use in my daily life as I live in the US and mostly speak English. I just took a Korean language placement exam for my college and did not do so well on the vocabulary section. I asked him some questions on what were the correct meanings of some of the words I did not know after the exam and after answering a few of my questions he got annoyed and told me he wasn’t going to help me anymore that it’s my fault for not knowing because I don’t read books in Korean. This makes me so angry because I grew up in the US, never formally studied Korean in an academic setting before. Korean has never been offered in my middle or high schools. The books I have read are of course mostly in English because every subject is taught in English. My whole life is centered around the English language other than when I am with my parents so how is it my fault that I have not been granted opportunities to read Korean books? 

Even though I know this, it makes me feel ashamed to be someone of Korean heritage but can’t speak my language fluently. It also makes me hate the fact that I live in the US because as a result I know little about the Korean language and if I had just been born and raised in Korea, I wouldn’t have this problem.  I’ve never felt truly American nor Korean. I’ve been made fun of for eating Korean food at lunch, listening to K-pop, and wearing my clothes in a more trendy Korean style (which is slightly more eccentric than American fashion). When I visited Korea, I also found it difficult to have deep conversations with my relatives as I don’t know how to say complex words or phrases. I also receive a bit of a culture shock each time with things like Korean ways of being polite - Small gestures like receiving things with 2 hands, always bowing to elders when greeting, and denying some compliments to show humility (thanking constantly makes you seem self-centered). When I forgot to do these things, I got yelled at by not only my parents and relatives, but by elderly strangers in public. If I had grown up in Korea, this would be a norm for me and wouldn’t have to think about this. I feel depressed about all this but I do know it’s not my fault

How can I get my dad to understand that this is not my fault and just a result of the environment I grew up in?",31Oct2020,1

I was here not too long ago venting out my frustrations about my friends and girlfriend drinking. I am 16 and she is 15, so this all already a bit whack. I had a big ol chat with my girlfriend and we were finally on the same page. Well...

After possibly the shittiest week of my year, me and my girlfriend had planned a nice weekend together so I could unwind and we could spend some nice time together and celebrate our recent 9 month anniversary. I was stupid excited especially since itd been a while since we've hung just the two of us.

But alas nothing seems to be going my way this week. She was invited to a party by someone she actually hates, and has now cancelled our weekend plans to get drunk, and smoke weed there at his house with some others. I told her it was fucked up to cancel the plans to hang with someone she hates, especially since she cancelled the today, the day we were meant to meet. She responded by telling me I'm overreacting and that she doesn't understand why I care so much.

Is she right? She told me just the other day she doesn't want to drink anymore, and now everything is different and she's treating me like an overprotective parent. Is it unreasonable to care?",31Oct2020,1
233,"So, today, me(20m) got into a fight with my brother (24m). I shouldn’t call it a fight, because I didn’t really fight back. I mean, the guys mentally unstable and carries a gun 24/7, so I didn’t wanna risk my life. He works for the same company as my mom and since covid has been working from me and my mom’s house, and has been emotionally abusing her for the past 6 months. I became desensitized to it, since they’ve always argued and yelled at each other my whole life. I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital about a week ago, and only after 5 days of having three therapy sessions a day did I come back and realize how toxic of an environment it was. My mom would stay in her room for an extra three hours a day because she didn’t want to go out into the living room and “have to deal with him”. Neither of us are allowed to make any noise while he’s working. 8 hours a day. 5 days a week. He’s constantly yelling at her and complaining about his job, yelling and slamming his desk sometimes. We have tried to get him into therapy, but he isn’t willing. Anyways, today, as I was getting water from the sink(next to his desk) he angrily shuts the water off as I’m filing up the cup. I didn’t say anything, I just turned it back on. He then grabs the cup, dumps out the water, and throws it across the room. I still didn’t say anything as I’m going to pick up the cup. He says “don’t do that shit while I’m working” I asked him why and he said “it’s too fucking loud.” I said “it’s fucking water, How is that too loud” he goes “It’s too fucking loud. Don’t do that shit again” and this, along with all of the anger I had pent up from him making my mother feel like a prisoner in her own room, and when she’s working they constantly get into arguments when she’s trying to help him, the fact that I’m not allowed to get water in my own fucking house, I threatened to punch his monitor. He said “Do it. I dare you. I fucking dare  you.” So I punched his monitor. It goes toppling on his desk. He then comes into the kitchen where I’m standing and punches me in the jaw, puts me in a choke hold and throws me at my room. After a LOT of yelling, my mom FINALLY kicked him out. I want to add that she’s threatened to kick him out multiple times, only to be sweet talked into a second chance. He then threatened to take our two dogs (who we basically share custody with) and never allow us to see them again, if my mom actually followed through with not letting him work here.",31Oct2020,1

He was trying to tell me he was upset while in voice chat with this person and I didn’t think it was serious as all. He said the other person was rude, and he felt uncomfortable with me and this person I hardly know “flirting”. I thought we were all doing the same thing and when he expressed good feelings I believed it was fake beef. This was wrong. This is basically a matter of pals before gals where he felt betrayed and I was ignorant. He is upset at what happened, and at the friend I made. 

Context: we are sixteen and have been friends for ~11 years. We have always had emotional conflicts but always get past it together.

He was a great friend to me in the few months our relationship lasted, and it was so wonderful to feel comfortable around someone, which rarely happens for me. I don’t care about the sex, my heart is broken at the fact that our friendship will likely dissipate, when he’s probably the best person I’ve had in my life.

Everyone tells me we would be good together but one time my mom in joking conversation said that we would not be a good couple and ever since then my confidence to reach out has been crushed. Every time I picture is though I can just see her and She brings me so much joy.

I was supposed to see my dad every month but my mom stopped driving us to the ferry which was a 25 minute drive from the house. So my dad could spend 3 hours coming down to pick us up. My mom then refused to drive us or try to keep in touch with him all my early memories were spending time with my dad outdoors and always crying going back to my mom. I didnt see my dad for 6 years. 

My sister started to email him when I was in grade 8 and I started to visit him a couple times a year. He got divorced again with another woman around this time because he was abusive I dont know if Physically or verbally. After highschool he said I could move up so as soon as I graduate the next week I moved up got a job and lived with my dad I seen his anger in small episodes but when I lived with him soon he would throw dishes out the window yell and scream when he wouldn't find his wallet or was dealing with a shitty situation. When he is mad he always talks to himself and you can usually hear about what he is saying about whatever is setting himself off. 

He lost his government job due to his anger problems. Soon after my girlfriend got kicked out and she came up here to live with us he would throw angry episodes and she would hide in the room listening to them while I was at work. He doesn't communicate with me or anyone properly he'd just yell and get mad and when he did say we didn't pay rent so we started paying rent. He also got mad at my girlfriend for eating the groceries we bought (my gf and me)

My gf moved away the following year back to her family I stayed with my dad and continued to work pay rent, help him(firewood and other projects) and clean which usually kept him happy but even then he'd still get mad sometimes. I broke my toes at the gym and couldn't work for a month. I went back to my mom's to heal up there because he would expect me to clean and help even though I was hurt. When at my mom he emailed me to get my dog get my shit and get the fuck out of the house. I later picked up everything had to quit my job barley had time to say good bye to the good friends and people I made a life around there and got thrown back into the city which was hard. He was sad when I got my stuff he was teary and knew he was wrong. 

We kept talking and my sister and me came up for Christmas which was good. We visited other times and the next Christmas he had an episode because we were arguing my gf and and my sister and her bf.

I was in school to do a trade and covid hit so I came to my dads to help him fo renovations to the house. I went back and found my schooling was postponed again in May till September I called asked him if I could work there for the summer and he said absolutely. I got my old job back and started working I bought a motorcycle to get around but the end of August I got in an accident and got a serious concussion. I couldn't do anything and the situation with my dad deteriorated.

 The plan was he was going to rent the upstairs of the house( the downstairs is being rented) and he was going to move into a trailer on the otherside of the property while building a cabin. So I invited my girlfriend back because my dad was now leaving he said end of September October he would move out. She wasn't really fond of the idea but I kept saying he would be gone. After.my concussion was regressing I went back to.work for 2 weeks and my appendix burst. This but me out of action till now and I'm still dealing with it but this is the current situation. 

I've paid for the groceries since moving up here. Helped him when I could. He said we wouldn't have to pay rent until he is moved out. He has multiple episodes where he yells at my calls me a lazy fucking cunt. Says I don't do anything.i lie about helping. So we started to Pay some rent.Today I went out with my friends for the first time in a couple weeks and told him I'd be back later I went to play pass. After pass I went to get gass and groceries in town which is a 20 minute ferry ride away. When I was gone my girlfriend was home he came in and had an episode called me a lying piece of shit and he hates my guts. My sister is also supposed to come rent the upstairs because all her schooling is online anyways. I am done in dealing with someone who doesnt see any value in what you do. These things hurt me because I love my Dad more than anything and want to help him. But I feel like nothing will help him. I now have my license and vehicle I feel like grabbing our stuff and just leaving while he is at work. But I want the property because it is hard to come by and rentals impossible to find here.

I had always told him I’d like to work on communication in our relationship, always knowing he wasn’t saying everything he needed to say. But he bottled it up anyways, and now I’m here. I was never angry, just hurt and sad. And then the next morning he sent me a long message saying how he regrets last night so much and that he can’t lose me. I’m so confused, I still love him and I want to get back together, but I wanna be smart and respect myself and truly consider things. I feel so confused, I’m not sure if I should take him back or not, even if I want to. Please help? :(",31Oct2020,1

257,"Hi, everyone! This is my first pregnancy and we are super excited about it! Although - I’m not feeling so highly of myself. I need to make a plan now for the better of my baby and my well-being, but I seriously need some advice. I am 10 weeks and 6 days pregnant! 

I am 5’4, 21, and 217 lbs. last year, I was at least 170, and the year before, 160. I was on birth control on/off, which I don’t think helped my appetite or weight gain too much, but now I realize I need to change.

- I only have very bad heartburn and acid reflux. No hyperthyroid, diabetes, or anything of the sorts. At times, I sometimes need to take Tums before sleeping.

- How can I learn to love lettuce? What lettuce do you guys recommend buying from the store? (I’ve heard iceberg is terrible). I need to learn to eat vegetables. It’s a journey, but I will. I’ve hated lettuce my whole life, sometimes I can eat it with tacos/burgers, otherwise, it’s always made me gag. And what dressing? What can I cook/roast/sauté? I LOVE potatoes, I have never tried broccoli, and I’m working on carrots. 

- I eat yogurt, a cheese snack, and sometimes sandwiches throughout the day. Almonds, I usually drink water, an occasional cranberry juice, or just occasional sprite to calm my stomach. I cut out sodas besides sprite months ago. And of course, I’m not the healthiest eater, we eat out and grab fast food, because we just “don’t have time”, but that’s never an excuse. I will eat lean meat with hamburger helper. 

- I’ve been doing my best to take at LEAST 4,000 steps a day. It’s been rough feeling so tired from the pregnancy constantly and it’s getting cold! 

Ugh, I just need some insight, I really care about this baby and know that I want what’s best for it and myself. I know I should’ve started this beforehand, but at least I’m realizing now. After the baby is here, I know I’m going to start exercising more and to find a personal trainer. I just would LOVE to start eating healthy now than later. 

Thanks guys!",31Oct2020,1
260,"So I finished university  (it was a degree in linguistics Portuguese-english). I live in Brazil and we have this system where you can get one graduation for free, as long as you pass the national test, and so did I. 

However, I'm starting to worry I might have chosen the wrong field. I don't know what to specialize in, and nobody hires me, not even for retail. 

Maybe I shouldn't have graduated, and should have tried a practical professional like working with wood instead. I'm creative and love to work with material stuff like that, so maybe I could have learned to do it. I'm good with words, too, and can create a piece or correct a text with excellence, but companies are not interested. I could be a teacher, but this is something I hate. 

The point is, I don't know what to do professionally. I feel like it has to be another option, something obvious I haven't thought about, but when I try something related to my graduation, it doesn't work, and I feel guilty for trying something else and kind of wasting my graduation for nothing. I also don't have any money, I just had this one chance and it didn't worked out to make a living in any way. It's important to me to be useful and independent, so it really annoys me.

Today everything was going great, we were talking while I was at work and she even threw in a couple messages like “I wish we could be together right now so we can cuddle” and a “I hope you’re having a good day I miss you” after I was away from my phone for about 2 hours in a meeting.

Its around 1030pm - 11pm and the neighbor above us thought it would be the best time to vacuum his house, normally everyones trying to sleep and my dad got annoyed and called him out but the neighbor above us didn’t care at all and continued while making fun of my dad ( I noticed this cause he started laughing and made the noise much louder)

Before this whole incident my dad and the neighbor above us had another issue, which 
is they bought a dog (we didnt have any problems with at first) with the house layout they have a mini balcony (made of wood) directly below the entrance of our house. The problem occurred when we started noticing that they let their dog pee and poop on their balcony, the pee drips down from the balcony to our front door which caused displeasing odor. Together with that they clean the poo of the dog by pushing it so it would fall to our front door, which made my dad really angry and talked to them nicely but being them they didnt care at all and took it personally. They didnt say sorry or anything.

Now back to what happened today my dad got really pissed and kept shouting “come down here I’ll fucking knock your ass down”.

264,"Trigger Warning — Sexually violent threats and generally violent threats.

My brother and I have been through a lot. We dealt with emotional and physical abuse, foster care, not knowing our father, not being raised by our mother, living in shelters throughout our childhood and more.

I deal with everything better than he does to say the least. He has anger issues due to our childhood. He moved in with my this past February and there have been minor problems but he has overall become a lot better.

He recently began drinking a lot! He went to a party and as I was home watching tv, a girl called me and told me he was trying to drive home and she asked me to get him.

My boyfriend and I obviously went to get him. When we arrived he was belligerent! He began saying horrible things that are definitely not normal.

He puked everywhere, slipped on the ice and smashed his back, punched my car to the point of denying it, etc. He told the girl who called me that he was going to RAPE HER and rape her throat. He told me that my boyfriend isn’t tough and that he was going to murder him and started smashing the car screaming, “murder, murder, murder!” He punch a dent in the hood of my car and said, “fuck these boys thinking there tough, I’ll kill them all, fuck it all.” He just kept saying he would rape the girl, rape my bf, rape our friends, he kept saying over and over that he’d kill and slit people and their throats and all this crazy violent stuff.

It got to the point that I smacked him in the face and he got really quiet.

After an hour we got him in the car and he tried to jump out of my car as I was driving 35 mph. He also get kicking the seat and smashing the interior of the car and he said, “you’re lucky you’re a girl, you’re luck you’re my sister, let me see a man so I can fucking kill him.”

Basically, that’s what was going on for about 2.5 hours and so my bf took his car and I took my car and my brother to our friend’s house and are sobering him up but how can I talk to him tomorrow?

He wants to go to another party tomorrow but I am going to tell him that he either stays home and relaxes or he can’t live with me anymore. He ruined our whole night, our plans, our plans for tomorrow or rather today as it’s about to be 3am.

I am seriously, I want him to be home tomorrow and I want him to get a therapist or I don’t want him in my apartment. Is that too much? I’ve never seen someone so violently drunk before. I feel lucky the girl whose house he was at was gracious and I’m angry that none of his friends helped him, they thought his behavior was funny.

265,"TW: idk but it might be a trigger 

Firstly i’m not suicidal.

I (18F) recently graduated school and i’m kind of in a hole, I have nothing to do, nowhere to go and all in all just sit most of my day in my room thinking. 

A bit of background, i’ve had some trust issues with my mum and don’t tell her a lot and don’t really like to think we’re close. She on the other hand apparently does. I’m very independent and do not rely on my guardians for most things.

My mum has been breathing down my neck calling me irresponsible and untrustworthy and thinks i’m an addict after she found out about my use of marijuana (which i haven’t touched for 6mths) and tobacco. She also has found out i’ve been intimate with an ex of mine and thinks i’ve been pregnant (i haven’t, i’ve always used protection). She’s starting to tell me I cannot be around my close friends as she things they’re all drug users who have zero lives and are going to bring me down (they’re not) and I’m struggling to be at home but have zero income and no way out. I can feel her and our other household members pushing me out as much as they can and have been trying so hard to find a job so I can just leave but it’s currently impossible.

My mum threatened to take me to see tracheostomy patients (when they put a hole in your throat due to cancer/other) which I think is fucking crazy, it’s my legal choice to smoke isn’t it? I understand her concerns but it’s my personal choice and i’ve told her that.

I’ll face the consequences of my own decisions not her right? How do I get her to just get off my case?

We recently became long distance and he’s road tripping from state A (he was visiting family) to state b, where he will live. The drive is about 29 hours. 

He had told me (20F) he needed to help a friend with something and he was going to Texas because it was on his way (I live in texas but he was going to a place 10 hours from Me) to State B. When he said his friend, he just said,” my buddy XYZ” and even said,” he”, so of course, I thought it was a guy. 

He gets to another state in Texas (a 16hr drive) where he will stay and keep driving the next morning to see his friend (he will drive around 3.5 hours to almost 20 hours to see this friend). 

That’s when I ask what his friend needed help with and he looks extremely confused and says he doesn’t know what I’m talking about at all. None of his friends need help and I must be mistaken. I tell him he said he was going to help his friend. 

That’s when he says,” oh that, yeah I’m having drinks with her tomorrow and then continuing to drive home afterwards” 

I was upset because he never told me that and never said it was a female. He said,” I didn’t think it was a big deal, it’s on my drive home anyway and she’s gay”. 

I looked up her Instagram and her bio says she’s a church going girl and a single Mother of 2 kids. 

Also, I looked up directions and he’d be driving 19.5 hours to her state to see her and then 16 hours to State B, his hometown, From there. He said she’s a very important friend to him because she helped him back when he was suicidal. 

I’m pretty upset right now and don’t know what to believe. He keeps insisting she’s super gay and that he won’t go see her if it bothers me. I don’t know what to think. My issue isn’t with him having female friends because he has several and I don’t have an issue about them going out. It’s the fact that he lied to me about why he was going there in the first place and who he was meeting.

276,"(A bit long, sorry!)
I have a friend that I basically considered as a sister. We've been practically joined at the hip for years! However, a couple months ago she started dating someone. Ever since she'd just ditch me. Whenever we hung it, it was because I asked. At some point I wouldn't message her the day we're supposed to hang, just to see if she'd say something, but she never does. I brought it up to her, but she said ""oh, I just assumed you didn't want to hang out anymore."" Which I explained, that wasn't the case. Afterwards I kinda just waved it off as a miscommunication and just me overthinking; yet it didn't stop there. She said ""aww you should talk to me more, like you used to because I miss you,"" but she always ignores my messages. The few times where she actually texts me is just to talk about how amazing her new boyfriend is. 

At this point, I'm a little annoyed; being repeatedly ditched and ignored, while only being messaged when she wanted to talk about her new man. Yet it finally hit me the most when one day I hear she's moving out with her boy. We've been planning to move in together for a couple years(an apartment for when we leave for college), had places to look at and everything; but I find this out from someone else. I brought it up to her and once again she goes ""oh I assumed you didn't want to move out with me anymore."" I ask her ""wtf made you think that"" and she goes on about this one time I said that I was glad to be able to chill at home for a bit. When I explain that it literally has nothing to do with me wanting to move out (it was just an off hand comment I made about finally having some free time), she offers to let me move out with her and her boyfriend. Obviously I'm pissed off at this point and I reject that offer. She starts complaining about me ""making excuses not to live with her"" when really, why the hell would I at this point? I've never even met her boyfriend, why would I want to live with him? Plus she proved to clesrly be unreliable!

Tbh, I don't know what to do.. With her not moving out with me, my plans kinda went down the toilet. Not to mention, I just feel like a second option, maybe even just a third option to her. My best friend just isn't acting like a friend to me. I know it may seem like I'm just bitching, but there are many other instances that led up to this. I feel so done with all this, and yet she was my closest friend so I definitely feel what would be considered heartbreak. It just sucks when someone you've known for years just suddenly leaves you for a guy they met online recently. I'm just at a lost right now, talking to her doesn't seem to help especially when she turns it on me or just flat out ignores what I say..

So, I've been together with my girlfriend for a month now and I've had a great time. In my eyes I won the lottery when I met her. We share a lot of interests, love the same music, love spending time together and most importantly she seemed like a mature and loyal person.

But 2 weeks ago she met my roommate and I felt like something was up. I didnt want to bring anything up because I felt like maybe they are just friends and I shouldnt kick up a fuss. Fast forward to 2 nights ago when we were all drinking and having fun. I got really drunk and I just laid down in the closest bed I found. I open my eyes and my girlfriend is shirtless, on the other bed with my roommate, also shirtless, who is sitting on her back and giving her a massage. I immediately called her over for a chat but it was really difficult for me to talk. I woke up the next morning and texted her if we could talk, but she said she already went home, and we will talk when she comes back.

In the very beginning we said we are going to be honest with eachother since we are both tired of short, meaningless relationships. I know she has been hurt badly in her past relationship and I'm pretty sure she isn't over her past boyfriend.

How should I handle the situation? Im still in love with her and I would love to somehow save the relationship, but I feel trusting her again is going to be tough. Maybe she is scared and unsure about everything from her past relationship, but I was always willing to stick by her and help her in any way I can.

I [17M] recently successfully asked out a girl [16F] who I met through a mutual friend right before my state went into lockdown. We texted a lot during lockdown, we both flirted a bit until I asked her on a date. She said yes, but the day before the date she injured her finger and couldn’t make it. We were both inconveniently busy the following weeks, so we have yet to reschedule the date. 

A few days ago, I sent her a text she didn’t respond to. I didn’t want to pressure her if she was busy or something, so I didn’t follow it up. Today I sent her another text, that she again didn’t answer. I know she’s seen in, as I messaged her on WhatsApp and it tells you if someone has seen your message.

Neither message was in any way weird or even remotely flirty, so I don’t think it was because I came in to strong and weirded her out or anything. And neither where any of my messages right before this, if anything I toned down the flirting after she said yes to the date.

Now that school has started up again, I’ve walked past her a couple times, but since she’s always surrounded by her friendship group that I don’t know anyone in, I haven’t gone up to speak to her since I have social anxiety and don’t like jumping into crowds of people I don’t know. And plus, I think I’m starting to fall for her as whenever I walk past her my brain cells suddenly disappear and I forget where I’m going or drop whatever’s in my hand or something equally stupid, which makes me worried about speaking to her face to face. 

Idk if I’m overreacting over nothing here, but this kinda worries me. She is the first person to actually agree to go on a date with me, and she is absolutely beautiful, smart and unique, so she is waaayyyy out of my league, so I’m feeling kinda insecure about this.

I hope it’s just that she’s been busy and hasn’t had time to reply or just isn’t in the mood to talk for some other reason, but I just have this bad feeling that I might have done something wrong without knowing it. I don’t want to straight up ask her “why aren’t you responding” because that would be weird and intrusive and pushy.

I just feel so unaccomplished because i have friends who are moving right away :( i’m sorta jealous because i don’t have that luxury since my family never saved money for me since i was born for college or anything! literally i’m doing everything on my own and i feel like i’m super broke and no one is here to help me. I’m literally breaking down right now as i type this out. I feel like a failure that i’m going to stay in my hometown after high school while other people go out in the world doing bigger and better things with their life. While i’m stuck here and i’ve read so many articles about “if you don’t leave your hometown in your 20’s you will never leave!” and it’s literally scaring the shit out of me. Am i making the smart choice by staying a few more years to do community and saving up because my mom literally does not care about my future and i have no help whatsoever....",31Oct2020,1

I have a good friend who lost a parent very recently and I can't even begin to imagine how they must be feeling right now, they had a lovely relationship with their parent. I had been in touch before and after they passed away. I had contacted my friend right after, but it was a condolence letter, and I mentioned that if they'd ever wanted to talk, I'd always be there. (to which they said thank you and that was about it so I didn't push)

it's been just a a couple of weeks since their parent died and it was my birthday a couple of days ago for which they sent me a message wishing me, and it was very nice and sweet. I thanked them but I didn't want to leave it at that,--I wanted to check in on them  but saying something like 'how are you holding up?' simply seems insensitive and I know they have other people they'd otherwise go to for comfort but I still just... want to do /something/ to help them, if there was a way to just be there for them in some small way? tbh because they messaged me first I don't know how to proceed? would sending something small like a meme, or an animal pic or something be appropriate? 

I also understand that maybe I'm overstepping as well because the last that I want to do is do or say something that will only make things seem worse for them, but I don't know if I should leave our conversation at a thank you from me that avoids everything or if I should say something to check in.

290,"So yeah, recently I've really been into airguns. Specifically, High Powered Air Rifles.. I'm really tempted to buy one.. To experience one for myself.. However, I have one problem.. I think I don't really need it (?).. Hunting is illegal on my country, and I can only use it on our very limited back yard.. So, I can play with it once in a while, then most of its life will be on a shelf or will be displayed. Unless, I use it for self defense or something lol.. On the other hard, with that kind of money, I can already buy a good laptop.. Not with insane specs but it's good enough to do my job. But here's another problem. I already have a Very High Specs Gaming PC at home that can do my job better. Which is video editing.. So, I will only use my laptop whenever I go out. To go to a vacation or something..

291,"Some guy slid into my DMs today and started a conversation. Initially, it was pretty innocent but then he started to send these really long paragraphs. If I didn’t respond immediately, he’d send another message until I responded. I felt something was really...off... about the whole conversation because he starting to bash general groups of people (aka people younger than me). I immediately told him goodnight because I didn’t want to talk to him another, but he sent a creepy message using my name followed by “I’ll text you tomorrow after work, and if I don’t, text me.” This creeped me out further, so I panicked and blocked him. I told my friend, and she said, “What if he just doesn’t know how to socialize properly?”

I felt bad and unblocked him, but he immediately confronted me about it. I told him I’m a naturally anxious person, and he responded with two paragraphs explaining how he understood that it was beyond my control and how I shouldn’t apologize for it. I told him goodnight again, and he repeated his actions: he used my first name again, sent a creepy goodnight message, and sent me a long paragraph explaining his past on how people thought he was a “twat” and how he “changed for the better.” 

He tried to follow the people I tagged in my Instagram posts, and I really want to block him again, but I’m scared he’ll retaliate. He’s currently on restricted, and I was planning to ignore him for a week before blocking him again. What do I do?

299,"Due to mental health problem, I(21f) only started to live fully for myself last year. It was a year of discovery, I met lot of people, lost friendships with some, discovered lot of hobbies, I drop out of college and then subscribe to two colleges (currently doing both) because I wasn't taken in the one I wanted to do (too far from home and my parents weren't willing to found me). Live in EU.

Now, I feel interested by a lot of things, and I have the energy to work on them. However, I'm too scatter on my hobbies and studies. It feels like I can't choose one and stick to it. I'm great in lot of them, the trouble is I don't have anh certification since I self teached myself, so I can't find a job in any of those field (art, aquascaping, photography, hairdresser) even if I do them near professional level and get some remuneration out of them. My parents want me to mive out before next year, so I obviously need a work part time to not drop of school again, and choose between my too colleges (maths and computering vs nurse school). I wanted to go to med school, I'm looking for otpion next year, but I don't think I'll be able to get to that field bc of the system.

How do I move forward to that deception and choose a field to stick to it and move on ? I feel like I'm loosing myself and precious time because I can't choose and make a plan for the next few years, I can't put up a life goal",31Oct2020,1
300,"So, I just feeling always insufficient and lacking skills mainly because I'm afraid that I'll be skill-less retard who's a failure and waste to the society. Recently in this past month I always learning new skills literally 12 hours a day and everyday(Webdev, japanese language, piano, mandarin and many more) as coping mechanism. I wake up at 5 AM then grinding skills until 6PM and sometimes until 9PM there's some few breaks but it doesn't amount to 60 minutes. I'm 21 yo and still in college studying law. 

My fear mainly comes from the fact that people near me are all succesfull people. I mean, going to prestigious university, rich, just all that kind of stuff that your typical asian mom would be proud of and me? I'm just a guy that got accepted to a really ordinary university like it makes me really insecure.

I'm afraid that my habit of grinding like this would harm me mentally and physically but I just couldn't stop man because the feeling that I should do something always pops out in my mind everytime I stopped like doing something productive.

In August my girlfriend and I moved to Oregon from texas so she could be closer to her family and her mom, who has brain cancer and was given a life expectancy of a year... a year ago. 

When she was diagnosed they were living in New Mexico and I moved with them there so I could be with my girlfriend. But due to some unforeseen circumstances we all moved back to Texas.

 her dad got a job in Oregon and so they moved and me and my girlfriend followed. They chose to come way up here because their families are originally from Washington and their home town is just a few hours away from where we live now. 

I had a very troubled upbringing without parent and honestly I never planned to live this long, but her mom kind of took me in and so in a way she’s like my mom in my heart. 

I still have a lot of family, and all my friends, in Texas and so I basically left everything so my girlfriend could have these final months with “our” mom. Of course I love this lady too but I miss my family so much. Like i said I’ve lived away before but never this far. 

Right before our move here my girlfriend began having seizures out of of no where. She had no prior history of them and the doctors keep passing us along and we still have zero answers after MONTHS of this. Due to the frequent and random seizures she can not work and so I am the only one who can. 

We were able to find an apartment for us and our puppy and I was able to find a really good job that I liked. It wasn’t my dream job but it paid good and had good benefits. I had to miss a lot of days and/or be late due to me having to take care of my girlfriend. My job was very easy on me because of this but they had their policies and so after I had so many “instances” I had to be let go. I completely understand, I mean what’s the point of having an employee if they can’t be there all the time. 

I’m 20 years old, I’m also a full time college student but since it’s all online I’m able to have a flexible schedule. I’ve never lost a job before and honestly I don’t know what do now. I’m not sure if I can support us for much longer. I have money saved up for a few months of rent and stuff like that but I’m just so tired.

So I told him and they broke up, but then Becka blocked me on Instagram, which isn’t very surprising because she is very petty. But that’s not what I’m upset about, they ended up getting back together about a month later. Now Brad constantly has parties that he invites all of my friends to except for me, and sometimes my friends will ask if they can invite me and Brad says that I’m not allowed to come.

This really upsets me because I’m leaving for the military in two weeks and I can’t spend Halloween with my friends all because I decided to tell Brad about what Becka had done to him.

310,"I was always a hard-working kid, had the best grades, and liked to stay alone and play games, even when I was 5-6 years old. Of course I used to go out with friends, play football but I kind of liked PC more. Then high school started and acne exploded, anxiety around people was horrible and I felt pretty low and had the feeling that everyone was looking at me. I got on acne meds, no more acne but I'm left with scars (which isn't as bad as acne though). My parents had issues through my whole childhood and I have seen lot of things, from normal to extreme such as fighting etc. I used to shake and be stressed as I didn't leave the house because of the possibility that something might happen (it did happen, I called police few times etc...)

Through these years I used to go out with my closest friends and we had fun together but it doesn't feel the same anymore as we are getting older and some of them moved away for job etc. I also have tinnitus, which is constant ringing in ears, I suppose it's because of loud cars and music, I went to doctor and yeah it's uncurable and I learnt to live with it but it doesn't feel good, but millions of people have it so I don't feel alone.

I never had girlfriend, I just don't feel like having one, I am more an introverted type so I guess I wouldn't really want to go out and so on. That could also be because I just didn't fall in love yet? I don't know but I guess it's not that important even though some girls like me and like to be around me, touch me etc. and I like the feeling. I mean sometimes they put their leg over mine and it feels good, but I don't feel like going further idk...

Now comes the part that I am ashamed of, and that is the sexual part. I was pretty horny even as a 6 year old kid, somehow I discovered orgasm and used to rub off the couch, chairs and other objects and not just at home. It just felt too good. That went on through years until I discovered porn when I was about 9-10. At I guess what was 12 years old, I started to masturbate to porn. That went on and on and I got into fetish videos. I kinda became obsessed with humiliation videos where women dominate guys and make them lick their footwear/feet etc.

It's really disgusting, I know. Even as a kid I used to watch feet and shoes of women and fantasise about it. I wish I never had lol. So I have done some things at the height of excitement and curiosity whose memories make me feel bad and like a pervert (which I was). When I was 13 I watched too much feet porn and I rubbed my penis on feet of some family members, it lasted no longer than a second, seriously. Then I turned back to watch porn and I finished off. I have repeated this about 3 more times, on different occasions and members. I was 12-14 I guess. I also used to take other people's (females) shoes while they weren't there and sniff and play with them... I repeated that last year in school when we were changing even though I shouldn't have done it but I was curious... I won't do it again.

Then last year I used to sext, send nudes (got scammed, person said he will sell them if I don't send money, but I blocked him immediately and deleted acc so yeah..). I would make many accounts, talk to dommes online, ask to be degraded and similar, I even used to masturbate on Omegle... I know thousands of teens did that but my conscious is killing me.

Then I discovered NoFap and read hundreds of similar and worse stories people have done, I even read a book about porn's effect on brain. I decided to leave all that behind and to stop doing that. But I feel like I lost my dignity by sending photos and doing those very disgusting and sick things... :/


So yeah, I guess this is kind of a confession but I had to let it out. I know what I did is bad and morally wrong, but I think porn and internet lead me to doing all of those things. Through internet I discovered porn, through Omegle I discovered Kik and sexting began etc...",31Oct2020,1

312,"Trigger Warning (Abuse)

I (17F) have had an extremely traumatic upbringing. My parents divorced when I was 10, because my father is an abusive alcoholic. My parents share custody so my brother Jax (15M) and I would switch on and off between their houses. From the age of 11 living with my father, I was emotionally, physically and sexually abused. I did everything I could to protect my little brother from my dad's anger which resulted in him not seeing a lot of what was happening. (The abuse typically took place after Jax went to sleep). I was psychologically tortured for about 6 years, until someone finally witnessed my father's actions and he was arrested. 

Since then, he has quit drinking (for the most part) and really started to turn his life around. After all this time I am finally starting to heal from all the damage I endured during my childhood. I am also beginning to rebuild some sort of relationship with my dad, which I am thankful for. 

Jax has been becoming more abusive and it is becoming unbearable. He rages at the smallest inconveniences and manipulates others into getting what he wants. For example, if he needs a ride to his friend's house and I need half an hour to get ready, he loses his shit. He throws the blame on me, and uses leverage to get me to cave. He threatens to move out and break my mom's heart or to shit talk me to my dad, threatening our improved relationship. He has hit me before, although it was a while ago. Usually his tantrums include swearing, punching walls and throwing things. I have a huge amount of experience with conflict resolution, but it doesn't seem to matter what I do or say. This conflict is unavoidable. 

Due to my childhood, I am currently struggling with mental illness such as depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies and PTSD. Being around violence is extremely difficult for me for obvious reasons, which makes this situation so much harder.

My mom hasn't been helpful, even though she understands what it's like living in an abusive home. She doesn't always witness the situation, so she refuses to take action. I am also the more reasonable one out of her children, so she always comes to me to solve the issue. She loves her son, and doesn't want him to move out, so she usually gives into his demands. 

I feel like I am slowly suffocating. I feel like I managed to escape hell, only to be dragged back in. I am constantly walking on eggshells, trying to avoid conflict. I am scared for my safety in my own home and am at a loss. I have the choice between being abused or giving into his every need. I am essentially trapped, and can see no way out. 

I am desperately seeking any advice that might help my situation. I have a therapist, although that doesn't help what I have to live with everyday. Thank you all.",31Oct2020,1

314,"I’m 23 years old and I just recently got my license/diploma on automotive painting (car painting) and by finishing my license I should’ve had a good raise in my salary but my current boss didn’t give me one.

My current workplace is a small business (we are 8 people working there) with a big reputation and contracts from big dealerships. It’s a family owned business and plus a close cousin of theirs working for them. So 4 family members and 4 other people in which 2 of the 4 other people are close friends with the owners. Anyways, there is always work, every week so there is no shortage of that so I figured talking to my boss in the beginning of September about getting a raise and until this days I haven’t had one, so he clearly won’t give me one. I’m not happy with that as I am also not happy about the people that I work with. To put it short, my coworkers are snakes. Talk about every one about others back, I hate that sh*t makes my blood boil. Since day one I knew I wasn’t going to be working there for a long time, been there 2 and a half years and now I think it’s time to find me another place to work at.

So now that you have a bit of a background story, I have been considering about changing workplaces. I could go to another small business shop and relive this thing where I ask about a raise when I think I should be having one and don’t get one, and having toxic people around me, or try a big business shop like work for a car dealership and have more diversity of people around me and might having higher chances of getting a raise when I ask for one.

He made me really paranoid and uncomfortable living here but since he got kicked out i didnt worry too much.

When i came back from the walk he was still there. He started questioning me about my dog about what race he is, boy or girl, what that kind of dog costs. He told me he wanted to buy a dog for himself and his family (which made me wonder because he originally comes from a country where women are treates like objects and dogs are considered dirty and he always seemed disgusted when he saw my dog). I just told him a pug doesnt cost much (which is a lie) and he should go to an animal shelter. He asked me like three more times to tell him the cost of a pug but i just told him that i dont know. 
I just dont trust this guy at all and my gut tells me he is planning something about my dog. Im really scared he might break into my apartment when my parents and me are not home to steal my dog and sell him or something. I dont know if im overreacting but im really paranoid now. 
I dont know what i should do about him. I would be happy about some advice",31Oct2020,1
316,"so about 4 years ago i made a reddit post and i said that i want a face tattoo i was 15 years old.

im 19 years old now and i still want it, before you say anything hear me out...

i hate school i know everyone does but i really do, last summer i worked in retail store and i hated it more than anything else, i came home tired and depressed about the next day... some time later i decided to do something i actually love to do, and about 5 months ago i started a clothing brand. i sell about 1 shirt per day on average (20 dollars) i know that is not even close to do that for a full time job but i truly belive deep inside my heart that i will sucseed and that this will be my full time job. today i told my aunt (we are pretty close) that i will get a face tattoo. 

when i told her that my mom was also there but didnt say anything, my aunt said that if i do that i will ruin my life and never get a job. i know she doesnt belive in me... but my mom said let him be, let him do whatever he wants he is old enough and even if she doesnt belive in me as much as i do it's still something...

why i want face tattoo? i always liked face tattoos, right now i have my whole chest tattooed and some arm tattoos even tho i like them i want face tat more than anywhere else on my body. by getting a face tattoo it will force me to do something i actually like and want and there will be no plan B becuase once i get it i will be super hard to get a normal job. if you came this far thank you for reading this and im curious about what people have to say about that.",31Oct2020,1
317,"Pretty much the title but I'll elaborate. My cat's name is spot and she is gorgeous, super fluffy black and white. She just recently turned 17 but over the last year or so her health has deteriorated more and more. 

She's pretty much totally blind now and will walk into pretty much anything directly in front of her, I think she still has a little bit of light perception because she doesn't always bump into things. 

She struggles to hear anything but loud noises so I'm pretty sure she's going deaf as well. Her back hips aren't too great either and she always walks a bit funny.

She Disappeared for 3 days....well 3 days ago, She's home now and sleeping on my bed but I fear letting her out to go to the toilet in case she runs away again. She was never properly potty trained as a kitten so she can't use a litter tray.

1. These harassers are using spambots en masse, more than 2k to spam on the live chat on the personality's live broadcast. 
2. This could be the first time, the hosting platform receives this kind of disturbance and revealed some critical flaw of that platform's user account system.
3. The personality that's been targeted has some level of status and related to corporations.
4. The harassment has/had lasted for months.

330,"Why isn’t she responding to my texts?



I [17M] recently successfully asked out a girl [16F] who I met through a mutual friend right before my state went into lockdown. We texted a lot during lockdown, we both flirted a bit until I asked her on a date. She said yes, but the day before the date she injured her finger and couldn’t make it. We were both inconveniently busy the following weeks, so we have yet to reschedule the date. 

A few days ago, I sent her a text she didn’t respond to. I didn’t want to pressure her if she was busy or something, so I didn’t follow it up. Today I sent her another text, that she again didn’t answer. I know she’s seen in, as I messaged her on WhatsApp and it tells you if someone has seen your message.

Neither message was in any way weird or even remotely flirty, so I don’t think it was because I came in to strong and weirded her out or anything. And neither where any of my messages right before this, if anything I toned down the flirting after she said yes to the date.

Now that school has started up again, I’ve walked past her a couple times, but since she’s always surrounded by her friendship group that I don’t know anyone in, I haven’t gone up to speak to her since I have social anxiety and don’t like jumping into crowds of people I don’t know. And plus, I think I’m starting to fall for her as whenever I walk past her my brain cells suddenly disappear and I forget where I’m going or drop whatever’s in my hand or something equally stupid, which makes me worried about speaking to her face to face. 

Idk if I’m overreacting over nothing here, but this kinda worries me. She is the first person to actually agree to go on a date with me, and she is absolutely beautiful, smart and unique, so she is waaayyyy out of my league, so I’m feeling kinda insecure about this.

I hope it’s just that she’s been busy and hasn’t had time to reply or just isn’t in the mood to talk for some other reason, but I just have this bad feeling that I might have done something wrong without knowing it. I don’t want to straight up ask her “why aren’t you responding” because that would be weird and intrusive and pushy. 

What are some possible reasons she might not be responding, including possible ways that I might have messed up? Preferably from women, but guys with experience with this kind of stuff are also welcome to answer.

TL;DR
I downloaded a chatting app as a joke and used a fake name and pic. I ended up getting along really well with someone and told them my true identity and they blocked me.

I downloaded this chat app last night when I was bored. I got it just to mess around with people and was planning on deleting it the same night. Nothing serious. I used a fake name and pic because I had anxiety about someone recognising me.

 I'm messaging random people being stupid then I message this one girl who I get a long with really well. We both had a lot in common, making each other laugh and introducing each other to new things. We was talking for hours. This was great because of my social anxiety I dont really have any friends and it was getting me down a lot recently and it looked like things might change.

 I then suddenly remember that I have a fake profile pic and name and it suddenly felt really wrong and I felt guilty. I knew I had to tell the truth even if it meant costing the friendship. I told her the truth and sent a real pic of me. Her response at first confused me because it didn't seem like she was upset but then she blocked me.

 I know I'm an asshole and I hate myself for it I was beating myself up for it and deleted the account right after. I was wondering should I still try contact her on a new account. Its just that with so much going wrong in my life right now this was the only bit of hope and i messed it up. She had anxiety too and doesn't have friends so I'm sure she's upset too I just don't know what to do.

I know it stems from just normal expectations of what's ""attractive"" even though I myself believe in more then just appearance is what makes someone. I'm also aware of me not being able to be really open up with people when I first meet them. Ive always been pretty reserved but now I realize how reserved I am... For an example it takes me a good 3 times of meeting someone for me to even really start warming up to them. I'll introduce myself and be part of conversations but I just know im not fully being myself...

* Back when I was younger I had a person I called a good friend at the time. This ""friend"" pretty much just took advantage of him being a bit older and me being so naive and unprotected at the time, I was sexually assaulted in my own home, and other places as well. I've done personal healing i guess if you can call it in a way. I've told my parents what happened, my close siblings know, and most of my close friends know as well. I've seen this ""friend"" after the fact at random places a couple times and never really had it hinder me at that time but I know it messes with me subconsciously here and there.*

 With all of that out of the way, I was wondering if anyone could think of a way to help myself just be more open to new people.

First I didn't answer but this morning I asked what does he ask it for. He asked ""is that important?"", I said yes it is.

I saved enough money to repair them to a certain degree but my family encourages me to keep the money just in case I will need them for my studies or just to keep it as a reserve in case I will face difficulties with rent &amp; other stuff in the next year.

I don’t pay anything for my university because I have good results but I study a domain where I will need to interact with people and I cannot present myself badly. I don't drink, i don't smoke, i don't do drugs.

My family thinks that this is ""not so bad"" as i make it seem and that people should appreciate me for other qualities. Basically they went as far as to think that i am mad because i want to spend so much in order to fix them. Yes, maybe i really am mad. I am young and i worked harder than my peers with families that could afford everything. What is so wrong in wanting to look in the eyes of another person and talk without being ashamed of myself?

I  was bullied constantly because of my teeth situation and because i tried so hard to learn. I never smile, basically i don't even know how to considering that i had this  for over 11 years. If i try to ask my friends then they all say something along the lines that the soul is the most important thing etc.

It is indeed a significant amount of money but I doubt any employer would look at someone like me. I don't even want to talk about relationships.

Any unbiased advice would be appreciated. What should i do?",31Oct2020,1
354,I’m currently 19 years old and just graduated high school a few months ago. My mom wants me to go to college but idk what to major in. I used to want to major in psychology but I found out recently that having that particular degree is basically useless. I had an interest in law but I honestly don’t think I’m cut out for it. Plus I don’t want to deal with having a bunch of debt to pay off. I just want to major in something where certain jobs will take me seriously. My parents never really prepared me for anything so now they expect me to have a plan already. I feel completely stuck and unmotivated. I hate that life is just passing me by and I feel like a failure. I just wish I had someone to talk to about what to expect when majoring into a certain career and wondering if I’m wasting my time or not. I just want some clarity and insight.,31Oct2020,1

I didn’t really  care about school or treating people with respect. This man had convinced me to apply and transfer to a university, and now I love school and having an education. I care about people and I have some true friends now. My life has done a complete 180. While I’ve become a better person, I still sometimes have these bad habits.  I still make clumsy mistakes and can act pretty incompetent. My boyfriend went to Stanford and when applying to universities got into every single Ivy League. Sometimes I can’t have the intellectual conversations he wants to have with me because I’m not at his level yet. He teases me about how trash I am as an American, and I know it’s a joke, but sometimes I feel really bad about it. I have borderline personality disorder too and  my symptoms show quite a bit and while it’s not tiring for him when I act out sometimes, I feel very guilty. I’m learning how to cope, and I’m getting better. I try really hard to keep on improving my self and that’s all I ever think about. I don’t want to be the person I was before and I worry that I might be toxic. He said he loves me and needs me. I believe that he deserves someone that is more intelligent and grounded, someone worthy of him. I don’t want to break up and I tell him this because I love him. I love him so much that I’m willing to have him find another person that is more suited for his personality. I don’t want to leave him, I just think he deserves the happiest and best life possible. I’m just unsure if I can give that to him. Is it okay to think this way? Should I actually leave him so he can find someone else?",31Oct2020,1
362,"**Try not to use the “You” word.**

Saying things like “You made me feel bad when you didn’t introduce me to your friends” or “I always get mad at you for the messy bathroom” will make you look like you’re being accused, and they may close the door or attack you.

Try using words like “I feel left out if I’m not introduced to people” or “Your bathroom must be tidy to start your day properly.” Changing from “you” to “I” removes your suggestion’s accusatory tone and focuses on your feelings instead.

**Make sure it’s a two-way conversation.**

Yes, you should be able to demand what you want most (and least) in a relationship – but your partner should do the same.

If you are the only one who should ask, try asking your partner what they want in the relationship. If you both work hard to make your relationship happier, everyone wins.

First I want to say that I have had my fair share of unhealthy and toxic relationships. This relationship I’m going to speak about is not unhealthy or toxic whatsoever. So if you can please read this with an open mind, I’d really appreciate it!

Okay. Now for the word-vomit, pour my heart out, desperate for advice seeking post..... 

I need guidance on how to help my boyfriend who is struggling hard with depression. 

He is in the army and is currently stationed hundreds of miles away from me.  He has had a tremendous amount of hell he’s gone through in his life, and this year he has lost 2 family members to heart attacks. He unfortunately was not able to see them or say goodbye because of Covid. :( 

He has a lot of things that keep piling up on his plate (emotionally and mentally). 

He has always been a ray of sunshine with his positivity and contagious smile. Right now he’s at his lowest point trying to push through each day like just getting out of bed is a marathon. I’m sure almost everyone eventually gets to a point in their life where they feel so sad they don’t even know how to function. 

My boyfriend says lately I’m literally his only source of happiness and his only courage to get through each day. We thankfully get to FaceTime every night. We spend every second that we can on the phone when we aren’t working. We never get tired of each other and never run out of things to talk about. We are truly inseparable. Like the cheesy “a walk to remember” or “the notebook” type romance when we are together. 

His smile and laugh are so contagious. He inspires so many people and has had an endless amount of achievements in his life. 

The last few months he has been in such a dark and sad place and now he only seems to smile when we are on FaceTime together. 

His depression has been at an all time low the past few weeks. 

This past Sunday my father was admitted into ICU for breathing issues and they discovered blood clots in his lungs. They had to perform an emergency procedure. Thankfully his heart suffered no damage and he’s okay, but Dr said if he didn’t go to the emergency room when he did he wouldn’t have lived to see Tuesday. 

This was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced. I spent Sunday through Wednesday night at my Parents until they discharged my dad Wednesday. 

The night I left their house it was really late because I wanted as much time to hug my dad as I could get before I had to get back to my home and go back to work the next day. 

My Boyfriend was extra depressed that night because our time together was cut short since I was with my family late. When I got home it was late when I called him and he was being very unsympathetic and snappy towards me and I could tell he felt like I pushed him to the side. 

But that’s my dad, I almost lost him. 

I don’t know how i can continue to give 100% of my free time and attention to my boyfriend and still make time for my dad and family right now and I don’t know how to tell my boyfriend that I need him to understand where I’m coming from, without triggering his depression to get even worse or upset him and make him feel like a jerk. Because he ISNT. And I totally get that in his support system to help him through each day while he’s battling this depression. 

I want to be able to save both of them from their pain and make sure they both feel an endless amount of love and support. 

I just don’t know what to do or say to get him to see that he’s my whole world but right now j have the two most important men in my life that need my full love and support — but that I’m just 1 person. Sorry for rambling. I appreciate any and all of you who actually read this whole word-vomit post full of my overthinking thoughts and run-on sentences.",31Oct2020,1
372,"I've been there for two years - at first it was alright, then the company got rebought by my current boss shortly before the pandemic. Then I got pandemic trapped because I was afraid to leave and to be unable to find anything in the current climate.

Basically, I was planning on quitting this payday ( my boss has the lovely habit of not paying people if they quit mid-month, or if they quit with notice because he knows he doesn't need them anymore, yes it's illegal, yes he got sued, no nothing came out of it...yet ). This is against my work ethic but I am not walking off without my pay knowing I'd have no job after and would be living on a way lower freelance income, and payday is going to be monday.

However I just caught covid - and my country is likely to go on lockdown. This changes the plan quite a bit as the 2/3 leads I got now for other work could dry up very quickly, plus the covid isolation could allow me to cash in another month of pay, assuming he even pays me for the leave.

Do I still quit on payday or do I wait to see if my country goes on lockdown in the next two weeks, which means I would be able to work from home ( my issue is not with the work, it's with my boss, I do not want to be around him as I fear for my safety around this guy) ?

The things my boss did are :

\- Wage theft, unpaid overtime ( I have witnesses), physical threats of violence ( to me, I don't have proof however), sexual harassment ( not to me ), blackmail ( not to me), illegal things in office (got proof).

That is for the ""really illegal"" things but he also yells at me, treats me like absolute trash, basically workplace bullying.

Tw: Child loss

Thursday morning my sister in law woke us up at 6am sobbing on the phone. My little angel had passed away in the hospital the night before. The horrible part is that we never even knew she was sick. No one had said a word to us. We immediately got plane tickets and left to his home state the same day. We didn't really know what had happened, his sister Julie didnt really give us any details she said we could talk about it once we got there. A few long hours and a very tearful plane ride later we finally got to he place and found out what happened.

SIL, who is husband’s half sister was raised as a very devout catholic and was raising Angel to be the same way. We are not religious but i was raised catholic so I understood.  Julie wanted her to get confirmed and was serious about her not missing any classes. We kind of butted heads on that because of whats going on in the world and I was seriously worried that angel would get sick. She was born premature and was immunocompromised so of course i was really worried. i got my MIL to help convince SIL to space Angels lessons to every other sunday that way if she did get sick or the priest/nuns were ill it would be obvious and make it safer, or at least as safe as it could be since SIL wouldn't postpone it till after everything calmed down.

SIL thought everything was calmed down enough to stop spacing out lessons and talked to the priest to give Angel extra lessons throughout the week after school so she could “catch up”. 

With all the constant and close proximity to other people at the worst time possible; Angel got sick. Her immune system wasn't up for the challenge and it tore through her fast.

Once we knew all the details I was incredibly upset(more so then I already was), I had been begging SIL to calm down with the lessons but she thought it was too important to delay it. When I heard that it was like my brain shut down completely. All I could hear Angel saying “MiMi, Am I gonna get sick? Mama says God will protect me, is he gonna protect me?’ when we last spoke.

I was beyond angry at her for it, I tried to not let it show on my face, I didn't say anything about it and tried to keep my face as  neutral as I could, I did not succeed. After a while she started noticing how quiet I was. When we first got there we cried and clung to each other, comforting each other.  After i heard the details I kinda distanced myself.  I was worried i'd lose my cool and say shit in anger. there was enough pain going around i didnt want to add to it.. But like a dog with a bone she  wouldn't drop  it. She started yelling that I was being cold and distant and that it was like I didn't even care that my God Daughter was dead. 

My husband immediately jumped in to my defense and said that while he understood she was in a lot of pain and that she was going through something most would never understand but that didn't mean she could take it out on me. I removed myself from the situation and went outside, I started chain smoking and just broke down sobbing. I was so angry at her for putting  angel into so much danger just to be confirmed by the church. It was just ridiculous to me, but I knew it wasn't my place to say anything and saying anything to a mourning mother about how she was the main reason her daughter was gone  would be a repugnant thing to do regardless of it being true or not.

after an hour, my husband left to get food and Sil came outside where I was and at first was much calmer. She just asked to bum a cigarette. I gave it to her and stayed quiet. Apparently that was the wrong thing to do. She started getting angry again. She didn't think I was comforting her enough or saying enough things to make her feel better. I apologized and told I was just overwhelmed,of course i was devastated by loosing angell and that I couldnt imagine the pain she was going through. That just made her angrier, She said I had no reason to be overwhelmed. It was her daughter, It was her loss, who did I think I was saying that to her and act that way towards her. I was very confused but I didnt know what to say so I just stayed quiet.

My phone went off with a text notification and holy shit,  She. Fucking. Lost. it. The sound I have set to play when I get texts Is My Goddaughter giggling and saying “ Charlie, charrrliiiie, We’re on a bridge Charlie!”. Its  a line from the Charlie the Unicorn short, it was her favorite youtube video and she said it so adorably that I used it, It always made me smile. Hearingher voice tore through me started crying. she just started screaming at me. I mean full on crack your windows screeching at me. She said it was so disrespectful of me to have that on my phone, and how dare I use her daughter that way and make her listen to that. She grabbed the plastic ashtray between us and threw it at me, yelling that Angel was her daughter not mine. 

When I just stared at her absolutely dumbfounded, and then  she said something ill never be able to forget, or forgive..

With her face an  inch away from mine she roared “ It’s your fault my daughter went to Hell!” 

She pushed me back into my chair, screaming “ I told you I wanted her to get confirmed! I told you! She was supposed to have been confirmed a long time ago, so she could be purified before she became dirty! Like you! And now it doesn't even matter because she's gone, and because of you she’s damned to hell!’

To clarify,  I didn't get confirmed until I was almost 13 and by that point I had already started my Menstrual cycle. According to her(and her specific church apparently) but  because I didnt get confirmed before it started it made me dirty. To them the fact  I had never been “purified

‘ and welcomed into God’s grace before “flowering’ I could never truly be fully accepted into “God’s Grace”. I’m honestly not sure where she got these beliefs from, I’ve never heard anything like that before but..?

And then she said something that finally made me SNAP.

“You wanted her to be like you. You wanted her to be your daughter, but she wasnt and never will be! This is why you don't have any children, God Is punishing you for  your disgusting ways! This is why God killed your baby, because you’re Dirty! You wanted my baby girl and tried to steal her from me. God will NEVER give  you babies!’

My husband and I really wanted kids. The whole time we’ve been together we always planned on having them. But  I got sick. Really sick. 70% of my stomach is gone, ⅓ of my esophagus, and almost 205 of my large intestine also had to be removed. We didnt realize how bad and thick the scar tissue in my abdomen was, We found out we were pregnant and  we were ecstatic. We were told it would be impossible  to conceive, and felt like he was  our little miracle baby. 10 weeks in I started having a lot of pain, nothing horrible. It was mostly sore, it didnt really alarm us I have chronic pain so we assumed it was just me having a tough couple weeks. It just  got worse, one night i ended up passing out because of the pain and went to the Er. doing tests,  they realized the problem was that because of the scar tissue a lot of my organs and abdomen are covered/wrapped in it and with my womb growing it was pulling at the scar tissue. If had gone for another 2 weeks it would have torn me open and i would have died from internal hemorrhaging before realizing how serious it was.  We had to abort the baby and accept we couldnt have kids. Sil knew about all of this, she was my ‘confidant’ when it came to that because her pregnancy with angel was very rough.

I broke. I just fucking broke. I finally just started yelling at her. I told her she didnt deserve her little girl, that she had been a bad mother who prioritized religion over her daughters fragile health. I told her she should never have kids again because she is too selfish and self absorbed to be a good mother. When we lived in the same city angel was with us and spent the night at our house every weekend, I was the one to pick her up from school, help her with homework, taught her how to bake cookies. All the while SIL was too busy man hopping, going out, spending all her money on eating out, buying clothes and smoking an insane amount of weed. 

When I said that she went to slap me but I smacked her arm away from me, and told her she was a bitch and didn't deserve such an amazing little girl. I turned and went back inside and locked my self in the bathroom. My husband got back not too long after that and as soon as he stepped in she went ballistic on him. I just told him and I Wanted to leave and get a hotel. I told him about it and he was beyond angry. He called her and laid into her about it. She went running to MIL and told her I blamed her for angels death and played victim. Now she's banned us from the funeral. She not allowing to attend at all and a lot of the family is backing her up. Im so fukcing heartbroken I wont be able to say good bye, or be there for my little angel. I’m so divested and I don't know what to do.",31Oct2020,1
393,"I don’t know if I’m overreacting but It’s our 2nd anniversary, I made him some homemade cupcakes and put loads of effort into them. I was going to be making us a nice meal as with lockdown there’s nothing else we can do. I was gonna put on candles and get all cuddly with films. 

I wake up, open our bedroom curtains saying “happy anniversary babe!!” I was excited to go to the farm shop and pick some fresh vegetables with him then maybe go on a little walk around some fields as they’re nice around there.

He wakes up, upset that there are dishes from the night before because we both had a few drinks, not much to affect us a lot and I cooked us a meal at like 1am (I had the munchies) he happily ate it, said it was really nice. Now he’s getting pissed off that I did it and the kitchen is a mess (there was a standard sink load, I washed them in 5 mins) kitchen was then back to normal. He’s pissed off saying he can’t be arsed with today, I haven’t even got a card or flowers. I sat down crying whilst he was in the other room complaining. 

I’m refusing to go shopping, I don’t want to do anything now. It was the same for Mother’s Day, he got his Dad to get me some flowers and a card, I opened the door to his dad and looked at my blank card and flowers, he was still in bed. I said he could stay in bed a little longer but damn.. can’t he even write in the card? Or give me the flowers himself? 

It’s not the card or flowers.. maybe it is abit. It doesn’t have to specifically be a card or flowers but they’re so standard and easy how can you mess that up? I just wanted a little effort.. a little excitement like me. I just wanted to feel like I was special. 

Am I being too sensitive and how do you all think I should have reacted? Should I have just shrugged it off. I have told him how I’ve felt, not really much happened there.",31Oct2020,1
394,So here’s a little recap of what’s going on currently in my life that has pushed me so far as to post it on reddit. I’m aware this group is called advice but I’m really not looking for any of that basic advice I’d like some real opinions. So to begin this month my ex girlfriend suddenly out of know where broke up with me right before a big party I was looking forward to going to with her. Had been with her for about 6 months but really felt like she was the one. had a toxic back and fourth argument with her she wanted me to move on but she would make comments like she loves me and still has feelings and misses me making me plead and cajole for her back super unhealthy and it never worked. right after that my first lieutenant committed suicide he was very influential in my life looked up to the guy it hurt me to hear the news. I recently started to go out and met a girl didn’t exactly have feelings for her but she was cute enough to catch my attention we had one flirty night where we ended up in bed didn’t go all the way cause she said she wasn’t ready which I understand. Then the next day she hits me with “ it’s just the other night was to much for me. I’m not ready for anything. Like wow I don’t know if I’ve been cursed or something but I’ve been having terrible luck lately. Any advice in this situation would be great been trying to distract my self at work but things can get slow and I get inside my head and it’s never good.,31Oct2020,1
395,"Hello everyone. 

Long story short,  I have been offered a job (not as much money,  but the projects they'll be doing next year will be huge and to not be part of that exposure, on't an idiot would say no) 

It's 3rd line consultancy with a little management thrown into it as well.  

But,  about a month ago,  another company potentially offered me a position as well (more money,  but I feel they've strung me along a bit.)

How do i approach this? Do i explain that I've found a position,  thank them for their time? Or,  do i just ignore them? Do I wait? What would other people do basically?

Also,  how would I go about writing the email? I'm sometimes not great at writing formally an d can act a bit crass or Kurt. 

Advice on this would be really appreciated.

So a little background due to some medical complications I don’t believe I’ll be able to have kids when I’m able so which was very devastating for me so In search of something else I’ve had thoughts of going into early childhood education as a career I’m 18 m and I love kids and also I feel teaching is my passion I did a program with my school last year where I worked with kindergarten kids which I had so much fun in and loved but I feel like its looked as odd for men to go into that field I couldn’t say things like “ aww shes so cute “ which is a genuine reaction I might have to seeing a kid do something without getting looked at as being weird it was also looked at as kind of different when I was the only guy who had done the program. I don’t want to get looked at as being someone with ill intent and I’m especially worried about someone making a story that I “touched their kid” just for being male and it would automatically go to me , this would destroy me as said before I love kids but If that happened I don’t know what I would do with my self I have such a passion to teach younger kids and I feel there’s such a lack of male role models in that field I don’t know if my fear is irrational or not but I just wanted to hear from someone.",31Oct2020,1
397, I have seen many of my friends look at Reddit and laugh so I am here to join the fun. What channels (forgot what the r/  things are called). and who/what should I follow? What do I have to do to be active in the community and how do I make friends on Reddit?,31Oct2020,1
399,"She told us about the movie night a day before, and a lot of people told her they'd come but they ended up bailing without prior notice.

400,"Hi all,

So basically TLDR, I (m 26) by chance became friends with a group of guys in school, I suffered and still suffer from strong social anxiety, but because we all loved sports (and didn’t care who knows) I came out of my shell more and more over time with these guys and I need up becoming part of their group. We were the “popular guys” we played sports together for both the school and our local teams, we played video games together, we got drunk together it was great. Then we went to university and it started to change (although not really because it was mainly my social anxiety holding me back) my friends started to talk to new people and invite these people round to our student house for pre drinks and after parties, and we started going to their places too. 
Basically while they all formed new friendships and relationships with new people my social anxiety crippled me and I never really befriended these new people. 
Then there’s the girl, a girl I’ve known for like 6 years now, again, TLDR, I realised too late that we could’ve been together if I wasn’t so dumb and had the wisdom I have now back then.

Okay so onto the problem, I feel as though my friends have sort of ostracised me slowly, I feel like rather than being part of the group I was always the tag along, almost like oh if he comes it’s fine but we’re not gonna invite him, anytime I tried having a serious conversation with them it got deflected like I’d ask why don’t I get invited to anything? I’m not part of any of your group chats, why? And they’d say “no one gets invited it just kind of happens” which I knew straight away that it was complete bullshit. 

And then as for the girl? She’s always been popular, she went to a large high school so had a lot of friends from there, then went to university and made more friends. And I know this sounds weird but we’ve all done it don’t lie, every now and then I’d check her Snapchat score, and for example it went up by like 400 in the space of a day, she’s super active and clearly talks to a lot of friends, and she has a boyfriend who she loves. 

Basically, what do I do to come to terms with all this? I live in a small village in the middle of nowhere, so everyone knows everyone, and making new friends seems really weird and difficult at this point. 

This is very skimmed on the details but yeah, my social life went from my teenage years of being pretty good, to peaking in late high school and then gradually getting worse and worse as the years have gone by to the point where practically only have two friends who wanna do anything with me anymore. I’m depressed as fuck.",31Oct2020,1

403,"My husband and I often recap what we’ve done each day at the end of the night and update our to do lists with what’s been marked off, and what we’ll focus on the next day. It’s a good way to keep track of things and know what the game plan is for the day to come. However, my husband keeps track of my to do list and reminds me of what needs to be done at least 3 times a day. Basically every time I see him during the day he brings up what needs to be done and goes over it with me, even if I’m actively in the middle of doing something on the list. He says he’s just trying to make sure we’re on top of things, but it comes across as he thinks I either don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing or he thinks I’m not capable of it. I update him constantly on the progress of things, but still even after I’ve already told him where I’m at he goes over everything again and sends me an updated list through text of what I need to be doing. These lists are helpful, but at the same time they come across as him treating me like I’m a little kid who needs their hand held through everything. He says he’s just trying to make us better at our planning skills, but to me that’s implying that I’m not good at planning things already. When going over our to do list he spear heads them and takes charge in creating the lists, and I’m just left sitting there like ‘yep, these are the things that need to be done that I am aware of that you’re now spouting at me as if I don’t already know them’

I just don’t know how not to take what I feel like is excessive micromanaging of my to do tasks as him being controlling, nagging, and offensive because it makes me feel like he doesn’t trust me to accomplish these tasks or he feels like I’m not smart enough to do it on my own. I’ve told him this multiple times and he swears he only has good intentions and is not trying to make me feel that way, but yet the micromanaging continues.

We started calling each other pet-names and such and we were even talking about her coming to study in the UK to be closer to me. Fast forward two more weeks to a few days ago and she barely spoke to me (we usually texted while both awake and Facetimed when possible) but she said she was really tired and was sleeping most of the day. I said it was okay and let her sleep. The next day there was still no response from her so I sent a good morning message. Two days later and a couple messages from me (as well as two missed Facetime calls) and there's still no response. Overnight her snap score went up meaning she has been active just not with me.

412,"When I moved into my new place in May, I was shocked by two things: my landlord's warning that the tenants above me in our two-family house were fussy and demanded exclusive use of the driveway and backyard space and that there would be no lease, as she only wants to paid in cash.   


The tenants upstairs are difficult. They pick fights over anything and have gotten angry at me in the past just for parking in front of my apartment because, apparently, they want exclusive use of street parking as well. When I put up a [""We Believe""](https://www.google.com/search?q=we+believe+sign&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS917US917&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU0pzWhN_sAhUygnIEHamIDS4Q_AUoAnoECAwQBA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=_UOrYZmnQHiO_M) flag next to my door last week, the tenants demanded I put it down in a matter of hours. They immediately called the landlord to complain and told me I was ""endangering their property and their lives"" but putting up a flag that could offend people. I compromised and told my landlord that because I have a constitutional right to put up a flag and represent my views (and identity as a gay POC), I would hang it on one of my windows instead.   


The tenants complained again. My landlord agreed it is my right to put up the flag, but has insisted now again that I take it down because she is the homeowner, she doesn't want the flag hanging on my window, and she wants to ""make everyone happy"" because the other tenants are upset. I don't know what to do. My father suggests I stand my ground, citing discrimination and holding onto my rights as an American.

414,"Kind of given up on myself, don’t have any goals or dreams and am slugging through studying I don’t like but have to do. Living but dying on the inside. Feel behind on everything and like I took a wrong turn in life and there’s no u-turn in sight. Mostly, I feel alone. 

Anytime I think to myself to want to get better, I shut that down with: what’s the point, I’m not going to feel better, I’m always going to reminded of my past failures, and life is never going to be as good as I thought it to be. 

I realize maybe shutting my self down is a coping mechanism for trying to be in control. I also realize ive forgotten so much of my recent years. I don’t recognize myself fully and feel like a character in everyone else’s life, and non existent in my own. 

I’ve realized maybe another coping mechanisms is to indulge in my own pity as a form of validation. I don’t know how to get out of this one. People say reach out and talk to others about your problems, but I‘m realizing I don’t want to be the seen as pitiful anymore. And no one is interested in that.

I also feel abandoned and alone. And this reinforces feelings of low worth. So why invest in myself. This is where I self sabotage as well. For example I want to buy nice clothes for myself and indulge in a hobby of creating things but then think what’s the point if I can’t share it with anyone or have anyone else appreciate it? So any motivation is just squashed. 

The only coping mechanism left is to just power through life at the bare minimum with no thought but to survive. But that isn’t working out either. 

I’m not suicidal but I feel that I understand a little of how someone might feel.  It feels like no one in the world truly understands or can help.

1. I haven’t seen my best friend in months. In those months we’ve very much grown apart; more than I thought we had. I’m coming to realize that my control freak tendencies will likely not mesh well with her free spiritedness and I’m worried that living together will make us hate each other. 
2. This was a rushed decision. We had planned to move together anyway but she pushed me to move the date forward from January to November. Two months is making a lot more of a difference than I thought it would.
3. This isn’t the first time I’ve moved out. I moved out when I was 18 for college and long story short had a meltdown, went through hell, and had to come home. Now, at nearly 21, I’m worried this mission will fail again. I’m very torn between wanting my own adult independence and being absolutely petrified of leaving my parents house, where I’m lucky enough to not have to worry about paying for any bills and I know it’s safe. 
I’ll be 8 hours away from home again and i’m afraid I’ll be like a lost country mouse in the big city all over again. My sudden anxiety is through the roof. How can I get over it and make the best of this situation? How do I get rid of the homesickness when it inevitably comes? How do I deal? Thanks in advance.",31Oct2020,1
418,"So I work as a Security Officer/EMT as my second job (part time). A promotion is coming up that I plan on applying for that will get me making more annually even if I quit my full time job on the ambulance. I will be working way less hours weekly and making more and be working waiting closer to home, it sounds perfect! My biggest concern is the competition from employees who have been with the casino longer. They have applied for the promotion in the past but have been turned down, I'm unsure of the reason though. Another concern I have is that we are short staffed on EMTs and they might want to just keep me where I am so they don't have another EMT spot open. What can make me stand out from the rest of the applicants? I have no negative marks on my record and even though I'm still newer (about 9 months with the casino), I still have a lot more reports completed and more calls Ive responded to that most of the ""veteran"" security officers.",31Oct2020,1

421,"So I needed cash badly to pay some bills so I wanted to do some loan and it wasn’t illegal loaning or anything but through the web ( stupid I know ) anyway wanted to loan 3 k So I submit my request and few hour later a man reach out to me. His name is John  and as he go along to talk about the loan, there was many requirement needed to meet. 

At first I was hesitant but desperate needs call for desperate time so I screenshot my id and everything. But the requirement they need to loan 3k was inconvenient because he needed meet to pay an upfront of 500 dollar to basically show that I was capable of paying that 3 k back. 

He explain it’s due to the whole covid and economic that they needed ppl who were able to pay back as many who loan from them before could pay back as they had loss their job.

So I told Issac off and explain to him that I’m  not confident enough to give someone 500 without knowing if they are to guarantee that 3k because this could honestly be a scam 

Anyway I rejected that loan.. this is where is gets even more dumb and yea I’m so Fucking stupid 

So John  has been talking and chatting with me and he was over friendly and yes I flirt back and then he made this offer that if I were to video call for 10 min he would give me 400 dollar . Gosh I’m so stupid coz that’s what I did and I should have request for the money first but I guess we both couldn’t trust each other but obviously I’m much more dumber coz I did it in the end 

Flash myself for 10 min and even strange how he didn’t appear on the screen at all but of course he was presence. 

Long story short , he didn’t pay up and i think more than not having that 400 dollar  I was so afraid he would post that vide online and he even have a picture of my id and everything . 

So please please advice me on how I can cope with this . Or what should I do next or even how do I know if he post that video  of me online.",31Oct2020,1

Also I live outside of the city so not taking the car to school would be a bit tricky.

In the meantime my 15 years old son made his coming out early October. I have no issue with that but it was unexpected, my husband was quite in denial for a few days before being ok with it. 
But since his coming out, he started to have mood swings, he is pretty irritated. He told us that he hates himself and he doesn't want to be gay. 
Now he thinks he is the reason of his dad's depression. So dad tried to explain him that he had nothing to do with it but he still refuses to believe it. 

I want my son to do therapy but he said I want him to do a conversion therapy which is obviously not the case. Now he thinks everybody in the house is against him because even his brother (16) support the therapy. 

Now it doesn't help that my husband doesn't want to get help either. He went through therapy as a kid and he thinks it didn't work. 

I know that my son has some identity issues, he needs time to accept himself and therapy should help him.

432,"So I work for a company that pays me base + commissions. I've converted leads mostly inbounds and some outbounds. Now, we are undergoing retraining as we all need to generate outbound leads as well.

Unfortunately, despite being 4 years doing this kind of job for different products/companies, cold calls just never cut it for me. I can speak to people, but just randomly appealing to them and making a connection B2B wise isn't something I could do. (Plus I'm just not happy with my career overall in general - trying to find something else but unsure what yet).

Now, my manager told us that we can inform him that if we're not able to shift for this change, we can either try to find a different opportunity either outside or inside the company, or just focus mainly on inbounds itself which may either be cause for reevaluation for our stay in the company along with a reduced pay/commission rate. The thing is, since June, I generated the most leads to be transferred to sales, surprisingly more than other people in my department.

I've already talked to him before in terms of my career that I'm fine proceeding with sales and I'd like to reduce the level of calls that I'm doing both inbound and outbound, to the point of perhaps being more in the analyst/project roles.

I [20 M] graduated with a degree in software engineering this year while working at a fast food restaurant part time. I have searched for nearly 6 months for a job but to no avail. With little practice post graduating I am feeling my qualification for that field slip from me.

I ended up finding a job as a package handler at UPS which is extremely physically demanding but give me a place that I can more easily move up in a company (ideally anyway) but will take a lot of time and it would be in an area that I am generally unhappy with.

434,"Hi everyone,
I am 22 years old and I've had a heck of a time in my early adulthood. I dropped out of school at around 16 and have only recently gone back to studying and am expected to get my HISET done with by the end of the year and afterwards I plan to go to a community college and then transfer to my local state college. However, I need a goal to work towards. 

All I know is that the sooner I can make good money, the better. My younger brother by two years has pretty severe autism and my only relative is my father, who had us pretty late in life, and he is getting up there in age and I would like to be able to support them as soon as I can. 

When I was younger, my goal used to be becoming a novelist or editor. I loved writing, but then I discovered that I liked working with people and knowing my work had a positive impact on them. My father used to be a lawyer, and I really liked the work that he did, but I know you have to study for a long time for that, and maybe after I get my bachelors I will pursue that route, but as much as I don't want to think about it, I am on a bit of a time crunch. I used to secretly love math and science as well - it just was never my best subject.

 I think the most important things are that the job pays well enough to support three people (and an esa rabbit), that there is an element of working with people in some form and maybe a lower level of schooling required. 

I know I'm probably asking for too much, but I would just like ideas. I'm willing to put in the extra hours and effort for anything that will help me support my little family.

Thank you.",31Oct2020,1
435,"Hi reddit, my girlfriend has told me recently she wants me to talk to someone about my mental health. Of course the world being the way it is at the moment, a lot of people are getting pretty down. I myself am finding it very difficult to handle my emotions, especially my patience and anger recently. I feel like things aren’t going so great for me recently and I am finding it very difficult to deal with other people’s problems like my partner. I feel like 6 months ago I could help and support someone fine and listen to their rants etc, now I feel like I don’t want to listen to a second of it. I feel like small little things like knocking something over makes me so angry and I don’t even know why. I am 25 and I lost my mother at 21 due to alcoholism, I just sort of dealt with it and got on with life, but my partner wants me to talk to a therapist or something about it because she feels like I haven’t dealt with it well, or it could of done some damage, and I have an obscur version or normal (growing up with alcoholism). I’m defiantly not being a great partner recently and really want to change, I remember the saying you can’t love someone until you love yourself, and recently I feel like I hate myself.
My question is who should I talk to? I’ve never really talked to anyone about problems, not a professional I mean. My girlfriend mentioned you could do it online? Sorry for the rant but I would love some advice on where I can get some advice on dealing with myself.

436,"please respond i need help today-this is my first ever reddit post so i’m not sure how to do this

me and one of my friends were wrestling last thursday and he ended up breaking my collarbone in 3 places and i just had surgery for it. 

there’s this kid who i’m mutual friends with and talk to somewhat often and me and him wrestled and he is about 2-3 inches bigger and way stronger and somehow i won and made him tap. then after that he was embarrassed so he wanted to fight and i didn’t want to bitch out so i said okay but then he wanted to do it a whole month out so he could “train”. so i was like no we fight now or never and he said no i’m not fighting right now. so we didn’t and then the next day i was at my friends and we wrestled and that’s when i broke the collarbone.

fast forward to today, he wants to fight and he’s telling all our friends he’s going to fight me. everyone’s like “what’s wrong with you he has a broken collarbone he can’t fight back” and he keeps saying he’s going to beat my ass now (not to me only to other people he thinks i don’t know bout this) and he keeps saying “life ain’t fair and neither are fights”. kell in mind- he doesn’t now how to fight he’s never fought someone which i have and i love mma but i can’t win with only one arm 

*btw i can’t say no to fighting because it’ll be at a halloween party with my girlfriend there and lots of my friends and even if i say no he will still try to do it*

so here are my options -
1. just throw a haymaker when he try’s to fight me and just hope the haymaker lands and he gets a bloody nose or knocked out so it looks like i won
2. kick him in the balls then just beat his ass- i know this will make me a pussy and way less of a man but idk what to do
3. act ghetto and say people will jump him if he try’s this- because for some reason he thinks i’m ghetto so i could just act the part and make him scared

He wasn't a good texter and he's also very busy cox he was running his own business but since he called daily I understood him and was patient. We've been talking for like 5 months in total but starting this month he has been very busy suddenly out of nowhere. And his night calls stopped completely. I was still understanding. He stopped replying to my messages completely and I had to keep double triple texting to get a reply. I was still understanding since he's the one fully running his father's business and he also said that he can't call at night because his cousin was staying at his home.  I was still patient but then i realised that he had softblocked me from Instagram. That was the last straw and I just lost my patience and started fussing. He kept saying it was his friend's who might have done it and he swore up and down on it.  I was upset so I just left it and he just completely ignored me for 3 days. I was waiting but he was just missing so I got worried and texted him and he was like he was waiting for me to calm down since he doesn't like to fight.

And I know that lotion isn’t for everyone but she is obviously very dry and she keeps scratching at it. It’s obviously very uncomfortable but she refuses to do anything about it. In the two years I have been with her, I have only seen her wash her face once. Even if we’re in the shower together and I offer some, she won’t take it. She didn’t take care of her skin. And her hands are cracked and bloody from dryness and yet she refuses to do anything about that either. I’m trying not  to push it on her because it’s her choice if she wears lotion but it makes me sad to see her not taking care of herself. She also has a pretty serious medical problem that she don’t want to take care of or do anything about. I offer to take her to the doctor and hold her hand but she says it “too scary” even though this problem could be life threatening.  

I’m so worried that other self care things will come up and she’ll ignore those too.  I just want her to take better care of herself so I can have her in my life for longer. I dont know how to tell her that she needs to wash her face at least once a week, that when her skin is peeling and itchy, she needs lotion, and when important medical things come up, she needs to take care of it.  

How do I politely tell her that she needs to take better care of herself? It makes me sad to see that she is ignoring her needs.",31Oct2020,1

457,"(English isn’t my first language and I am a Muslim)

So I got into r/Noahgettheboat and saw the usual of Pakistani rape and pedophilia story, but 90% of the comments are targeting Islam for having rules that allow rape and pedophilia, as a Muslim I find one thing intriguing, most of all religion and how to follow that religion is written in books and talked from one another through generations. If so, then while passing religion down via speech someone can just lie about it or someone can just write false and hints about religion, however I am not going to point fingers and target anyone’s religion as they have their choice to follow their own religion

I think too much of misinformation has been spread just because we have too different opinions on religion, even in Islam it is allowed for Muslims and Christians to live together as long as they don’t do anything to offend or cause an argument/war, Muslims and Christians can even marry and have kids as long as there isn’t any conflict about religion between them or to the kids 

(tl:dr): I saw a post on r/Noahgettheboat that had Pakistani rape and pedophilia, comment section was targeting each others religion instead of talking about Pakistani culture about it, a lot of misinformation has been spread, lies can easily be spread via talking and written books

Can you give me your opinion on this topic if it doesn’t bother you too much as it has been troubling me a lot",31Oct2020,1
458,"I'm a minimalist, and not a very spiritual person. My family knows this.

But every year, on Christmas and birthdays, I get a barrage of knick-knacks and spiritual/motivational magnets, things like that. 

I've tried to politely suggest other gifts (even making  and sharing an amazon wish-list), or making a donation to a any of a number of charities instead. But it never works. My family likes to 'surprise' people when they give gifts, and it's a no-no not to have a physical gift on a holiday/birthday. And no, they won't do gift cards because they're too impersonal.

Every year I dread my birthday and Christmas, because I know I'm going to get a bunch of junk that I don't want and won't use. And I feel so bad about it that I can't throw them away, so my basement is packed full of these old gifts. 

And that is my big problem; I have a hoard of things that I can't throw away or donate and serve no purpose but to take up space.

It makes me sad because it feels like no one is paying attention to what I actually like and who I actually am. Like, the gifts might be tangentially related to an interest of mine, but are things that anyone who has spent two seconds with me would know I don't want. 

I don't know what to do. I feel guilty that people are spending money on something I won't enjoy, I feel too bad about that to get rid of the gifts, and I feel sad that no one seems to know me very well.

I'm just not the kind of person that likes ornamental items, and I'm just not very spiritual., and I reallt bristle at those phony motivational quotes

 I don't know if this is my family's way of trying to change how I am or just not paying attention, but it's very frustrating. It feels almost as if it's being done purposefully.

I'm at my whits end, and my basement's end. I can't keep hoarding these gifts down there and the clutter is driving me mad.

What can I say that won't hurt someone's feelings, but will get them to stop buying me gifts?  Or do I have to bite the bullet and just say that they could better spend their money on someone they will enjoy? I can't bear the clutter or the guilt much longer.",31Oct2020,1
459,"So 4 months ago I met this chick who caught my eye and I’ve been hooked on her ever since. It’s been a rough road, ups and downs like crazy. She said she liked me, then I told her my feelings and she left me. Then came back, then sent mixed messages, then admitted she never truly liked me. So one night I got drunk and texted her asking to just have one date, no commitments no anything, just two friends going out to have fun so we can say we tried. She agreed. The week leading up too it, things seemed to change. She was texting me a lot more and sending signs. So the night came, and we went to mini golf. The connection felt amazing, and we had a great time. Afterwards we went and parked my truck my the local river landing. I asked for a kiss when in term lead to a make out session, which lead to more. Nothing too crazy just oral sex. Afterwards we cuddled and it was amazing. She told me she might have started catching feelings. Whenever we’d hang out before she’d always be watching the clock and when it was time to go she was not scared to tell me otherwise, then I’d immediately have to drop her off. This night she wanted to stay with me, and would even delay her curfew. Now Ik everything sounds good, but I’m scared. What Changed? And we did consume a little bit of alcohol that night (we both only had about 3-4 beers) and I hope it wasn’t that and she was just looking for a hookup. What do y’all think, can feelings change like that? Or you think she might have just want led to hook up? She was the one to initiate the oral sex too. I hope she has feelings",31Oct2020,1
460,"I (M28) have a 2 y/o son. His mom and I broke up about a year ago and I've been raising him ever since. It was a rough breakup for me but I'm handling things my own way. Long story short, my ex is a narcissistic, lying , manipulative alcoholic. She has lied to me more times than I can count. She hasn't had to work a day in her life because she's used to getting everything for free. She's dealt with alcoholism since before I met her about 7 years ago. I was always there for her, first out of what I thought was love and then for our son, until I couldn't take it anymore. 

She is still in the picture and visits our son sometimes but never for more than a few hours. She has never taken care of him or given him the attention and love he deserves. To her it's more important to be hooking up with the guy of the month, partying and getting drunk.

I don't mind raising my son by myself. I love my little guy to pieces. I don't mind that my ex is the way she is anymore. Personally, I'm working through the breakup and doing pretty well. What pains, worries and angers me is seeking that little boy craving for his mom's love and she only gives him so little. It fills me up with fear knowing that he will grow up and ask me about her. How will I handle that? Do I tell him she's sick? That she doesn't love him? That she cares more about herself than anyone else, including him? What do I do if he ever finds out his mom is involved with different men? Or gets teased at school because she's a drunk and a slut? Can I spare him from this pain in any way?",31Oct2020,1
461,"I'm currently working on a political campaign and I moved across the country for a few months so that I could work on the ground with this campaign. I was really looking forward to the campaign finishing and being able to come back home to see my girlfriend and family, but I got hired for a job that wants me to start soon after Election Day (in about a week).

This job is in another state, so I would have to pack up and move again, which isn't a big deal but I would really really like some time home so I can spend some quality time with my loved ones. This situation is pretty much my fault since I said in the interview that I'd like to start as soon as possible, but I expected there to be some onboarding and time allowed for me to get ready to move.

Since Thanksgiving is coming up, I'd optimally want to start after then, so that I have time to 1. move back home, 2. spend time with friends and family, 3. find an apartment, and 4. quarantine before starting work.

I feel like I shot myself in the foot by saying I wanted to start ASAP in the interview and I really don't want to start off this job on the wrong foot, so what do you think would be the best way to navigate this situation?",31Oct2020,1
462,"I started a new program this year. It’s a 4 year program with 25 students. It’s part of a larger cohort of 125 students. Over the last 2 months, most of us in the 25 student cohort have gotten close. We help each other out a lot and stuff like that. One of the students in the cohort is gay like me. He is 20 years older than me, I am 25. I posted something on social media and this classmate messaged me and started chatting with me. He didn’t know I was gay but I basically came out to him because the post indicated that I could be gay. When coming out to him, I basically shared my entire life story with him, as he wanted to know more and I wanted to share. We were bonding so well. We also ended up both flirting. The next day I messaged him a random joke during (online) class and he initiated a flirting session and asked me a sexual question. He is in an open relationship. I am single. I have attachment problems. We chatted for 2 hours on face time that night. We exchanged nudes, talked about our sexual preferences, etc. Things escalated quick and the sexual tension was high. By the 3rd day chatting, we made preliminary plans to meet up half way for the following weekend as we live about 7 hours away from each other - the plan fell through the next day. Later that week, I was messaging him being a little foolish and he wasn’t responding. I was being annoying basically, but that’s because I felt comfortable with him, I didn’t think it would set him off - it did. He said to me to detach. I told him ok no problem I was like “I know I’m a little crazy lol” and then he replied with “it’s good you know you’re not healthy” or something along those lines. I think I pissed him off because I was being a little immature in my messaging saying things like “answer me!” I was being needy. 

I was really excited to have a new friend and a friend with benefits. That’s all we agreed on and we had said that we would build new boundaries as the relationship went on. After that argument with him, I was like I’m going to back off and let him message me next. He got sick later that week and messaged me yesterday apologizing for not being in touch with me and that he was sick. I told him no worries and that I wanted to get an update on boundaries after last time. He said he really regrets being inappropriate with me and he wants to remain professional. He apologized and said he should’ve been the more mature one. I told him that’s all good, we can make that happen still. 

I lost some sleep over this. I feel a little hurt about it. It’s like I showed him my real and true self, and then he decided it wasn’t for him, which is whatever that’s fine - it doesn’t change the fact that I’m hurt about it. I want to move on by blocking him on all social media’s and just cutting ties with him. I don’t want to be professional with him, whatever that means. I’m here to learn and grow yeah, but I don’t want to have to stress about what I can or can’t say around him. I also just feel a little betrayed, because it all happened so quick. But I’m conflicted because I know it’s immature/unprofessional to block someone, especially in a professional program like the one I’m in. But also, who cares? Like I should be able to do what I need to get over it and move on. So I’m really conflicted I’m not sure what to do. 

I know this was long, hope someone can give me some advice on this. Thanks!",31Oct2020,1
463,"So I know this girl vaguely. My ex was in her friend group. I ran into her maybe a little more than a handful of times always at parties, never got close to her but never had issues with her either. A few years passed and she had a baby. 

Her baby is 11 months old I believe and starting around when the baby was 2 months old she posted videos of her going out and drinking. It wasn't anything too bad at first just maybe once a week she would go to a bar. Which I am not judgemental of Moms do deserve to have me time and go out. However she continued to go out more and more and stay out later and later and pretty soon all her social media stories would be of her drinking.

I felt off about it but wasn't sure what to do I decided to mind my own, sounds like I was not the only ones with concerns. She made a huge facebook post about people talking behind her back. It was a picture of her taking a drink of alcohol while holding her baby. It was long and more insightful but the jist of it was that she is still a person and still have a life and that she doesn't have to explain herself, that her child is her everything. And as a young parent she has no guilt enjoying the things she did before having the baby (still keeping his best interest in mind). And that she craves excitement and parenthood doesn't have to be all grown up basically. And most of the time she only makes a cocktail to take a sip then pour the rest out.

Okay fair enough post. I kind of forgot about it and was minding my own business but her social media stories got worse and worse. She was posting about alcohol and doing shots literally 5-6 days a week. Or drinking at 7am. I would be waking up for my day at 5am and see she posted an hour ago that she was still faded and partying from last night. Some things she shared to her social media stories are: a bill of $300 that she spent on alcohol for a girls night for her and one other girl that they finished all the alcohol in one night. Her having her baby in a baby carrier strapped to her chest while she danced at an outdoor club drinking. Her drinking until 5am each snap chat had her progressively drinking and getting more drunk. Her being drunk around her friends or at a bar almost every night. Her husband isn't really shown in the stories maybe he is taking care of the baby but still? Even when she has her friends babysit her friends are lit too the other night she reposted her friend basically drunk off wine while watching her baby so she could have a night to herself.

I feel like I am not close enough to her to say something but I really do not know what to do. I believe she is over-drinking to the point where there has to be some neglect going on (even if it is unintentionally).",31Oct2020,1
464,"My family says I’m lazy and entitled. I have quit many jobs and chances to go to school since I graduated high school in 2016. I’ve been trying to figure out what I want to do and become a better person but I’ve just felt weird and trapped since I graduated 


I did a lot of drugs in highschool but even before that I was always acting up, and a bit wild. Something on me now just feels like numb. I have little drive to do things , I’m a bit akward , I have a hard time communicating and focusing, and overall I’m just confused.

I like exercising, eating and cooking clean food, computers, bass music, YouTube videos, movies, tea, salad, snowboarding, ect. 

I don’t have a good relationship with my family. My grandmothers old and harder to communicate with but I love her dearly, I just find it hard and I motivating to have a relationship with her. My mother just works all the time and is a bit crazy having delt with me my brother and my father as we were growing up. She was put under a tremendous amount of stress and now resents me for moving over to my grandparents in high school. We can’t really communicate, and she says she refuses to have a relationship with me until I get a job and support myself. She hasn’t been there as a mother since I was young, but she always supported me and tried to keep me going down the right path.

I live on my own. I live with three guys I dislike , they are loud and unclean. They slam doors at night and it bothers me so much. I was working at Pizza Hut. I’ve been tryna go back to school but I’m not in a position to take on the loan my parents say I need to get . They said if I pass my classes they will pay it off. Ok . I don’t know what I want to do and I had a job as an industrial electrician but quit it after a day. 


I’m constantly back and forth on things. Can never make up my mind. Worry about things, yet I feel like my brain doesn’t work right. My moods sometimes up sometimes down and I just feel a bit unstable and weird. 

I’ve got an appointment to see a counselor in November , and then a path in January. I’ve been scared for so long to see a doctor and get on medication but I just want to get to a point I’m happy again. 

Sometimes I feel fine and am totally happy with myself others I just feel dead inside and like an old man. 

Overall I’m a pretty positive and easy going person though. I take care of myself and am thankful for what I have.


My mom and brother have always said I have no problems it’s all in my head. That’s maybe what stopped me from getting help for so long. I tried to just deal with it. I tried eating clean, fasting , exercising, ect. It was so hard for me to come to the realization I might need to seek mental help.

Everyone calls me lazy and entitled. I know I need to get a job and work for what I got. Part of me just doesn’t want to. Everytime I get into something I psych me self out and quit it. I just want to find something I enjoy. 

I have no problem with hard work I’m just confused and don’t know what way to turn. 

How can I help myself/ change these negative thought patterns. Does it sound like I need mental help? How should I deal with my family issues? 

Am I just lazy and entitled? How do I go about changing that about myself?

Thanks in advance",31Oct2020,1

468,"So to give more context, I have a friend group on discord and the age range is mostly 17-21 with a few 16 year olds or younger. We play games a lot and are in voice calls almost every day. I'd say we're a pretty close group and are always supportive of each other.

I would also like to mention that our group is very age conscious and have no tolerance for the older guys flirting or making a move on one of the girls who are younger.

Approaching the night, everyone slowly left a vc we were in for a couple of hours, one by one until it was just me and Taylor (fake name for obvious reasons). At the start we were really just talking about life and random shit and it was deep.

We talked about our families and how we used games or anime as an escape from life, and the conversation shifted to dreaming. He told me how he uses dreaming, or more specifically lucid dreaming, as a way to cope or deal with his thoughts.

Taylor told me that he would dream about r*ping people, and said something along the lines of, ""It's human morals to think it's wrong, but I'm still curious about it and want to know what it's like."" This being in place of the r*pist. He also often talks about hentai and told me he has dreams about having sex.

I was taken aback and didn't want to freak out in the call. I tried to tell him it was wrong but he didn't budge so I shifted the conversation into something else and left the call. Now I'm really uncomfortable and don't know what to do.

I'm very close with the owner of the server but I'm not sure if saying anything about it would be the right thing to do.

Now that the context is set, let me dive into the event. When we were walking a motorbike almost swerved into us. My friend had to jump in order to not get hit. The biker was drunk and he was carrying someone else who was dead drunk and wasn't even concious I guess.
Despite this the biker had the audacity to ask us to ""fuck off"" when my friend looked at him in a bewildered expression.

This made me stare that biker down and while he asked me to walk away I had some choice words for him in my mother tongue as well. He kept shouting but I ignored him, picked my friend up and went on walking.

A further 80-90 meters down the road the biker chases after me. I finally stop when I realise that he was indeed chasing me. My friend stopped a bit ahead of me because he chose flight mode while I chose fight mode.

I stood my ground with my arms up while he kept hurling abuses at me telling me that he would literally ""slap the shit out of me"". But he didn't attack, just kept screaming and showing his fists. Then gathering all his strength he did push me, but it had very little effect on me as I just went back a couple of steps and found my balance again. 

I took out my little surface spray sanitiser and sprayed it on my tee because I didn't want any of his filthy hands on me. And I motioned him to come again at me rolling my eyes at him like you would to an annoying kid.
This made him even madder and he kept hurling abuses. Now I was ready to strike him, even had my fist balled up .

This is the point when a few of his friends ran up to hold him back and asked me to walk away and why did I abuse him and blah blah blah. I simply told them please hold your friend back from drinking and driving.

I waved goodbye to the guy too and could still hear him screaming abuses as we walked ahead.

Now I know that I acted responsibly, kept my head calm and dealt with the situation so as to not cause a physical fight. But somewhere in me I also feel that I should have smacked that idiot a bit to kick some sense into him.
On the other hand I also know that street fights often lead to horrible conclusions and we should always avoid violence when possible.

So reddit, please give me some advice on what to do in such situations. And what if something like this happens when I am out with a girl/woman. What do I do then?

Edit: because of the tragic thing that happened to me a few years ago I like to think that I’m pretty strong mental and can deal with some shit but this has just fucking hit me hard because of all the things going on in my life rn.

I moved into uni in September and after a week or 2 I’ve become the one that my mates play all the pranks on (all silly stuff like moving my food from my fridge and putting my slippers in the freezer) and then a week ago our flat was at spoons all a bit drunk and they all started to send pictures of me with weird Snapchat filters on to the group chat whilst I was just sitting there feeling shit. 

Yesterday I forgot to lock my door as I usually do when I go out and they took my bed, drawers and bin out of my room and we’re just sitting on it down the hallway when I got back.
These pranks and general talking shit about me behind my back and taking the piss out of me would be fine if it wasn’t just me being the but off the joke every time but when together my flatmates all just go for me.

I’ve had a big tragic thing happen to my family a few years back which my flatmates know somewhat about so these pranks and cunty behaviour towards me hasn’t even been my biggest problem/worry at uni (therefore as I don’t seem to be that affected by them taking the piss out of me, it might be why they’re always going for me)

The annoying thing is individually they’re all really nice to me and I enjoy going out and spending time with them when they’re not together, so it’s tough as if I say anything it’s gonna make it awkward and horrible for me as because of corona they’re the only “friends” I’ve made at uni and it’s not like I can just distance myself completely from them and hang out with another group which would probably be the best thing to do. 

Along with the family problems I have my flatmates have really made my confidence and self esteem fall down rapidly from where I was mentally at the start of university.

I’m really stuck I don’t know what to do as the 3 other guys in my flat would be the ones i will move into a house with next year (but I don’t think I could handle them if it continues like this) and I don’t want lose the only “friends” I’ve made so far at uni.

TL;DR: flatmates always playing pranks on me all the time and talking shit about me when together but individually they’re all really caring and nice to me. I need advice on if/how I should confront them or who to ask for proper help from",31Oct2020,1
475,"Favouritism is rife in my family. I just so happen to be the favourite grandchild. My grandparents have always gone the extra mile for me and we share a close bond. They recently came into quite a bit of money and I honestly cried with relief when they offered to pay my rent for my final two semesters of university. My life has been turned upside down by this pandemic and this money is going to help me get me back on my feet and kick start my future. 

Here’s the problem; my brother (18M) is not the favourite grandchild. He is my mother and father’s favourite child. He is very similar to my father in terms of aspirations and interests and I suppose I’ve just always been a bit of a rebel in comparison. He found out about the money today and he’s clearly hurt. We aren’t close at all and this revelation has created a lot of resentment. I don’t even blame him. His life has been turned upside down too and it’s not his fault that my family has this shitty dynamic of picking favourites. If I’m honest, I don’t even deserve the money. I haven’t held down a job in a year due to mental health issues and the pandemic while he has been out working while studying. I feel like I’ve been gifted something I don’t deserve. My mother is enraged about this. Like I said, he is her favourite and she also feels I’ve done nothing to deserve this. I just want to make things right. I tried to refuse to accept the money but my grandparents wouldn’t listen and I didn’t want to seem ungrateful. I feel awful.

477,"So my country is going back into confinement and I’m struggling again. The first time around, I had a hard time getting myself out of bed and motivating myself to do even the simplest things became a real challenge.

I told myself I’d try working out, get some fresh air at least once a day and again, it’s only been 2 days, but it feels like it’s been 5 weeks already. Has anyone else struggled with this?

478,"Throwaway. 

Over the past few weeks, I (23F) have developed such severe anxiety about being seriously ill or dying that it's starting to affect my life. I wake up in the night panicking, can't focus on work, have to try and calm myself down multiple times a day. I just want to go back to how I was before. 

I don't know why it started really. But all of a sudden I keep conjuring up all these scenarios in my head like: I've had a few headaches recently, what if I have a brain tumour and I don't know? What if I'm infertile, can't have kids, and my partner leaves me? What if someone I've been with has given me HIV and I don't know it? What if, what if, what if?

Realistically, I have no reason to believe any of these things. I have no symptoms of anything being physically wrong. There's no family history/no reason for me to believe I'm infected with anything. 

But the what if's are eating me alive. I'm so scared I'll someday find out I'm sick and it'll be too late. Every time I even see like a photo of a married couple on Instagram or a baby, I think to myself 'Well, you're going to die so you can't have that'. And I don't really know what to do/how to get out of this phase of anxiety. Any advice please?",31Oct2020,1
479,"As the title suggests I have a friend who was instructed by our government health service to quarantine. He isn’t, he works as a bar tender which is not a good spot for people to be going in the first place and while he is working there it’s so much worse. I’m tempted to call the health services and get the bar he works at shut down. Especially since the fact that I’m sure at least one person at the bar knows he is supposed to be isolating and they haven’t done a thing about it. Where I’m from the fine is serious with potential jail time and IMO he’s breaking the law and putting hundreds of people at risk. Also our city has set record cases daily for the past week and it’s getting bad again.

So I’m just wondering if I’m over reacting about this or if I should do what I think is the right thing and call. Another option is to have a talk with him but what am I going to be able to say to change his mind. I might just call the bar he works at and report it.",31Oct2020,1
480,"Hello! So I live with my parents and they are hoarders. My father passed away so now Its just my mother, brother, and I. I first noticed the hoarding in my room at the age of around 15 due to having a friend over and not having enough living room (bedroom) to even have a common guest over.

Most of that particular hoard was due to old papers from school however since I have been able to remove them.

Fast forward to now and im still living in the same house yet the entire house is full of trash in every room except for mine.

The garage is full. The kitchen is trash. The Living Room is not Livable (although walkable and my father actually just died in this exact room overnight). 

The office room is completely full of junk that has been sorted into boxes as well as several large industrial printers that have never been used ever not even once as well as several other pieces of junk.

Its a 3 bedroom 2 bath house.

The other 2 rooms are occupied by my mother and brother. The parents room has always been messy. My brothers old room is actually now halfway filled with junk (I really don't have any other way to describe these random things that take up space).

1. What do/should I do?

I have seen the TV show Hoarders on AE Network and it seems to me like the people who hoard are always somehow aware of their situation yet unable/unwilling to change.

They claim to have several different thousand uses for items that are never actually used. The intent is possibly 100 the execution is 0.

The house itself is actually in bad shape due to the hoard as well. The ceiling in the garage has been removed and replaced with makeshift doors. There is no garage door.

I want the wall in the garage smashed and all the junk removed as well as the ceiling fixed as well as any repairs that need to be done.

My mother is incompetent when it comes to cleaning.

Honestly I believe it does/will take a ""Visionary"" to complete this project.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you!

I was diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder last year as well so I don't really handle confrontation well, I'm very sensitive and cry or have panic attacks as well as generalized anxiety. I go out of my way to avoid my sister and stay in my room but she still finds ways to berate me and call me weak, pathetic; find me in her way, or inconveniencing her somehow. She takes everything I personally and makes me feel guilty for even existing often. Even me avoiding her upsets her more as if she can't see why I want to avoid her. She recently expressed she feels she has to be on tiptoe around me despite her being the cause of the issues we have. (Maybe it's a neurodivergent and neurotypical divide?)

I didn't want to see the inside of a church again  ever, but when some friends invited me to their kid's baptism, I  resigned myself to sitting through the ceremony just to be polite. Then I  found out it's not a stand-alone event, it's part of their weekly  church service (TBH I have no idea if this is typical).

The  invitation gives me the option to attend only the reception, which is 2  hours later, but somehow I feel like I'm being selfish and a bad friend  if I take that option. At the same time, it would be optimistic to  predict I'll find the service meaningless and be bored out of my mind  for 2 hours . I may actively hate it.

1. RSVP No
2. RSVP Yes to reception only
3. RSVP Yes to both

488,"I ended up pregnant. I’m in college, I did everything right (I was on BC and he had a condom). I had terrible odds and ended up being the fluke that gets pregnant. Yay me.  

So here I am, 7 (I think) weeks pregnant with a confirmed blood test.  I got a call today to schedule my first OB appointment and just sobbed.  

I always wanted kids, but obviously right now is not the right time. I have been with my boyfriend with 4 years now, from high school up to the same college.  He graduates next year and has plans to go directly into his masters.  I’m on track to graduate with my BS in 3 years.  A baby right now is it good.  

I’ve been weighing my options.  I’m considering the pill abortion, but it’s extremely expensive where I am and I basically would need a loan to afford it on my own, but my boyfriend said he would pay for it.  Adoption I’m considering, but I’ve heard and read that so much trauma comes from that I don’t know anymore.  I also don’t know how I would manage a pregnancy in college. We told my boyfriend’s parents in a hypothetical way. They’re traditional and don’t believe in abortion, but have been constantly asking for grandkids (we’re in the US but our native culture the usual age of a mom is around 18).  They’ve constantly talked about how they would take care of it and basically “give it back” when we’re ready.  I believe a lot of it was the empty nest syndrome kicking in. It’s weird...I’d technically still be raising my baby part time.  Whether his parents will actually follow though is different, I don’t know that. 

It’s weird for me.  I feel like I want this baby, but I know for my life to go how I want I can’t.  I don’t think I want this baby enough to sacrifice my future.  

I’m asking for advice here. My boyfriend supports all decisions I make, and he’s okay with whichever route I take.  He wants the baby too, but he agrees this is definitely a shitty situation. I just want to know what someone else would do in my shoes (hopefully not with a biased pro-life view but more of an impartial stance).

She sent me a picture of the card and my name is slightly misspelled (missing one letter), but my first/last name combo is super unique so it’s definitely my information minus the address. Which is why she was able to locate me so quickly on Facebook despite the typo.

I did a quick google search and was able to find a couple of 3rd party databases to verify if I actually have been registered to vote in a other state. And it is true... It seems like they used my email and phone number, however I wasn’t able to verify this information on the official FL website as it appears they used a different birthday.

499,"I know, confusing title. Let me explain: 

I have an ex best friend that I’ve known for a couple of years. Let’s call her Sara. Sara did some terrible things to me last year and during the pandemic. I don’t want to get into too much detail, but she decided to leave me at a night club one night in downtown when I got (apologetically) drunk and went to get another drink. I know, I pledged to never do that again (I’m now not as trusting of people). She was with a couple of her friends.

She’s also called the cops on me. The cops almost ended up arresting her for wasting their time. 

I forgave her. 

Prior to all this, I introduced her to my other best friend Meghan and we formed a nice tight group last year. But, during the pandemic, she continued to hurt me with gaslighting, backhanded compliments, straight up calling me names. 

I finally decided to end the relationship. But I wanted to be civil so I just told her we’d be better off as just friends/acquaintances since we didn’t mesh well, and why I came to that decision. She didn’t take it well. I just tried to ignore her and see her here and there when the group would be together. I tolerated it, but wasn’t super ecstatic because she continued with the gaslighting and snarky comments. 

Until she tried to physically fight me one day. I called quits. Now, even though I don’t feel particularly good about it, I feel some resentment toward my best friend Meghan. Meghan says Sara does get annoying, but she tolerates it. Now when Sara is invited, I decline to go. My best friend Meghan hopes we can work it and Sara keeps trying to start anew.

509,"A little background on me: throughout high school, I really stood for nothing, I was/am depressed (but now I’m more high-functioning) so I didn’t have a “main character” role at my small art school and still don’t. I’m in my senior year and have just started pulling everything together getting A’s and trying to start an advocacy collective, but with Covid-19 everything has been slow and I still don’t have something that could push me out of my city and into a college far away. Like most, I have opinions about the world we live in, opinions that I could’ve acted on before now, that would’ve put me in the grasp of one of these schools. I know that I will probably have to go to a community college and hopefully transfer later on, but I don’t want to live with my family. 

I should start by saying they aren’t abusive people, we just differ very much on what I could do with my life and it hurts me. Because of my past failings they think that I’m dumb, and so we don’t really communicate or speak without them being condescending or yelling. They sometimes offer to help, but I know there always is a price that I don’t believe I’ll be able to pay. When I explain to them that with my fragile state I don’t know if I’ll be able to hold commitments like starting my own organization/company right now, they get upset and tell me that I’ll never succeed. It’s not that I don’t want to do those things, I totally do, but if I started something I’d want it to matter, and I need credentials and time and quite frankly to heal from my depressed state more. Once again, I already have started something within my school and it’s not big yet, so that will distract from working on an even bigger project.

I try to be understanding of where they are coming from, but sometimes things begin to seem unreasonable considering that I’m trying really hard to get better now and that’s what matters right? I know they are older and thus probably wiser than I am, but they have this phrase they use to make it seem like I everything I want, I will never get “You don’t understand the way the world works.” I think that’d be somewhat reasonable if I thought I was going to get into an Ivy League or about to be famous or a millionaire  without working for it, but I don’t, I fully think that with where I’m at I will go to an average school and work as hard as I’m starting to, to get myself out of it, or maybe stay depending on money being a factor. 

Essentially, if I end up in the same city I am now, I won’t want to live with them; every time I get into these needless arguments I feel even lower than when I started, this I think is causing me to revert back to my old ways like binge eating, and not working or learning and stewing for hours on how unsuccessful I am. I have tried to mend this, but I think the only way is for me to leave until I’m no longer so fragile and inconsistent. 

I am scared though, because I don’t know how to do this. I’d probably have to get a job, but I wouldn’t know where, and budgeting and paying taxes I’d have to research further on. I’d have to put myself through college and pray that I get a scholarship if I transfer. I would probably have to live at women’s shelter for a while, I wouldn’t have money for a phone or laptop, or hygiene products. I’ve always lived a decent lifestyle, and the quality of what I have I know would drop down. How would I put time into my education? How would I become the great smart person I want to be if I can’t access news or research things? I know I’d have a library but I’m Gen-Z so I’d have to learn a new system entirely. With Covid-19 I don’t know how to do this, so many people are already unemployed. I have other family but I don’t know if they’d want me to live with them.

one of the final teachers she had to work under was named hunter. as i said, ivory'd had curveballs thrown at her for years, dating all the way back to middle school. someone tried to drug and essentially rape her, someone faked being gay to fucking harass her, and being the beautiful, young, blonde woman she is, i'm sure anyone could assume how much she had to go through.

hunter was the worst of these. essentially, hunter's rating of ivory's performance would be the telling factor in deciding whether she could graduate that year. in case you didn't see this coming, hunter treated her like a sex object just to get a passing grade. she had to wear humiliating clothing, sit in the way he wanted her to, let him fucking get touchy whenever he wanted, and even had to act like everything was normal when he introduced her to his WIFE AND FUCKING KIDS.

she's always been a very kind and considerate person, too much so, i could argue. not only did she just want the year to get done without extra trouble, but she didn't want to seem like a burden and kept this secret to herself for God knows how long. as far as i know, i'm the first and only person she's told about this. if not the case, i'm disappointed for those friends for not seeking justice in the same way i am.

even the teacher herself claims that she's simply over it, i hardly believe it. if that truly is the case, she should want justice to be served as well so that no other vulnerable students have to suffer through what she did. never in my life have i been a violent person, but hearing what happened to ivory legitimately made me feel like i could murder in cold blood, no hesitation. to get over the whole thing, i want to get a PI to get dirt on hunter so he can be brought to justice. problem is, i have no clue how to go about doing this.

is it legal to go that far? is it even possible for a PI to figure out which specific teacher did what he did? according to ivory, she forgets his name. i see this as either a lie to keep someone out of trouble or unconscious suppression of memory. once again, i have an unbridled amount of anger i've never felt before, and i want to essentially avenge ivory and her honor. if anyone has any information or inquiries that could help my case, please comment or dm me. i need to alleviate the guilt on my shoulders for something i didn't even do.",31Oct2020,1

She comes from a very strict and religious family so even when we are together as a family there is always distance between each other.

Throughout the last 2-3 years our other Mutual family friends kept telling me to keep an eye on her since they come from a good family. Despite that, during Corona and the pandemic we saw each others families daily and got close. Everyone knows she likes me, and we have been hanging alone 4-5 times alone now at 2am (She sneaks out), I told my brother the situation and he is telling me to not hang out with her because it will affect our family relationship if she were to get caught but despite that we are also good friends with each other now.

She comes from a religious family so no Kissing or anything else. My friends are telling me to pursue it because she is ""wifey and relationship type"" We also hang out during the day too but how should I proceed? Keep talking to her as friends and sneak out or cut her out? And do you think the age is a problem?

The rest of my extended family fought so often they're broken up and I could never get in contact with them even if i wanted to now. In the same year i made a lot of friends but when my gf at the time broke up with me I only had one friend that stayed my friend. Its almost 2021 and i met someone great. The only issue is that she doesn't support me emotionally and honestly whenever I'm feeling depressed and sad she just decided to no longer pay any attention to me in fact she doesn't say anything and wont even attempted a hug or consolation. I only have 1 other friend. Hes usually busy and honestly not the best person to hangout with by himself. My point is I feel really really alone. I just want to sleep until something gets better.

It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm falling in love with her and just need some sort of way to release these feelings I have because everytime she invites me over I'm fighting string feelings and it'd becoming a real problem for my mental health.

I was thinking of a hookup buddy or something. I have friends that live about 4 hours away that have found girls that would hook up with me, I was lucky enough to get good genes and most people would say I'm pretty attractive so I got that going for me. I would drive the 4 hours to go see these girls and just hookup with them but I can't do that everytime, it would take a full day to do that and it will probably grt pretty costly overtime with gas and stuff like that. I tried tinder but the app has been so buggy and I get like 50 matches before someone finally wants to meet up, next thing you know, they say they want something serious before we start having sex and I'm not looking for something serious at the moment.

Hi!

I am 17M and there is this girl I want to date. We started talking in school and I started to think she might have a crush on me.

She was constantly complimenting me, hugging me, telling me how she talked a lot about me with her friends and she gave me a kiss on the cheek when we graduated.

I kinda forgot about her this summer, but I started texting her again recently, mid-October. We talked a bit and I directly went to “wanna hang out soon?”. She said “omg yess I’m so down”. We planned something for last Saturday, but 3 days before, when I asked her if she still wanted to go, she ghosted me and on Monday, she said “hey sorry I didn’t have my social media accounts oopsie” which was kinda sus.

I once again asked her out, she said yes and it got weird. Like, she started answering my text at one day intervals while I answered her in a matter of minutes. We can’t say that she only has limited time on her phone each day, I answered on the same minute and she didn’t see the message. Last message is me asking telling her when I’m available to plan something.

Texting at 1-2 days intervals is quite annoying and I’m getting tired. Like, she wants to do something, but she takes way too much time to answer.

Either her parents are super strict and she almost can’t use her phone (but she is active af on Instagram, liking, commenting, etc) so that would be weird or it’s some kind of mind game where she makes me wait.

I want to kinda confront her on the subject and tell her that it’s stressful af without being too confrontational. Maybe like a “hey?”, she answers and I tell “sorry about that I was just stressed when you didn’t answer me”. I just don’t want to seem too clingy or like forcing myself on her, just don’t want to be ignored for days for no reason,

What would you do? I do it and risk being annoying or I do nothing and see how it goes?

P.S.: I know that she might be not interested at all, but for the sake of the question, if she was interested but acting like that, wwyd?",31Oct2020,1
517,"I (17F) was pressured into seeing a therapist due to personal problems. I've seen her now couple months. First I want to say that my attitude on it was bad at first. I didn't take it seriously and made no attempt communicating with the therapist. 

Recently I've gotten more open about opening up and doing some work to grow as a person. We've talked about my dreams and future plans for the most part and she knows my future plans. My issue is that every time I try to answer to her questions and tell her about them she brings them down and I feel like shit after every session we have.

She sometimes laughs at them and then when I've asked her what is she laughing about (makes me uncomfortable). She says I say things in funny way and swears that's all. But to me it doesn't feel like it. I've tried to talk about it with her but It's only made it worse. I don't know how I'm supposed to work with her when I can't talk without her laughing or telling me my plans suck and that I couldn't even make them come true.

I talked to my mum about it. Asking if we can try to find someone else or if I can just stop seeing one. I'm aware it's really hard to find anyone who'd have time to take me in the middle of pandemic. But I no longer feel comfortable sharing or talking to my therapist.

519,"I am new to reading and I'm on the fourth book of the harry potter series which I love but my friends comment has bothered me so much. I always knew I am slow at reading and because I have not read so much in the past doesn't make it better.

I've already told her that I am slow etc but she still later felt the need today to get into a discussion how short the chapters on harry potter are. I said it takes like 1-2 hours for me to read those around 20 pages because I am slow and inexperienced but she kept saying how she would be able to read 5 chapters in those hours and how fast she reads when she is really into the book.

That bothered me so much because I also love the book I'm reading and my speed shouldn't matter - but she just kinda ignored my answer and kept going how fast SHE reads and how she reads slow when she doesn't like the book.

AGAIN, I LOVE Harry Potter and the books so much more when I've started reading and YES I do read slow but it has nothing to do with it! I always sometimes read the sentence over and over again because I want to get everything in, I said that but she said ""yea but I can read 200 pages in 2 hours and I get everything in"" etc.

Like everything I've once told her she used in her argument and what she said etc which made it feel very personal and like she tried to tell me in a way that I don't like the books and that I am not a real book reader or whatever.

It made me very sad and hurt even though I shouldn't care about it because I know my truth.
I don't even know what she even wanted the conversation to be about if it was not to hurt me because why should I care how fast she reads and how fast she reads when she loves the book?

I'm sorry if I'm being dramatic or over sensitive or whatever but it felt so personal and mean when she started that conversation. Again.. Everything I have said to her she used against me in a way if you can get what I mean? I read slow to get everything right in my head - she reads fast when she loves the book and she can easily get everything in the head with no trouble (for example)

Is it weird that I am this slow? 20 pages = 1 or 2 hours.

I didn't even think the chapters was short.. I thought the harry potter book chapters were pretty long until she commented.. But again I am new but I feel so shitty now.. I guess doing this post in hope someone is or were like me or something.. I feel so shitty for being slow and she made me feel shitty

Again.. I love reading now when I have started doing it but my speed shouldn't matter right? Every one are different and I can still like the book/books if I am slow...",31Oct2020,1

So after breaking up with him and unfollowing him everywhere after he unfollowed me on Instagram, he visited a chat room we both frequent. While I was there, he said he's texting and driving to test his quota for stupidity and self-destruction. Not so much the latter one. And I questioned his sanity in my mind. He'd reply to every message that wasn't supposed to be for him. 

We had this discussion so many times in the past, the texting and driving thing. That if he'd ever text and drive, he can forget about me. He's not only putting his life in danger in that case, but others', too.

The day after I called them because I was worried, I had separated her from our other two goats already , it was heartbreaking watching them look over too they’re dying mother. The vet gave her a B12 Vitamin shot and checked out our other two goats, he said they’re healthy.The day after she seemed to get better. So I had hope she was gonna get healthy again.
But When I went to check up on her before bed she was dead, It couldn’t have been the age , she was around 4 years old. ( the two were old enough and didn’t need milk , I was with them a lot) 

Fast forward to today,
I went to give the remaining two goats water.
I opened the stable door , One of the two looked at me and then just fell over.
This happened 2 hours ago.
He was healthy this morning , he was healthy 5 hours ago.
It couldn’t have been old age , he wasn’t even fully grown yet, not even a year old.
I’m so confused , I can’t help but blame myself for this , what if his sister suddenly also dies?
I couldn’t even look at myself without being disgusted for not helping earlier , for not realizing that maybe there was something wrong, I don’t want to leave his sister alone because I have this thought of when I leave I’ll find her dead the next day.
I’m probably gonna sleep in the stable tonight.
Just in case something happens , please if anyone has similar experience or any advice please help me out.

527,"Hi reddit. So i’m in a bit of a pickle. My parents just allowed me (17m) to get my own room, so I was finally thinking I could get a sense of independence in my life. But somehow, they managed to take that away again

I came out as a conservative to my parents (I live in California, this was very hard lol) and right away they have already started to bar me from politics. No reading news articles, no watching the news, no nothing. I’ve always wanted to make my own podcast or show and just talk politics with people and educate myself of our government system. Content creation has always been a passion for me, I just haven’t been able to get a chance to try it because of my parents.

I proposed the idea of starting my own little talk show or YouTube channel as a hobby. They immediately said no, and said if they ever caught me talking about politics with anyone, they would take my new room away from me. This is something i’ve actually found a passion for, and now I can’t do it.

So I tested this, I got on a call with my friend and just started talking about school. During the conversation, I look under the door to see a shadow of two feet right up against the door. 

I have no sense of privacy ever in my own house or room, and I don’t think I’ve ever actually had a chance at privacy in this house.

I wanted a second opinion on this decision made by my parents to bar anything political from my life. I know today’s political climate is very polarizing, and that was their main worry. But even proposing the idea of just talking about it to other people without revealing who I am was met with failure. I’m doing good in school, and only proposed this content creation idea as a hobby I could do, since it’s the one thing i’m passionate about. Thanks.

TLDR: Should I buy a house (vs. renting) across the country because I can work from anywhere now?

Due to Covid, my office moved to remote. Due to how well it's gone, we have been given the option to stay remote. I currently live in north GA, and honestly see this as an opportunity to stay at my job that I enjoy but get out of the state/south. I hate the heat and am miserable 80% of the year because of it. I love being outdoors but overheat way too easy, despite living here for ten years. I miss the cold of Alaska, where I lived when I was a kid, and as much as I love the Appalachians, there are plenty of other mountains in the US. 

I would love to move to a colder, more progressive state in general. I have been looking at VT and NY. I am single but make good money, and honestly, at this point, buying would be cheaper in a lot of places than renting. I'd instead start putting my money into a home vs. living in an apartment. My plan would maybe invest in a 2-3 bedroom and rent one or two fo the rooms out. 

I'd love advice on if this is a sound choice or if I am being too indealistic in the situation.

530,"If covid allows it, I (21F) should spend the first semester of next year studying abroad (it’s mandatory for the major I’m in). My mom has mentioned repeatedly that she wants to come with me. And I can assure you, she’s not joking. She’s definitely a helicopter parent and I’m the youngest of my siblings so it’s even worse with me, she still sees me as a child, basically. 

She seems to have noticed that I’m not very keen on her joining me abroad so now, instead of saying she wants to come with me for the whole semester, she’s saying she wants to visit me for a couple of weeks but that she’d leave me alone. I don’t believe that at all, she’d definitely check in on me constantly and a couple of weeks could easily turn into a couple of months. 

Some background info that I think is relevant: Colleges here don’t work like the ones in the US. There aren’t dorms on school grounds and a lot of people continue to live with their parents while at college. I live very close to my college so I wasn’t allowed to live in a dorm. Well, I have a chronic illness which prevents me from going to college full time. It’ll take me twice as long to graduate (8 years instead of 4). My chronic illness also prevents me from combining college with a job, I need as much rest as I can get. So this means that I’m stuck at my parents’ home until I graduate at 26, if all goes well, but then of course before I can actually move out, I first have to find a job and save up for a while. 

And don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to sound ungrateful. I am grateful that I get to eat home cooked meals and that I’m not left to my own devices. But I do really want to move out. I’m tired of being treated like a child and not being taken seriously. I know for a fact that my mom still searches my room and she always comes to the weirdest conclusions when she finds something “out of the ordinary”. Example: when I was a teenager she once found candles in my closet, her conclusion was that I must be using cocaine. Yeah... So when I get that one semester where I will be able to live on my own, 4 to 5 months in the total of 8 years I have to spend at college, I desperately want to take that chance to actually live on my own without someone hovering over me. 

The thing is, when she talks about joining me abroad and sees that I don’t love that idea, I can see that she feels sad. She means well and I really don’t want to hurt her. I’d be okay with her staying for a couple of days, maybe two weeks but I’m afraid that she could end up staying longer and saying it’s a surprise. 

So, does anyone have any advice on how to let her down easily? I don’t want to hurt her and I’m afraid it would crush her if I’d explain it like I did in this post. But I also want to make it clear that I want to spend that time living on my own so she doesn’t end up “surprising” me with a two month visit lol. 

Lastly I just want to say that I hope I don’t come off as an asshole on here. I do love my mom and I truly appreciate everything she does for me. It’s just hard. I feel like I’m not viewed as a full person at home. When my family’s having a serious discussion, everything I add to the conversation is immediately dismissed by my parents. I get that I’m only 21, I’m still young and I still have a lot to learn. And I get that my parents have trouble letting their youngest kid go, I really do.

I've told her what those words mean over and over and she refuses to listen. I wish I could tell her that those words trigger me but even if they applied to me I know she wouldn't care and leave the problem to my therapist. I'm completely clueless on what to do, if tired of feeling like shit everytime she says it because of the personal reasons it triggers me and the sympathy that I have and she doesn't for the people who have been hurt by those words.",31Oct2020,1

I(14) had a teacher who taught for a year and left. NO one liked her, or the way she taught. It wasn't helpful to ANYONE. She even made a few comments about other teachers. She was environmentally active and still is. Had activities regarding that, asked us to make seed v=bombs and stuff.

Our class responded well in it, me and others from my class also took part. I also try to be as sustainable as I can and spread awareness. Recently she came in contact with my friend(also 14, call him F), and talked about founding a organization. She is already talking about taking the organization to a ‘higher’ level, and about wanting sponsors and asking people to donate, when NOTHING is planned even on a minor level yet.

She also taught another guy at a different school(also 14, call him D), who is in our group. As per the teacher D is VERY good with technology and stuff, he is not, he just knows the basics, as do most teens now-a-days. Teacher has no clue about how any tech works, except simple mobile phone features. 

Even at school, she(teacher) used to keep on talking and no one could understand anything. She never lets the other person talk, even if someone is, she interrupts; it is straight up annoying. The teacher, called me a few times and she keeps talking for hours and we hardly get to speak for a minute. 

She even forced F to change his profile picture to a plant, and also for some reason she thinks WHATEVER D thinks is right. So teacher and F are founders and D and myself team heads. Teacher asked me to make a PPT and ask D for some inputs. I showed him my presentation which took me literal HOURS to make, and he had a problem with the template. I downloaded a creative template from a completely legal site and used it, cuz it looked great and went with the theme. For some ‘religious’ reason his parents have told him NOT to use readymade templates also he said it was unprofessional?? The template had nothing NSFW/wrong about it, it was just beautiful graphic plants/flowers/leaves with a green bg.  Anyways, D thinks highly of himself, it’s obvious, so my PPT had to go to scrap because of him. Tbh, he even talks like a literal salesman. The admin meetings are literally D and the teacher deciding stuff and telling us, occasionally asking F and I for inputs, which she won't even let us completely speak and take in mind.

The teacher just thinks D is the best or whatever, she, the teacher herself doesn’t do any of the work, and the on top of it behaves in this way. Technically she isn’t even my teacher/ authoritory anymore. I am sick of it and her and D. I really want to leave it, but then she’ll ask why and all of that. Even my friend F wants to leave. Teacher thinks it’s be a good idea to give certificates to all, and I think I’ll wait till then because I HAVE put in actual work into this and certificates like that would be good for future job opportunities and stuff. But how do I tell the teacher I want to leave, she’ll probably guilt trip me and stuff like that?",31Oct2020,1

545,"Hello there! I'd like some thoughts on this.

Firstly, the daunting issue of my transcript. I didn't apply to a single university in high school. All I cared about were my friends, sports, and video games. I enjoyed my childhood; why would I want to think about something that would the end of it? This behavior of putting the unpleasant future realities of life into a box in my mental attic and avoiding opening it at all costs would become a theme in my life.

Having graduated from high school, I didn't know what to do next. There was this community college in my area that lots of people in that position went to. So, not knowing what else to do, I applied. I should mention: I completely drifted through high school. I graduated cum laude, but I NEVER did any of my homework, resulting in multiple homework grades below 20%. My test/quiz grades were high. This had me feeling like I must be pretty damn smart or something (lol). So, when I found out that my first college course was ONLY graded based on your test grades, well, what do you think I did? I stopped going to class completely, telling myself I'd just go on test days and ace it. Predictably, I failed that class. This is where a lot of people would have learned their lesson. Gotten that kick in the pants they needed, but not me.

I would go on to fail 7 courses in 4 years. The worst of it was a semester where I completely stopped attending all 4 of my courses and even neglected dropping the courses, though I could have. I understand how grossly self-destructive this behavior was. I blamed it on lots of silly things at the time like my ADD, however, to be honest with you, I was simply avoiding adulthood. I didn't want to leave my childhood and adopt responsibilities that I thought would turn me into a droning, soulless person who hated my life.

I knew deep down that I needed to stop avoiding life and I wanted to turn things around. The community college I've attended has a grade replacement program. In 2018, I started retaking many classes I'd failed and also taking some new ones. I did better, but not as well as I should have done. This is where I took calc 1 and 2 and thrived in them. But, I ultimately still didn't know exactly what I wanted out of college. So, rather than correcting these grades to As, which I know I could have done, I corrected most of them to Cs or Bs. Altogether, in about 3 semesters, I raised my GPA from around 1.8 to 2.4.

This amounts to a college transcript that is entertaining to look at if you enjoy poorly written comedies and horror movies. 

* Hours attempted: mid-90s. 
* Hours completed: 75. 
* GPA: 2.4, with 7 Fs, a couple of Ds, and an absolute wall of Cs. 

Even with that amount of credit hours, I'm still one (previously failed due to lack of attendance) PE class away from an associate's degree.

My college transcript is not going to help me any time soon. But I'm not going to say oh well I guess I lost the fight. I've been a lazy bastard. I suppose that is the personal demon that threatens to consume me. I have to fight it. If I don't fight it, I'll be sent down to the hell on earth that I deserve. Maybe I'm facing this demon and all I have on is a ragged shirt and a wooden sword. Maybe I could bring out a true warrior if I dug deep. I don't know what's in me, but I have to fight.

Now, going forward: why am I thinking of becoming an actuary? I think it's a career that I'd enjoy and one that I'd be proud of achieving. I love to think analytically and strategically. I love arithmetic, and I'll love the coursework that's required of me. I think it's a career that I can be \*good\* at. After getting to a point where part of me thinks I've fucked myself into a life of working on a food truck for $11/hr + tips and wondering what could have been if I had picked up my sword and fought my demons, the prospect of a career that I'm proud to be in and that I'm \*good\* at would be quite.. fulfilling.

The main issues in my path are my GPA/transcript, the unpredictability of my discipline/focus, and finances. I want to say I will focus this time, and that at my age, something will click, but I've felt that before and not much has changed. Financially, the community college is doable but the university I'd like to eventually transfer to would be a different story on my current wage.

Here's some semblance of a plan I've come up with that might deal with all 3 issues:

1. I join the Air Force and try to land a job that has good prospects in civilian life like Cybersecurity. 
2. While serving a 4-year contract, I spend a good amount of my free time getting my bachelor's degree using Tuition Assistance.
3. IF I finish my degree during enlistment using TA, I will spend the time I spent on course-work studying for actuarial exams. IF NOT, I will use the GI Bill to pay for the remainder of my degree once out, and then of course focus on exams.
4. I combine my experience in, say, Cybersecurity with the Air Force with my degree/exams to find a well-paying job that I'm qualified for, aiming for a good company that provides a fulfilling work-life balance.

Now, I understand that this is a very idealistic plan and I'm probably missing some things. There might be some holes that you folks see and I don't. One that I can see right away is a lack of an internship. I'm not sure how detrimental that would be, but you see why I would need some advice on how realistic my plan is.

How realistic is my plan? What am I missing? Is there another more efficient path that's entirely separate from my plan? Should I just accept defeat and apply for the nearest-hiring McDonald's management position? Your perspective would mean so much to me, and please feel free to poke holes in my idealism.

\*\*TL;DR I have a horrific college transcript from community college and the only way I see of repairing it and achieving this career is through retaking classes to replace grades, then transferring to uni. Due to that, my history of indiscipline, and finances, there is perhaps some outside-the-box thinking required for my path forward. I outlined a numbered plan a few paragraphs above. Please tell me how realistic that plan is and/or things I'm forgetting.\*\*

Thank you to anyone at all who provides insight for me.",31Oct2020,1
546,"I have done a Podcast for about a year now. It has gained less than 30 followers. My question is why?

 Does the show itself suck?

 I have advertised with Facebook ads. I have used Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even tictok to get the word out.

 I have a website and a Facebook page.

I have even bought in pants that I give away to various places as I drive around the country since I am a truck driver.

I have bought microphones and equipment to make my show sound as good as I possibly can.

The only thing I have left is my show must not be that good because no one is listening after a full year. (Less than 30 people on avg)

So if you are a country music thing could you do me a favour and give me some advice.  At this point I don't believe it's marketing because I have done literally everything I can so I am looking for a device on the show itself.

552,"\[Sorry for the long post and for using a throwaway, my sister's here! I've posted this on AITA before but I needed advice and added more details\] 

So, two of my sisters and I (F) just moved to a new apartment. It's smaller than our last one.

The new apartment has 3 bedrooms; master (biggest + own bath), middle room and (very) small room. During viewing, my older sister (S1) called dibs on the master room as she had the smallest room at our old apartment. Me and other sis (S2) agreed as we didn't really mind and actually quite ‘pity’ her for getting the smallest room before. S1’s ‘smallest’ old room was bigger than our current apartment’s middle room, so it’s not actually that small as the old apartment was way, way bigger.

S2 then quickly called dibs on the middle room saying, ""I have tons more stuff than you do"". I understand that. The middle room also faces outside with a nice view. I don't really like sunlight but I like having a view, but not important to me. The small room faces inwards to the corridor with a void gap. 1-5% sunlight, mostly corridor lights. I didn't mind at that time, so I ended up with the (very) small room. Also to note, only the master and middle room has AC. We are located in the equator.

S2 then said that it's unfair that S1 gets the master all by herself and pays the same, I just realized that and agreed, so S2 proposed that S1 pays more in rent. S1 agreed. S1’s room is double the size of mine without the bathroom but she only paid about $40 more than us. Even S2 said we should’ve upped it a bit more. 

At this stage, I should've really thought more about my share of the rent and discussed it. Again, I didn’t mind much at that time and I really thought I could handle the room as I was trying to be positive and considerate then. 

Days later after moving and living in the house, I realized that it's really unfair that I have to pay the same amount as S2 when she has a bigger room and an AC. I was sweating a lot in the middle of the night every time I tried to sleep in my room even with the fan on full blast. I ended up either being awake until 3-4am or having to go sleep in the living room where it's much cooler with just a fan (same as the middle room). While she gets to sleep comfortably with the AC on. I'm thinking of getting an air-cooler or even begging the landlord to go halfsies on an AC..

I use my desk a lot (work from home), so I need space for it. I had to get a loft bed just to fit my desk under. It's also such a hassle to get on/off my bed. She rarely used her desk and she also gets to have the extra space to store her things? And she gets to use a normal bed? While paying the same rent as me? She gets to have a nice, cozy room while mine... It sometimes reminds me of a closet/jail... I think she'll still try to debate me if I asked to pay lower bills as I don't have AC and she'll just say ""I don't even use AC that much"". I heard her AC turned on nearly every night.

Also during viewing, I faintly remember/don’t remember that the small room has no AC and didn't have much time to think about it before we confirmed the house booking. Also, the other similar units we saw in the building all had AC in the small room, that’s why I forgot for a while that one unit (the one they happened to pick) doesn’t have it. They were pushing me to agree on booking about two days AFTER viewing.

I know we’ve already moved in but the time window of when I should’ve asked them before was really small and I haven’t had the chance to think properly before booking it. I’ve told them before that I needed time to think but they forced me to confirm faster, to avoid the unit getting booked by others. I really had no choice. They’re happy with the apartment choice but I needed time to think about whether I’m happy with it but they forced me to be fast. Our old apartment lease wasn’t ending immediately, we did actually have time. And I know the building has a lot of similar other units we could lock on to later (I’ve researched). 

Part of me thinks that they’re already happy with the unit we’ve seen and didn’t wanna dwell on it too much (since they got the better rooms) and just wanna be done with it, and didn’t care if I was really okay with the unit or not and forced me to think faster. I legit didn’t have much time to think so I just confirmed after much pushing from them. I was also partly under the illusion that my room HAD AC because of the amount of units we’ve seen. Now, I’m the one ending up with the short end of the stick and I really don’t know what to do. I was a chronic overthinker and I was trying not to overthink when they pushed me to confirm it. This is why I usually overthink. I really really regretted not doing so. 

Tbh, I actually would’ve felt fine with the small room if either my rent was lower, or if my room had AC (with the same rent amount). 

I do think that I was being too lenient and too considerate during the house-hunting process and forgetting to think about myself? I admit I'm quite guilty for not thinking properly. I really thought I could handle it. But I really can't stand it anymore. It feels really unfair. I would even agree to pay more if I was the one occupying the other better rooms. 

How should I go about this? Is it wise for me to ask for a lower rent? How should I ask? I'm really not good with words and can come out too strong/aggressive. Or should I just suck it up and move along? (I really don’t think I could, worst case scenario: I’d move out to a better room rental while still paying for this room too and have to spend a ton on rent). 

This issue is (literally) keeping me up all night and I’m very depressed thinking about it. I know my sisters can afford it as they’re earning more than the average and are always buying ‘pleasure’ items (kpop albums, decors, extra makeup, plants, etc) without much thought. I’m working for a small company and especially after covid, I’m not getting as much as before. 

Please help, I'm really, really depressed right now. All kinds of advice are welcomed.",31Oct2020,1
553,"Broken from being ghosted after 10 years
Found this post which stung a little and had to ask but confused on why this person is this way? when I gave a lot of pure love and received a lot of hate from her

Why I left 10 year relationship so he can grow (me too)

Hi all. 

I was with my boyfriend for 10 years. My first live my only love. Of course we had ups and downs and plenty of them. What started the stream of toxicity was his immaturity with finances and pretty much everything to think about it. We grew up together. I work customer service at home and its a good paying job. He was ok to working in his laboratory job as a phlebotomist I started to become the head of household and I wanted him to be a man. We have gotten into arguments and he’s tried to talk to me but It just seems like I end up yelling at him when he’s expressing how he feels. He’s never cheated and I know reading that looks like he’s a a bad person but he’s not. He was loving and caring but really didn’t know how to move forward in life. He tried to communicate with me how he felt lost being back in Florida cause we lived in Phoenix and he was thriving there and he had his school and career planned out. I wanted to move back to Florida and he followed me not wanting to lose me. 
He would get upset if I tried pushing him bc he said I was being “motherly” apparently I was harsh whenever I pushed me, he says I don’t talk to him with any sort of kindness just very hypercritical towards him. he worked weekend nights 3day 12hr shifts he felt miserable. 
I always wanted best for him so I guess that motherly lll but that’s what you do in a relationship right? Uplift him when he’s down and he does the same for me but there’s been many occasions where he tried to talk to him and I ended up lashing out on him, screaming at his face and he says I am belittling him and his job. I would ask him to wake up after his work weekend just to be with me that he ended up sleeping on a futon near my computer or on the floor just to be near me, a lot of times he would stay wide awake after 12 hrs and he would just tired and quiet. 
Well he never took kindly to my advice to I stopped giving it. He became complacent and I kept moving forward, Still super kind and loving so of course I loved him back. We decided to move across the country and start our life. ( we loved there before just going back) so we had to same and hustle and just make sure we were set once we get there. 
He didn’t have much saved even though he says he had to spend his money on his car that’s old, pay some debt to get a heads start. He was spending a lot of money in only fans and being reckless, he tried to communicate why and what was happening in his head but I don’t care about the whys, it just hurt. He says he has tried and tried to bring passion into our relationship but I’m always angry and emotionless love making that he would just buy personalized porn wanting to receive what he always wanted from me. Whether it was me sending him cute selfies or making him feel desired by me. This was a pattern in the 10 years. Porn and finances. We both smoked weed for years and there’s been times were he tried to quit but I always brought it back up or I would smoke behind his back. I looked down on him for the weed yet I was doing it myself with him and without him. 
But of course I let him tell me he’s sorry and I forgive him. 

I officially left him this time bc were 30 years old. I want to move forward in life and so does he but I can’t keep picking up the pieces. I always tried and he never let me. I really love him. I really really do. And it’s only been 3 weeks so far and it’s tough but I know I’ll be ok. We had multiple miscarriages and I never saw anyone else as my partner. I wanted him. He said to me that those miscarriages didn’t seem to affect me in any way that I just brushed them off but for him he really wanted them and it tore him apart. 
Some days I feel like I made a huge mistake bc growth happens together not separate but then sometimes I feel that “woman empowerment” and anger of if I have to do it alone why do I need you then? 

I have a lot of anger towards him bc I had to step up a lot in the relationship but it still never cancels out the love I have. It’s seriously breaking my soul I did this to him. 

Any advise or worlds would be great. I guess today is just a tough day. 

Thank you


I found these posts trying to find advice or how someone else has coped with being ghosted after a 10 year relationship.

I’ll admit I was wrong for the porn but after trying so hard to communicate with someone you loved hey we need to spark our love making.. she’s never loved herself and because of her I now know and fully agree in you can’t love someone else if you don’t love yourself.
Her misery in her head was dumped all on me.
I chased her back to Florida wanting to not lose her while she could care less. 
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made was to follow her back to a place where growing up I considered a dead end. 
Low pay, no prosperity, jobs in health care are eliminated very easily while in Phoenix I saw and experienced a whole different attitude with jobs and the people which is why I fell in love being there. 

I fell hard being back in Florida and completely lost but my main focus was to be the best I can be for her and I failed miserably. Still lost her cause I focused too much on wanting to be a great lover that I didn’t focus on myself. 
I saw these posts and she talks conveniently about herself to make her sound like she’s this perfect angel 
But a lot of what happened was how abuse she was mental, emotional and sometimes physically. 

I allowed things to happen, and I should’ve walked away the money violence was brought into the relationship. I am a calm person and although I can be mean I chose to lead with love. Fights, disagreements, differences, whatever it maybe I don’t let go of love and replace it was angry and hate. 
I’ve always been romantic and passionate, a hopeless one but I had to hide that because of the awkwardness she gave me.
Poems, letters, confessing my love. 
I have learned a lot through 10 years not just about myself but also about her. 
I wish she saw what I saw and fixed it cause we would be okay but I can’t help but see how self centered and selfish she is.
I first communicate, then I try again and again and eventually I’m laying in bed day dreaming of a Day she changes and actually cares about my want a needs or enough about me to even acknowledge she isn’t right all the time.
I’ve tired to be flirty with her and have that fun with our intimacy and I get shut down.. 
to backtrack a little when we first met, fell in love, when we established how strongly we felt about each other she was ready to drop our relationship to move into her brothers house cause he promised her fame. 

I sat in the car torn, that eventually I felt like I had convinced her and that didn’t make me feel good, I’ve lived with that insecurity for 10 years. Everything is about convincing not her wanting to do it on her own.. she doesn’t risk anything for love. She’ll say the hell with the relationship for money and small fame. The same thing happened with pregnancies, she was never excited. I was madly in love with someone that didn’t love me back, when she was pregnant all 5 times, my heart dropped but when she lost them, a lot of me died. Especially when she showed no emotion just like she states “not with him” 
Just reading that tears me apart. Why 5 times to come to that conclusion? 
Why lay in bed doing nothing absolutely nothing and letting me have sex WITH YOU while you show zero emotion, just pure awkwardness then get mad then claim I’m not the one to have kids with you. 
I accepted from day 1 that IF we didn’t have kids.. I wanted to be with her regardless. I accepted her for all the flaws and all the goods. 
There was a moment where her parents accused me of kidnapping her, posted a letter on my door and my parents door accusing me of these things because she become cold to her parents, avoided them, ignored them and I become the target. That crushed me at 20 years old, that crushed me looking at her like speak up but she let them accuse me of these awful things. 
From that moment I looked at porn to get off, I didn’t want to be with anyone BUT her but I did go on sites for material to masturbate and that’s all it’s ever been. 
Same year I found out she was texting this guy at her job. Sexually texting him, he’s in her home, at work, after work, she’s going to a music studio like a groupie and he’s there, hanging out with girls pushing her (at least that’s what she said) to do things with this guy. 
All I ever wanted was to be comfortable with our intimacy and when I found out of she was talking dirty to this guy and everything else I saw a different person she says to me she can’t be like that with me. 

That has never left my mind.. how can you give me awkwardness while you gave this guy everything he wanted just like that.. 
she states she was scared of him but it didn’t sound scared in the voice msgs, or how he was in her apartment, hanging out late at night seeing him afterward and practically being a groupie. But I get awkwardness,
All these 10 years I’ve tried and tried and tried to communicate my deepest thoughts and what I got back was abuse, mental, emotional and at times physical. I tried to spice things up, be more loving, be more affectionate, lead with love and passion I have for her but what I’ve gotten back was awkwardness, I get shut down, told I’m not comfortable with that. 

Even the simplest things like I miss you are too much to ask for. Affection is too much. About the only time I’ve ever gotten the feeling of desire was when she drinks that it kills my mood at the times when I realize this is only cause she’s drunk, I wish this was normal, 
The looks I get from other woman, how they flirt with me and all I think is I wish she looked at me the way they look and talk to me. 
But for me, everything is a no but for a random guy she gives it all.
She says he was assaulting her, pushing himself onto her but I find that extremely hard to believe but I let it go to a certain extent.
So yes, I looked and bought porn to find some sort of escape from that feeling of not being desired ever by her. From day one to the end of 10 years. 
I went on onlyfans buying custom pictures or videos of girls sending me selfies as if they were her trying to seduce me, showing me desire. It’s stupid and I know it but I didn’t want to go and mess with someone else when she’s all I ever wanted. 

Maybe I should’ve left when my needs were not served but finding these posts shows how she doesn’t even know what she has done to me. Just throws me under the bus and blames me for everything. Makes herself seem like she’s an angel but me a monster.
10 years I’ve felt like I’m not worthy of love, affection, kindness or any level of intimacy without being drunk. 

The times we have been good as indeed been good but the toxicity she’s brought to the relationship can never be talked about cause she will blow up in my face. I had asked her for some time for me to reset before we leave. I wanted to work on myself and focus entirely on my workouts saving and working but I was told hey let’s have a baby once we get to Phoenix and she knew that would excite me

To then days later her retracting everything she promised like nothing has ever been said. 
We did have this plan to come back to Phoenix , that I have wished for a very long time and she flaked out on me. Ghosted me, abandoned me and never said anything at all. Gave me a chance to only take it away. On and off
I made it to AZ alone, even though she was supposed to be beside me. 
Struggled like hell, father was diagnosed with cancer once I got here. I have my uncles death in my mind and then the death of her because it does feel like she died and I never got to show her the plan that we both had set out to execute together. From me working and paying rent alone to her just focusing on school and me trying to join the military and accomplishing a childhood dream of trying out for something special..

It’s been hard because of the job rejections that after months of struggling I was granted this state hospital job and paid.. finally paid for my experience and a job I can see myself grow in and move up into being an RN. It was my last opportunity before I started working at the post office and I went in knowing this is my last chance to crush it and I got the positive and couldn’t be happier. Hours, benefits, growth opportunities everything is on point and what I wanted for the entire time of me being in Florida that I didn’t get.. 

all I am missing her her and it’s killing me.

555,"Hi everyone, so I’m kind of split right now between 2 decisions.

Decision1: I start a trades program at a college in January that I’m not really sure I would enjoy but it would show me if I like it or not plus it would take care of my financial problems right now like not being able to get full time work. Plus if after a semester I don’t enjoy it I can withdraw and go for something else I think I would enjoy such as a teaching program. I believe I want to be a teacher but it is a long difficult process and I don’t know how realistic it would be. 

Decision2: Work a non routined schedule at a minimum wage job trying to break even on my expenses until April, then I do a summer millitairy program to make so extra money and go for the teaching program or potentially another program that interests me.

Basically I’m not sure if it’d be worth going to the trades program just to see if I would enjoy it although it would be a much quicker and easier process if I did decide I enjoy it. Only a 2 year program vs the teaching (6 years). 

Do you guys think it would be worth trying out the trades program for a semester and then deciding from there ? It would solve my financial issues and give me a sense of if I like it without limiting my other options. 

Thanks!!!",31Oct2020,1
556,"So, through this pandemic my mom has been very stressed and worried in general. When this happens, she usually turns to the internet and reads articles and such. But now she has taken it too far, she has become a conspiracy theorist and is almost crazy. 

She now believes the following theories: 9/11 was an inside job, COVID-19 is fake and was planned to turn us into basically a nazi regime, western medicine is actually meant to slowly kill you, phones can cause low sperm count and cancer, and finally 5g waves cause brain tumors in cancer.

Now it started out slow, and I thought “It’s fine she’ll get over it quickly.” But she didn’t, and now she is what I think is actually danger, because she has stopped taking her antidepressants, anxiety medication and more.

I am very worried for her, as she has struggled with mental illness for a long time, and I want her to be safe. My parents are divorced, so my dad is not involved. So I asked my sister if we could do a makeshift intervention, but she doesn’t think it is a big deal.

558,"My father and I were never really close. We kind of used to be, when I was a child but ever since my parents split up, we became more distant.
There were several awkward attempts (from both sides) to approach each other, but it never felt familiar again. My dad has his own family now, a new wife, a stepdaughter and a grandchild. Whenever I went over for a weekend-visit, he never took the chance to make a small trip or something like that. And I really started to wonder why I am still doing these visits, when all I can get is the cold awkward ignorance from my father. 

Earlier this year it took such a toll on me that I was having mental breakdown. In front if him. All he did was to shrug it of and left me alone in the room. Not because he doesn’t care about me but he simply doesn’t know how to approach me anymore, and I get that. 
I just distanced myself from him, because of the things he did to me in the past. I love my dad but I can’t create the bond that died ten years ago.

 I don‘t even have the hope to improve our relationship anymore, in fact, it felt better for me to kind of let go of him. 
I never told him about that. I didn’t know how.

With christmas approaching I keep getting asked if I am „coming home“ for christmas. But my gut tells me that it is going to be a shit and depressing time anyway and I don’t really see the point in visiting anymore. 

I now I want to set clear boundaries, to communicate my thoughts and feelings to my father and in order to communicate my boundaries.

But I don’t know what and how I could tell him. 

Can anyone help on how I can approach this situation?",31Oct2020,1

It’s basically impossible for me to have any alone time and the constant close quarters are making us fight and resent each other which is breaking my heart.

An old family friend reached out to me last night because they've ran out of people to trust and they really need help. She and her girlfriend currently live with her mother who has schizophrenia and has quite serious alcohol abuse issues. I've always known the mother had alcohol issues but as far as I was aware, it was under control and once I moved away, I lost contact with the family. 

My friend and her girlfriend are being emotionally, mentally and financially abused and need to get out of that house asap but because of covid, and her mothers actions, they have very little left in finances and don't know what to do. 

They're both vulnerable people because of their sexuality and gender identity. They have already contacted the local government for help but they've been told they're not an emergency so it'll be months, if not years before they can get help. They're afraid that their situations is going to get violent and I want to be able to help I just don't know how.

570,"Hello, 

I dont ever really post to reddit so forgive the mistakes, im not even sure if im allowed to post this here but ive tried looking at more related forums and i cant find one thayll allow it.

This is going to be long and very complicated. I would be so extremely greatful if I could get some input regardless because im losing my mind. Im also using a phone so i apologise for the typos and grammar issues. 


im a 20 yr old girl. About two years ago now I got on nexplanon. Love it i never had any issues up untill recently but ill get to that later. 

I was in an on and off situation with a guy who is toxic. We were on and off for two years. We always had unprotected sex because i felt safe because i was on nexplanon. which claims to be 99% effective, prevents ovulation, thickens the mucous lining to block sperm, and thins the lining in the uterus to prevent implantation. But i then learned that girls are still getting pregnant on birthcontrol and now im paranoid to the roof. This guy finished inside me.

I got a unusually light period, i ended up spotting for like two weeks. Then it got heavier for the third week, more like a period. Now i know nexplanon has a tendency to do this so i called the gyno and also cause i thought i had bacterial vaginosis and made an appointment. I took a pregnancy test as well because the spotting scared me lol but it came up negative but later when i was looking at it (i took a picture), later as in a week or so ago now, it also looked like there was no control line either so i dont think it was an accurate test. But nonetheless ill continue.

Went to the gyno who asked if i could be pregnant and i said i dont think so cause i was bleeding for so long but i was having unprotected sex sometimes. She asked if i taken any pregnancy tests and i said yes but it came up negative so she said that because i took one she didnt feel the need to test again cause i said mine was negative. 

She prescribed me the pill birth control. Ive never been on the pill birth control before.

so i think i continued seeing the guy after this and i think he finished in me atleast once after that. But we have since cut ties and i never wanna talk to him again i dont deserve someone like that. I deserve better.

It now gets complicated. Im now on two birthcontrol one is extremely new, and to be expected im going to have side effects. So now i can give you guys dates because now i have more of a calculated record of things.

i think i saw the gyno on sept 24 or something. September 27th when i started my birth control i also started having symptoms of covid but assumed it was hay fever because i get insane allergy issues. Long story short i had covid because the symptoms progressed to the tell tale symptoms of covid. But i experienced some nausea which could either be from the bc or covid. I eventually took a pregnancy test in case to rule that out and it looked negative. Im pretty sure it was negative. Im not sure when i took it it was the first or second week of covid.

Now my anxiety had also gotten extremely bad. Like super paranoid im pregnant and like super irrational and almost delusional. Ive never been so irrational and delusional like this so i assume its the pill.

Eventually i got my period again which felt like a period but it only last 4 ish days. And at the end felt like there was a lot of clear discharge as well and for some reason my brain went ""youre pregnant""

To be safe i took another pregnancy test, it came up negative but it also looked weird idk if it was faulty again or what but i lifted it to the light and it looked negative. I kept the test though for a few days. I didnt look at it for those few days and later i looked and there was a fucking line so it looked positive. 

I didnt know about evaporation lines but i think it was an evaporation line. 

But it fed my anxiety.

Previously before my anxiety got so bad i was watching tiktoks and there were so many that people said they got pregnant on birth control. That some people didnt even show symptoms,still got their period, had negative pregnancy tests and still were pregnant. Which seems impossible and idk if those posts were true but it has scared the shit out of me.

And now if i get bloated or if my stomach starts looking bigger then normal i freak out that im pregnant. Ive gained some weight i believe. My boobs are bigger and my thighs are bigger and so is my tummy. Ive always been super super thin. And my lower abdomin looks so round like in my pelvic area. Ive always had a bump there cause uh i have organs and uterus but it just seems rounder then i remember. 

That also fed my anxiety about being pregnant. I cant go to my mom about this because id be disowned. And thats why i cannot be pregnant, that's why i got on birth control in the first place. They will kick me out and disown me, i have no job because i quit the job i was working because we assume i got covid from it. I was a server at a restaurant. I had a few tables one in particular who seemed sick. i finally started trying to rebuild my relationship with my mom and if im pregnant itd destroy all of that. Also I dont want a baby from that guy. He was a terrible person i made the stupid decision to stay with him and have sex with him and all of that but i felt really safe on nexplanon especially cause even though we had unprotected sex he more often then not didnt finish in me it was only a few times where he did. Regardless stupid of me and im never letting that happen again.

So i took a pregnancy test but i didnt trust it because i did it out of anxiety and my pee was kind of diluted i think. But it said negative. 

I then ordered more pregnancy tests. And it came. I had gone out with a guy friend (it was my second time going out after quaratining myself for 3 weeks, i work my mask the entire time as well because of my residual cough) and i held my pee for 6-7 hours so i assumed it was good enough. I took a digital clear blue pregnancy test which told me i wasnt pregnant.  

Btw all the tests ive taken are clear blue.

So my anxiety went away for a bit.

** almost over i promise. If youve read this far thank you so much im so sorry its so long.

I decided to cut coffee from my diet because i thought it was also affecting my anxiety. That helped a lot except now i am here thinking im pregnant again.

At this point its been approx month since ive seen the guy i was on and off with. Idk when the last time i saw him or the last time we had sex so im just going by the date i started having symptoms of covid which was sept 27th. 

Its oct 31st happy halloween btw.

But i took a shower this morning and idk my pelvic area and abdomen look round and i panicked especially cause like my boobs are a lot bigger. Its to the point i dont want to eat because i dont want to look at my stomach and think im pregnant when really i just ate food. Its completely irrational.

I just want this anxiety to stop i want to know for sure for sure im not pregnant. I have to take the pill all next week but i can finally stop after that week. Im only supposed to take it for two months to help regulate my period. 

Im praying i get my period.

Ive also been dealing with  a variety of issues. Fatigue, sleepiness, ive been pale af, and i have a residual cough still because of covid. The lack of caffeine could be the cause of my sleepiness. Its only been like a week since ive quit. But it could also be because of covid. Ive also been getting lots of headaches. Which could be from covid or my allergies. I dont usually get headache from caffeine withdrawal if so im past the point where id be getting headaches.

The pill could also very well be the cause of my weight gain cause i heard it happens alot. I never gained weight with nexplanon or when i previously used the patch.

Then my anxiety thinks about the tiktoks ive seen where they didnt even know they were pregnant, they were getting their periods, on birth control, negative pregnancy tests, etc. And its like what if thats me. I do not want a baby right now i dont want kids for a long time.

I didnt realize it was so common for girls to be getting pregnant on birth control, it was made out to be very uncommon, if taking the birth control right, almost impossible. 

Idk how im going to get through next week, im just praying once next week is over i get my period and this irrational delusional like anxiety goes away.

If you have any input, advice, or in a similar situation i would appreciate the input. Once again im so sorry that was so long and it may have been confusing. if you have questions ill definitely try my best to answer them.",31Oct2020,1

572,"It's my (14y/o B) freshman year in highschool. In 8th grade I was living with my mom but I have now since moved because her and her boyfriend would get pass out drunk every day. Me, my brother, and 2 older cousins share a room there on breaks (like summer, or the weekend). It was summer break. We would keep the door to our room shut at all times and let those 2 do whatever all day long. We never really came out because we never knew what version of them we'd get that day. We had each other and it was great. We played video games together all day, made each other breakfast, lunch, dinner (they tried to cook for us but they ended up with undercooked spaghetti or bloody meat.) We were there for each other.... Well.... Their drinking had gotten worse and worse and one day I got threatned by my moms boyfriend that id get my head ""thrown to the ground and stomped on"".... Which just warmed my heart... So I moved in with my dad. 

At first living with my dad was great. He only drank sometimes and he didnt really ever yell at me. I just did what I was supossed to do and we were happy...
School started and I did online school for a while till my grades were dropping. (When they swiched me to online school they gave me an extra 48 hours of work and said that i was cought up with the class. It was so much work that everything I was working on had a 0 in the gradebook for and anything that i could still do would be counted late and theyd minus 30 to 100 points depending on the teacher)
When my dad found out my grades were dropping he pretty much yelled at me and called me a worthless bum and made me switch back to in school learning.
Now that I'm in in school learning my grades went up a little, which my dad didnt appreachaite whatsoever-- if anything I got yelled at agian for them not being high enough. If i dont make all As he screams at me and if I do I dont get as much as a good job he just ignores it and says that they better not drop. Over the last 2 or so weeks hes yelling at me more and more cussing more and more and blaming me for everything wrong in his life.  My grades have started dropping agian because ive been sick and asleep about 20hrs a day so I havent been doing school work for the last 3 days. Now I have all the assignments from the last 3 days as 0s in the grade book. My dad screamed at me when he told me this, the screamed at me to clean the whole house. I told him I wanna try to do my school work and he said ""I dont give a F**k about your school work. You can drop out and be a F**king worthless poor bum for all i care. Clean the house.""
Like I said ive been awake max 4 hrs a day and Ive spend those laying there trying to sleep.

With him being mean to me everyday, me no longer having a real mom, and my dad hating the very last friend i have, Im not sure what to do.

I know 4-7 places where I could go if I do run away. If one place isnt sufficent then I could go to the next. My friend would feed me and make sure im okay. I have about 1k $ to give him to take care of me for at least a tiny bit. Im fine with rationing out food and i have unlimited water. For my clothes there is a laundrymat that uses 0.50$ per wash. For a shower my friend said he'll let me use his. I know how to treat wounds and how to properly live in the wilderness if i need to. I have taken 3 Years of health science and i have the U.S army survival handbook. As soon as I can find anyone ill work for them.

I've explained the story so many times, to so many people, and the most I get is condolences. Nobody ever really ""understands"" this trauma, and I get that. They're not professionals and they shouldn't need to hear my problems either. I'll try and sum this all up for the lovely gents/gals on this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, this isn't so much about my court case and the obscenities within it, but I will need to mention a brief summary of it. This is more-so about my own future, as a 20 year old, after all my previous dreams were absolutely crushed to a fine dust from this incident.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since everything concluded with the courts and I was lucky enough to receive a deferred adjudication, a ""second shot at life"", I haven't been able to sleep at night.

From my perspective, I still ended up pleading guilty. I'm still a ""guilty"" man, even if there was absolutely zero intent to commit the crime that I was allegedly claiming to commit ([hint](https://www.memedroid.com/memes/tag/school+shooting), it was merely a bunch of real-life shitposting)

Everything that's been going on, from the original stupidity that got me in hot water to begin with, to the absolutely unfortunate events that spanned the two years thereafter (which was far worse, emotionally, than our current pandemic), to the court itself and how they listened to my attorney and never myself, it just pains me.

I feel as if they never really got to hear my side of the story. I was essentially forced into pleading guilty due to the 'overwhelming' evidence against me, according to my attorney.

The overwhelming evidence in question was me writing down my own statement regarding the school and the tip they received. I repeatedly claimed it was nothing more than a joke and there was zero intent to commit a shooting, yet they still claimed it was more than enough to cause me to be convicted of a terroristic threat, hence why I didn't want to take this to trial.

On the contrary though, my attorney lied to me and told me that the case would be exonerated from my record once the adjudication is completed. It isn't going to be completely exonerated, I'm still going to have a guilty plea on my private (government) record.

This royally pissed me off. I would've 100% taken the trial if he hadn't have told me this. He was never clear on the communication with me, and wasn't sufficiently able to explain what I was really getting myself into.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've mentioned my troubles with the court, I want to mention why it's so cumbersome.

I wanted to seek out a job in a government field, a field where I could actually contribute to society in a way that I wanted to. Originally, I wanted to take a shot at the military, particularly the Navy, but due to my mental history, this case and my history of autism, they pretty well ghosted me.

I'm not sure if it's blind-sided determination, but a part of me still want(s/ed) to seek that option out. To really prove to these people that I'm more than what they're lead on to believe, regardless of my previous malice and past mental health. You could think of it as similar to those malicious hackers who are given the option to either join a government agency or face the legal consequences for their actions.

That was one of my bigger goals, as stupid as it sounds. I really wanted to prove my worth, to get out of this hole I'm in (with both mental health and the legal situation). However, with each passing day, I'm starting to realize that this major life goal is nearly impossible, if not straight impossible to achieve.

My mindset is something among the lines of ""nothing is impossible"", and that was what I was riding on for a long time. To see that I'm finally reaching the end of the line, the point where I literally cannot do anything more to reach my already near-impossible goal, is crushing.

So crushing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm here.

I'm 20 years old, midway through my adjudication, and completely lost.

My career path was shattered. You may assure me that there's other careers I can seek out, but I truly wanted to be a part of something big, or to be able to save other lives. I really wanted to do that. It was my dream job, you could say. There is no organization/company/business out there which meets these desires that isn't affiliated with the government though.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's the problem.

With my guilty plea, I'm doomed. I'll never be able to get into any government position or job. I'll never be able to have the career I want. It's truly haunting me.

I've tried everything in order to potentially reverse the plea deal and take this to a proper trial. I've tried e-mailing several agencies, I've tried getting every ounce of information related to the court case, I've tried gathering school records, e-mailing attorneys, I even managed to find a couple of people who drew media attention for the same exact situation, it's so overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

It, quite literally, feels like the whole world is against me.

If I can't find a way out of this case, what is there left for me to do? What can I truly enjoy in life anymore?

Is there even a way I could fire back at the school for what they did? File civil litigation? I don't even know anymore.",31Oct2020,1
574,"I have a job prospect in a different state that my best friend just moved to. We're both males in our mid-20s and we met in college, and lived together for 3 years with no real issues.

I'm out doing laundry at the laundromat. My wife is upset that I haven't texted her much since I've been out. I have nothing to really talk about, and I don't want to bother her (or anyone for that matter) with rambling trash. I also just don't like talking when I have nothing to say. I don't like making things up. If I try to convey I'm not in a talking mood, or I just can't put words together, she gets more upset with me and says I'm just bullshitting.

I work in childcare that offers tuition assistance for employees so childcare is figured out. We have many people in our corner that are here to support us and stand with us. I want this baby because honestly this is all I’ve wanted and I’m so in love with my boyfriend. We know we want to be together forever. The problem is that when we first found out, we were both terrified, obviously. We talked and considered abortion as an option. (Please don’t judge me on this aspect). I went to work and told him to think about it during the day and we will come to a decision together. I called him at work and we both decided we wanted to keep this baby. I was so happy! We were on the same page and I felt like we were in this together. Today though, we talked again and he said his final decision on what HE wants is an abortion. We know that the final decision is in my hands because I’m carrying this baby. I don’t want an abortion. I also don’t want to lose him and be doing this all on my own. It scares me more than anything and Reddit is the only place I could think of to turn to. Please help me! I’m so lost :(",31Oct2020,1

At the start of my relationship my fiancé said that he and his first gf of four years ( they broke up when he was 24 he is now 31) and he fizzled out. That they were too young and that had they been older things could’ve been different. This comment still irks me and it kind of stops me from feeling completely secure in this relationship. Though he says I have nothing to worry about and he’s just being mature about the situation it makes me feel like she was the right one for him, they just had bad timing and I’m the next best thing. We’re 31. I’ve become paranoid about it and he says that if he wanted her back then he wouldn’t have left her at the time.

580,"I work in a relatively small city that has a tight-knit group of people that work in hospitality, gossip flies through people that work at the bars, everyone knows or knows of each other. 

From November 2019-January 2020 my boyfriend Joe (27M) was cheating on me with India (20F), the girlfriend at the time of quite a popular musician and cocaine dealer. India and I had a threesome together with joe in January before I found out they had slept together 3 times over the span of a few months previous. She initiated the threesome and I was fucked up so just went for it, I spoke to Joe before it happened and he seemed unsure but agreed it was a good idea. After finding out they'd been sleeping together previously this felt awful, I always remember watching him have sex with her.

India's boyfriend broke up with her a couple of months later when everyone started finding out and he sent loads of threatening messages to my boyfriend and even went to his work and accidentally punched a coworker of his that looked similar to him instead of joe! (he approached him from behind, and they both are tall, have shaved heads and have a similar coat so I could understand the mistake) The police got involved and statements were given, but nothing else came of it

Full lockdown started and some time during, we heard India was saying that my boyfriend had given her MDMA every time they had hooked up and forced her into sex. There was lots of gossip and stories, I was living with joe at the time (and still am) and his mental health was really deteriorating at this point because of all the gossip, he kept telling me it was making him want to kill himself. And then 3 other girls came forward and said they had similar experiences with him, being drugged with MDMA and forced into sex. 

We came out of lockdown and Joe was beaten up really badly by India's ex-boyfriend when I was there, outside a popular bar. Joe had to take 3 weeks off work for a broken rib. He then quit his old job and started a new, better paying job where I work but it turned out the general manager is a close friend of India and he was sacked within a few weeks for taking a piss out front of the venue at 11 pm when all the toilets were closed. 

The piss was well over the road from the venue and there was no need for him to be fired. It was so shocking and he was fired on the spot. Gossip got around that he was actually fired because of all the drama surrounding his name and the sexual assault accusations. I have no doubt that this is true, they just couldn't fire him because of gossip so they waited for him to slip up no matter how small. This was within 2 weeks of him starting employment. 

Hes been left in a minimum wage job unable to get another one, helping out where he can with rent because he has hardly any shifts, we still live together and I don't know what to do. All my friends hate him and there's nothing I can say to redeem his name, all his friends won't talk to him or have blocked him on social media, he's fully been cancelled. So much of me feels he hasn't done these things, he's always been quite shy sexually and used to have ED. He also has done some horrible things, I don't know who to trust but he's been so insistent he wouldn't do something like that. If India really was taken advantage of would she have been so comfortable hanging out with him, taking drugs with him and sleeping with him so many months after? I feel she was trying to escape her own guilt of what she did and shifted the blame with no regard for the consequences. 

I broke up with him a week ago because all of it was far too much. He was in the process of moving out to his mums but a full lockdown has just been announced today so I can't find another flatmate anytime soon. I was so much more heartbroken than expected thinking he was leaving, it was such a civil breakup and he understood why it was happening but he's been crying a lot. We've been together two years and I love him so much, have never clicked with someone like this and he says the same. He wishes desperately he could help more with rent and he shows me he loves me in every way he can with no money, he's so kind and sweet. He always says how sorry he is and does everything he can to make me feel loved, I've never met anyone so sweet, I don't understand this dark side of him that cheated on me. 

I wish we could both be out of the public eye and we could just love each other without judgement, I know he would never ever cheat again and I feel really comfortable in this relationship but I'm finding this whole dramatic situation so embarrassing, what do I do? i really do love him but can't embarrass myself like this with more drama

582,"When I was born in 1986, my family lived in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Rapid City, South Dakota. I have two older brothers and I was raised by a single father. According to my dad, I began reading pretty early, but walked and spoke late. As a little kid, I was a socially awkward nerd. My IQ was 124, which made it difficult to connect with more average peers. I had a group of other socially awkward nerds, but I never went over to their homes or anything.

I only really cared about science and cartoons as a little kid. And as I got older, no one wanted to talk about these things with me. In 2000, my life changed when I read Das Kapital for honors history. As a little kid, I always thought the government should do more for the homeless, like giving them money and helping them get jobs, but my father, who was a wealthy member of a local company's board, always told me that they'd just buy drugs with the money, and I stuck with that explanation.

After reading Karl Marx's book, I began to question those explanations, and, while disagreeing with Communism, would often use Marx's arguments when discussing economics with others. I followed the 2000 election. I loved Al Gore and feared that if Bush won, he'd become one of the worst presidents in American history. When the Supreme Court voted Bush into office, I was pissed off for about a week.

Then came 9/11. Despite loathing Bush, I really wanted him to guide us through the recovery of that tragedy. As Bush became more and more incompetent, I became more and more extreme. Soon I formed a small grunge/punk band with a couple more popular friends I had made in 1999 and 2000. Our songs were all long, musical screeds lambasting Conservatism, Christianity, and Capitalism. During lunch periods, I would give loud speeches defending Progressivism through a megaphone.

From January 2002 to April 2004, I lifted weights, and soon became a fucking mass of muscles. I went from a socially awkward nerd to a giant, rippling beast who was constantly at parties and shit, all while still excelling in school. However, every adult, even my own father, seemed to hate me, and for whatever reason, I cared what adults thought of me. And I didn't want my community to see me as a punk, so when I turned 18 in 2004, I scraped together money from odd jobs and grants from my dad to move to Hollywood, California.

While I wasn't seen as a punk there, I couldn't stand the culture of Hollywood. Everyone there was a smug, rich celebrity and I hated it. I can' tell you how many times some rich douche celebrity walked into the 7/11 I was working at acting like they were Jesus in the flesh whilst grossly slurping from water ice or something they bought there. So, using money from my job at 7/11 and money my dad gave me, I moved to Miami, Florida in the autumn of 2004.

Miami was a lot better than Hollywood, but eventually, I got sick of the heat, as I had grown up accustomed to the winters of Rapid City. So, in the spring of 2006, I moved to New York City, which I also enjoyed more than Miami and Hollywood, but I became overwhelmed by the city. So, in January of 2007, I moved to Chicago. I absolutely loved living in Chicago. I worked as a janitor at a Burger King. While there, I made several friends who shared similar views to me. We'd always have parties and go to protests together. I loved the Chicagoan winters, as well as how the city wasn' too big, and how everyone was Progressive like me.

In 2008, I fell in love with Obama, and when he won, I and my friends threw a huge party. However, from 2009 to 2011, I became tired of Obama, I became tired of his decline into Centrism. When I saw he was the only candidate in the 2012 Democratic primaries, I got fed up with all of America, and in February of 2013, I moved to Asuncion, Paraguay. From August to October 2013, I lived in Fortaleza, Brazil. While in Asuncion and Fortaleza, I began researching the history of South American civilization and became appalled with Europe.

When Spanish and British settlers first arrived in South America, they destroyed what the Canari people built and massacred the Amazonians with smallpox. So, in September of 2013, I decided to completely remove myself from anything European and became a pepper farmer in Ybycui, Paraguay. I threw out my computer, bought a small hut, and began living the greatest years of my life.

However, in October of 2015, I remembered that America was having a new election, and began saving up for a computer and plane tickets to Aberdeen, South Dakota. I felt it would be indefensible to leave my country stranded again. By January 2016, I had enough money for all I needed and bought a nice home in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Aberdeen. (Since 2005, I've been saving money in another bank account to buy a nice home in a community where I do actually want to settle down.)

During this period, I worked as an English teacher a private middle school. When I wasn't at work, I spent my time doing three things:

Discussing politics on 4chan and Reddit, defending Bernie Sanders and later Hillary Clinton Playing video games Watching Family Guy, Adventure Time, We Bare Bears, Gravity Falls, American Dad, Steven Universe, and Star Vs. the Forces of Evil (varying taste, I know) While my neighbors were very Conservative (I hated all the fucking TrUmP/pEnCe 2016 signs I saw), I liked life in Aberdeen. It was really cozy and charming. But I changed in Aberdeen. When I lived in Rapid City, Hollywood, Miami, New York City, Chicago, Asuncion, and Fortaleza, I was a partier and an extrovert. But when I was in Ybycui and Aberdeen, I became an extreme introvert who just wanted to be alone and binge We Bare Bears.

After Trump's victory in 2016, I became so much more radical. As the blood on Trump's hands accumulated more, and as I saw my nation collapse, I went from hopeful Democratic Socialist to radical Leftists. By the end of the summer of 2018, I had become convinced that Marx, Gramsci, Trotsky, Emma Goldman, etc. were all correct. So, to fully grasp the history of my movement, I took the autumn of 2018 off to visit France, the home of Victor d'Hupay and Maximillien Robespierre.

While there, I visited the cities of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Guadeloupe, Lille, French Rivera, Nantes, Rouen, Versailles, Grenoble, La Tour d'Aigues, Reims, Dijon, and Le Havre. While living there, I became convinced that not only was Leftism correct but that my purpose in life was to fight for it. On the winter solstice 2018, I returned to Aberdeen, only to move to an apartment in Lamego, Portugal as a permanent residence a few days later.

In April of 2019, I chose to see what life was like in authoritarian countries, living in Grodno, Belarus from April to July 2019, and Plovdiv, Bulgaria from July to November 2019. In November 2019, I moved to Tskhinvali, Georgia. I only planned to live there until May 2020, but obviously, the pandemic has trapped me here, where I've been working as a telemarketer since November 2019.

During my time in Tskhinvali, I lost hope in ever going back to South Dakota. While I'm a white straight male, I fear that Amy Coney Barrett will infringe on my rights as an atheist. Additionally, one thing I realized in 2018 was that all Americans, regardless of class, gender, religion, race, or political affiliation, have blood on their hands. As they pay taxes, that money goes to murder people in the Middle East. I cannot live there again. I'm thinking after the pandemic, I'll visit Iran and Lebanon to see what life is like under the tyranny of Islam and the American citizen.

But ever since spring 2018 or so, I've just begun to feel awful. Ever since I've been feeling sad and degenerate. In 2003, I was a strong, buff popular musician. Here I am today, in Georgia living as a fat, lazy guy who's losing his ability to focus. When I'm not at work as a telemarketer I'm sitting around watching cartoons and playing video games or writing about Leftist philosophy and politics on my shitty blog.

I just feel sad and irritable, and I have no clue why. When I started feeling this way, I was still skinny and had a respectable profession as an English teacher. Why am I feeling this way?",31Oct2020,1

587," I was at a park with my kids. I want to give a little info about the park so you know the situation better. It is a tiny park surrounded by playing fields. There are like 8 fields around this tiny park, people use these fields for soccer, football, baseball, ext. But the play park itself is tiny , just a few swings and slides. Anyways, my life-partner was on the phone with his mom while we both were shadowing our youngest child. Suddenly a football hit my man in the leg, and this woman and her high-school aged son come up with arms open like they want his to toss the ball back. My life-partner told them they needed to be more careful, they hit him in the leg, and he is trying to watch our child, who is small, about to my life-partners knee in height. The mother of the high-schooler said ""We are at a park, I am trying to play with my son. you didn't get hurt, move on."" My life-partner responded with ""There are literally football fields all around us, why not play with your son there instead of a small enclosed space with small children?"" I jumped in to the conversation to have my man's back, I reminded her that there is a baby about my man's leg height walking around, they could have hit that baby in the face. This woman said ""Baby? What baby?"". This woman near us with a cute tiny daughter with just a lil sprig of hair pulled up into a tuft, she was wearing a poofy diaper and a dress, I pointed at this cute little girl and said, ""What if you would have hit that girl in the face instead of my man's leg?"". The mother of that baby said ""If she got hit in the face with a football, she'd be fine"", I told them both that if my son got hit in the face with a football, I would have my life-partner take my son directly to the doctor to get him checked out, meanwhile I would stay behind to get this documented by the police so I could sue for medical costs. They started calling me every potty word out there. Both her kids, my kids, everyone at that park heard her call me the B-word, the C-word, and she even threw in the Mother-F word in there for good measure, and told me to fight her. I told my sons, who came up looking to have my back, I pointed at that potty mothed chick and told them ""Don't repeat any of the naughty pottys she said, y'all are gentlemen, just ignore her, I'm ok and you are ok, stay away from this woman and her kids. Then I sent them off to go to their daddy. This woman is still on me, yelling at me, begging me to fight her, and calling me a ... the P-word for vagina. I told her that I am not a criminal and assault is a crime, and if I were to assault her infront of minors, well then I would be held accountable in law, not just the police would get involved, but CPS would too. I mean, I was just stating facts. So she keeps on calling me the B-word a few more times, then her high-school son starts taunting my middle school son, saying about how I can sure say lot of smart words but how I couldn't handle his mom on one-on-one combat. I told my son to get down and don't hang out with that boy, I reminded him that **assaulting** a guard could change a 5 day jail stay into a 5 year prison sentence, then reminded him of his cousin who we cant see for the next 11 years, because he went to juvenile hall for selling drugs at his school, but got a bigger sentence once he **assaulted a guard. The woman then started up on me again, saying how I needed to show my boys how to be men, and she keeps on claiming that me ""Whooping her A-word"" would prove to my sons that I'm a real woman who would protect them. I told her that in my family we use our words not our fists, and I guess I said it in a day-care kind of tone ( I have worked at daycares, and as a teacher for Sunday school before, so sometimes if I am repeating the same sentence I use with the kids, my tone can get that way) she went off the rail, told me that she was a grown A-word adult, and that I was talking down to her. I told her that wasn't my intentions at all, there are alot of phrases that I repeat using the same tone. I was just trying to say that I believe in having a discussion, parent to parent, and that violence is never the answer. Then she went off the rails again, calling a P-word A-word B-word all in a row, then her daughter came up, I had no idea this little girl was even at the park until she came up, wagging her little 3-year old finger at me saying ""Don't you dare F-word (ing) talk to my mother like that you B-word"" I looked at that little girl, and my heart fell, I looked at her mom, and said ""That's sad, here I am trying to raise gentleman, and here you are with a daughter, how are you going to teach her how to be a lady?"". She claimed that her daughter didn't need to be a lady, especially with P-word A-word B-words like my sons around, my boys came up again, to yell at the woman and have my back, but I told them again, ""Boys, don't say anything to this woman or her kids, If a girl ever talks to you like this in the future, leave her, because I don't want a trashy daughter-in-law."" Then she backed up, took her kids to the car, stayed on the phone for like 15 min fussing and cussing with her kids wandering the parking lot and in the street. My life partner said ""You did it now, she's probably calling her family members to beat you up."" I got a little scared, one on one, I could take her, but being jumped, that isn't a fair fight. So I told my life partner we should go. He told me that we weren't leaving the park, that our sons are going to enjoy a lovely day outside in spite of my drama, and that I should have just let it go a long time ago. I reminded him that the football that hit his leg wasn't a nerf one, but a leather bound NFL one, that was the same size as our youngest son's torso, and if they aren't worried about hitting a baby in the face, they sure weren't worried about hitting our kindergartener in the face either. He reminded me that these people weren't like us, so there is no talking sense into them. I made a plan, I told him if a car came with a group of people, that he would take the kids to the car and drive off, and send the cops to the park immediately. It takes a while to load my kids, and Id rather distract them then any of my kids being hurt, and I know for a fact that my life partner is a flight and not fight person, meanwhile I am a fight person. Well, I don't go looking for fights, and I only fight back to protect myself, and I have never been the first to hit, but when push comes to shove, I stand my ground instead of running away. My man runs away every time, and that's ok, I love him and don't think he is a P-word, I just think everyone has their own personalities, and its ok being you. Nothing came of it, we left about 15 min later once one of my kids started demanding ice cream. How do you deal with people like that? People who prefer violence over reasonable conversation. I want my children to be safe, but this world has become so angry and unreasonable.**",31Oct2020,1
588,"I'm not sure if I can explain this in words.

I don't really enjoy thinking. It sounds weird but I get anxiety when I take a walk because I'm alone with my thoughts. It's not that my thoughts are intrusive or that I think about terrible things, it's just that I don't like thinking. It makes me bored in a way. It feels like being locked in a white room with no stimuli for hours on end. This is starting to be an issue for me in everyday life because a significant portion of a day is usually spent walking somewhere or being alone with your thoughts and it freaks me out. 

Does anyone know any way to cope? I wish I could sit on a bench in the park and just genuinely enjoy the moment but I can't. I have distract myself in order to ease my pain, like being on the phone or having a conversation with someone. It's not a permanent solution because I'm just pushing away thinking about things.",31Oct2020,1

590,"Okay will start with saying, im not a guy who will run away. Will face up to my actions if needed, however im way to young to be a parent and really dont want to be.

Ive met this girl twice, we hooked up both times, im 99% sure she isnt on any contraception. The first time we hooked up we didnt use protection (i know im a idiot), i get the risks and understand it, just didnt think now im in this situation. Always pulled out. 

Today again, we hooked up, had sex once, and I pulled out (get this isnt 100% safe). We then had sex a second time, I told her I was close and well I ended up finishing inside her. She said absolutely nothing about it and didnt react. 

Her period finished last friday (23rd) as she was asking me to come over that night. 

This all happened literally 10 mins before i had to drop her off to work, she really didnt say anything, or care at all. Im just worried as I really dont want her to be pregnant. What are the options I can do and talk to her now to try make it less likley that she would be. 

Like I said, we are literally just hooking up, wouldnt be a future with it and we are completely stupid for doing it without protection. Any help or support would be appreciated. What should I say to her, how can I talk to her and convince her to take the pill ect",31Oct2020,1
591,"I’m (F15) not sure if this is the right place to ask but for a long time my mom has been kind of a cleaning freak. I thought it was just a mom thing but then she went on to describe that seeing our house dirty just makes her feel depressed and that she can’t just sit still and avoid cleaning. She cleans the house around 2-3 times a week. I told her the way she feels doesn’t seem normal but she said it is normal. It’s not like crazy cleaning though. Just sweeping and mopping the floors, cleaning counters and tables, picking everything up, doing laundry, etc. It’s nothing major like scrubbing the whole house clean. I’ve suggested to her that we leave all the cleaning to Saturday since we’re always busy during the week(she has work and comes home around 4 and I have school) but she still sometimes cleans when she gets home from work. I understand cleaning once every week because by the end of the week everything is dirty but she can’t wait until the end of the week and cleans multiple times during the week. She’ll even full out clean when it’s only a little bit dirty. Is this actually normal?",31Oct2020,1
592," I (17M) just remembered this and honestly I can't help but feel extremely uncomfortable by this memory. I did something which is absolutely nothing like me and the worst thing is that I did it for no reason at all. I had this thing when I was younger (around 11-12) where I would think ""what if I did this?"" and then proceed to do some weird shit just for the sake of doing it. But it always involved me and only me. Now what you are about to read is going to sound really weird and I am sorry for that, just by writing this I am feeling extremely uncomfortable, especially because I just remembered this. One day I came out of the shower and my dog was next to me and I tought ""what if I touched it with my \*\*\*\*"". I did it (not in any sexual spot, it was on his back) and immediatly thought ""why the fuck did I just do that?"" and left. I never did anything similar (obviously). It really is weird to remember that and I honestly don't know what went through my head. I didn't want to have to explain this, but I didn't do it in any erotic way, it was literally what I described, I touched it and went away feeling really weird. My life has been really normal so far and remembering this is awful because it makes me feel like a sick person. And maybe I am. I just felt like I had to tell someone about that. I am truly sorry you had to read this. I just can't stop thinking about it. I am constantly thinking about what would my gf think of me if she ever found out about it. I am always trying to make her happy and I feel like she deserves better, but at the same time I son't want to break up with her over something I did as a child, I love her too much. This is why I am posting this here. Should I be worrying about this?",31Oct2020,1

I guess I had a questioning look on my face (my neighbor has short hair) because he then proceeds to tell me that he wanted to use a straightener to straighten his armpit hair. Is this something that all men do?

594,"When I was born in 1986, my family lived in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Rapid City, South Dakota. I have two older brothers and I was raised by a single father. According to my dad, I began reading pretty early, but walked and spoke late. As a little kid, I was a socially awkward nerd. My IQ was 124, which made it difficult to connect with more average peers. I had a group of other socially awkward nerds, but I never went over to their homes or anything.

I only really cared about science and cartoons as a little kid. And as I got older, no one wanted to talk about these things with me. In 2000, my life changed when I read Das Kapital for honors history. As a little kid, I always thought the government should do more for the homeless, like giving them money and helping them get jobs, but my father, who was a wealthy member of a local company's board, always told me that they'd just buy drugs with the money, and I stuck with that explanation.

After reading Karl Marx's book, I began to question those explanations, and, while disagreeing with Communism, would often use Marx's arguments when discussing economics with others. I followed the 2000 election. I loved Al Gore and feared that if Bush won, he'd become one of the worst presidents in American history. When the Supreme Court voted Bush into office, I was pissed off for about a week.

Then came 9/11. Despite loathing Bush, I really wanted him to guide us through the recovery of that tragedy. As Bush became more and more incompetent, I became more and more extreme. Soon I formed a small grunge/punk band with a couple more popular friends I had made in 1999 and 2000. Our songs were all long, musical screeds lambasting Conservatism, Christianity, and Capitalism. During lunch periods, I would give loud speeches defending Progressivism through a megaphone.

From January 2002 to April 2004, I lifted weights, and soon became a fucking mass of muscles. I went from a socially awkward nerd to a giant, rippling beast who was constantly at parties and shit, all while still excelling in school. However, every adult, even my own father, seemed to hate me, and for whatever reason, I cared what adults thought of me. And I didn't want my community to see me as a punk, so when I turned 18 in 2004, I scraped together money from odd jobs and grants from my dad to move to Hollywood, California.

While I wasn't seen as a punk there, I couldn't stand the culture of Hollywood. Everyone there was a smug, rich celebrity and I hated it. I can' tell you how many times some rich douche celebrity walked into the 7/11 I was working at acting like they were Jesus in the flesh whilst grossly slurping from water ice or something they bought there. So, using money from my job at 7/11 and money my dad gave me, I moved to Miami, Florida in the autumn of 2004.

Miami was a lot better than Hollywood, but eventually, I got sick of the heat, as I had grown up accustomed to the winters of Rapid City. So, in the spring of 2006, I moved to New York City, which I also enjoyed more than Miami and Hollywood, but I became overwhelmed by the city. So, in January of 2007, I moved to Chicago. I absolutely loved living in Chicago. I worked as a janitor at a Burger King. While there, I made several friends who shared similar views to me. We'd always have parties and go to protests together. I loved the Chicagoan winters, as well as how the city wasn' too big, and how everyone was Progressive like me.

In 2008, I fell in love with Obama, and when he won, I and my friends threw a huge party. However, from 2009 to 2011, I became tired of Obama, I became tired of his decline into Centrism. When I saw he was the only candidate in the 2012 Democratic primaries, I got fed up with all of America, and in February of 2013, I moved to Asuncion, Paraguay. From August to October 2013, I lived in Fortaleza, Brazil. While in Asuncion and Fortaleza, I began researching the history of South American civilization and became appalled with Europe.

When Spanish and British settlers first arrived in South America, they destroyed what the Canari people built and massacred the Amazonians with smallpox. So, in September of 2013, I decided to completely remove myself from anything European and became a pepper farmer in Ybycui, Paraguay. I threw out my computer, bought a small hut, and began living the greatest years of my life.

However, in October of 2015, I remembered that America was having a new election, and began saving up for a computer and plane tickets to Aberdeen, South Dakota. I felt it would be indefensible to leave my country stranded again. By January 2016, I had enough money for all I needed and bought a nice home in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Aberdeen. (Since 2005, I've been saving money in another bank account to buy a nice home in a community where I do actually want to settle down.)

During this period, I worked as an English teacher a private middle school. When I wasn't at work, I spent my time doing three things:

*Discussing politics on 4chan and Reddit, defending Bernie Sanders and later Hillary Clinton

*Playing video games

*Watching Family Guy, Adventure Time, We Bare Bears, Gravity Falls, American Dad, Steven Universe, and Star Vs. the Forces of Evil (varying taste, I know)

While my neighbors were very Conservative (I hated all the fucking TrUmP/pEnCe 2016 signs I saw), I liked life in Aberdeen. It was really cozy and charming. But I changed in Aberdeen. When I lived in Rapid City, Hollywood, Miami, New York City, Chicago, Asuncion, and Fortaleza, I was a partier and an extrovert. But when I was in Ybycui and Aberdeen, I became an extreme introvert who just wanted to be alone and binge We Bare Bears.

After Trump's victory in 2016, I became so much more radical. As the blood on Trump's hands accumulated more, and as I saw my nation collapse, I went from hopeful Democratic Socialist to radical Leftists. By the end of the summer of 2018, I had become convinced that Marx, Gramsci, Trotsky, Emma Goldman, etc. were all correct. So, to fully grasp the history of my movement, I took the autumn of 2018 off to visit France, the home of Victor d'Hupay and Maximillien Robespierre.

While there, I visited the cities of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Guadeloupe, Lille, French Rivera, Nantes, Rouen, Versailles, Grenoble, La Tour d'Aigues, Reims, Dijon, and Le Havre. While living there, I became convinced that not only was Leftism correct but that my purpose in life was to fight for it. On the winter solstice 2018, I returned to Aberdeen, only to move to an apartment in Lamego, Portugal as a permanent residence a few days later.

In April of 2019, I chose to see what life was like in authoritarian countries, living in Grodno, Belarus from April to July 2019, and Plovdiv, Bulgaria from July to November 2019. In November 2019, I moved to Tskhinvali, Georgia. I only planned to live there until May 2020, but obviously, the pandemic has trapped me here, where I've been working as a telemarketer since November 2019.

During my time in Tskhinvali, I lost hope in ever going back to South Dakota. While I'm a white straight male, I fear that Amy Coney Barrett will infringe on my rights as an atheist. Additionally, one thing I realized in 2018 was that all Americans, regardless of class, gender, religion, race, or political affiliation, have blood on their hands. As they pay taxes, that money goes to murder people in the Middle East. I cannot live there again. I'm thinking after the pandemic, I'll visit Iran and Lebanon to see what life is like under the tyranny of Islam and the American citizen.

But ever since spring 2018 or so, I've just begun to feel awful. Ever since I've been feeling sad and degenerate. In 2003, I was a strong, buff popular musician. Here I am today, in Georgia living as a fat, lazy guy who's losing his ability to focus. When I'm not at work as a telemarketer I'm sitting around watching cartoons and playing video games or writing about Leftist philosophy and politics on my shitty blog.

I just feel sad and irritable, and I have no clue why. When I started feeling this way, I was still skinny and had a respectable profession as an English teacher. Why am I feeling this way?",31Oct2020,1

598,"tl:dr. friends don’t care much about the virus and it makes me think i’m just an overreacting crazy person

How’s it going guys. 

So as the title says, i’m a bit worried i’m overreacting. ever since quarantine started earlier in the year (holy shit it’s almost been a year lol) i have been very diligent about safety and cleanliness. i live with my family ( shit went south for me with the economic stuff after my first year of college so i’m back at my parents till i bounce back) and they all take it pretty serious too. my dad is a germophobe so he was doing safety stuff before the pandemic. 

My main concern is my friends. they are all pretty skeptical of the virus and a couple of them don’t even believe it’s something we need to worry about. because of this, they have been routinely going out to bars and the such and inviting me every time. i said yes once or twice when the year started as the restrictions weren’t so tight back then, but as the year grew i had to keep making excuses for saying no. every time i bring up the topic of a freaking pandemic going on, it always seems to push some buttons. i got into a slightly heated argument about it a couple weeks ago, so to maintain the peace i haven’t brought it up since when they invite me places and say it’s something else causing me to cancel. 

i just don’t think it’s responsible to be going out like that, mask or not. but it seems everyone around me in this town is saying otherwise and it’s making me think i’m crazy.

am i overreacting? i don’t want to lose friends that i’ve known since pre-k because of my fears. but then again i feel like it’s wrong to be going out. today marks what feels like the 100th time of making an excuse to go out, and now i’m leaving one of my better friends alone at a party because i can’t pull myself to do that in good conscious. 

any advice would be awesome. i’m pretty confused right about now.",31Oct2020,1
599,"Is instilling used correctly? Anyway.

I (20F) have a guy (18 or 19) friend and a thing I like about our friendship is that we can just be brutally honest with each other but also about our feelings and we often are. He lacks self confidence and is a shy/awkward type. I’ve noticed that once in a while he kind of has some incel vibes... I’m not here for that or toxic masculinity.

Look, is taking him (online) shopping and slapping on a face mask a horrible idea? He wears very safe clothing and I just feel like sometimes a new wardrobe can be really refreshing and give some confidence? Finding a style that’s not black pants and a white shirt. It will also help him stand out more when it comes to dating if he’s confident and looks good yk...

Sometimes when we snap he is wearing a face mask but he’s super hesitant to put one on with me cause he thinks it’s embarrassing cause he’s a guy. I just want to show him that it’s not? And that he should be himself unapologetically.

I already hype him up at any chance I get and I’ve tried to change his perspective on dating which I think have helped a bit. He’s the prize but no one wants a dusty, old trophy! 

I am a girl though, and maybe that’s not what guys really need? I just want to see him happy 

Also a side note: he’s obviously expressed he wants to get better at dating and find some more confidence, I’m not trying to force anything on him or change him.",31Oct2020,1
600,"TLDR: My 13 YO sister just called me (19 YO) with a bottle of alcohol (4% fyi) and I don't know what to do.

Back story: When I was her age I did the same, then went on to dangerously experiment with drugs. I'm much more responsible now and only smoke weed once every few months and don't drink. We have a very strong bond due to being in an abusive family (mum used to be physically and verbally abusive to me, she is better now but still is sometimes verbally abusive to my sister. My step dad, my sister's father, is very distant unless he needs to tell her off).

My sister struggled making friends until now. I was really happy when she seemed to have found a good group of friends finally but she recently told me she smoked weed with them a couple of times.

I didn't mind this too much but we had a talk and said to not drink and only do weed once a month max, to which she agreed. But she's started to smoke weed more and more and has just called me asking which flavour of this brand of alcohol is best. I'm glad she's having fun and has friends but I'm very concerned.

601,"For a couple of months now, I've been friends with this person who I'll call Dave. 
Dave and I hit it off really well when we first met. It was like we clicked, we shared a lot of the same interests, he was super nice to talk to, and he just made me really happy. We would talk all the time on Discord, in private DMs and also in a server I made for a few friends of mine. However... he would vent to me, a lot. I've always tried my best to help him, sometimes being on my phone for a few hours just discussing what was wrong and trying to make him feel better. I'd send him literal paragraphs and mini essays of my thoughts and advice that I thought would help him. I dropped everything that I was doing to be there for him if he needed to vent, because I wanted to try my best to help him. 
But, now it's gotten even worse. He doesn't talk to me very much, and it seems like the only time he does talk to me is just to vent or to complain about something. Just the other day, on my Discord server, he said he felt like his girlfriend didn't love him anymore and that all of his friends thought he was annoying. Dave said that the only person making him happy was one friend who lived near him (all of his other friends, including me, have never met him in real life and only know him online). He says stuff like this all of the time... And I didn't even respond to it that time because, in the past, I've already sent him paragraphs telling him that I, as well as other people, care about him a lot, and that he's a really great friend to me, etc. It makes ME feel bad when he says that nobody cares about him, because I've tried so hard to be there for him and to help him. It hurts me when he says stuff like that, it makes me feel like he doesn't even care about me, or that he's just disregarded my efforts to be there for him and be a good friend to him. 

Lately... Considering all that's happened, I feel like maybe I should remove him from my friends list on Discord. He hardly speaks to me, and only ever complains or vents. It hurts me, a lot... every time he complains that his friends think that he's annoying and that nobody cares about him, I feel like crap because I feel like everything I've done for him doesn't even matter to him. 
I guess the point of this was to ask, should I try to salvage our friendship or do you think I should end things with him? Do you think he's just using me as a person to go to when he needs to vent about stuff? I just feel like our friendship is turning toxic... And I really don't want to hurt his feelings, but being around him makes me both sad and upset.",31Oct2020,1
602,"My child just forced herself to eat food and I am terrified. I have three children, my middle child who just turned 13 forced herself to eat food I prepared her only to almost choke on it. 

There was nothing wrong with the food. Everyone enjoyed it. It wasn't undercooked nor overcooked. I didn't use anything she was allergic to. She just could not eat it for some strange reason. 

She said it was like her entire body was working against her and trying to get her to not eat it. I don't know what was wrong with it.  But not only does this make me feel bad but also worried. It scared me to see her do what she did. Especially since she seemed to be having so much trouble eating it. This has never happened before and there were never any signs of her having trouble swallowing food up till now. 

It was even more scary seeing she almost choked trying to force it down her throat. My daughter is such a glutton that she'll pick food off the ground and eat it. She'll ear any type of food placed in front of her unless it was clearly in someone's mouth. She'll do it even if it doesn't look tasty. Which is why I feel so scared for her.

604,"I'm getting a little anxious on the days leading up to my test.

I was first issued my permit in 2014 and took the class when I was a sophomore in high school, but it was very hard to get help from people to teach me to drive. My parents would very rarely be willing and when they did help they got incredibly anxious or angry. Then, they'd just give up after about 20 or 30 minutes and take me home. So for all of high school and college, I never knew how to drive. I had my permit issued again in 2017, but it was about the same story as the first time, then a third time in July of 2020. It was my plan leading up to graduation to ask a friend to teach me in the summer so school or jobs wouldn't get in the way, but I wasn't counting on a pandemic happening. On the bright side it didn't seem like I needed to retake a test, but I still spent about two weeks studying up. Then I spent an hour a day on the road with my uncle leading up to the test on August 31st. I think I spent about 30 hours on the road and I felt very confident. That was until the day before the test, my mother informs me that according to the neighbor who works at the DMV, the road test is no longer on the road, but instead completely in the parking lot.

I don't know how other states or countries are dealing with driving tests during the coronavirus pandemic, but I live in the US and in my state, the examiner no longer gets in the car with you. Instead, they test you completely in the parking lot of the DMV and direct you from outside the vehicle. I guess I took this for granted and assumed that they would still be testing us the same way, especially since one of my friends who lives in another state told me his road test was on the road. The modified road test was divided into four stages: maneuvering through some traffic cones, parallel parking, a three-point turn and reversing.

Before the test starts, you drive into a 9' by 20' box facing a series of \~3 cones directly in front of you. There's also a cone on each corner of the starting box described. The examiner asks you to turn on your left and right blinkers, your high beams, your low beams, your hazard lights and your windshield wipers. For some reason, they cut out some other things that you would have done pre-COVID, such as demonstrating hand signals. The manual online says that they'll ask to honk your horn, but my examiner didn't do that. I did most of this right except for the windshield wipers and possibly the low beams. I struggled to find the low beams but I think I turned them on. I turned the windshield wipers on like my parents showed me to (a button on the turn signal handle) but it was very slow, so the examiner told me to speed it up. I eventually got it but I'm not sure if he marked me off for it for how long it took. I thought I was prepared for this part, but I just got so nervous and couldn't really process what he was saying fast enough or maybe I second guessed myself.

The first stage of the road test was maneuvering through the cones. Starting in the box, you start to turn the car right at an angle and straighten it so you face a barrier and stop at a white line. Then you reverse and re-enter the box you started in. Then, you turn to drive on the left side of the cones and stop at a stop sign. While you're doing this, you have to pretend you're on a main road and do shoulder checks so the examiner. I guess this is supposed to demonstrate that you're practicing driving safety, but I don't think this is really a good substitute for going on the road. Nonetheless I was able to do it, although I was very scared that I was going to hit a cone. I read somewhere that if you hit anything, then it's considered a critical error which would be an automatic fail. On the road that's one thing, but on this road test you're confined to a space that's barely feasible to drive through at low speeds. I was actually shaking so much the examiner asked if there was something wrong with the gear shift when I tried to change gears.

After the first stage, you have to drive forward after stopping at the previously mentioned stop sign and wait for the examiner to direct you to the next stage. You drive forward to another stop sign with a barrier to your car's right parallel to where your car should be. at the end of the barrier to your rear there's another barrier that makes a right angle with it, which is supposed to represent a car where you're supposed to parallel park in back of. There is an empty space behind the barrier with dimensions 24' by 7' and you have to park in this spot no more than 12"" from the curb. This was by far the hardest part of the test. I've heard of examiners possibly having students parallel parking behind a car pre-covid, but not in between cars because it would be questionable on their part in terms of safety. So, I wasn't expecting that I'd have to do this, although I had practiced with garbage cans at home before with minimal success. The major problem was that I could not get close enough to the curb for the life of me. I was afraid of hitting one of the barriers and receiving an automatic failure. So I tried parking in the spot and it was pretty obvious that, as expected, I was too far from the curb. I readjusted my position by going back and forth, but couldn't get close enough. When you change gears to get a position (an act the test calls a ""reversal""), you lose one point. My examiner at one point told me to stop and measured the distance from the curb, but told me it was too far. I continued a few more times and then he stopped me and said I accumulated 17 points, which was over the limit. 

So he directed me out and I had a conversation with him. He told me to watch YouTube videos to get a better idea, which I already had done by then. I knew there was a technique to parallel parking that a lot of videos said would ""guarantee"" you park perfectly every time. The way I remembered it for the test was: watch through the right rear triangular window until the end of the front car was visible, then turn the wheel completely to the right and back up until the car to your rear is completely visible through your left rear view mirror. Then, straighten the wheel and back up until your right rear view mirror passes the left rear view mirror of the car in front of you. After it does, you turn the wheel all the way to the left and wait until the car goes into position and stop. I tried this on the test, but it didn't work.

After explaining this to the examiner he suggested I use a more compact car, but I only have a choice between my mom's car and my dad's car. My dad drives a pickup truck, which is out of the question, so the choice was my mom's Mercury Mountaineer. It was a little bulky and I tried to see if any of my other family members had one (or if any of them had a backing signal to tell if I was too close to something), but no one was really willing to let me use their car, so I'm stuck with this one. I couldn't get my own car because I don't have a license and I can't register a vehicle under my name without a license.

I think I've adjusted to how far I can back up without hitting something, but I'm still a little angsty about it. I have to almost stand in my seat to get a really good view of how far the barrier is from me and if I put the back seats down I can get an even better view. I scrapped looking through the left rear view mirror for the second step in parallel parking and decided to just wait until I was 45 degrees away from the car in front of me. I practiced with my friend and cousin and I've made much more progress. I think I'm a good driver but I don't think this stupid test is a good indicator of how competent a driver you are. Also I had coffee last time which made me a little too jittery and probably didn't help to calm me down.

Does anyone have any advice for getting a very good understanding of your environment around the car so I can confidently parallel park aside from what I just mentioned? Without any type of backing monitor? If I can get past the first two stages, I think I can perform the 3 point turn and reverse just fine. All you need to do for the reversing is go back in a straight line for 50 feet. The 3 point turn is nothing different from what you would imagine.

606,"So I have been seeing someone I met through the internet since june more or less, it's long distance as in living in the same country but hours away cities. We got to meet by the end of July and have since met once again (both times were trips for more than a few days). That definitely helped to get to know each other more, be more comfortable and just see if there was chemistry (big yes) and if we actually did like each other. 

Thing is, he is pretty set on on taking things slow, while I'm an impatient person and when I know I want something then I go for it. I have verbalize what I want more than once and he has said that he wants us to get to know each other more, to see how we fit together and all. Problem is, sometimes I do feel insecure and down thinking he may just be enjoying the time but not wanting something more serious or actually a relationship (we have both said that is what we want long term). How can I deal with the feeling of wanting more now and not feeling like we are not in the same level yet on what we want?

I have had a problem with convincing parents that I have health issues, all of it gets blamed on the fact that I’m overweight, which very well may be the cause, but I still want to get it checked. I’ve been having a strange menstrual issue for a month. My parent has pushed it off saying that because I’ve gained weight, my hormones are not working the way they usually do. Eventually, I convinced the parent that I feel like this is too weird and I’ve never heard of this issue happen before. The parent told me to call the doctor and book an appointment, but I don’t know what to say when I call because a receptionist answers. I am really embarrassed about this whole issue and I don’t want to let on too much (I know I shouldn’t be embarrassed but the truth is, I am).

609,"Hello, I am 19F. I am feeling very conflicted about leaving my job. 

I work in the snack bar of a sports facilities. I have been working at this job for almost 15 months now. The management has been very good to me about scheduling and mostly giving me the days off I have requested until lately. 

I don't want to work weekends anymore, I only want to work during the week. We have a small staff right now but that is okay because our business has been slow enough that we don't need anymore. But in the next couple weeks, we are going to be adding 4-5 new leagues. And I know for right now we are not hiring anyone new unless absolutely necessary.

I was only working 2 days a week but now I am being scheduled to work 4 days. I am scheduled to work Saturday or Thursday-Sunday the next couple of weeks. So my workload is doubling now. 

I feel really guilty about wanting to quit now when things at work are about to be really busy. The holiday season is always our busiest time and now with the new leagues starting it is only going to get worse.  I feel like the job is interfering with my personal life.

Now I'm starting to become more confident in myself, which is great, but it's also made it very frustrating that the people in my life still see me the way they've always known me. The other day a friend introduced me to one of *their* friends as somebody who ""just kinda shows up whenever we get together."" That on its own doesn't bother me *too* much, since up til now it's been an apt description... what *does* bother me are the reactions I receive when I demonstrate behavior/mannerisms that aren't reclusive or passive. 

It seems like people think it's ""cute"" or ""unique"" when I'm asserting myself or telling someone to do something. Sometimes when I try and instruct people to get things done, they'll laugh. I get that it's because they're surprised, but that in itself still bothers me, especially knowing that it's exclusively when I do it that they react that way. Even if for them this is ""unusual behavior from Magnasimia"", for me it's ""who I am now.""

tl;dr  
Used to have a fling with a co-worker, it didn't pan out because i was cringy. Got depressed for 2 year after she moved out of my department for unrelated reasons, but since the corona virus iv sort of ""sprung"" and have made a presence at my work place, iv been told that i ""stand out"" by other people as i started working harder at my warehouse (labor-wise) to tire myself out so i can sleep at night (i have insomnia). Recently i was socializing with everyone and i happened to literally bump into my 3 year old crush.

She smiled and was staring at my crouch for a few seconds as we bumped into each other, i stupidly said ""heeeey"" because it caught me off guard. Later that day she passed by me again and we sort of eye fucked each other for a good 6 seconds.

I was thinking about texting her but i haven't text her for anything besides work related stuff in 3 years.

621,"I would really appreciate some help here from unbiased people. Essentially, I need to know how to deal with a 'toxic' family member. In chronological order from my perspective, it goes like this: 
1. Me and my much older cousin become best friends when I was little. She was 20 years older, so she looked after me sometimes and occasionally she'd act like my mom, but we were ultimate best friends and she shaped my opinions on a lot of things. My parents were a bit unstable when I was growing up, so I'd often go to her for support, and I developed (and i think she did too) a ""my parents vs my cousin"" mentality. 
2. When I'm 15, some family issues arise over inheritance (very typical family dilemma.) 
3. My cousin and I drift apart for a few years while we both are busy, and she makes some very questionable decisions regarding a mutual family member. She worked very hard during this time, and so I tried not to judge her choices or the very negative attitude she adopted towards others when we reconnected. 
4. While reconnecting in the past year or so, so many things have changed... Almost every conversation we have now, I find myself heavily disagreeing with her morals. Ive tried to keep the relationship afloat in the name of how close we used to be, but I just dont want to anymore. 
5. The straw that broke the camels back came when her opinions of my immediate family came out. Like I said, my parents and I had a rocky upbringing. But over the past 5 or so years my parents have made leaps and bounds, and together they've become the most amazing parents. We're incredibly close, and I am so appreciative of their growth to be better for us and them. My cousin never really liked my parents and vice versa, but my cousin, everytime we hang out, slips in a subtle insult or a straight call out to my parents, and Ive had to tell her several times I don't like it when she insults my parents. Next, and what really ended my cordial feelings, was when she insulted my little brother. For literally no reason. My little brother is a child, and for some reason my cousins always hated him, and openly admitted it to me about how she hated him.
7. Additionally, she continually texts me to try to guilt trip me into hanging out. Literally ALL THE TIME. I stopped letting her buy me dinner when we did hang out because she'd then pull the ""but i bought you dinner"" pity party to get me to stay till really late hours, for example.

Overall, I really love and appreciate my cousin over how close we were and what she did for me when we were little, but her constant negativity, declining morals, hateful attitude towards my other loved ones, and her incessant need to see me and guilt trip me have completely turned me away from her. I know Im probably an asshole, but I just dont know how to better this situation. We're supposed to go on a long vacation together (this was planned last year when we were getting close again), and I feel awful because I simply do not want to go, but I dont know how to end this relationship (or if i even should?)  Also, its important to note that she has purposely ostracised herself from literally every member of our family except for me, and now that I'm drifting away she's trying to be nice to my little brother in hopes of having a relationship there (despite never once being nice to him all these years).

Sorry this is so long. I appreciate any advice!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Child Problems

Since turning 3 Years Old, he is super impatient and expects what he asks for, then and there. Constantly angry/pestering when he doesn't get what he wants. Examples:

1. He asks for food all day, we give him something to eat, 5-10 minutes later, asks for more..  
We tell him ""no, you've had food already"" he goes ""please"" (10+ times everytime) and when we ""no"" multiple times, he has a complete meltdown, screaming, shouting, stomping, throwing stuff, hitting stuff, etc.  
\- Breakfast, Small Snacks (around every 2-3 hours), Dinner, Treat (If eaten all).  
NOTE: We try to spread his eating out throughout the day, so he isn't over eating.
2. He asks to watch ""Paw Patrol, Dino Trux, etc"", if he doesn't get to, BAM.. Meltdown, anger, cries/moans, does everything he knows that gets under our/mainly her skin.
3. He wants his Water Bottle, it can literally be on the floor in front of him and he asks for one of us to get it for him. When we say ""You get it"" he moans.   
\- This one isn't that bad or all the time, just occasionally. But my partner seems to get very angry/annoyed when he does it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Partner Problems

NOTE: She is Diagnosed with Depression, probably to do with Child's behaviour mainly from my observations and her Past.

She gets angry, upset, stressed and sometimes cries whenever he just won't listen to the simple answers ""no, later, stop asking, wait"". 

She is nearly exploding an anger everyday because of his disobedience everyday lately as she can't ignore him due to his constant pastering.

&amp;#x200B;

She shouts at him for smallest of things too. Examples:

1. Bath time she shouts at him angrily for moving around while trying to clean him.
2. He follows her around the flat and shouts at him angrily to stop following and to go away 90% the time. He does this with me too, keep telling her ""it's a normal kid thing"" many times.
3. He drops food on floor or on himself and he moans about it to clean up or get it off him with towel, like normal kid. She has a fit and stresses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me &amp; My Problems

I'm quite calm person and only 3 people have seen me angry/upset that I remember. Since I grew up kind of the Black Sheep of the family, I learnt how to ignore mostly everything negative to shield myself from hurt or being annoyed most the time. Which wasn't hard to learn to do, but she can't seem to learn to do it at all?

So I can ignore his pestering, moaning and tantrums from being told ""No"" quite a lot more than my partner.

Only times I really ever get upset/angry is when my partner is starting to be high pitch irratated or angry/cry screaming which triggers me to retaliate and get involved.

\- Guessing when I see her stressing at him or anything really in general, it's literally the only thing that bothers me, ever. Nothing else bothers me, just her mental state. Don't know why?

&amp;#x200B;

This kind of makes us argue little with me saying ""Just learn to ignore him when he moans"". She says she can't ignore him at all when he constantly says ""please"" over and over and over. I can understand but parents do need to learn that skill very quickly or they're screwed in some sense, told her this too.. 

Then I feel awkward to see her for while and just want to leave her alone because of her inability to just ignore him or control her emotions better which starts the same argument over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I seem to get the backlash the most for getting involved but then if I don't and let her just deal with it, she moans loudly that it's only her, you have a Dad too you know!

Makes me feel guilty and shit inside every time, when I shouldn't as it's not just her he does it too.. but she thinks it is because I don't lash out as much as she does. Rare when I do lash out voluntary.

NOTE: He does come to me first a lot the time, but then proceeds to her and pisses her off so quickly, it's weird.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My Questions

What can I/We do to maybe stop my child from being a ""devil child"" or whatever people call them with his attitude lol or how to teach my partner how to start ignoring his demands and not giving in?

How do I go about talking to her about all this and what type of help would benefit her that I could bring up?

I'm concerned for my partners mental health &amp; actual health with the stress and anger she has and why my child is so disobedient and won't listen at all, so I need advice/help now as I have no idea what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TL/DR

My partner (26f) ""Diagnosed with Depression"" is always stressing/angry with my child (3m) because of his disobedience and unwillingness to listen to us, if we deny his demands. Her mental health and possibily physical health looks like it getting worse to me.

What can I do to help/fix my childs behaviour while teaching him to just listen and leave it at that &amp; what can I do to help my partner with her stress/anger issues?",31Oct2020,1
624," Hi, so my gf and I have been back together for about 7 months now and I love her so much. We get along great and we have really grown so much during our year long break.

We broke up for a few reasons, but they are mostly irrelevant now, and the rest we are now both mentally in a better place to work through them together.

I had a short fling with my bestfriend during this break up (I didn't see my gf and i getting back together it wasnt just a break) I sort of had on and off feelings for this friend even in relationship but didnt act on them till the relationship ended.

The friend and I were super close and things heated up fast, but eventually I ended it as I realized I wasn't over my gf or ready for a relationship which is what she wanted.

A year later, my gf and I got back together and I told her about the fling so I cut contact with my ex friend/fling thing as I don't typically keep contact with exes and it made her uncomfortable also.

I haven't spoke to the friend since we got back together aside from her reaching out a few times but I didn't really respond. I have been feeling strangely about it all lately and I can't tell if I have residual feelings for her, or if Im still feeling guilty or if I just miss her in general as she was my bestfriend, we talked everyday and Ive never been closer with someone.

I feel really guilty and I don't feel comfortable talking to my partner about this as it could make her insecure but i feel like im cheating or something, and that perhaps she should know in case she wants to end things over this? Idk.

I have no intentions of reaching out to my ex friend, but I would like some advice on how to get over this 'crush' or whatever im feeling because I feel so guilty.

I still check their socials, I am mostly feeling bad for how our fling ended and that I hurt her so I like to check in, I plan to stop this as it can b seen as fueling or whatever. I also admit I have posted a few things to see if they would look just cause I hope they miss me too? or i miss the attention from them or something?

Ugh. I hate this feeling. Any advice is welcome.",31Oct2020,1
625,"Come March I will have to move out of my home in NYC (this is happening regardless of what I do). My plan prior to the pandemic was always to try a nomadic lifestyle. Obviously the pandemic has complicated that.

My plan tentatively is to join a close friend in Hawaii come March and stay for 2 months (maybe 1). After that, I'd like to join a friend in Mexico City and live there for 6 months. From there, I'll figure out what's next. I am staying in these places for those durations as it aligns with when I'll have a friend/place to stay with. 

I am immensely conflicted. I have been extremely vigilant about the coronavirus. I have not eaten out once. I have only met 1 or 2 friends outside socially distanced with masks at any given time. I have definitely not gone to any parties. Not out of concern for personal safety but because I feel it's a duty we all bear to sacrifice for the greater good. 

This is my inherent conflict. Is it ethically right or justifiable to embark on this more nomadic lifestyle where I expect to stay at a place 3-6 months and move on? 

On one hand, I justify it to myself by saying I will only *move* to a location. I won't engage in reckless or selfish behavior. I will be the best visitor I can be until a vaccine. Many people have moved since the pandemic and I would be one of them. I don't fault them for making a move and find it rather reasonable. Moreover, we may have a vaccine by the time my 6 month stint in Mexico is over. Which would mitigate any concerns on my end of my next few moves.

On the other, nomadic lifestyles are inherently different. While I will practice all precaution while I am settled/living in a place, I aim to be moving around every 3-6 months with the exception of the initial 1-2 month stint in Hawaii. There's no guarantee that there will be a vaccine and that sort of frequent movement is not helpful. And if I ever do get sick, I could be a disproportionate burden to a country like Mexico that is less equipped financially to deal with a pandemic.

Would love your thoughts on the situation. Excuse me if I post this on a few other subreddits. Would like to consider the widest variety of viewpoints I can. Thank you for reading.

626,"I don’t understand how people can just get married and be around each other constantly.  I got married in 2019, and I love my husband.  But I guess I just didn’t expect to struggle so much with it.  It’s not like we didn’t live together before.  We were living together for a couple of years.  I guess things are a bit different because we’re legally bound together now.  Also, I feel like I was much more independent before we were married.  My finances were mine only.  I felt like I could buy whatever I wanted, as long as I could afford it.  Now it’s like I can’t do anything without it somehow affecting my husband.  He’s not trying to limit me or anything, it’s just the dependency aspect that is embedded in marriage.  I can’t just go for a walk by myself.  I have to at least tell my husband where I’m going, and I know that the entire time I’m gone, he’ll be worrying about me until I get home.  So it feels like I can’t really enjoy it.  

I really miss having any alone time at all.  We have a small house, so even though I could go in a different room, I don’t *really* feel like I’m getting alone time.  I miss running errands for myself only.  I miss putting off cleaning and doing nothing while ordering take-out.  My husband makes much more money than me, so I often feel guilty if I’m not doing more around the house.  We try to share our chores, and we both want to have an equal and fair distribution of chores.  He tries to reassure me that I don’t need to take on the majority of housework.  I just constantly feel like I’ll become the “nagging, lazy wife who has let herself go” stereotype if I’m not constantly working...  

My husband doesn’t want to spend the money on take-out (I get it...it’s not the healthiest, and it’s more expensive).  I like to cook, so I do the majority of the cooking.  But sometimes I just want to get take-out or go out to a restaurant.  We got ice cream recently, husband got into a bad mood all day over the fact that a child’s size ice cream cost $4.  My husband grew up in tough circumstances, and money was often tight, so it has had an impact on him.  But it gets frustrating.  It’s hard for me to enjoy anything I buy because I’m riddled with guilt.

Also, changing my last name was also really difficult.  It felt as if I was changing my whole identity.  I always knew what marriage entailed, but for some reason, everything feels different now that I’m in it.  I’m constantly feeling depressed from having so many responsibilities and feeling guilty for wishing I was single and didn’t have to worry about anyone but myself.  I have had conversations explicitly about all of this with my husband.  I know that he’s been trying to work on making things better.  I feel like the problem is that I can’t handle marriage and responsibilities like this. 

I don’t know what to do.  I’ve been completely miserable.  My ideal life would be to live by myself in my own place for like 3-4 days out of the week, have my own finances, have my own stuff at my place, and pack a bag to be with my spouse for the rest of the week, then go back to my home.  I’m sure in this scenario, going back and forth could get tiring.  But it wasn’t that tiring for me when we were dating.  I had a lot of comfort in knowing that I had my own place to go back to where I could be alone.  But, this isn’t something my husband wants.  Not to mention, that would be quite expensive.  I don’t know if it’s something anyone but me wants.  I’m just so much happier alone.  I feel like I’m an empty shell of a person now...",31Oct2020,1
627,"Was sent home by my manager today because I was wearing a sweater that wasn’t allowed (which is complete bs, but that’s another story). She told me to change into a proper sweater and come back, but before she let me go, asked me if I was wearing a bra, and when I answered honestly, told me I had to put one on before coming back, which has been illegal since the 1960’s.

Originally I just wasn’t ever going to go back after being sent home - ignore calls and texts, ignore the schedule, just never return. But my mom works in human resources (at an unrelated company), and so she knows all of my rights with this stuff, and when I spoke with her about it she said to go back and file a harassment claim because legally they cannot do that because under Title VII it is considered workplace discrimination (and also, why was a grown woman looking at my (18 year old) boobs? The entire situation was wildly inappropriate).

When I told my boss (and my manager’s boss) about the comment and that I wanted to file a claim, she told me she didn’t think I should because I was taking the entire situation too personally (and spent 15 minutes talking about my uniform violation and wrote me up for the misunderstanding where I thought my sweater would be okay because it followed every guideline they’ve ever told me about acceptable sweaters).

Here’s where things get complicated.

All of the above happened today. I got in touch with the owner of the franchise, she said she’d do a full investigation and get back to me on Monday. My boss told me not to come back to work until then (which my mom told me they legally have to pay me for those hours I’m missing that I would have worked). But last night, before I even knew there would be an issue today, I applied to a different job (I’m very unhappy in the one I’m in right now, and feel as though I’m frequently being unfairly singled out there, and have been looking for a new one for a few weeks) and I’m fairly certain that I’ll at least get an interview.

I selected that they could contact my current employer. I have not told my current employer that I am searching for a new job - but I think she’s been starting to suspect it for about a week now.

While I know my boss cannot legally defamation my character to my potential employer, and while I know that the harassment claim is within my legal right and she cannot use that against me in any way, is there any way the claim will influence what she says about me, if they call her?

My second main concern is the interview; if I do get an interview, and they ask me why I am leaving my current employer, what should I say? Should I mention the claim, or is that not a good idea? My plan before was to tell them I didn’t feel as though I was being given opportunities to move up in the position I was in after almost two years of being there. I’ve had three different bosses and I feel as though I’ve done my best to show every single one improvement in my quality of work and yet I continually get passed over, and I’m looking for a company where I can grow as an employee rather than remain stagnant, but I feel like this whole “harassed by my manager and my boss told me I was taking it too personally” thing is a pretty good reason - but does it look bad to say that to a potential employer?

I expect to be interviewed either before or shortly after the claim is resolved - depending on whether or not it’s fully resolved when the owner calls me back in two days or I have to take it to corporate.",31Oct2020,1

Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to go on a coffee date sometime next week 

To which she replied yes. This was yesterday. Today I find out from my roommate after he has a 3 hour conversations with S that she isn't opposed to dating but just wants someone who is genuinely interested in her to ask her out, not someone looking for hookups. She told me multiple times she wasn't interested in dating, but she has speculated recently that I have a crush on her. She seems more open to it now. IDK, I also talked to S's roommate R. R said that S said she wasn't interested in dating either. I heard from two sources, including S, before asking out the other girl that she wasn't interested in dating. Now that I have asked out someone, she seems more open to it and my roommate says he thinks she's waiting for me to make the first move. Btw, she doesn't know I asked someone else. What the hell do I do?

I don't want to be an asshole and I don't want to be a cheater. Those are fundamentally opposed to my values. I can't cancel my coffee date, but I want to date S more than the other girl. Does that make me an asshole? Am I being a jerk? I do genuinely like both girls, but I have known s for longer and as a result like her more. How do I navigate this situation? I don't want to lose either as a friend and I don't want to come out of this as an asshole of someone who's integrity has been lost",31Oct2020,1
631,"I basically asked out a girl (17F) I (17M) know very well two days ago and she hasn’t replied or even opened the message but she would have seen the notification, she’s definitely online as she has liked other people’s posts and things.


A bit of background info. She used to like me a year ago and I liked her to but I had way to much self doubt to believe it. We DM’ed each other for a while and the conversations always lasted till midnight. That was last winter and during the summer I messaged her a bit but not very regularly. I am very introverted, shy and a bit lonely and she knows that and she’s kind of the opposite. Recently, I started a new conversation and it went ok and 2 days after that ended I just out of the blue asked her to hang out some time.  It’s been 2 days now with no response at all and she normally responds quick. 


Should I either;
apologize for maybe being a bit weird?
Wait a bit longer?
Or say something like “if you don’t want to go it’s fine haha”?

638,"So backstory, me and my girlfriend have been friends for years now, since probably grade 5 (were in 11th now.)

I dated my girlfriends cousin (6th grade) back in like 7th grade (they were very close and my girlfriend said her cousin liked me so naturally myself being a 12 year old jumped at the chance to date anyone.) , and never saw her because we went to different schools, which led to me breaking up with her after about 3 months. 

Ever since that day, she’s hated me with all of her being. yes, a grade 10 hates me, because in grade 7, 4 years ago, i broke up with her. 
So me and my girl have kept this pretty secretive around the cousin, (her parents have helped a lot with that.) But, when my girl went to the bathroom as they were hanging out, she went through my girls phone.

643,"I left my full-time job about 4 months ago &amp; I had another job lined up, but it turned out to be misleading. I left that &amp; tried to focus on my side business &amp; I've had some success, but not enough to financially support myself. I developed a pretty hard-core crush on my supervisor at this full-time job, but I was with my ex at the time, so I did nothing about it. After I left, I waited a month &amp; wrote him a letter asking him out because I had found out through a friend that he wanted my number before I left. He got it, but never did anything about it, so I decided to be a little bold. 

Anyway, I was completely ignored &amp; rejected. I wrote to him that ""no"" would be understood, but the silence really hurt. Our mutual ""friend"" had a pretty big crush on me, but knew I liked his buddy, but he accused me of being obsessed with this guy &amp; told him that I was. This ""friend"" I had also said I was desperate because I was recently single &amp; also accused me of sleeping with men at work, but I never did. That's harassment &amp; slander because I asked him not to lie about me, but he never stopped. I was afraid to report him because I considered him a friend. I was also verbally sexually harassed by a man outside of my department &amp; had a fair bit of unwanted advances from men, but they weren't all harassing me. They just misinterpreted my friendliness. 

Anyway, I was going to email my hiring manager &amp; ask if I could reapply for my old job. I'm very much prepared to stand up for myself &amp; talk to my ""friend"" about boundaries as well as a few others if I come back. 

I'm just so embarrassed over the rejection from my supervisor. I wouldn't say I was desperate. I was just excited to maybe get to know someone again &amp; I'm assuming it was interpreted as desperation because of our ""friends"" big mouth. I can't blame him completely &amp; he's not a terrible person. I think he was a bit jealous &amp; wanted me for himself.

I'm just afraid because I don't want to be a pariah at work &amp; if I did come back I would very much like to communicate with my supervisor &amp; tell him that I have no intentions other than to be 100% professional &amp; that I never meant to make him uncomfortable. I'm okay if he never wants to be friendly with me again. I never really did anything wrong to him, but I feel ashamed whenever I think of the situation. I wqs going through &amp; I'm still going through a lonely phase in my life, but I'm okay with being alone for the most part. 

I really liked him, but I always respected his management. I'm shocked that I would even consider coming back, but I need something to do woth my time. I've already been judged &amp; stabbed in the back, so I really expect things to be just as toxic as before. I'm just able to handle it better.",31Oct2020,1
644,"First off, thanks for taking the time to read this. Life is busy.  So, I'm trying to decided if I should change my major from  Physical therapy assisting to vascular/general sonography. I'm 34  and would like to get closer to financial independence, but I want be content with my next career choice. 

PTA Pros:  

\-I am one volunteership, and two letters of rec, from being able to apply for the  PTA program. The program would start in the fall of 2021. If I went sonography, I wouldn't be able to start the program till summer 2022.  

\-Sports and fitness is a lifestyle for me. I have been in to sports and fitness since I was in elementary school, snowboarded in college, rollerbladed 12 miles a day for 3 months; for work commute and enjoyment, ran and volunteered for a Spartan race, because I enjoy it, and am a month away from completed my Personal trainer license(albeit, its taken me over 6 months to finish it, due to other life and laziness.) I enjoy  helping people improve themselves and their health. 

\-Sunken Costs. My tuition is being paid for, so I'm not taking on any more debt for my current schooling, but I feel terrible not finishing something I've started or changing the plan, again. 

PTA Cons:

\-The PT industry is set to have a 8-9% cutback for insurance reimbursements and payments in the next three years. 

\-PTA's specifically, with have a 15% pay reduction, while attempting to manage more responsibility and  metrics, with the addition of current standards of care. 

\-I enjoy being there for people, in emergency situations, but I don't enjoy socializing or relationship building, so much. I recognize the value of relationship building, even if it's small employee to customer, or just getting along with people, but I prefer to have a small circle, otherwise I'm cleaning, fixing, or working on personal projects, and want my work to reflect that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sonography Pros:

\-Lower intensity of patient care. They typically don't spend very long with a patient.(i.e hr rehab session vs diagnostic patient procedure)

\-Higher median pay

\- Puzzle solving and analytical and visual problem solving that is more geared towards singular focus,  and detail task, which I  prefer, in a work setting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sonography Cons:

\-An extra year of wait time before the program can begin.

\-The shame of not finishing what I started. Most of family, friends, and colleagues know about my ambitions.

\-Difficulty of securing a sonography position. It's a good job, so it's highly competitive. Like most other things. 

I have a big student loan debt, and I live with family right now. Not quite my mom's basement, but the spare room. I have a bachelors degree, but never used it to it's full ability. It's in theatre.

I also have a 30 hour/week job, that I enjoy, and have good standing with, but it won't pay me enough to support a family, and doesn't have benefits.

649,"So basically I got news from my younger sister that my dad has found a lump and that he's going to get it checked out.

The reason why I don't know how to feel/react is because I haven't seen the guy in 5 and a half years. This is due to him becoming a horrible person after my parents split. He was very on and off with seeing me and my sister to get back at my mum. The times I would see him, he would talk shit about my mum calling her a witch etc and just wasn't very pleasant in the way he would talk to us. So after a couple of years of this, I decided to go no contact for my own mental health. 

However, my younger sister didn't do this and continued to have a relationship with him. We learnt that he was telling her that me and my mum were the devil and that mum was the reason why I went no contact with him etc. It got to a point where my sister would react so badly towards us that social services had to get involved and my sister went to live with my dad. She lived with him for about a year which wasn't go well at all, in the end my dad put her into care as he didn't want to deal with her. Her being in care as ruined her effectively and my mum can't take her back as she can't provide all the support that my sister needs now. She does her as much as she can thought.

After all this, my sister still has contact with my dad and I believe he's still saying similar stuff to her which just sucks. If it wasn't for how he treated my sister, I might've started seeing him again after a few years but that situation has diminished that chance. 

However, I now received that information and I'm stumped on how to feel. People mention about regretting not having contact with someone when something bad happens. I don't see any scenario being particular good for mental health so would like some advice if possible.

Thanks in advance",31Oct2020,1

651,"I understand the title may come off as arrogant, entitled, or spoiled, but please don’t take it that way. Hear me out...

I tend to subscribe to the saying, “but once, cry once”. I understand what my mom is trying to do, but I feel like she is wasting her money and I don’t know how to tell her. She buys my sons, ages 5 and 8, really poor quality gifts. Example, she bought one son a telescope for Christmas. The telescope is the worst quality thing I’ve ever seen. The tripod is too light and doesn’t absorb vibrations. The lenses are so poor, you can hardly observe the moon. But she gets suckered in my gimmicks and brands. This was a National Geographic brand telescope and had a super cool “iPhone mount” for the lens. Other people know to ask me if he would ever use such a toy, or they give money with a card and he can use the money toward something he wants. If she had given him money, maybe he could have combined his birthday cash and picked out something of a bit more quality. Now he is stuck with a stripped out plastic tube that is of no use to anyone. And she has, once again, wasted money. 

Is there any way to convey this to her politely?",31Oct2020,1
652,"I got a job in another town and moved. I have some family here, but it is what it is. My cousin bro moved to a different town. My cousin sis is in town and she's generally not really a good friend, so I cannot hang out with her that much without dealing with some kind of toxicity. My aunt and uncle are just doing their thing, living their best lives, working and choring. 

I was doing my thing living as best as I could too. The transition is coming down on me and I was trying to keep up with it, but it doesn't feel so great right now. I went from daily active work which I love, but it paid minimum wage (in an arrogant toxic town that caters to elderly white retirees and their \*dreams\*) to daily sitting and writing for 9 hours a day, encouraged to skip lunches so that our department can prove its productivity, with no real tutorial, just sink-or-swim, making twice the money that I used to make. It's not comfortable. It should be comfortable, but it's not comfortable. My new apartment costs twice as much, and it's not really sustainable. If I had a place that costed what my last apartment costs, this would be a comfortable amount of money to save up.   
This is exacerbated by the need to pay my ex-roommate rent for a certain number of months. I agreed to do this because my ex-roommate lost his job and found out, several months after COVID-19 lockdown, that it wasn't just a furlough, it was indefinite. Also, ex-roommate is psychologically and verbally abusive and every year I tried to leave before that he had some reason why I was being a shitty human being if I left him to fend for himself. This time the job sprung on me so suddenly that I didn't tell him because I didn't want him to talk me out of it. I desperately needed more than a minimum wage job, and I needed no one to stop me. So I agreed to help him with rent. I'm feeling crushed under the pressure. 

My parents are willing to flow some money to me so that I can put it into my retirement, but I hate it. I spent my whole life trying not to rely on my parents because that's what the \*American dream\* is about - we pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and make it work so that people who wanted to have power over us can't have power over us. And that's what I want - freedom. But there's no such thing, is there?   
In case you're wondering, the reason I ended up with a roommate like that guy\^ is because I needed to get away from my parents, who treated me like an object and possession and not like a person. They second guessed every attempt I made at pursuing my career field, even though more than one career counselor sat me down and told me that I have a degree and I need to put it to use. So I really DON'T want to take my parents' money. They say they don't want to control me anymore, but let's be real - humans are humans and old habits die hard, or die never as long as you know you can get away with it.  


I held off on all candy and festivities and going out and buying dinners, and then every now and again I get tired, lonely, bored, cranky, frustrated with monotony, and want to do something different. I'm annoyed that the only thing there is to do in this town is go to restaurants or movies or spend money buying things we don't need. I went from a town that recycles and is chock full of parks and nature, to a concrete-Venice with islands of spending potential to quell your boredom - you have to actually make money for that. It's hurting me morally too. I'm a biologist. Endless consumerism isn't good for the environment. It's plastics and synthetics, or it's useless ""fashions"" when you know you could be doing something else. Finding a recycler was like pulling teeth. No one was willing to help or be helpful. If I wanted to speak to the manager, I was called a ""Karen."" In my last town, we were skinned alive by our bosses if we didn't offer the utmost service and help. (This is possibly tied to the elderly retiree community to whom we all fawn, stumbling over ourselves to offer only the best service.) The difference is stark. I don't know what to do or say. I'm supposed to do this all on my own?  


I have gained a significant amount of weight (for me - I'm short and petite so any amount of weight or bloat is a lot for me.) I don't know what to do. I try and I try and I try and then, hormonally, I lose control for a week. I cook for myself, clean constantly, eat well, exercise 1-2x per day, added resistance and weight lifting to my routine. The only things missing are daily meditation/yoga/de-stress exercise. I'm also not getting enough sleep. (Junk food and heavy food give me indigestion, alcohol and weed make me feel bloated and give me cravings, so I'm not really that worried about getting stuck on those things.)

I'm getting mixed messages at work. My boss's supervisor wants us all to get sunlight and fresh air whenever we can, but then he turns around and pressures my boss that we need to put out a certain amount of work or we'll be deemed as unnecessary. As the new fiscal year started, assignments are pouring in. I'm new and there's no training regime for this - just working off of previous assignments and using them as my guide to complete new assignments. If I take my Union established breaks and lunches, I feel better, but if I need to put out a certain amount of work to prove my worth and necessity, then I have to skip all breaks, lunches, and any remaining daylight in the sky. I'm a POC - I need sunlight for my vitamin D and general health. (I DO have vitamin D supplement I can take at home with my meals and I'm trying to do so, yes indeed. I also DO have a light box so I can simulate sunshine on the cloudy days when the Seasonal Pattern gets rough.) It's awkward to say the least. Last week my boss was on vacation and still working from home! What the sh\*t is that? Why isn't he allowed to take breaks?!

I'm having trouble with this and I keep postponing getting a psychiatrist so that I can get back on some adult ADHD medicine. I'm still ruminating about my past domestic abuse and it's ruining my productivity. I'm so tired of sitting every day, my muscles are getting so tight. 

I DID start Tai Chi, and I'm hoping that helps with my stress, and joints, and feeling of needing community without just going to the mall and buying things. I have not started volunteering again yet. That really helped me in the past, but so many things were shut down for a while. I'd like to, and I don't know where to start. My psyche is still overshadowed by my previous 3 years in that toxic town where we cow-towed to a snarky entitled older generation. 

This embarrassingly went from an advice question to a confession of how I'm NOT okay right now even though I'm telling people that I'm okay. 

I'm still asking though, for advice. How do I do this? How do I make this transition work? How do I transition from active 8 hours a day to sedentary 8.5 hours per day?  
 I desperately needed to get away from my previous situation, and I'm also so confined, isolated, and LISTLESS. (I'm not chronically bored - there's plenty to discover if you look. But there has to be MEANINGFUL actions or else I'm just another disgusting consumer fueling America's dying capitalist system like some trained chicken, and friends - I will not accept that life.)",31Oct2020,1
653,"So here’s the situation: i just started training for my job, and i work right next to my trainer and someone of much higher rank than me (I’m in the military). Until recently i have been attempting to be more charismatic and open to conversation; which isn’t something I’ve tried before, but i wanted to keep it going. I usually practice my charisma by talking to people I’m around (in this case my trainer and co worker) but yesterday i became extremely uncomfortable talking to them after my trainer criticized me for being late, and then later being extremely tired about an hour before i left work. 
It’s expected that i would be called out for being late, and I’m not giving myself any excuses for being so, but it’s the way i handled it that i needed advice on.

After i was criticized, i slowly started to just shut down. I kept telling myself that it was just something to learn a lesson from, yet i started to crumple and cower over the course of 8 hours. I tried to keep up conversations and be energetic, but the more i tried to keep up the charisma the more drained and defeated i felt. My posture went from relaxed to tense, my voice started growing quieter and more timid, and i could barely get through my shift without feeling completely awful.

Some backstory: the time around when i was in high school, my mom married someone who was an ex-marine. He was well meant, but extremely critical of everything i did. Until then i hadn’t had a father figure to teach me important things about life and it reeeeaaalllyyyy showed. He must have realized how far back i was and supposedly decided to teach it all in the span of four years. I suppose it was best i knew all that stuff before being thrown into the real world, but the consequences of the constant berating of criticism whittled my confidence in myself to basically nothing. During my younger years i also had trouble with self confidence, as when i asked for help, my mom or grandparents would watch me fail once and then just do it for me in frustration, so I’ve had a lot of similar troubles back then.

Now when i get criticized or told to do something by someone who has power over me i just keep my head down and quietly obey, while my self confidence ceases and i become extremely burnt out and tired.

So what should i do? Seek help? Adopt a different angle on the issue? I’m not sure, i just really need advice before it breaks me back down to nothing again",31Oct2020,2

So right now I think that next year I could start masters degree in something not that specific  like business administration or smth similar, but is it the right way to go? I am having a lot of difficulty dealing with a fact that I FINALLY found something I like, but it doesn't really provide for a secure lifestyle.

I am 23 now and I would appreciate advice how did you find something you would like to study and then work in for quite sometime. What kind of proffesion you can find that gives financial security and maybe would involve something with  education because thats something I can feel passionate about.",31Oct2020,1

660,"Is there a special treatment to help them and/or a safe facility to keep them in while they’re worked with?

If not, it seems very irresponsible to take an already-violent psychopath (yes, they are already violent), and just keep them in a house/in society and wait for them to grow bigger and turn their current brand of harm, abuse, and bullying into potential horrible wounds or murder.

It just seems like an unnecessary and irresponsible risk in my eyes.

So, what can be done? Is there a treatment for them, or a safe place for psychopaths like them to stay so they can’t harm people as readily? Again: Seems reeeeeal risky to just keep them around in the house and in society.",31Oct2020,1
661,"TLDR: Adopted stray dog, everyone says hes owned by someone but they do not know who. Am I stealing dog or not? What do I do if supposed “real” owner shows up?

So for context a week before fall hit there was a dog roaming around our street. He was very wary of humans but super friendly towards dogs. I thought the neighbors had taken him in as he was in their house for a night but they said he was not n gave him to me. Now I put this dog up on the lost dog website for my city went to get him checked for a microchip (no microchip) and waited about two weeks for someone to claim him. No one showed up or bothered to call out in the neighborhood. So I adopted him, Microchipped him gave him vaccines and a tag. Baxter is pretty attached to me and sleeps in my bed every night. 
Throughout this entire month everyone kept telling me hes owned by someone but never said who I asked and asked around but no one had a clue other than he MUST be owned by someone. 
Today it happened again and I was so angry I shouted THEN WHO OWNS HIM and he never answered that other than “your stealing the dog”
This kind of broke me today as im scared someones just gonna hop on my door step and claim him. Hes my baby now and I am not sure what to do if that happens. He was never microchipped and before all of this the “owner” just left him out for a WEEK not even taking him in. At this point I am really leaning towards fighting to keep him as I have already paid for his expenses and plan to have him fixed (the vet said hes about 6mo-a year old most likely 8months).
Am I stealing this dog? Should I have tried harder to find this supposed owner? What do I do?",31Oct2020,1

663,"Hi everyone.

I really just need to tell this to someone because I can't take this anymore. Today's my birthday.. Yay right. No. Fuck that. My family ruins every day of my life. Every single one. I turned 20 today. Was really looking forward to it. Too bad my mother ruined it all. I called over 4 people. My cousin, my best friend and his family and my mom's friends. She's pissed about all ir because ""I didn't tell her"" when that crazy bitch didn't listen to anything I've been saying for the past 5 fucking days. She ruined everything. I'm not even thst mad about my birthday since I honestly hate all of it even the concept of it. What I hate the most is that she considers me an embarrassment because of ""my points"". For her it's completely normal to live the way they did 40 years ago, she's forcing me onto religion which I couldn't care less about. Just because my points are modernized they're wrong. I really don't what to say to this. She ruined my life completely. 

I feel so sad and so unwell that I genuinely want to die. I don't want any of this, I really don't. My life has been fucked upnfor the last 10 years. Looks like there's quite a few decades left of being fucked I guess.

664,"Hello,
The title is a little vague but if you read what I am about to write you might understand more. 

Anyways I am 18 years old and here is my story. It will be long but I am sorry if it is too long because backstory would be needed so you do not misunderstand what I am asking here. 

Up until now I never had a gf that I thought I really love because I could not grasp the concept behind that feeling but I met a girl (17 yrs old) almost a year ago and fell so much in love that I could not think straight. 

She was perfect for me and she had everything that I could have wished for and we had a lot of fun but big problem were her overprotective father and her step-mother.( I wont go over too much detail on that)

I was infuriated and losing my mind over her dad and step-mom and trying to help her with her anxiety and stress because those dumbass wannabe parents would not let her out of the house if it is not with family members, made her work a lot, clean the house alone and take care of her baby step-sister.

I tried helping a lot, talking with her, going out even if it was once a month I would give advice, hug her, kiss her and tell her it will be alright. Yet I was powerless since it is not my job to meddle in family affairs of another family. 

Then all of a sudden I overthought everything and every day Id ask myself what if I am not enough, am I helping enough, what if she leaves me.

After 6 months of a relationship going without as much of a scratch she dumped me because she said her dad wont change in his behaviour and she doesn't want me to suffer anymore.

I was heartbroken and the break up hurt more than her dad's behaviour. 

I did not expect myself to start emotionaly distancing myself from meeting new people and losing all will to be with anyone else because she was the perfect one for me.

And now Im stuck inbetween of two thoughts:
-If it is meant to be it will happen again, I will wait and

-Nobody is gonna wait for me, why would I wait for someone I gotta pull myself together.

But honestly I got no motivation for that. She was the perfect one yet I fucked up somewhere. 

I know I may not be the only one expiriencing this but if anyone can give me any sort of advice I would really appreciate it. 

I am so sick of thinking I won't be able to find anyone again because I am scared of going through so much happiness just to lose it again.

If you did read this to the end thank you and I appreciate that you would read this post of mine and if you have any advice write it in the comments.

Thank you once more!",31Oct2020,1
665,"Hi, quick trigger warning of themes on suicide and self harm, as well as general mental illness, thank you. Throwaway name from a previous post here, which is now hidden (sorry).

Anyways, to my friend... let’s call them H? So the thing is on the tin, but for some context...
- H and my other friends (R, S, and F) are all only online friends who I chat to on Discord (A chat room type app, usually for gamers but I just use it in general)
- This is on a private Discord, with only around 20 people, with 5 or so being active.
- H is a minor, and has seen a therapist before quarantine but lost most contact after.
- H’s family is toxic, but they cannot leave their home.
- I (OP) have anxiety and depression, and go to a therapist regarding trauma from my mother. I am also under 18.
- I’ve also been in not the best mental state the past while due to a few consecutive bad experiences that have put me under mental stress, and at this point I’ve been having a hard time even getting out of bed some days, waking up at 4 in the afternoon.
- H left our Discord server out of the blue a few months back, and only returned around a week prior. We haven’t had much contact during the middle period.

Okay, to the bulk... I was just scrolling through chats on the Discord yesterday, reminisce, right? But then H says something in the channel/chatroom I made for them, explaining how they were going to... attempt. I freaked out, and some of my other friends did too, and we tried to tell them to stop. Eventually I had to back out of the conversation because my tears stung so much I had a hard time opening my eyes to text anything, much less think straight enough to say anything without the chance of H taking it backwards and using it as proof to do it (something I understand, as I’ve almost gone through with a plan before and done the same out of desperation); so one of our mutuals, R, pulled me aside to a DM while F and S (other friends) kept on with the discussion. R told me to not check the channel until it blew over because those type of situations trigger me into a spiral, but I waited around 5 minutes then came back to try again. With the four of us we convinced H not to do it, but I’m still so scared.

I wasn’t able to do much as the others, I admit. I burned myself out earlier this year from trying to be the ‘helper’ in that friend group to the point where I hurt myself willingly because I wasn’t able to get my own troubles out towards anyone (or I felt that way) and so I just put all the energy to “making myself realize it’s not all about me” or something. But I digress, this isn’t about me...

Again, I’m scared of this happening again, I’ve heard that H has tried before when we were no contact, but never went through. What can I do to help, if anything? I just want to make sure H is safe... 

Thank you in advance for any advice given, really.",31Oct2020,1

It bothers me. A lot. The guy I lost my virginity was manipulative and not at all a good person to be with. I can’t believe I didn’t see it at the time being 24. Old enough. He got me very drunk one night. Or stupidly I drank too much I guess... and yeah. I don’t wanna even think about it it makes me feel sick. I was 24 at the time and I was very strict on my virginity. Even walking down and aisle where there’s alcohol makes me nauseous. It was my biggest goal to wait for marriage as I grew up in a very red pilled ideology of a  household. I’m trying to break free from those ideologies as they’ve obviously harmed me. But I’d be lying if I said I don’t believe in them still. 

After that first ex and I broke up I felt so low and disgusting. A year later I started sleeping with a colleague ( I’d say a handful of times if that) The sex was obviously miles better than that dreadful first time. 

Fast forward to 26 and I meet my fiancé. I love him so much and everyday it pains me that he’s not my one and only. My first, my only and my last. Like I had always thought my life would pan out. Except i’ve slept with two others who didn’t have any actual love or respect for me. 
I have a great relationship now but there’s this black cloud over me. I feel sickened and embarassed that my fiancé knows ive been with other men I don’t know why. I guess because I’m sure he doesn’t like it.. who would? I can’t help but feel really bad as my goal in life was to be with only one man. Will I be loved differently, seen as less special? Just be honest. 
He’s never made me feel bad about it but at the beginning he wasn’t happy about my past and said that he sees me as his wife and not to remind him of my past. of course and has a past of his own but idk. It hurts. I worship the ground he walks on but I never feel good enough. I never feel like I’m special enough. I also recently read online that men feel closer and more attached to a virgin spouse and it hurt. I know I logically have more to give but there’s nothing special there to give. Anyone can give him kindness or love, or make him food etc. 

I feel like I’m drowning in pain each day and life is feeling less and less worth it.

Thing is our wedding is coming up in December and I still cry myself to sleep pretty often about this whole thing. We don’t live together  but we will once we move in. I’m worried about him seeing me so broken over it. He knows I wishes he was my first but he doesn’t know how much it tears me up on a day to day basis. Idk how he’d react. I’ve tried to bring it up but I can tell he doesn’t want to discuss it and sees it as a me problems. I feel like he loves me but he doesn’t love the whole of me.",31Oct2020,1
667,"So it started in middle school, he began an overly intimate, forced, inappropriate relationship with me. I had no control over it, he abused me emotionally and mentally to force me not to be able to leave. 
This went on through out high school and began to struggle to function because of it. Then it continued after high school. He acted like he thought he was going to force me to marry him. I knew I would not be doing that. I started dating someone else, he seemed to get angry by this. Then I broke up with the guy. Continued seeing the teacher. Friends witnessed him with me felt it was wrong, that he wasn’t communicating clearly. The teacher began brainwashing students to try and manage the back lash he was getting.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for around two months now, but we've known each other for a few years, so she definitely knows how much Halloween means to me. We've been talking about getting together on Halloween for months now, probably since about July, and I've been really looking forward to it this whole time. I took off from work, deep cleaned my whole house from top to bottom so she didn't have an allergic reaction to my cats, went out and bought candy, the whole entire works.

Last night, while I was at work, I texted her asking when she wanted to come over today.  She said she didn't know if she even wanted to come over, and that she didn't really feel like going anywhere.  I was noticeably upset, we had been talking about this get together for months now, and she even said that it was unfair to cancel on me the day before just because she didn't feel like coming over.  In the end, she agreed to come over, and that was the end of that particular conversation.

Fast forward to this morning, she was talking about how we were gonna watch movies and eat good food and how her hair looked good today and all that kind of thing, and as time went on I was even more excited to see her.  About a half hour before she was supposed to get here, she texted me saying her stomach was bothering her, but after a little while she said that she felt better so I was like cool, you're still coming over right? She texted me back saying something to the effect of ""I really don't want to go anywhere today, sorry.""

I'm really upset. Not only is it my favorite holiday, we had been talking about this for a really long time, she said it was unfair to cancel on me, and she definitely knew how excited I was about these plans. She said sorry, but I told her I was going to take some time to calm down before I said anything back to her because I didn't want to say anything that I'd regret out of frustration.

It's been 2 hours and I still haven't said anything to her. I still love her a lot of course, and this isn't something I'd want to break up over, but I am very upset and disappointed.  I want her to know that I am seriously upset and disappointed and I don't want stuff like this to happen again, but I don't know how to say it without coming off accusatory or mean.

673,"Hi hi, I’m 18 senior year of high school and I’ve been feeling like I’ve had nothing to live for since 6 years ago. I would like to include everything so I can try and give you exactly what I was feeling so sorry in advance for the wall of text. 

I used to be a quite a religious person more specifically a jehovah witness since I was born but in 4th grade my dad hated the idea of me being one of them and promptly banning every way I had access to it not only physical things like not being able to go to service and getting rid of books and such but also restricting access to there website and somehow convinced the rest of my family to not let me go with them which made me, I wouldn’t say depressed but more like very sad and although I still remained to believe in god it faded around 6th grade when I decided that god didn’t exist. In 6th is when I started feeling depressed because religion was the only thing I cared about other than my family. I then started having suicidal thoughts but I decided that I wouldn’t kill myslef until 8th grade if nothing positive happens by then. 

When 8th grade came around I managed to make some friends which isn’t something I had up until this point. Eventually my friends became more like family to me and took the place of what religion was to me. Near the end of 8th grade though my dad decided for reasons which he never explained that he didn’t want me being friends with them because they liked anime and I would disconnect from them or he would get them in trouble. And in fear of getting the people I cared about in trouble I accepted and started to fade out of the group, and if you could guess I started feeling depressed again because I lost the friends I had. 

Then 9th grade came around when suicidal thoughts and depression were worst for me. I decided to gather all my strength and tell my dad I needed help. I don’t know why I decided to go to him it’s just another of my stupid mistakes. But when I told him that I was depressed and has numerous thoughts of suicide he told me that I wasn’t and was just looking for attention. This really broke me because I had a realization that my own parents didn’t care for me. I started to feel empty because at this point I wasn't living for anyone or anything and just wanted to die. I decided that I would wait until a year after I moved out to make the decision.

The rest of high school happened just with the same emptiness and wanting to die. As said before I’m in my senior year of high school so I have roughly 2 years until I move out. 

I guess what I’m asking for really is what are the things that keep you living, the things in your life that give you meaning or any suggestions you have for things I should do or try. Sorry for taking up your time I hope my grammar wasn’t too hard to read",31Oct2020,1

I hope you can give me some advice, because I dont really know what to do anymore.
My girlfriend is studying physics and astronomy on a university. And she really likes the subject and loves the stars. However, she doesnt like the school and the people, they dont help her, especially now when she is ""sick"" from her wisdom teeth. Now she is getting further behind on the others and she is getting tired because of the infected teeth.
She peobably wants to stop, but doesnt know how and what to do after it. She fears that if she stops, she will stay in bed and get depressed. She also is kind of ""depressed"" about life, and doesnt know the meaning of life or what to do. I am 18 (m) and she is 19(f). She got bullied when she was 12 and still has a low self esteem and thinks that if she stops she is not as good as other people. (I tell her thats absolutely bs) her selfesteem is getting better, but she still thinks other people are better.
She told me that she wants to ""live"" more, and do stuff that define her more. So she can be proud of herself and others of her aswell. 
So my question now is: how can I make her see that she is the most beautiful person and that everything will be all right, it just takes some time and seeking out things.

PS: she loves the idea of the future and us probably living together, and take care of the pets and kids. But she doesnt know what she wants to do as a job or stuff like that.

PPS: English is not my first language :)

680,"I'm a 22 year old male, and I'm worried that I might have an addiction to pornography, and other adult content.

I masturbate atleast once a day, everyday. Sometimes more. I have well over 1,000 pornographic images saved on my phone.

I often find myself on adult sites and chatrooms, and I lose hours at a time without realizing it. I've recently started purchasing pornography via OnlyFans (nothing wrong with having an OnlyFans, it's just that I often use it impusively and I never thought I'd ever start to *pay* for porn.)

At work, sometimes I'll go into the bathroom to look at pornographic images (I do *not* masturbate. I just look.)

I've tried to stop, but it's difficult.

I see a therapist for depression, anxiety, and stress from some chronic health conditions. (Due to these conditions I want to avoid pysch meds such as Prozac.)

I've never had a girlfriend, never even held one's hand. My therapist, who is a very kind older woman, is well aware of my poor selfesteem when it comes to the opposite sex.

681,"Hello I am 20f, and I have a friend who is 19f, we have been friends for a while, on an off during childhood due to me moving away. when we finally came back to being friends it was the summer of 2018 when we both got into a tragic car accident. I was left with my lower half broken and almost two years of physical therapy. It was a wake up call for me, seeing so many friends come and go during the process of my recovery. Going to therapy and learning how to set boundaries for myself as been a big help of what I want in friendships.   


So that's when my friend comes into the picture, over the past 2 years, of my recovery I picked up on things that I've started to dislike about her. Slowly distancing myself from being friends because I don't feel like I have really a place in her life due to her boyfriend. I get you want to spend time with your significant other and you are in the honeymoon phase, though to ignore your friend as if I am not there is hurtful. I'm not saying she cant spend time with him or doesn't have a right to be with someone, I want her to be happy and I want someone to really care about her. I don't need attention from her 24/7 but it's tiring when I am the one always asking to hang out and then I get well I'm hanging out with my boyfriend today or yeah we can hang out sometime and it is never brought up again until I bring it up. Not only that but it feels like when she gets a boyfriend that, that's everything she is centered around, like the last person she was with, she is doing the same thing to me like she is doing now. Sometimes it bothers me when she doesn't follow through and making to me lame excuses about oh well I got super overwhelmed and went to hang out with her other friend instead of the plans we made, despite me texting her in the morning asking if we were still good to go for the day.   


Now we get to the current boyfriend she is with, I'm scared that it will be another dependent relationship like the last one that my friend was in. Telling me that they were just friends and that she didn't want to be in relationship, especially with a guy again. Then her boyfriend is all she talks about when the few times (I haven't seen her in a month and only text her briefly) when I went over. She tells me things as a friend have me worried since she is the only real friend or person in his life, she feels bad if she didn't want to be with him.  Asking her to still be friends even if they break up because he doesn't want her to leave him. Her boyfriend is very clingy and affectionate and always compliments her and is always doing things for her.   


Which makes me concerned because I want to ask my friend ""do you want to be with because he puts you on the pedestal? do you want to be with him because he is constantly complimenting you and it makes you feel good? or do you want to be with him because he is a good guy?""   


since the week before telling me she was with him, she told me she didn't want to be with anyone that she would rather do a softer version of FWB. I get feelings and situations change but after the dislike she has for men, it just made me question why she is suddenly so enamored with him. At the end of the day, she makes me feel like she doesn't care about our friendship at times because of the patterns that happen everytime she is in a relationship. I don't want to be a clingy friend but I also want to be acknowledge and made to feel like she wants to be friends with me. There are times when I feel like she does not, I don't think I'm happy with the state of our friendship, it just makes me sad when I think about it because she is treating me like my ex friend treated me with her relationships and friendships. I just don't want to be put back in the same cycle of only being needed when its convenient for the other person and not a communicative  friendship and that's why I've stuck to online friendships for so long. I also don't want her to become dependent on one person either, I want her to find more friends and discover more of the world than a bubble she lives in.

682,"Posted earlier in another subreddit and was told to post here instead.. 

I admit I was an active drug addict when we met and on heavier stuff than weed. She and I would smoke weed together then I'd go home and do heavier stuff. It became an issue. She threatened to leave me over it and I agreed to do 90 days in treatment to get better.
  
While here, I've become completely sober. I dont even smoke cigarettes anymore. And it has been repeatedly drilled into me that when I leave I cant let myself restart any of it because its all a slippery slope back to where I was. I have a son from a previous relationship who I have been failing as a father. I have let my career fall apart over the years. I have to stay better.
  
My girlfriend picked up a drug charge a couple weeks ago for possession of weed. Im not there. She did it all on her own. She starts telling me on the phone yesterday how she was speeding because she was upset at me and thats why she got stopped and the drugs were found. Its always my fault.
  
I told her to quit smoking it because she doesn't need it and I cant be around it when I come home anyway. She gets furious and tells me that I'm an idiot for taking prescription meds because big pharma is controlling my mind. That quitting everything doesn't count if im still relying on lorazepam and sleep aids for mood balance and rest. She mocks my recovery and tells me she will never stop smoking weed and doesn't want to be with me anymore.
  
I'm so heartbroken. I love this woman. She has been my heart for so long and I was finally at a place in life where I felt a future together was possible. I was planning to propose at Christmas.
  
It was bad enough she ended it but she kept on calling every few minutes all night. It became very triggering so I asked my friend to hang out with me and keep me level headed. Our friendship is purely platonic. 

I couldn't shut my phone off because I was waiting for my sons mom to text me back to set up a time to video chat today so I could see his costume and I wasn't thinking clearly enough to just block a number. She and I had been living together and I know eventually im going to need to be able to communicate with her about getting my stuff back.. so that kept me from hitting block. 

My ex called a total of 37 times in about 2 and a half hours. My friend had been begging me to let her answer and I had been saying no but finally said ""okay but don't make it worse."" As she picked my phone up she said ""no better or worse im just stopping it."" She then answered the phone and laid into my ex with an insane verbal assault that I admit shouldn't have happened. The calls stopped after it though and everything was quiet the rest of the night.
  
This morning I get a text from my exes mom telling me im a small man for letting my friend attack her daughter and that her daughter was upset all night because of it. I knew I shouldn't let my friend answer but I did anyway. Im at fault. I know. 

Part of me wants to reach out today to apologize bc even though she hurt me I hate knowing she is upset. The other part of me knows its probably not a good idea.",31Oct2020,1
683,"I genuinely don’t feel wanted at home and need to move out, I found a apprenticeship that’s being offered in a different state for IT. I don’t want to live in the same city or anywhere near my parent because rent is high and wages are low. You’ll either need a roommate or have to settle for living in the ghetto around where I currently live.

I’ve taken prior classes for IT but don’t have a degree although I’m working on getting into a cheaper alternative online college. The apprenticeship doesn’t require any education other than high school.

684,"Hi to everyone.

I(23M) am in a quite confused and weird situation.

I work in a company that my father(60) ( let's call him Va) created with his friend(57m) ( let's call him Sa), they started the company 10 years ago and there were 2 employees that worked there, i was in school that time and after i finished school - 4/5 years ago i started working there because the other 2 employees left the job or have been fired, and for the last 4 years i am only employee in the company.

Va and Sa have a deal that they split the profits 50/50, Sa owns the 2 machines ,  Va have the place and control everything about the work. Now the situation is that in the last 1 year i have started taking many work that Va used to do, like i am procuring the goods, deliver them to the closest buyers location, do all the work like care for the machines, alone create a daily plan for work  what is urgent and what is for later, take orders from customers, bring about others stuff in the place to be in good condition, etc.

So now, Va - my dad, is almost free with his time and he just go on coffee every day, he enjoys and chit chat with friends, he is doing everything except helping me with the work, because   thanks to me and my connections we have 1 new customer that is the third best in buying from us and the company is going upwards, but also the work is too much and i can't handle it all alone, because they seem to not care about anything.

I always talk to Va to help me, to bring some other employee maybe part-time, to take some other obligations to do but he just doesn't say anything and go away, the problem is that now i can't say just simply i leave the job because i talk with customers and they expect everything from me and i need to tell them something like "" from now talk with Va about everything"" , but here is the catch.

My dad - Va, after talking with me and making some kind of deal, told to Sa that Va is going to retire early and they need to think what to do with the company, now i am planning to buy the machines from Sa or rent them temporary (he put a price really high for selling or renting, around 16 K euros for selling, and 500 hundred euros for monthly rent )  but as a can assume he does not like that and instead wants to continue working alone, or me to work for him which i don't accept anyhow, and just to note that he know maybe 30% of the job how it's done, the calculation, etc, so it would be extremely hard for him to start a company, another fact is that he is in big debts and he just takes money from our company and spend for other stuff not thinking if the company have the money to pay the goods or other expenses.

So now i have found other machines which are approx. 4 K euros, ( i have around 6/7 K euros in cash now to start a business)  they are little smaller than the current ones that we have but they are doing the job, i can repair and upgrade them really cheap and they will have no problem about working for maybe another 6-7 years , until i have money to buy new ones that are 15 K euros approx. 

The thing is that i want to start a new company, buy the machines and just start working, but the problem is that my dad doesn't support me in anything, he just says hold on, wait, wait, later, etc. 

These days he sold a place and took 17 K euros, and he helped one friend and loaned him 10 K euros, but for me he don't want to give more than 2 K , he says maybe that the most, and that after few months, so now i am confused how he doesn't want to help his son but is helping another men. 

If i start a company i want to rearrange this place where i work now, and put he machines there and start working ( maybe paying rent to my dad if he asks), but i think that if i just go with buying machines and starting company he wouldn't give me the place and i would be in conflict with him, and i would be in need to find some other place to work and paying rent there.  So now i need approval from him to do everything.

In private life, i am doing everything home in our house, ( we live my dad and mom, my sister , me and my brother), helping with home stuff, repairing something, caring for absolutely everything, while my brother just go smoking cigarettes and partying and not worrying about anything, and yet my dad still loves him more, and forcing and persuading him to start a business with repairing cars and telling him that will invest in his business 4-5 K euros.

If i just go and continue with my plan i would be in conflict with him, and knowing him everything is possible, i will have many obstacles from him, and would be very hard for me to run the business and maintain everything under control. I want to work alone as quickly as possible, because i waste precious time here and i am constantly under pressure and demotivated, because this work thing is really influencing me in my life, i non-stop think about that because it is really a big problem in my life that i am battling every day, and is making me nervous, angry and i just want to resolve all of this and continue in my life on my own.

I am not looking too much about money and fame, i just want a business for myself because of the freedom i can have, working for myself and relaxed, i just want to have a peaceful life, start a family and continue with life smooth.

So now i don't know what to do, which way to go, what would you do in my place?

Please give me advice it would really mean too much to me if you share your opinions and advice.

Thank you very much.",31Oct2020,1

686,"Hi, 

I know this is kind of a weird question. 

I struggle a lot with self-esteem, and am constantly comparing myself to the world around me. There’s never anything I can do just because I like doing it - and every new thing I start usually ends up following the same kind of pattern. It’ll start out great, but then I’ll start comparing myself and it gets more stressful. 

For example; Art. I love to draw, its fun. I used to absolutely love making characters. But now instead of just making characters and not caring about what others think, I get so caught up on whether a character will be perceived as ‘good’. If the story is good, if the design is good, etc. 

Music as another example. I used to love playing the ukulele, but now I know a couple people who play, it’s always in the back of my mind ‘they can do this better than you’. 

Gaming too.

And don’t get me wrong, I still love all these things a lot. But I feel like now there’s a lot more stress attached. How can I break this and just have something I do to keep myself happy, not need to ‘be the best’ at. 

Also, ‘Just stop comparing yourself’ comments are great, but I really need to know how to do that ^^; I get that I shouldn’t, but I can’t help it. 

Hope this all made sense.",31Oct2020,1

Back in NYC, we need to marry at the city hall as everyone, and I would love to invite a few of our close family members at the day of the city hall for a group family picture, and maybe a dinner somewhere or at our house. 
However, his family is ginormous and his mother ultra-orthodox along with a few sisters. I only have 2 members of my family in the city (My entire family is from a different country). 

He insists that to have pictures followed by a dinner he would have to call everyone, around 50-60 people, and make special arrangements for kosher food and so on. I don’t know any of these people besides his mother and a few siblings that I adore. The immediate list wouldn’t pass 20 people: 2 on my side and 18 on his. 

This long list would implicate on budgets that we don’t have, so the solution for him is to not have any gathering here. This means that I wouldn’t have a single photograph of the most important day of my life with people I actually care. 

What should I do? I am upset with this situation and I just wanted photographs to frame and to have as a memory with family members that are important to us and that are not kosher or complicated.

690,"To give you a little background, I’m a high school junior, who moved to my new school a year ago as a sophomore, and ever since I moved there was this one guy (friend A) who’d always try and involve me and talk to me and ended up being my first real friend. I’ve always known and seen him as a loyal, honorable, good hearted person loved by all, he seems to have the ability to make you feel like you’ve know him for years after being in a room with him for two hours. Fast forward to about half a year ago, when two girls enter the friend group, immediately he starts getting close to one (girl A) of them and I guess while I’ve been blissfully unaware, they hit it off. As of about a week ago, I found out they’ve been dating for 3 months, and friend B has known since the beginning and kept it a secret. For a little more background, friend A had grown up with Friend C, and they’re practically brothers, after also having recently started getting to know friend C, we both came to the conclusion that Friend A and Girl A are dating, so I asked her about it and she confirmed it. As I started unraveling the plot I saw that my once honorable friend has been lying to me, friend C, and the rest of the friend group, even having turned me against friend B who only kept his secret. He countlessly lied to all of us about the situation, and after speaking to friend B I’ve found out he’s been ignoring him and lashing out at him. I recently spoke to friend A, and had a real heart to heart with him, trying to get him to show emotion but I only got so far, the current situation is that friend A knows Friend C and I, his two best friends know that he’s dating Girl A, and she persistently tries to get him to tell us, the problem is he’s never really had any emotions, and it’s causing him to act so uncharacteristic. To further complicate the issue, my best friend, friend A has been telling his girlfriend to lie to us, even though she’s wanted to come clean the whole time. It’s evident she loves him more than he her, with no disrespect to him because he also loves her immensely. The whole situation around their relationship sucks, but the relationship itself is great for both of them, and they truly love each other and better each other, problem is he’s seemed to have forgotten about all his other relationships. 

I’m quite hot headed and have a short fuse, now I’m not sure what I should be doing and how I should react. He even said multiple times that he knows what I’m talking about when I vaguely hint at it, and that he “agrees with me” (that he should tell us) and yet he’s persistent in hiding it, knowing full well that I know.

693,"Hi everyone, this is a long read and I appreciate any advice given. 

So I'm a freshman at my local community college. Due to a bunch of family health problems that translated into me having mental health problems high school wasn't the greatest for me. I always took at least 4 APs and did really well the first couple quarters and then it all went down the drain. I was apart of the debate team and did basketball but due to my low GPA and basically feeling worthless I didn't apply to a 4 year school and I probably wouldn't have gotten in. I'm not stupid or anything, I'm capable of a high rigorous course load but mental health sucked during that 4 years. Community college was basically my only option. I never imagined I'd end up here. 

Anyway, I'm doing kinda good. I'm taking 16 credits with 4 As and 1 B. I'm trying to get an internship over the summer at one of the local law firms or a maritime shipping company. I feel like I grew as a person since starting college and have been on top of my work and trying to reach out to my professors to build relationships, trying to start study groups (which failed because no one was interested) and gearing up to go to a 4 year school.

Problem is, I don't know of I could handle doing two years here without serious regrets or depression. None of my classmates seem engaged. I answer pretty much all the questions in a bunch of my classes on order to not have the class sit in silence. It's terrible. I honestly hate being here. I'm not being challenged and I feel like I'm teaching myself everything. 

I don't think my high school grades are good enough to get out this year despite having high grades right now and hopefully the next semester. I'm taking 32 credits this year so hopefully my high school grades won't be looked at. I don't think I'd have all the credits by the time applications need to be out to transfer.

I was considering a gap year to get some internships, try some extracurriculars, volunteer, and polish my SAT score and then apply to a 4 year. I just can't imagine staying at CC for another year. I'm depressed at being here, I feel worthless when I see my friends at other schools having the college experience or even being around other students who want to learn and engage in class. I'm worried that a gap year would look terrible to admissions though. 

Any advice, I feel trapped, disappointed, and angry at myself for getting into this situation. I can do so much better but I'm stuck.",31Oct2020,1

695,"Hello Reddit!  


So, basically I'm 17 years old, about to turn 18 in December. I'm currently hired at a local supermarket as a ""Youth Employee and I work part time. I make around 10$/h, but when you turn 18 you earn 20$/h.   
Therefore, because of the raise in $/h, they usually fire youth employees when they reach the age of 18. I also expect to be fired, however I've noticed a few things lately during the past couple of months:  


I've been given more responsibilities, such as doing things on my own which I would usually have an adult by my side to help me with. Like setting up product exhibits and such.   
I've been on the floor instead of being the cashier,  
I get a lot more praise for my work, mainly by the second in charge,  
I've generally been given opportunities to take charge of things on the floor/at the cashier's, as in giving ""orders"" and help make things run smoother,  
I've had to train 2 people as cashiers during the past few months, something that some adult employees (That've worked therefore 5 years) have been asked to do,  
I've been called in more frequently to help out,   
Less noticeable I've been given a separate t-shirt from the rest of the youth employees. This might just be me overanalyzing, but; The adult employees have shirts with stripes, and youth employees have these neon or light blue t-shirts. I however, have a dark blue polo? Only a couple of other youth employees has this? The reason I'm mentioning the clothing, is because my boss (Who just took over the shop a few months ago) has been really adamant about changing the clothing so it matches hierarchy. He's told me on several occassions that he wants the customers and the employees to be able to see who's in charge.  


Another thing is, that several adult employees have just quit, as they've finished college and are going to university, or because they want full time jobs elsewhere. I think around 3 of them just quit. 

Now, all these things have led me to believe, that I might have a chance at staying there? I'd honestly not mind. I told my boss I would like to speak to him, and he agreed to speak tomorrow behind closed doors.   


I've been thinking of saying something like ""Hey, since I'm turning 18 in a month or so, I was wondering whether I would be allowed to stay or not. I'd really like to stay, but I understand if I can't. I'm asking in advance, as I want to search for a new job in advance as well, so that I don't stand without a job for too long when I turn 18.""  


There are a few obstacles however. I've been ""back talked"" in a way by an adult employee, something that my current boss talked to me about when he took over the store. I'm not going to go into depth, but in short, she got angry because I didn't say farewell when my shifts ended, and because I argued with her because she told me to trim 8 rows of products in 1 hour. (This would take at least 3 hours.) Mind you, she told me all of this in front of the customers, which is why I asked to take it up with her.  


Anyhow, my boss dragged me in for a talk and made it clear I had to obey her - emphasis on me having to follow the hierarchy. I don't see her around much nowadays, but I'm guessing she could've put in a bad word for me? I don't know, but he's asked for updates every now and then, and I've always just told him that everything was good and that I never saw it as being a rivalry thing between me and the adult employee.   


So, should I take this opportunity to ask him about my position? Also, was this the right moment to ask? A lot of my friends tell me that they personally just waited and either got told they were getting promoted or getting fired. Since there's 1 month and a few days to my birthday, I was wondering if I timed this correctly? As in, if he's even had time to give it a thought, which he probably hasn't (I think).",31Oct2020,1
696,"Hello all, a little new to Reddit so please forgive any potential faux pas's I commit in one of my first posts... but I am in desperate need of some advice.

Recently I went to a coworker's party - while I was there, her step-son apparently took a liking to me. She texted me about it, but I awkwardly shrugged off the offer because I didn't want to be rude and flat out say NO since it's her step son. There is a laundry list of reasons why I'm not interested, they're not relevant, except for one, which I'll get to in a second.

Her husband adds me, which I felt was kind of sus given that I said two words to him at the party, but I figured why not, and today I find out why. It's his turn to try and hook me up with his son. He sent an incredibly informal (like we've been friends for YEARS) kind of message, asking if I'd accept a friend request from his son because we have stuff in common and he was asking about me after the party.

I can't say enough how awkward it is to have a 30+-year-old man having his parents try to hook me up with him (this is the aforementioned reason). But I've been raised to always say yes and to care about others' feelings above my own, and I just can't anymore, it's something I've got to stop doing. Not to mention, they've crossed some major boundary lines for me, so my anxiety is in a FUNK over this.

704,"Hey there! So I'm a genius (school wise, pretty stupid socially). In elementary I tested so high that my teachers wanted to move me to G.A.T.E. classes (for the gifted kids) but my parents never followed through (not sure if they just didn't give a shit and not want to put in the effort to help me with that stuff, or if they just wanted me to have some sort of normal life). In middle and high school I was in all honor or A.P. classes (my parents weren't allowed to choose my classes and stuff anymore).

 I once took an IQ test, and I literally got the lowest score needed to get into MENSA. But the thing is I never studied for it, I just kinda took it. My other 'Genius' friends got much higher scores, but they all studied. In my advance classes, I was usually in the bottom 10% (mostly cuz I did school cuz I really enjoyed it, and had zero interest in boosting my grades just to get into a prestigious college). But in all my non advanced classes, I was the smartest kid in the room. I would set the curve every time. I made the Principal's honor role 7/8 times! One of my friends said that I'm basically Malcom from Malcom in the Middle, aka that one kid who's a genius, but still somewhat normal. 

Anyways, the subject that I enjoyed the most in school was Film. I loved every aspect of it, and I still do. I've won a few awards here and there, nothing major, but enough to the point where I can say I'm a Filmmaker without being a poser. I also took the MBTI test, twice actually to be sure, and I got ENTP, which is known as the most creative type. So I was not only a genius, but apparently a creative genius. 

My delima is this; The subject that I excelled the most in school was humanities. I once took a debate class and I did very well. After each debate, there would be a class vote on who won, and then the instructor would say who he think won. In the popular vote, I went 5/6. In the instructor's vote, I went 6/6. The professor would tell me that I should run for president one day. I laughed it off... didn't think I was presidential material and honestly, I had zero interest. He would say why not? And I would just come up with some stupid excuse like ""I'm black and so I'd probably lose. It'll be like another 100 years before there's another Obama."" Fast forward a few years, and now I'm a third year at a top 25 university. I need to declare a major and it's literally either politics, or film for me. I've finished all my G.E. and unit requirements, and I've been told that I need to start a major next semester. Film brings me happiness, and even if I don't ever win any Oscar's, I'd be content if that makes sense. 

Politics I'm just good at. I have zero intentions to actually ever run for president, I was thinking more on the lines of being a senator first and then working for the United Nations. My thinking is that a Dentist doesn't fix teeth because he enjoys it. He fixes teeth because he's good at it, and it's his job. That's what politics would be for me. A job that I'm really good at. I read an article once that said that the number one factor in what makes a good leader is creativity and that the greatest ones in history have been those that were deemed creative/ crazy (this is why people like Donald Trump tbh). Ik some will say that I should double major, but tbh, I'd rather double down on one and be great in one subject, rather than average at 2. I was thinking like an 80/20 split would be cool like a major and a minor. What do you think? What would you do if you were deemed a creative genius? Do what makes you happy? Or make the world a better place? Btw my family is upper middle class so I don't really have to worry about finances... Tldr; I'm a certified genius who has creative tenancies. Should I either dedicate my life to the arts or to the United Nations and help make a better world?",31Oct2020,1

he's also the type to keep going if i talk shit back. he'll act like i started it and he'll keep going and be really petty.

*context, just skip to the end for the TLDR*


Alright, this is quite the story. I (16M) dated a (16F) I know we're young, but its what it is, everyones done shit like this. Around 2 years ago, I met Alexa (fake name), through my bestfriend Sarah (also fake name). We got really close and hit it off. about 7 months in to our friendship, I realize I like her, alot. I decide to ssk her out, and she goes to Sarah for advice (sarah is also her bff) Sarah tells her to give me a try and see how it goes.

We end up dating for about a year and a half. 2020 arrives, we're not talking that much. Only forced conversations, covid also hit, which made it worse; so pretty much January 2020-April 2020 no talking, just forced convos. April rolls up and we have one of the best convos we've had. I mean we talked for a solid 6 hours, she says she has to go sleep, I tell her goodnight, I love you. No biggie right? haha, no. She responds with ""umm.. I dont know what to say to that"" It then sunk, she has lost feelings. I say nothing. 


Couple hours later I bring it up, shes asleep so I dont expect a reply till the next day. Next day rolls up and we pretty much breakup. Months of getting over her, and she decides to write me a handwritten letter about her feelings and send it on my birthday, but she didnt send it, Sarah told me she wrote it but she pussied out.

Shes trying to get closer again, and I have the choice to choose right here, right now. Do I do it? Shes made me the unhappiest ive ever been for a solid 5 months, and now shes just coming back. What do I do? Do I let her? I miss her and all, and I wouldnt mind being just friends but like... It doesnt sound right.


TLDR: Ex is trying to get back at being friends again  after saying she didnt love me after 2 years of dating.

Do I do it? Just doesnt sound right. I would really appreciate advice on this.",31Oct2020,1

I normally would just tell my parents, but it would make him hate me and I’m trying to have a positive relationship with him. My sisters are kind of mean to him, so I want to be the sister that he can trust (I also think my sisters meanness towards him has contributed to his behaviors :/ ).

Even though I can see that’s not true and they are genuinely amazing people. I also kept on thinking, I shouldn’t be too overly happy, I might annoy them or with my closest friend, we both know we literally happen to have the same mind and we’re like sisters to each other but I couldn’t help think today, when we were agreeing with things we genuinely had the same opinion on, I kept on thinking, don’t say anything otherwise she will think you’re copying her.

711,"So, I've been living with my boyfriend (now husband) for 9 years at the time of this story and I've always kinda wondered if my inlaws were throwing shade or if I'm over-thinking this.  Etiquette where I'm from and where they're from are night and day (I'm rural, they're big city folk).  Can you guys weigh in and let me know what you think with unbiased ears?

So my boyfriend's little brother had been living with this girl for a few years and they decided to get married.  We'd met a few times but they live several hours away so it wasn't like I knew them well, but I'd known my husband's brother since we were in High School.  We weren't friends, he's younger, but it's a small town so everybody knows everybody.

Anyway, I'll cut right to it.  I don't know what the etiquette is for seating arrangements at weddings.  Honestly, I don't even like weddings, mine (married the guy in this story a few months after his brother's wedding took place in fact) was a very simple affair with less than 10 people in attendance.  It WAS NOT FANCY in any respect.  My in-laws wedding however, was the tens-of-thousands of dollars, let's make an epic blow-out, 100% instagrammable ""magic moment"" big city type ordeal with all the stops pulled out.  Assigned seating, had to spend a whole weekend on this and hundreds of dollars just to participate.  My boyfriend, whom I was basically a common-law wife to at this point, was the best man.

So I can't help but notice that, while all of her family - her brother and his wife let's use them as an example, were seated with the rest of the family at the ""family"" table, I was seated at the furthest table to the left of the wedding party with the wives of the rest of the groomsmen and one poor guy who didn't make the cut to be a groomsman ( I think they were afraid his alcoholism would get in the way).  I'm not friends with any of these people even though we're from the same small town and know of each other, so I was just stuck at my new brother and sister in law's wedding with what amounts to a table full of strangers.  True, I wasn't legally a wife yet, but they knew we were waiting for a big event in our financial lives to finally pull the trigger and sign the legal paper work.  I had basically been part of the family for nearly a decade at this point.

Should I have been set with the rest of the groomsmen's wives, or should I have been sitting with the rest of the family?  These people aren't really religious so I don't think this is a factor.  I'm not really sure what the appropriate answer was here.  I kinda feel like I probably should have been sitting with the family because I WAS family, but maybe that's not how traditional wedding seating works?  It was an awkward night being on my own trying to make conversation with a bunch of acquaintances who had their own little clique (they were all my BIL's friend's wives and they all still hung out together frequently at home).

713,"Hey reddit.

Let me give some context:

I'm currently in a city because im studying my engineering degree.

Since covid i left my house, six months passed and someone broke in and stold a lot of my things.

My neighbor (which i was allways cordial with, but never actually tooked a moment to actually meet them) asked around for my phone number and contacted me. I call my aunt who lives close to ask her for help (the door lock and some other things had to be replaced). In that process my neighbor's mom came and spoke with some of my family and when they relaxed enough to talk about things other than the fact i just got robbed, my neighbor told them that her 18 yo daughter (Lets call her Liss.)had a crush on me.

I don't know why tbh, i've never actually spoken with Liss before, i'm a 23yo and a 5/10 at best (I have hypodontia, half of my teeth are missing, the low selfesteem caused by this also made me not have a good posture, i've been working to improve on these regards since at least 2 years tho, i also have another cronic condition that makes the skin in my mouth get red/brown and dry at its worst, but i fix that with some clindamicyn+walking). Another thing is that i'll go to the US (i'm currently on mexico) to work there and actually have a good life(Mexico has been a cartel hell hole since years now, and due to some of my family members being on cartels i think the best thing i can do is leave and live with my family in the US(i'm not involved in any of their activities, but i feel in danger just because of being family with those people)).

Should i try something with this girl? idk if the age gap is acceptable (my parent's relationship age gap is 7 years and other people i know have even bigger age gaps), plus the fact that i'm leaving the country next year.

I know everything i wrote almost seems like reasons i shouldnt be with her. But i've never had an actual serious relationship in my life (as an example, the only kiss i ever had in my life was by a drunk girl that kissed me without my permission , just that :P).

The thing is that i've allways wanted to have that first love experience, i lost the chance to experience it before and i don't want another regret in my life, i've actually never ""lived"" my life, i've been out with friends maybe around 15 times in all my life since my teenage years, i've been drunk 3 times (I was just tipsy tbh :p).

I don't want to hurt her when i ultimatley leave but i dont want to be 24 and still havent found love before.

What should i do?

I'm planning on actually meeting her and spending some time to decide if i really want something with her tho. I just want to know if this is actually viable to try.

If you guys need any other info just ask me and i'll do my best to replie.",31Oct2020,1

718,"This is so much to type but I have nobody else I can ask for help on this. 

So I play an online game and I met a new friend who is my age and we clicked and got along so well. Everything has been fine and great, I’ve known her for a month, we were basically best friends. Then a week or so ago I played with one of my *other* friends, instead of her one day. Just one time. She texted me and was super pissed that I “abandoned her” and “threw her away” and she said that she had been waiting on me all day and then I went and played with someone else (when I literally never implied or told her that we’re going to play today or that I’m going to get on). She said I “owe her” some time together since I “did this to her”. 

Since then I’ve been distant. I haven’t played with her at all, I’ve played with my other friends only. I’ve texted her very little because I’ve really felt resentful towards her about this whole thing. It’s just so fucking stupid. She’s hardly texted me and so I’ve hardly texted her. 

I’ve also been sick all this week and going through a lot of family shit, and my work is in full swing right now  with the holiday sales I have to advertise and the rest of the responsibilities of running my business by myself. So I haven’t been on Facebook much to text, and I’ve hardly texted anyone at all lately. 

Now a few minutes ago she texted me again and told me that she’s not going to put up with being ignored and abandoned. She keeps putting on a guilt trip about how her last friend died, and how she has abandonment issues. As if those things are my fault. She is being a total bitch to me for virtually nothing, when she was the one who started this whole mess to begin with, over me playing with someone other than her for 1 hour of my life.

721,"So recently my lesbian friend confessed and told me she is into me romantically; we managed to stay friends etc, i told her it was ok and all.

She confessed because in the latest period she was being very jelous about our common male friend (she's convinced there's something between us, but in fact there's is nothing, she even asked him, and he told her that he sees me as a sister), anyway she just couldn't handle seeing us talking, making jokes, even chatting (she started comparing our online/offline status to see if we were talking), anyway i tend to make a lot of complex about everything so i started to feel guilty if i talked too much to this friend, even if i was trying to shake off this feeling because it isnt normal.

Anyway i just tend to avoid situations in which me and this male friend ""stay isolate"" while she is with us, because i know it can trigger some jealousy **** (she suddenly became quite and stop talking when this happens, and i really dont stand this behaviour, especially when there's other people and they start asking questions). It's a bit heavy as situation and im starting to not tolerate her.

My male friend give me a smartphone with animal crossing on it, because he knows i like it, and then proceed to play with her on the ps4. I didn't like this situation, not because jealousy or else, but because for ****s sake i can't stand the fact that she lives these situations with no thoughts at all while im here counting how many ****ing words i say to this friend because i dont wanna handle her ****ing rage jealousy.

I’ve been looking at work from home jobs, trying to figure out how I can establish a work schedule when I have my toddler with me on my own so often.

A couple weeks of that I was out of town, but mostly the reason why I hadn't seen this guy for a standard hang sesh was something of a mutual distancing effort following my first acid trip which went pretty terrible. I was pretty embarrassed by my break from reality, a lot of the things I said, and having my mom pick me up. I think he was worried about my mental health and wanted to give me space given we never talked about that stuff. I think he was also a bit weirded out by his interpretation of some of what I was saying to him.

I feel I’ve caught him in lie after lie after lie and I still choose to believe him when I know what he says is bs. So when we got back together over a year ago I saw on his Instagram that he had been messaging other girls calling them pretty etc. I asked him about the conversations and he straight up deleted them in front of me and said “what conversations?” When asked about later he said his phone must’ve been hacked even though it’s supposedly encrypted. Once we split the same day I was told by our female roommate that he kissed her the day he broke up with me but she rejected him. When we got back together he said she was lying and it never happened. So fast forward over a year to last month. We had stopped talking to one of his friends due to issues with mutual people we knew. We agreed he was toxic and we wouldn’t see him anymore. So later the friends girlfriend messaged my boyfriend asking why they weren’t talking anymore. She claimed in text that he and the friend had met in secret a while ago, and essentially talked bad about me after we agreed not to see him anymore. I asked him if they really met and he said no. Just asking him if they really met put him in a state of defense claiming I never really trusted him and I never would. At this point he’s right, I don’t trust him. I believed everything he said about everything even when it went against my gut feeling. I asked him if he had been talking bad about me with his friend and he said no.

He claimed that his friend will say anything to make him look bad, but the screenshots show them both talking. I told him the screenshots weren’t sent to me by the friend, that I got them myself so his friend wasn’t baiting me.

One thing that's helped is re-channeling the energy into flirting on dating apps/sites, but because I'm not looking for anything serious, (and because of the pandemic I'm not comfortable physically hooking up either), it's a cycle of matching with someone, flirting for a while until things fizzle out, and then waiting to match with someone again.

I know /r/nofap exists, but the general mindset in that subreddit seems to be about learning to ignore or suppress arousal. I'm a believer that arousal is normal and *can* be healthy. I just want advice on how to be single and avoid making it *un*healthy.",31Oct2020,1
733,"Should I text him?

Hi! So I lived next to this guy last year in university and we would always hang out and smoke weed together. We lost contact when the pandemic hit and we had to leave school. He told me he was shocked that he didn’t try to sleep with me after seshing all those times. And I said if he’s going to come back to grab his things that weekend to let me know and we can chill one last time. But he replied the next day and said he couldn’t. So I didn’t reply as the convo needed. A month later in April he unfollowed me on Instagram and I got really sad so I unfollowed him back. I eventually deactivated Instagram but downloaded tinder this week. We matched and he messaged me saying “hey there stranger.” I didn’t reply that day because I was sceptical of him so the next day he unmatched me lol. I was kind of regretted it because I miss the times we seshed together when school was on so I was wondering if it was a dumb idea to Dm him on Instagram saying something. I’m back and forth because it seems like he doesn’t give a f about me if he unfollowed me and stuff but then again I don’t want to miss out because I like him LOL",31Oct2020,1
734,"Hello everyone I (20M) have a huge fat crush on my bffs brother (18M), he knows that and never said anything about disliking me, he keeps saying rhat he doesn't mind if I flirt with him, lets me get physically close to him, almost cuddled up, now, I'm pretty sure that's still a no from him but any advice on how to determine that without asking? which will be my last resort if I get desperate

Also, do you think it's age inappropriate of me to make advances on him? I know it's just a couple years but I'm still unsure about that",31Oct2020,1
735,"This might be TMI, and I’m directing this question mainly towards women. Those who don’t want to hear about menstruation and periods, please leave.

Also, throwaway account because this is lowkey embarrassing.

My whole life I’ve had irregular periods, which was really annoying since I never knew when it was gonna happen, and I’m usually very unprepared. I talked to my mom, who’s a doctor, about going on birth control pills since that would help regulate everything. She agreed and got some for me.

I was taking them for a few months, and it helped a lot. My period basically went away for the entire time. My skin also got clearer and I generally just felt happier (because it also helps with hormones a lot). 

But I ran out a few days ago, and haven’t gotten new ones yet. In any other scenario, it would be okay to miss a few days of pills, but lemme tell you, the aftermath is horrible. It’s as if all the missed periods from the last few months are all coming at once. I’ve never had it this bad, thankfully there’s no cramps (but I never really had cramps to begin with), but a LOT of blood.

Is this normal? How long will this last?",31Oct2020,1
736,"so i just came to the realization that most of my relationship with the father of my child has been very toxic filled with insecurities and anger. I was not raised in a very loving home but i don’t understand why i feel so much attachment to someone that doesn’t make me happy most the time and in turn i don’t feel i make him very happy either. I’ve tried time and time again to talk things through with him see what we can fix, but he just doesn’t want to talk. I want a good environment for our child and would love to fix things with him but i don’t see it really happening... so why am i so attached, shouldn’t i want to be happy? being insecure, hurt and angry all the time... it’s not good. is there some psychology behind this? aha. just wanting to hear other people’s experiences and how they made the steps to either change their relationship or leave.",31Oct2020,1
737,"So, a few nights ago I was fidgeting with a small flip knife. I looked at the knife, then I looked at my skin and then I cut neat lines on my shoulder. I didn’t really think anything of it. Earlier today, I came across the knife, flipped it open, and cut rough lines into the opposite shoulder.  
I was completely calm when doing so, I was perfectly fine before and after. 
I’m 16, not depressed, and my shoulders really hurt. 

Is this bad? Should I do anything about it? And if so, what?",31Oct2020,1
738,"Hello everyone, I’m a M25 and to sum up quickly I was sexually assaulted about 4 months ago. I find myself able to become aroused but the moment I go any farther than that I begin to have flashbacks. What can I do to help or be able to reclaim my sexuality?",31Oct2020,1
739,"Every fucking day, it’s this family and they’re constantly yelling at each other in some foreign language, slamming shit around, slamming doors and just being insane. My girlfriend and I are at our wit’s end. 

But if we catch them in the hallway, they’re quiet and reserved and don’t say anything. 

From sounds alone, it almost sounds a very dysfunctional family or a couple, that just gets off being dramatic and loud and fighting. I don’t suspect any physical abuse. The screams really come, about 95% of the time, from the same one woman. 

Our apartments are set up so that I’m the only one next to them. If I complain, they’d know it was me and I really don’t want to deal with whatever consequences *may* happen. 

And they’ve been here for years so I’m not sure how the office has *no* idea what’s going on. 

So far, I’ve just playing ignorant to the whole thing but it’s getting to be unbearable. I almost am willing to construct some Machiavellian plot to get the office to become aware and kick them out, over just straight up complaining.",31Oct2020,1
740,"Right now. I work on average 20 hours a week and I go to school full time. Lately, I’ve been running out of energy and suffering from a lot of burnout. There are days, weeks even, when I do nothing BUT work, and it’s left me exhausted. I’m set to graduate by the end of the year so I don’t wanna give up and I just got this job that I like and I don’t wanna leave it yet. I’m also making plans to move out of my parents house and in with my girlfriend and a couple of our friends. I’m also a writer and am currently working on some stuff that I’m extremely passionate about. I’m out of energy. I wanna know how to balance all of this out or if it’s even possible.

744,"Hi! So i’m a 21F and my arms are mad skinny. the rest of my body is healthy and i eat a balanced diet and never skip any meals ect. but my arms are next level skinny, to the point that the shape of my arms are the shape of my bone structure, no exaggeration.I can’t even pinch my arms because they are just so skinny. 

I tried to eat more but all i did was gain more belly weight and i dont want to go to the local gym because obviously COVID-19 and I don’t think its worth making a hospital consultation.

So any advice on how to gain weight on my arms?",31Oct2020,1
