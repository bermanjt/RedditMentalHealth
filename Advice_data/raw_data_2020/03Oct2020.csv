0,"As the title states, I have COVID-19. I was tested and diagnosed this morning after being mildly ill most of the week. It started on Sunday evening I just felt a general sense of being unwell, Monday my nose and ears were very congested, and by Tuesday it was completely plugged up. I had mild aches and pains by then but Wednesday I started to feel even worse. Yesterday I worked a 10 hour shift at the hospital. I’m a cardiac sonographer so my work requires me to be in patients rooms for up to an hour doing heart ultrasounds. These patients include Covid positive people. I have scanned several of them throughout the last several weeks and I’m assuming that’s how I got it, even with all my PPE on. The thing about this is, although I do feel like I have the flu and I have run a fever of up to 101, I really feel like I have the flu. My friend is a respiratory therapist and is going to snag me an incentive spirometer at work so I can work on not getting pneumonia. I struggle with severe health anxiety and mild depression so for me to be dealing with Covid really has my anxiety very high. The doctor told me my symptoms would probably peak on Sunday or Monday and I’m so worried that I’ll take a turn for the worse and end up in the hospital and on a ventilator. It scares the absolute heck out of me, especially given the fact that I am married and I’ve got an 11 year old daughter, as well. She was tested today and was negative so she’ll be staying away from home until I test negative. I’m trying to remain positive and not think of all the horror stories I’ve heard. But it’s extremely hard for someone like me to do.",03Oct2020,1
1,"I have one simple question but i apologize in advance if i shouldn't be posting it here:

 If any of my girlfriend's past partners have came inside of her and we have children with my girlfriend, is there a chance that the child will have any other genes rather than mine? Even the slightest percentage? Instead of 100% my genes?

3,"So I have a friend, let's call him Jeff.

Love Jeff, he's a great dude. Nice to be around, generally a nice guy. Recently he's been irritating the hell out of me more and more each day and I feel like I'm gonna snap at him or start developing resentment towards him.

I've thought of distancing from this friend for a few days or a week to reset. What should I do?",03Oct2020,1
4,"Okay so quick back story, it’s always been a dream of mine to join the military since I was a kid and I still plan on going I’m 19m, okay so here’s the thing the branch that I originally planned on going to was the navy and I had no issue going like I didn’t think twice about it until Graduation and came to a realization that I wasn’t mentally prepared to go so I took time and started working, my friend recently brought up the idea of being in the marines with him and enrolling under the buddy system so we can give each other support in a way and I’m all hands down on the idea but when I really think about it, it kinda gives me a little anxiety because I’m a scrawny kid also because they go to war first and my plan was to hang on a navy ship but regardless I am going to enlist with my friend and I’m basically asking for advice to essentially help me overcome this fear that I have or should I even join at all idk, I don’t wanna work a regular 9-5 job for the rest of my life if that makes sense",03Oct2020,1
5,"My friends (all single) have been buying lingerie for themselves because, why not, you should be able to feel sexy, beautiful, and empowered just for yourself. So I decided to join in and grab a couple of pieces of my own and I was super excited to get everything! For context, I don't really feel like I have a ""natural"" sex appeal and it's very rare for me to feel sexy (or even like hot or cute at the very least lol). So I was really hoping these new pieces would help me see myself in a new light, and feel sexy for myself

boy was I wrong  

I put the pieces on and before I even looked in the mirror to see everything I could feel myself starting to tear up, and when I did turn around, I immediately started to cry 

Instead of feeling sexy, or beautiful, or cute I felt like a joke. I felt the least attractive that I ever have in my life. 

So guess my question issss, has this ever happened to you? and if it has, what did you do after? Did you try again? Did you force yourself to wear it anyway? Or did you do something completely different to help with this? I feel very defeated right now if i'm being completely honest :///",03Oct2020,1

11,"So today, I sort of had this “last straw” moment with my sister and I got angry with her, and basically told her she had a victim complex. Basically I brought up a few time of when she put me down in front of others, which she does regularly, I’ve noticed. Sometimes when we’re around her friends or our cousins, if it’s easier to socialize with others by making fun of me, she will definitely resort to putting me down. Like once, when we were hanging out with our cousin, I said something with completely good intentions, which she perceived as an attack. But when I tried to defend myself, she played it up so I ended up looking crazy in front of my cousin. But after I explained the situation to her afterwards, she still said “oh ok, but I perceived it as an attack” like what am I supposed to do?? I can only control the perception of my words to a certain extent and I apologized? Also, she is just so quick to anger. We’re both living at home with our parents due to COVID, and our mother is crazy about cleanliness. But my sister just gets so livid when she has to clean or wash dishes. And it pisses me off bc as annoying as housework is, I understand that we need to maintain our shared space, and I do my part. But  she will just begrudgingly clean and be angry and almost aggressive to everyone the whole day. It’s just immature. Anyway, I told her all of these points this morning, and she started crying. Then she came up to me later today crying and said I hurt her feelings and that I shouldn’t “psychoanalyze” her, but I was just saying my opinions on how she was treating me??? Idk I feel bad, but should I ? Is she trying to manipulate me? Please help, any advice is welcome",03Oct2020,1
12,"Hello everyone. Recently, I found myself without any meaningful hobbies apart from, day, reading, so I decided to finally learn to play an instrument. I’m a big fan of baroque era music, so I decided that a recorder would be my best option. I know the recorder has a reputation from poor elementary school playing, but when done correctly, I think it’s such a beautiful and mesmerizing instrument with such a diverse range of sounds. So, I purchased a few different types of good quality and I started to learn to play with self teaching methods books.

It was fine for the first week or so, but I frankly never told my family, just out of the stigma of it, which in retrospect isn’t something I should have been embarrassed about. They did find out after the first day or so, which my mother questioned me about, since she saw it as an elementary school toy. I explained my rationale and that it actually was a serious instrument. She seemed to think it was fine, so I went one for the week playing and practicing. I was starting to feel really good about it around then, I felt like I was actually adding some stimulation in my life, and one exercise I actually felt like I was expressing myself. Suffice it to say, I absolutely loved playing it. 

However, on the second week, my sister comes home from college. My door has a large aperture near the floor, so it’s extremely easy to hear what people are saying in my house. After a few days of her being home, I could hear my family starting to talk about how much they hate hearing it. Everyone in my family seemed to just start trashing my music and the instrument. I didn’t take it to heart at first, but it started to really eat at me over the course of the week. I try to work around peoples schedules so I’m not bothering them, but they just continued to bash it incessantly.

Eventually I got stuck on something, so I decided I could use professional lessons. I asked my mother if that would be okay as maybe a Christmas and birthday gift, but she seemed extremely hesitant and reluctant that the recorder even needs a teacher. She still considered it a toy after all. I tried to explain again, outlining the specific issues I was having, but she considered it a simple toy. I decided to just pay for them myself, which have gone wonderful. However, just her insistence that the recorder was a toy made me feel really depressed frankly. My entire family spoke again about how horrid the instrument was, as well as how I sound, and I honestly just wanted to cry, which I did for a moment. 

On the third week, my mother came to me on multiple days and seemingly was trying to talk me out of playing the recorder. She was asking about how this would even benefit me, my college career, or my eventually job. I simply told her it wouldn’t, it’s just for personal growth and fulfillment. I don’t plan on playing it for a career, but I still want to play it well! These conversations she keeps having with my are just making me even more depressed though. I feel like I’m improving and making the recorder sound nice, but they keep joking about how painful it is to hear me and in my mother case, are trying to actively stop me. My mother was even starting to say things about my recorder teacher, whom she has never seen, nor met. She keeps talking about how she’s just stealing money from me.

It finally got to today, about a month in. I was taking a shower and honestly was feeling quite depressed about the entire matter after practicing. I was going to go visit my girlfriend, so I wanted to bring my recorder along to show her my progress. Once I got out of the shower, I just heard the most awful things about how I played and the recorder itself. It made me so angry and sad honestly. However, my sister added more fuel to the fire, when she exclaimed to me, “I hate hearing it, you better take your recorder with you so we don’t have to hear it anymore!” I even heard my younger brother talking about how awful it was to hear me. I honestly broke down in tears in my room after that. I know they weren’t saying anything that bad, but I’m very anxious and sometimes depressed individual, so it ended up being too much for me. 

I don’t feel like anyone supports me actively trying to learn something new. Nobody ask me about my progress or lessons, or how I’m feeling  with it. I want to continue so badly, but I honestly feel very overwhelmed with how family is treating me. They did this with my major too, but they finally stopped after three years. They kept telling me I should join the military instead, despite making the honors college and doing very well in my courses. They only stopped when I got a paid position doing my major.

Is there anything I can do to either somehow make them understand, or simply just not let it bother me? I know this is probably just really whiny and it’s probably my thin skin making this worse, but it’s really making me more and depressed, so I would appreciate any helpful advice.",03Oct2020,1

14,"We've been broken up for just 2 years now, and it hurts because I love her still and I know she doesn't love me anymore.
Where we live (UK) drinking is just far too common, we drank and smoked cigs together at 14 and she got pretty drunk easily, not me. Since then there's been multiple times she's been drunk as hell, it's how we got together but I'm starting to think that she's abusing it too much.

We're 20 now and I don't know what to do because we have a friendship that's very solid, but every time I've heard her talk about her drunk nights out where she's hooked up with random people drunk and had me various times help her or collect her or even talk to her and support her as she's cried n stuff. I still have massive jealousy over these things. She has alcoholism in her family, I think a grandad or great aunt which could affect her.

She could never be serious, anything serious and she starts to cower away. I used to think I wasn't good enough at all for her, I still do, but I also know now how flawed she is and I still love her regardless which is why this sucks. 

She had an accident before lockdown where after a fight with some friends she got drunk as hell and ended up in the hospital to alcohol poisoning, I got called and drove over to see her. The doctors and what not came over asking about drinking problems any drug problems or suicidal thoughts as they might do, it got me thinking that they might be on the right lines. 

Now during lockdown she's been getting drunk again  and I've been working during and unable to do much about it but I'm getting very worried. I know we're very young still and normally you'd hear like a 25 year old just go through it but I'm getting scared that she might do something else that you just might not come back from. 

I'd very much appreciate any advice.",03Oct2020,1

16,"New post because they other one was a bit long. 

I (26 Male) graduated from a Master’s Program earlier this year along with about 30 peers. There was a girl in the class who I had a crush on and was trying to get to know when Covid hit and classes went online. Unable to ask her out in person I asked her to coffee online and she ghosted me (she didn’t respond to my messages). I was devastated and heartbroken, and was in a bad place already because of covid. I removed her on all social media because I thought it would help me get over her, but a few days later tried to add her back. A few weeks later I apologised to her for what I did. I have been messaging her occasionally and she responds but I don’t know if she has forgiven me or if she’s mad. 

I also removed one of her guy friends who was also in our program. He was making me mad by ignoring all of my posts, which maybe sounds stupid but was angry and I thought removing him would be the best course of action. 

Anyways this all happened a few months ago but now I’m starting to wonder if other people in my program have found out I removed the two of them on social media. Aside form their close friends I didn’t expect anyone else to find out or really care (I don’t think I would hearing about a similar situation) But I’m starting to wonder if other people in the program found out somehow. I think a few people in the program may have unfollowed me on Instagram, but they may not have followed me in the first place I can’t remember. There is one girl who I am pretty sure knows because we used to be friendly but when I saw her the other day, she ignored me and seemed to be avoiding me, which is when I first realised that something might be up. I had been doing Zoom trivia with a group of us regularly since the pandemic started in March and it’s been nice to stay connected with them but I do feel some guilt about what I did because they might not like me if they knew I removed that girl just for ghosting me. Now I am wondering if I should even go to trivia anymore or if I have alienated them. 

What should I do? I know I made mistakes but I don’t want to lose friends, do you think my actions would be unforgivable to them? Should I keep going to trivia? Should I come clean? This whole situation is making me feel like garbage and alone. Do I need to make this right? Or just move on. I hate only being able to wonder if people I consider friends no longer like me or are talking about me behind my back.",03Oct2020,1

I am relatively healthy, skinny, I've been more active lately and seen a lot of improvement in my mental health (not feeling depressed) lately, but I'm still feeling stressed.

I am taking 3 AP’s and 2 Honors classes for my junior year of high school. We’re only a month in and the workload is nothing like I’ve ever had before.

These past few weekends I’ve had this pattern where on Thursday and Friday (usually my busiest days) I’m incredibly impatient for the weekend to come, as one does. The concept of “free time” is alien to me during those days. Time for hobbies? Passions? Goals? What a weird concept.

But, as soon as it does, I find myself so mentally drained that the things I usually find interesting seem unbelievably exhausting in all ways. I end up simply resting and meditating because that’s all my body will do.

23,"My 8 year old (a month from now would’ve been 9) french bulldog was put down yesterday. I cant stop feeling guilty, like i betrayed her and let her go before she was ready. I feel like she wasn’t ready to die yet and like we just gave up on her. So here’s some background on what was happening with her:

She started having diarrhea a couple months ago. After 2 weeks of it not stopping we were planning on bringing her to the vet and within that time she also stopped eating and started bleeding from her bum. We called the vet and had to wait 2 days to bring her in and they told us to let her fast for the next 2 days. When they checked her she was very dehydrated so she was given fluid injections. They did bloodwork and anything else they could to find out what was wrong. They said they didn’t know what was wrong but decided to give us metronidazole pills, electrolyte powders and bland food to hopefully kill off any bad bacteria in her stomach that could’ve been causing the diarrhea. We gave these to her for 3 weeks and after the first week we also sent in a poop sample to test for parasites, worms, etc. Those tests all came back negative and the vet still couldn’t figure out what was wrong with her. We updated them after those 3 weeks to tell them nothing was changing with her diarrhea although she was behaving a lot better. After that she went downhill extremely quick. She stopped eating again, started vomiting constantly and became extremely lethargic. After she stopped eating for 2 days we decided to force feed her some soft food that was mixed with water. She was still drinking water but couldn’t keep any of it down and it was clear that she was extremely dehydrated. In just 3 days she lost an insane amount of weight. We called the vet and had to wait another 2 days until we could bring her in. Once we finally got her checked again they gave her a fluid injection for her dehydration and also did a barium test. They sent us home with her that day and said to go back the next day for an x-day and ultrasound. We went back the next day and the vet said they still couldn’t figure out what was wrong with her, but they said her colon had expanded an extreme amount and they think it wasn’t capable of absorbing any food or water. So apparently all the food and water she was ingesting was just swooshing around in her colon and then exiting without being absorbed. We asked what our next step to help her was and the vet just said there isn’t much we can do. They said it’s possible it could be lymphoma in her intestines but it wouldn’t really be worth doing surgery to check for it because she would be at high risk under anesthesia because of how skinny and malnourished she was (and also because she’s considered a senior). They also said that no matter what we tried, she would never go back to her normal self again. My mom asked if this means we should put her down and the vet said it seems like there’s nothing else we can do. 

My only issue with this is that I didn’t hear the vet directly say “she is going to die no matter kind of treatment you try to give her” and “she will only get worse from now on.” This makes me believe there WAS something else that could’ve been done, and my poor baby WASNT ready to go. The two days we had with her after that appointment almost seemed like she was getting better. She completely stopped vomiting after we brought her to the vet the day before we were told the bad news and she even hungrily ate some pieces of chicken and a treat when she hadn’t willingly ate in an entire week. She was even acting curious and greeted someone whenever they walked in the door. The only thing still off about her was that she was still extremely skinny, drinking tons of water and sleeping most of the day. She would mainly sleep, drink a lot of water, go pee, then sleep right away again. I’m not sure if this is because she really was dying or if it was just because she hadn’t eaten and was vomiting the week before so she was still experiencing the bad side effects from all of that.

Please tell me if we made the right decision putting her down and any advice on how to stop feeling like the absolute most evil person for doing what was done.",03Oct2020,1

28,"I feel like may parents are too strict. I do everything they ask me to. I get fairly good grades, I stay out of any major trouble, and I haven’t gotten to to any serious problems at school, but my parents are still so strict on me. I’m not allowed to play video games on weekdays, despite only being able to play for 2hrs a day max( a rule might I add that I created myself to prevent gaming addiction for me and my brothers). I don’t have any social media, and every app I want to download needs to be requested to my Mom and approved, whether that be a game or a school app. These ones are exceptionally frustrating for me because social media like Instagram are the main ways people in my school communicate outside of school(for obvious reasons) and there are some things I want to do with my friends that I can’t, like play some online games, or use discord. Hell, I can’t even get IMessage games. My mom’s reasoning was that I needed to focus on school, despite me being consistently focused and getting good grades for all my life. I feel socially fucked because there are so many things I’m not allowed to do, that I want to do, and most other kids parents let them have so much more freedom compared to mine. I don’t usually just complain to my parents, I usually just suck it up. But the few times I do try to have a discussion with my parents about this they just shoot me down with “You need to focus on school” or “Don’t question my authority” I feel exceedingly  frustrated because despite wanting to have a mature discussion, my parents will never listen time simply because they believe that they are completely right!!! I have always tried my best to obey my parents and don’t understand why they can’t give me a little more freedom. I am genuinely starting to dislike y parents now. Does this all seem too strict or is it perfectly justified? I’d like to know.",03Oct2020,1
29,"I went to a really small Christian school preK-8th grade. After I graduated 8th grade, my family had to decide if they wanted me and my other 2 siblings in a public school or a Christian school. They ended up choosing another very small non-denominational Christian school (around 15 students per grade). The reason we chose this school in particular had to do with the fact that it was the cheapest  private school in the area. 

Well anyway, I’ve gone I this school since my 9th grade year and I’m graduating this year. At first, I had no problems with the school. The school offers no APs or Honors classes, but coming from such a small middle school, I had no idea what those classes were. The school does offer a few online dual enrollment classes throughout local college. We have weekly chapel, and Bible class each year is mandatory. There are almost no clubs except for a few sports. 

For my first 2 years in this school, I was fairly happy. I had made friends, and while some of the classes seemed a bit easy, I didn’t feel like I was missing out on anything. I didn’t start becoming frustrated with my school situation until around my 11th grade year, when I was given no option whatsoever and put in 2 extremely easy, pointless electives. The high school runs on a block schedule, meaning that high schoolers take 4, 90 minute classes each semester. Being that two of my classes were electives,
I felt that I wasn’t gaining anything. 3 hours of my day was taken up with learning how to smack a volleyball and bake food (The classes were team sports and consumer skills). At this point, I’m a junior in high school, I have friends there, and it’s not like my family is just going to let me change schools. Second semester rolls around, and I’m put in the Bible class with a teacher who was possibly the worst teacher I’ve ever had. I don’t think I even learned anything about the Bible. I feel like so much potential class time was wasted. 

I didn’t become extremely upset about my school until this year. This year, a teacher was hired to teach a senior math class (not the one I’m in, thank god) and a  junior Algebra 2 class. This teacher literally graduated high school herself around 1-2 years ago (I’m not 100% sure) and she has no college degree whatsoever. This is absolutely insane to me. Not I or any of my siblings are in her class, but I am extremely upset at the audacity of the principal to even consider having a teacher that doesn’t even have college degree. I understand that sometimes small schools have trouble getting qualified teachers. I know that some of the teachers I’ve had aren’t teacher certified, but at least they all hold degrees. The school is accredited (I’m not sure how) but this is absolute insanity. My younger brother is going to be taking Algebra 2 next semester, and there is a likelihood that he will be in this teachers class. If he is in her class, I doubt he’ll learn anything and he won’t be prepared for the SAT. I’m not sure how it’s even legal to have a teacher that’s that under qualified. 

I’m really upset and I’m not sure what to do. I’d rather not change schools my last semester of high school ( I don’t think my parents would let me). I know after I graduate I have to somehow convince my parents to put my siblings in a different school. I hate this school for lying to my family and taking our money. I hate that my parents have sacrificed so much to give us what they thought was a good education. I feel so bad for all of the parents that put their kids in this school only to be taught by someone who has no business being a teacher, let alone a high school math teacher. I’m applying to colleges and I’m afraid I haven’t been academically prepared.  Sorry about the rant I’m just really angry an upset about this entire situation and I’m at a loss for what to do.",03Oct2020,1
30,"My dearest Lilly, 

I love you with all my heart and I am so sorry for not meeting up with you that day when you made it to my parent's home. I trust you unconditionally and I was so wounded you would hurt me that way, that I never tried to figure out the facts. You are a wonderful person, hardworking, intelligent and so selflessly kind and I hate to say , a bit of a doormat and codependent and you should stop being that asap. I love you as much as I possibly could with my cold heart, but your life it burns through my empathy. I don't want to see you hurt anymore. 

I know you intervened between my issues just cause you wanted to help me out, rather than with any agenda. I know you were right there when I was born. I know you selflessly care and beyond that I never had much expectations from you, I love you back. It saved me and my connect with my family. It helped me thaw my trust issues with two friends that I have, one being you. I never will forget what you did for me. The person in your memories was a childhood rock to me. 

My lovely Lilly, please, for the love of God and all my goodwill, find someone amazing who can see how kind you are and how much love you have to give, adopt more kids, have new dreams, whatever makes you happy, I will be there for you. You are so incredibly smart and prolific before you let something so evil a important position in your life. For someone so smart and intelligent you can be so  emotionally stupid, you practically rewired my priorities. Make new mistakes, let go of the old.

You mean alot to me, more than you will ever know. Thank you for being there just cause you care, and you did that unconditionally.  I am so sad I didn't take the opportunity to see you that time, I was so angry. I promise you my other friend is just as heartbroken as you about how you both turned out, (its true) that person does love you unconditionally but is retarded on how to express it, maybe you can go back in time and play great music and bring back the innocence. Please choose happiness for me. I want to be happy knowing you have new adventures.

Always yours, my lovely flower with deep wisdom. 

Your friend.",03Oct2020,1

So anyways we went on the first date last night. Everything was going really well at first. We were laughing and nonstop talking. But then she abruptly tells me she has this long distance thing with a guy she met on Omegle. 

She goes on to complain about how he’s a douche and how she’s not sure how to cut him off. Then she’s like “I just don’t connect with him the way I connect with you,etc” 😑

40,"I'm currently a freshman going to college a couple hours away from where I live, and I am majoring in civil engineering. Recently, however, I have figured out that it really isn't for me. I struggle with and don't enjoy mathematics and ""mathematical sciences"", such as physics and chemistry, at least to the extent of how complicated it gets in civil engineering, despite only being a freshman. I really cannot stand the work, not only because I don't understand it, even though I've gone to see the teacher and had kids tutor me, and I still just don't get it, but also because even if I did understand it I don't enjoy it. I've spent my whole life around the construction industry, and there are certain things that I enjoyed about it, but I used to think that that was pretty much my destiny and the best possible career for me, but after time away from my family, particularly my father and grandfather, I've realized that it may not be. I'm not saying that my father and grandfather pressured me into thinking that it was for me, because I recognize that I have put this idea in my own head that this is what they want me to do, since it's what they did, their grandfathers, uncles, and whole family, they were all in construction, so I feel like I should be, too, but I just don't want to let them down. I love my father and grandfather and I love what they do, but I don't want to follow in their footsteps, although in a sense I do. I wish there was another way I could follow in their footsteps without working construction but it seems like that's what I'm supposed to do, but I know I wouldn't enjoy it. Another part of this is that I believe I should change my major, but I'm not sure what to change it to. I have interests and I have things that I'd love to do in my life, but I'm not sure how to best situate myself to do something that I actually love.

tl;dr: I 'm a freshman in college and I am taking civil engineering but I more or less hate it and struggle so much with it, but I feel indirectly pressured by my father and grandfather to continue on the tradition of construction, although I have interests in other careers.",03Oct2020,1

i’ve had adhd since i was 14. it presents itself mostly in a school setting, where i have to keep still and focus for long amounts of time. i graduated and went off the medication i was on, because when i started working, i was doing taste that needed a much shorter attention span. 

i am now 22 and have since started school again. i was doing fine when we were physically in classes (i did struggle but it was bearable). but now that everything is completely online, i can’t focus. i feel extremely overwhelmed by schoolwork. i stare at seemingly simple assignments for hours without being able to do anything.

i have tried everything, sitting in enclosed spaces without distractions, stim toys, etc. the only thing i haven’t had again (which always helped) was medication. i’ve spoken to doctors about it here, but they just assume i’m a college student attempting to sell the drugs or abuse them.

She started fearing more and more of her dad that she was afraid to be alone in the flat with him . When her moms dad died and left for the funeral 
She and dad was alone in the house , he made her remove his pants and he flashed his dick ,she was crying and screaming to make him stop . He forced her to French kiss multiple times .

She studied so hard and left to Poland to do her higher studies cause of the abuse she was facing but then again her dad didn’t leave her alone .
She thought she was safe in Poland but , One day without her and her mom and knowing he left to Poland ,he entered her dorm room and he took her bra and tank top. As she returned from class her dad came to her room and gave her a bag which was a sex doll dressed in her bra and rank top ,the bag also contained few bottles of vodka. She took a photo of the bag contents and sent it to her mom. She was broken down.

Her dad is a powerful and rich man with lots of connections in India , he hates her to have a bf I think maybe because of the fact she was sexually abused by him and she would say everything to him. 

Her mom didn’t take any actions because of the fear he will stop her medical education and also her brother studies.Her brother is doing engineering in Canada and he doesn’t know anything and all the abuse.she and her mom lives in fear.I don’t know what to do ,I’m not rich and have not much knowledge about where to get help .

TW: Depression, Abuse, attempt of suicide

First of I'd like to say that I've been over this topic many times with friends, family and therapists. I definitely won't be able to mention all the details. I have many questions I'd like to receive advice about and I'm thankful for any kind of input you can give.

I'll be mentioning me (20), my father (mid 40s), my mother (mid 40s) and my sister (21)

I have written ""counselor"" many times when I was in fact talking about a therapist. Apologies. 

Let's start with some basic facts. I'm now 20, I am a highly sensitive person, I have chronic depression, general anxiety disorder and ADD. My father is a very insensitive person who's never dealt with his own childhood issues or any kind of psychological problem really. He's a classic ""I am who I am, take it or leave it, I'm not gonna change for anyone"" kinda guy. 

My father and I have always had problems communicating from a young age. Even when I was a baby and little kid he couldn't properly understand my emotional needs. My sister was always an overachiever who wanted to avoid conflict and always put her own emotional needs last and I have always been quite the opposite. My father never really understood what was going on with me (regarding mainly my high sensitivity and ADD but also a lot of normal kid stuff) and since my sister wasn't like that at all he simply calls it ""having a difficult child"". Me being called difficult and being blamed for the way I behaved as a child still hurts very much to this day (he still does it). He also refuses to acknowledge that he might be partly responsible for that behaviour, as it was mostly a reaction to his behaviour. For example, I would always see him shout when he got angry so when I got angry I would also shout. However, that almost exclusively happened when he first shouted at me or my mom. 
Of course I had many problems in school due to my high sensitivity, ADD, early oncoming depression and obviously the problems we had at home. My dad simply blames me for all that and makes me feel like somehow it was my fault that as a kid I wasn't able to deal with my high sensitivity, him being emotionally negligent and at times abusive, undiagnosed depression and undiagnosed ADD.

About the abuse I would like to mention that it was mostly emotional, like gaslighting etc, I am however certain that he did not do any of it on purpose but simply didn't know anything else. There was one incident where the abuse got physical, however it was not his intention to hurt me. I was hiding under the covers when he shouted at me and when I tried to run away he pinned me to the bed with his forearm, accidentally blocking my windpipe for a considerable amount of time. I must have been around 10. 
This event very much shifted our dynamic from shouting at each other to him shouting at me and me simply standing there until it was over. 
Mixed in with all the fights were a lot of great memories and support in different aspects of my life, which might make my situation all the harder. He also sometimes would subtly threaten to beat me (roughly translated ""One day it's gonna be too much and I won't be able to control my hand"")

Now to the more recent events of the past few years. About 3 years ago my parents finally decided to get a divorce. While my sister had a hard time coping with that, I realised quickly that my life would ultimately change for the better without my dad around. For a few months after the divorce we had a relatively good time settling with this new situation. My parents went to a counselor to talk about how to proceed regarding parenting and other things.
During this counseling my mother decided to admit to an affair she'd had while they were still married. This ended their friendly relationship and my father actually fell into depression for a few days. While I was ofcourse shocked to hear about the affair at first, I came to accept it pretty quickly and it didn't have any lasting effects on my relationship with my mother.
It did have me hoping that somehow my father would be more understanding of emotional issues but I was wrong. The following months I was severely depressed, unable to go to school and even attempting suicide. I finally decided to put a pause to my dad and I's relationship for a year and although he was very hurt he respected my decision.
The following months were especially hard on my sister as she didn't understand my decision at all (My sister was only ever a witness to the abuse, never a victim herself). While it was hard at times not contacting my dad it did wonders for my mental health. Shortly before a year was over I started looking for a job and since I was feeling ready I contacted my dad to ask for help. After we got along nicely searching for my job I decided to end the 'relationship pause' early and we decided we would see a counselor together. For a few months we got along better than ever, going to counseling every ~3 weeks and not talking about sensitive topics outside of counseling.

Recently my father decided, since we got along so nicely, it was time for counseling to stop. We had not even been there a total of ten times. At first he only suggested it because he thought, since we weren't fighting, our relationship was basically saved. (All this happened in a counseling session) I told him that there was still a lot of unresolved shit but he claimed that since we managed to talk about it in counseling we might as well just talk about it over dinner. I tried to make him understand that that wouldn't work as we definitely need a sort of ""translator"" who helps us understand one another. He then told me he wasn't willing to pay for counseling when it could just go on for ages and ""it's pointless if we're still gonna be here in three years"". He does not understand how counseling works. I tried to make him understand that if we stop now we'll just fall back into our old patterns right away and that we'd just end up at the point where I'd have to stop talking to him again to save my mental health. He literally told me to do that then. At this point the counselor asked him to leave so she could help me calm down and avoid a panic attack. 

I very much feel like my father doesn't care too much about me since he made it quite clear that his time and money are not worth improving our relationship.

He asked me the day after to have lunch with him but I told him I was not ready to meet him outside of counseling. He agreed to see the counselor one more time. We haven't had much contact since as we have yet to make the appointment.

I know that if my father refuses to continue counseling we will fall right back into our old patterns and it will take a sever toll on my mental health. For the first time in years now I'm actually seeing the results of all my work I put into my mental health and I don't want to risk my health. Now I'm thinking, should my father refuse to work on our relationship in a professional setting, should I cut all ties right away? Should I give an emotionally distant relationship a shot? Is there any way to make my father listen and understand my situation?",03Oct2020,1

48,"Some days I wish I could just wake up and leave the house. I will stare at my freshly washed face in the mirror and talk myself out of it because somebody may think I look ugly.

And I wear eyeliner because my natural eye shape isn't as attractive without the cat line. Then I put powder on my whole face and that's it. The bare minimum yes, but without it, I feel ugly.

50,"I'm devasted, I'm hurt and I don't know what to do...

Over the course of a year, this guy who I thought was my friend/mentor got me to invest over $40,000 . He is the business owner/phd type and I thought it would be a good way for me to learn how to invest. In simple terms the agreement was:

\- I loan him money. 

\- Investments would create profit and we both make money. 

\- If investments failed to yield returns, He pays me back as if it were a loan. 

We started out small and after seeing some results he would convince me to add more and more money, which I did. I was able to get back $17K from the total investment of $40,000 but after months of empty promises he is now ghosted me. He won't reply to texts or calls. His business closed down and he's moved since we first started with this whole deal so I'm unable to find him. 

Evidence I don't know what to do with: 

\- 1 bounced check for $7,000.

\- 1 bounced check for $40,000.

\- One promissory note from his LLC with him acting as an officer, agreeing to pay me $30,000. 

I have pages and pages of texts with him admitting he owes me this money and that he will pay. I've already spoken to the police department and several attorneys offices but nobody is helping me.

51,"Me \[29F\] and this guy \[31M\] have been friends for 14 years. We've spent insane amounts of time together and we usually share a lot. For the past few months though, he's been incredibly absent and is behaving strangely. Nothing has changed in his schedule, but he always complains about not having enough time, even though he spends quite a lot of time on his own, playing videogames, watching stuff on YouTube and ''doesn't realize how time flies by''. He's told me all this himself when I asked him about spending some time together and he somehow doesn't see the contradiction. He has trouble showing up on time when we make plans and oftentimes when he does make it he'll half cancel on me, like ''hey sorry I'm in a bit of a hurry, can't stay''. Sometimes he wouldn't show up at all and would let me know like an hour ahead, which leaves me incapable of making other plans. I'm currently sustaining myself by holding 2 and a half jobs. Needless to point out how that screws with my time. I've explained this and asked him to be more considerate numerous times, he always apologizes and promises to get it together, but it hasn't happened. He has much more free time than I do.

I'm on very good terms with his girlfriend \[30F\] as well, they've been together for 4 years. Idk about her, but he claims he's never been in love with her, however he does care for her. They used to live together in an apartment he inherited, but when the pandemic started he moved with his mother in her house and blamed it on covid safety rules (just prevention, no one got infected), told me his gf was perfectly fine with it. Nonetheless he still visits her often so why move out then? A month ago, she complained to me about him moving and ''leaving her alone when she needed him the most'' (she recently had a very important exam). So, not fine with it at all. Then she proceeded to tell me about him being absent and not paying attention to her. Well what can I say... out of loyalty to him, I didn't complain back, but needless to say I get her. 

He doesn't have any closer friends. I asked him whether he was feeling depressed, sad, whether I could help with anything. He acts a fool but there's no way something isn't up. It's not me, it's not his girlfriend, I think this is about him. When we do manage to hang out, he often talks so much that I can barely get a few words in. And it's always some rant about the news or how the educational system should look like and I'm fine with talking about those things, but I want to share so much of my own news with him and I feel like I never get the time to do so. He doesn't treat himself any more carefully either. He's always lacked motivation career-wise, but now he is basically absent from his own life, not just from the lives of the ones who care about him. I'm worried.",03Oct2020,1
52,"This is my first post here and I'm on mobile so please forgive if it's a little wonky.
I know two people that I think would be perfect for each other. Z, my best friend from high school, and R, my uncle. They're only 5-10 years apart in age, they're interested in the same relationship dynamic/lifestyle, they're always posting the same memes, and they seem to be each other's types (physically and mentally). The two have never met and they most likely never will unless I got involved. I really love them both and want them to be happy, but both have been in traumatic relationships before and are pretty uncomfortable with meeting new people and opening up. I don't even know if introducing the two would lead to a romantic relationship, but I do feel that they could be good friends at least if they were able to work past the initial awkwardness of being introduced to each other.

54,"Honestly quarantine has gotten into everyone but more recently it really has gotten into me. School was a usual distraction which I was fine with since I got to talk to actual people. My mom has gotten religious for the past few weeks due to unemployment and it’s just really wow. One point she tells me to pray and another she calls joe biden a devil which makes me so uncomfortable. Afterlife and death thoughts have kept me so down recently. I just can’t stop thinking about, the only way is when I distract myself like playing a video game. I have gotten many advices about it and they have worked for awhile but not too long until I get reminded of religion from my mom to even social media. I don’t have anything against religions, I’m just uncomfortable when people put it against me. It’s like a constant reminder that I’m going to rot in hell for not being that or that. Sometimes I feel alone I guess? I can’t talk about it to my mom of course, she’ll probably tell me to go pray and hope jesus or whatever takes me in like?????? 

I just need advice how to just get away from these thoughts. Maybe I should go out more but then you have quarantine so it’s just eh.",03Oct2020,1

58,"I get along with my direct boss REALLY well. I’m talking I went to the beach with her family, really well. My day-to-day is great, she’s a great boss and I’m good at what I do. 

However, the upper management is awful. I don’t respect them one bit. They’re so “frugal”that the won’t spend any money to improve things. They are hardly ever at the office but refuse to change policy so that things can be accomplished when they’re gone (approvals, printing checks, etc.). They refuse to hire more people and everyone is so overloaded. I have so many complaints about them that I could write a book. 

I am way underpaid. Logically, it’s a no brainer, find a new job. However I truly love my direct boss, and it would be the biggest nightmare in the world for her if I quit. We both already work 55+ hours a week and she is the only one who knows how to do what I do. Also- I currently handle hiring so the mere act of finding a replacement would be hard for her. Not to mention the time it takes to train someone. 

There’s no one else in house who could take over temporarily either. I’m not joking when I say there realistically needs to be 2-4 hires per department. 

Here’s the worst part- upper management will not let you give notice. If you resign you’re out the door five minutes later no matter what. 

I’m just not sure how I can leave with a good conscious. I feel like I’d be sacrificing my morality. But it also makes no sense to get overworked underpaid at my age. My boss says she is too old to bother looking for another job she just wants to ride it out to retirement. 

I just don’t know what to do.",03Oct2020,1
59,"**Some background info on me (skip if you don't care):** I'm an ambivert that has no problem socializing if I really want to, but it's difficult for to speak about my own issues or dealing with difficult things socially that involve me, I just 'thick skin' everything as much as I can. I can also be paranoid (like I get strange feelings that people hate me, I don't believe the compliments I get on my appearance, etc etc) Basically, I'm a whole ass mess.  


Years ago, I had my first and only short-lived relationship with a girl- we were basically immature kids and I was a moron back then that did whatever for attention. It ended badly (it being my own fault on multiple counts) and that was that. She got into a couple of bad relationships/incidents after that, and I blame myself for that too- if I had been at least a decent person, it wouldn't have happened the way it did.

We ended up being chill later on (or I thought, anyway) and I had some people tell me that when I was brought up, she would talk badly about what happened, saying I was obsessed with her or whatever. I thought that was fair enough and ignored it, continuing to act friendly with her, but I always found myself acting kind of awkward around her since... I just didn't know whether she was actually okay with me or not. (That paranoia kicking in.) She even asked me to transfer into a class with her since she didn't know anyone else in it, and I agreed since I thought maybe it would help us get along better.

A year ago, she removes me on everything and starts ignoring me in school, like I'm a ghost. It came out of nowhere (or so I think)- she hadn't texted me or anything that I could see beforehand. It was kinda tough, since I think of her as a good person, enjoyed our friendship, and I just don't like having bad relationships with people. I've respected her wishes of not talking to me till now, but it's still been bothering me a lot, even though I really, really wish it didn't.

I found out recently that my family will be moving to New York soon. It's tough since I don't want to leave, but at this point I kinda have to accept it. But the main issue is that I still want to try and get some closure, figure out why she did what she did, and apologize properly for my stupid actions (which I never did, yikes) before I leave the country. It's probably pretty selfish of me, but I don't really want to regret this. I even feel like this is what's been subconsciously keeping me from getting into new relationships.

Is it worth opening an old can of worms that she probably doesn't want to deal with? Or should I just... try to forget about it? And if I do reach out to her again, how should I do it? I wanted to talk to her in person since I *really* don't like texting, but uh... we're in the middle of a pandemic.

My mum has smoked all her life and a lot of it has been in the car and I never really minded it because I was just a kid and didn’t quite understand the effect it can have on me as well but recently it’s actually started to make me sick, the smell of smoke wants me to throw up. Not to mention I’m also an asthmatic so my lungs aren’t the best already.

So I asked her to stop one day saying it’s starting to actually make me feel sick and I don’t like the idea that my lungs are getting fucked up even though I’m being respectful to them by not smoking.

She’s doing this thing where she starts to complain about how stressed she is and she needs for relief as it calms her down and i understand that but I don’t see why I should suffer because of it? Every time i bing it up it just ends in a yelling match about how she’s stressed and she needs this and it just pisses me off so much because no progress has been made and sometimes it even feels like she guilt trips me.

Ever since my boyfriend turned 18 (he is 19, almost 20 now) his parents have been making his and our life hell. He was abused his whole life and still is, along with the rest of his siblings. His parents abuse each other as well. When he finally got a job this year (he worked there for six months) all his money went to THEIR bills. If he didn't pay their bills or babysit for them, he was restricted access to the vehicle, therefore missing work. He needed the money for his own food (they stopped letting him eat their food when they were around) to save for a car, and to pay for his car insurance. It got to be $600 a month from them. The situation was inescapable because no one else will take him in, and his job was too far to walk and neither of us could afford public transport. I'm not in a troubled situation at all, however I cannot help him because I'm a low wage part time working living with my parents ( they won't let him live with us because it's against their morals, but also because he lost his job) right now he is supposed to be staying at his cousins for a night after leaving my house, because today his parents finally lost it
He had to leave the house to run errands with me, and his mom blew up and called our phones, saying he was supposed to watch her kids so she could sleep (???) then was screaming that she was going to break his belongings and come to my car and hurt him/us. When he came home to get the stuff, it was all out in the yard, his door was broken, and the younger children weren't being watched and had gotten outside unattended. It was horrible. He is under his sister's phone service, because he is trying to get another job that he can walk to, but she is cutting it because she said he doesnt deserve it. I dont know what to do. Both of us are on the autistic spectrum which only makes this harder. All of his money from work they took, if he didn't pay they wouldn't let him leave or would lock him out of the house.

89,"I've always struggled to feel affection or compassion for my mother, because from my teenage years I've seen her as selfish and uncaring of others.

We've ended up living together again this year, and she and her husband (not my father,) who has always been physically and verbally abusive to her, and has made it clear that he wants to be unfaithful to her, have split up and now live separately. She would tell me every time we were alone how she wanted to be away from him, and herself initiated the split by stranding him in the forest.

I very much want to have a good relationship with her while I still have the chance. But I don't know what to do. It seems like I should comfort her as it's a clearly difficult time, but just today she told me, half proudly, that she saw a girl was messaging her husband and she proceeded to send him messages threatening suicide if he got with that girl. Then, deciding he may just get angry at that, she  manipulated him into thinking their relationship could work if he blocked the new girl.

She has been doing these sorts of things ever since their split, and she says now that she'll just string him along until she can get medication or therapy and feel better about herself.

I'm absolutely disgusted by her and her behaviour, and it's incredibly hard to have any sympathy for her despite her constantly talking about her only alternative being to kill herself.

So basically, if you read that pile of shit, thank you, what the hell do you think I should do? Should I be trying to ignore the way she's acting and support her anyways?

94,"Okay so I’ve been together with my boyfriend since September of 2015 and I would say our relationship is healthy. There’s no cheating nothing negative of the sort. I see my boyfriend (R)everyday, like I love him to death. So it’s been 5 years we’ve been together and when it comes to arguments we are pretty good at communicating, I’m not saying we’re perfect, we do fight but not for things about cheating or anything. However, back in the day I was not a saint before I met (R). I was always messing around with guys when I was in high school, it never lead to sex, just fooling around. After graduation of 2014 I met this guy through Instagram, (A). He wasn’t really my type, but I just thought “hey, what the heck??” And we talked for two months and finally met and fooled around for two months until I literally came to the conclusion that I did NOT want to be with this guy, so I told (A) that I wasn’t over my ex (which was true at the time) and he literally did not want to have anything to do with me after that and literally told me to fuck off. Which I was okay with, because I really didn’t love the guy or anything, but he seemed to have wanted to be serious, because he was rushing things so fast. So I just carried on. Me and (A) still follow each other on Instagram, we literally have no bad blood, like I can tell our relationship was really not that serious. Then in 2015 that’s when me and my boyfriend (R), got together. Okay so (R), has no exes whatsoever, the only ex he has was his 7th grade girlfriend that lasted a week until one of his friends dared him to break up with her. After that he never dated anyone other than just talk to a few girls but never got serious or ever fooled around with anybody. I know because when me and him fooled around for the first time he had no idea what to do, and I was so used to just guys knowing what to do. (I know, I sound like a big whore). So basically I just had more experience than he has, (I’m pretty much his first girlfriend) and I always wanted to tell him about my past, but he always shuts me out and tells me “there’s no point to know!” Or “I don’t want to hear that!” Like he really doesn’t want to know. So I never mention about any of my exes. I wouldn’t necessarily consider (A) as my ex because I never loved him, and I literally got over him like nothing. So here’s the dilemma... I’ve been following (A) on Instagram since 2014 because like I said, there was really no negative fall out between us, then 2015 me and my boyfriend (R) got together. Now present year, (R) started following (A) because (A) sells weed and other goodies and (R) is always buying weed. Now (R) started hitting up (A) just to buy some weed and they’re always meeting and (R) told me what a nice guy (A) was and he’s still buying weed from (A). It’s been about 2 weeks since this has been happening and I really wanna tell (R) about mine and (A’s) past, but (R) has made it very clear he doesn’t want to know anything about my past. But then (A) messaged me through Snapchat just saying “hey” and now I’m thinking (A) may or may not tell (R) about our past. But I’m thinking maybe he won’t? Because why would he be out for revenge? And for what? Because (A) literally moved on to like 7 different girls after me so now I’m just feeling guilty because (R) doesn’t know that I used to mess around with (A), and they’re always meeting up to do their paraphernalia junk! I think I feel I am in the wrong because (R) literally has no idea about me and (A) and I guess I am afraid that (A) might tell (R). And I’m afraid if (A) tells (R), then (R) is going to get all mad and be like “why didn’t you tell me??” Because he’s done that before when me and (R) went to a party there was a guy there who I had used to talk to, but I never went up to him or anything. It wasn’t until like 2 weeks or a month after the party I told (R) that there was a guy at that party I used to talk to and he went all up in arms and was like “why didn’t you tell me??” Like I am not sure what to do?

95,"For my entire life I've never been happy with my body. Don't get me wrong, I love parts of it - my eyes, my hair; but when it came to other parts (especially weight), I've always put myself down and seen them as inherently bad or undesirable, even if I know logically that those ideas were unfounded or exaggerated or just plain false. I'm young, fairly healthy and in decent shape, eat well and exercise when I can, but for some reason I always just compare my body to Oblivion and feel like shit for it.

96,"Need some Advice on my situation!!

So to start of I’m only 25 I debated writing this but I feel like i need some advice. About a year ago I noticed changes in my nipples and freaked out because I thought it was cancer. After being tested it just turned out to be eczema which was a sigh of relief, well Kind off. My eczema flare ups are pretty off and on but it’s manageable with my medication( ointment). I’ve been scared to date because I don’t know how to explain to a guy that why my nipple doesn’t look normal. I know I’ll be rejected. This is a little bit of a tmi but I’ll just share it, both of my nipples are affected, they’re both cracked and dry, the eczema was so severe that the skin on the tip of both nipples have completely came off. They’re very itchy and sensitive and if wear a bra for too long they hurt a lot. 

 I’m not sure how to tell a future partner about this, everyday just looking at them I sometimes break down and cry because I feel like I’m not attractive anymore. I’m afraid I’ll feel humiliated and my self esteem is so low that I’ve been depressed for a long time. I know
that obviously this is something I can’t change but any advice on how to cope with this ? Do guys care if our nipples are ugly looking and not attractive ???",03Oct2020,1
98,"I work as a Dental Assistant and got a new job a month before COVID hit. I love my new job and it took me a while to get out of my shell (I'm painfully shy) and start to show my personality to my coworkers. I've always been describe by friends and peers as nice, thoughtful, shy, and smart. But I'm also very blunt and dont sugar coat what I'm trying to ask or get my point across ( I still say please and thank you) . Its been mistaken as being rude in the past and I've always apologized and I've been working on it but I have my bad days where I'm human and snap.

I've come to find through some talkings with my boss that she doesnt like how blunt I am nor does she like that I dont smile all the time. I'm not a smiley person and I have resting b**** face so it doesnt help. I smile when it counts; in front of patients and coworkers but not when I'm just doing normal tasks of putting away instrument or typing notes.

Now to what transpired on Thursday. The day before at closing, my boss wanted to me to go drop off some boxes at a drop box to be delivered to some labs. She mentioned there being two drop boxes with two different company names. I made the joke of ""I got this. I'm not that stupid."" With a smile on my face and laughing because I was joking and jabbing at myself. 
 
I found out the next day that my boss didnt get my joke. She had said my ""last straw"" was when I asked a coworker if she could clean the breakroom and bathroom at the end of the day (we all take turns) because I had saw on the board she was not able to do it in a while because of going to different offices. Coworker said that was fine and we continued  on our way. This is what set of my boss and she pulled me to the conference room.

I was then berated and I could feel my body go numb as she ripped into me out of anger and frustration over everything. She said I needed to change my personality to be more bubbly and smile more because I look so mad at the world. That life is short and I need to be happy. She then said that I was hired for a certain job and I'm not doing that job (we're currently short staffed due to COVID), that I need to change my attitude if I want to continue to work there, thats In lucky to have a job right now, she put me in my ""place"" that I'm new here and I'm not part of the circle at work and I dont know any of my coworkers and that I need to get to know them (I have and one of the coworkers I get along great is coming to a game night in a couple of weeks), then she crossed the line that pissed me off. She proceeded to tell me about her marriage and comparing it to mine and how I need to be compassionate to my husband and to other strangers. That I need to learn to be humble. She then went off how she doesnt like to manage but will when something isn't right. I tuned out near the end of the lecture because I was trying so hard not to burst in tears at work and in front of her. The lecture ended with her hugging me and said something that I dont really remember but it wasnt comforting.  I went on the rest of the day struggling to hold back tears and felt hurt and my character being attacked and put into question. Today was very tense and I avoided her as much as I could. When I had to talk her, I kept the conversation either professional or polite.

Sorry that this is so long. I dont really know what to do. I'm fearful of losing my job now during this pandemic. It's a private practice so there is no HR department to go to. The only person above her is the owner but I dont feel like I can go to him to talk about this because he and the manager are very close. The only thing I can think of is to just shut up and work and not joke or be myself at work and especially in front of my boss. Thank you for reading this. Sorry again that it's so long.",03Oct2020,1

107,"I may sound like a trash of a human being in this post, but I just need to let it out. 

I have a bitter sweet relationship with my parents. Dad is the strict type of parent and mother is the casual best friend type. However, my mom only focuses on business and being a millionaire. Compared to my dad, it’s the same thing. 

I’ve been moving house to house and I had some bad memories. I noticed I blinded myself with negative thoughts that only allowed me to remember the negative memories of my childhood, and I can’t remember many good memories. I have a few, but it was never with a person. I never actually felt belonged in the family. Maybe because of my appearance or just because I never achieved my stepmother beauty standards and my dad’s standards beauty standards that are super high. However, the good thing is that he’s being patient, but other times it turns out the be a bipolar change to his opinion, and starts insulting me. 

Now they have lost hope on me. I left university because I can’t afford it. I tried getting a job but with my location, it seems impossible. Now I’m at home, doing nothing more than research on how can I possibly have a life by working online. So far, it seems way too hard or maybe I’m just being a lazy person who does not know what level of effort to put to things. I really wanted to make my parents proud, but the only thing I noticed is that I’m just bringing them embarrassment. I haven’t even finished my driver license. Like, I’m so behind in life. 

I’m in a beautiful house, with my family, and at the same time with my sister that is on rebellious phase, she has been insulting me because I live in the house. Telling me shit like u are never going to succeed, shut the fuck up, grow up bitch, and she’s only 13yrs. I can be a child, but I’ve sent out like 30 applications a day, and no one response me. 

I’m considering leaving the house. Especially living in a share house because I can’t even afford something that easily. I want to move out, I know a lot of people in my family speak behind my back. And even my psychologist told me that I’m in a toxic environment. Also, that I was suffering from depression. I feel like I need to kick myself out there in the world and find my ways to grow as a person. Sometimes I think that leaving in an Utopia will not allow personal growth. I don’t even think I have a personality. I’ve been crying a lot of nights. And I noticed my voice is sounding kind of depressing. Sometimes I just want to go away from the house, by telling them I just wanna see what the world has to offer, leaving unprepared and begin to be responsable of my own stuff. 

The worst thing I can say, is that I since little been compared to my little sister, and we are 6 years apart. Like beauty, to grades to morals, to behaviour to relationship with my dad. Sometimes I just let her have it because I honestly dislike my father. He has caused me some trauma by hitting me without me having an explanation when I was 7 and 12 yrs. however, with my sister, he never hits her or punishes her when she does something wrong. What did I ever do wrong?

I noticed I’m stuck in a loop of looking for his approval.  I’ve failed so many times that I just gave up. I’m hopeless, I even tell him to his face that I don’t love him( he started it saying it to me like my entire life). I just wanna leave the house. I feel like a stigma. I wanna leave  this toxic utopia, and possibly find a place in this world where I could feel belonged. 

Even I’ve noticed that I treat my friends more as a family than my own family. It’s scares me to noticed this. I just wanna live life, not just being secured and sad for the rest of my life. I want to be for once hopeful. 

So should I leave? If so, what do u think I should consider?",03Oct2020,1

I explained my work experience was in a university town, meaning my supervisors/department heads changed constantly so sometimes I didn't even interact with them let alone be able to ask them to be my reference. Nonetheless I gave them the store numbers and names of general supervisors to ask for with a note that its highly unlikely they still work there or even remember me when one place hires like 50 new people in a year.

112,"ok so first of all I want to say that I'm not someone who dates a lot mainly because I don't trust girls that much, because i was raped at 7 by a 16 year old girl ;Long story short girl was having a lot of hookups so their catholic parents locked her up in her house and my dad was friends with her mom (although i suspect he was having and affair with that girls mom) my parents divorced shortly after this incident)  so anyway i was raped by that girl at 7 and then at 8 i was molested by my brother's friend (i think he's a closet homosexual) so with all this info you are seeing that im not the most stable individual. had a good chilhood despite all this mess. had my only and first gf at 12 in jr high she ended up cheating on me with my brother, but i already knew she was like that cause I kissed her shen she was dating this guy. in high school because of some domestic violence my step dad and mom were having i felt like not going to school puberty was pretty bad for me as well I had bad acne and have some hypertrophic scars all over my back and chest.  I did nothing for a couple years because i was a cripple for a while I stepped onto some kind of cacti and got infected by chromobastomycosis. so I felt like the most unlucky individual and i still feel that way I feel like god has send me some curse just for fun, i felt so unlucky sad and depressed and  used to day dream all days. so at 18 I regain some confidence mostly through reddit and online sites my family's way of pushing me over to do something is usually just saying im useless and that i should do something of my life. so anyway i got my ged at 19 got into college at 19, and stayed there dropped after a year because I was lacking financial stability, worked for 1 year at a call center (DO NOT RECOMMEND) and resigned back in march. anyway I think i got a little carried away with the main issue. so this girl is 24, im 21, she lives with my friend and they have a daugther together. so I always hanged out at his place usually on the weekends , we've been friends for about 8 years. (or more like were I can't consider myself his friend after what I did.) she  started texting me because she had my number I've known her for so long that I don't even recall how i got her's or how she got mine's, but anyway we started texting and it was mostly me asking her how my friend was, I used to avoid asking her related to her besides asking her for coocking advice, we didn't even talk that much so , back in july I started going  my local gym with a friend becaus ei gained a lot of weight with this whole Quarantine, then another good friend of mine whom i've known since 2012 told me that she wanted to have sex with me because of they way she was texting. I naively replied to him ""no way"" but he kept on insisting it was true. one day out of the blue she texted me ""Im so horny"" with one of those thirsty emoticons but i changed the subject quickly , my memory fails me a lil bit now but after that hot emoji my friend pushed me to do it. and he said that i should text her after all my friend  and her aren't together anymore ( i'm not sure though ) so we've begun exchanging hot messages she sent me nude pictures and the next day we had sex , it was awful though in the middle of intercourse all i could think was how this was so wrong and what would happen if anyone we know saw us. so anyway it's been over 6 weeks and I've been going out with her secretly and texting each other everyday pretty much, she tells me she likes me a lot and i do the same I LIKE HER A LOT. i like the attention i like how she toys with my ear. I like her so much, it saddens me how some little affection and attention can make me feel this way. the issue is I think she's quite dishonest with me, she texts other guys right in front of me. i know she texts with her ex (she left my friend for some guy who is older than her late 20's for a year and came back to his place this year)  I don't know if she does it in purpose because i left my friends messenger open in my cellphone because his got lost and told me if  he could open his messenger in my cellphone I went to eat dinner at her house , when my friend wasn't home, and she got a glimpse of  a message my friends gf sent and she got mad at me. said ""i was talking with my hoes"" I don't know what kind of relationship we have but I like her a lot but im mad that she speaks with some other guys and this whole situation is a mess. I am falling for her and I hate myself for it. why would i waste my friendship of 8 years over some girl who takes a lot to answer my texts and im pretty sure that  she is seeing othert guys. this is driving me crazy, she also asked me if my friend had had sex with this chick and i said yeah that's the one then my friend inmediately texted me saying i wasn't ghis friend anylonger. because she inmediately told him . that was yesterday  he asked me for screenshots of our chats and i had to create a fake conversation, he then apologized she said he was calling her names and a whore and stuff like that so she used what i had told her against him,  I guess she was angry at him and still has feelings for him. and she just told him right away. I don't know what to think I don't know what to do all i know is I like her a lot and im pretty sure she is just using me to past the time cause she's bored.

119,"So my father recently passed away from cancer.
He was a drummer, and had a beautiful Pearl drum set that I always loved and had fond memories with, and had even peaked the interest of me learning drums.

Now, my aunty ended up with the drum kit, Dad apparently wanted to give it to her, but I have since found out that he only gave it to her out of pity cause he though she wasn't getting enough from him.

My aunty is unfortunately a pretty nasty woman, has caused a world of trouble in my family and torn our family apart over matters between her and my grandfather.

I have little faith that the drum kit has gone to the right home and I wanted it back.
My Nana collected the drum kit in my aunties behalf nearly a month ago and it is STILL sitting in my Nana's car, which I can only imagine is not good for it in all temperatures.

I asked my nana when we caught up last if I could have the drum kit back. I know I should have said something in the first place when I knew it was going but I thought I'd be okay with it, but it just hasn't sat right with me since that its going to her.
She also has kids that she doesn't teach how to respect belongings.

My Nana said it was an unfair ask, to ask for my Dad's drum kit back. She says ""but you're getting lots of other stuff from your dad""
Everyone else I speak to say I'm justified in asking for it back.
So i wanted some neutral opinions.
What does everyone else think?

Is it unfair and should i let it go?

122,"hi, I live in the US. theres a lot going on right now. where do I start. I suffer from anxiety, depression, depersonalization, ocd, and trauma. my boyfriend is having trouble with his family, but that is another story. (I can also post the link to his post if anyone is interested.) I need gas for my car and repairs, but i am getting low on money. I'm in college plus with the pandemic and recession going on, places aren't hiring. I've tried looking into freelance writing and photo editing, I want to sell some of my artwork on etsy, but I feel so discouraged. theres just so much pressure on this generation in this country and it feels like it's all working against me. no financial support for students. minimum wage is so low. it feels like I'll never make a living doing anything I love. I need to pay for car repairs, and help pay for food for my boyfriend, but it's so hard to make money back right now. on top of that I have constant anxiety and am trying to overcome trauma, and my therapist is no longer seeing me. any suggestions? even just on the money part? sorry if this sounds like a whole lot of whining.",03Oct2020,1
123,"Long story short, my alcoholic father ruined my mother’s life, due to poverty me and my brother had to migrate to an other country at a very young age to work and survive, we managed it well, after 6 years of hassle we are both well financially and well on the way for our careers .
We kept supporting our parent all this time but now we have both said that the only way for us to move forward is to help my mother migrate to an other country so she can work and survive without our financial support, my alcoholic father will not go, and he don’t want to work as well. 
He trying to guilt us into the notion that we are destroying the family.
Happy to hear everyone’s opinion.
Should we use extreme force to get my mother away so she can work and survive herself and let my father starve to death or until he change his attitude and drop drinking .? 
Or should we keep on this sick game, and potentially destroy our life with them ?

So I decided to ask my class if anyone gets the same thing and of course everyone said no.

The thing is, that ever since then the teacher that was there has continued to make kind of mocking comments that bother me.

They say stuff like ""What pattern does atrophy look like, huh?"" and ""Well what does that feeling look like?"" but in a really passive-aggressive tone and it just makes me upset.

126,I've recently stopped using nuvaring and my partner and I have unprotected sex. He didn't pull out in time on the sep. 26th and I can't log in to my period tracker account that has my data from 3+ years because I deleted my Facebook account linked to it. I have no idea where I'm supposed to be in my cycle. It feels like its been too long since my period. I've been tracking my heart rate and it seems to have increased. My normal resting heart rate is 60-74 and now its 90-140. Been feeling more dizzy than normal. I have postural orthostatic tachycardia which makes me dizzy but only when I move too much. My dizziness has suddenly become more common at rest. Yesterday and today I've noticed being short of breath and some vaginal cramping (very mild). I checked my cervix but it seems like its right in the middle and its not super soft but its also not very hard so I deemed that inconclusive. I also haven't had any good bowel movements (slightly constipated) smoke one to 2 cigarettes a day and sometimes none at all. I feel guilty about smoking now that there's a chance I could be pregnant. The other day I had radiating very bad lower back pain and no spotting. I'm feeling a lot more full after only a few bites and staying hydrated. I havent been chugging water these past few days because it seems like I have to pee too much and its annoying. I'm eager to take a test but its too early. Any advice?,03Oct2020,1
127,"I met a guy on IG and we FaceTimed  once. It was a really good genuine conversation but I had been struggling with personal things during that time so I had told him I wouldn’t be able to talk. He understood and told me he would call me once and a while just to check in on me. He called me once a month for 4months and I didn’t answer. 

Two more months go by and life had gotten better for me. I planned on calling him, the same week I had thought about it he texts me asking how I’ve been and if I would want to talk. We start FaceTiming again every day for 6+hours for two weeks. Started watching shows together on Skype and would talk more afterwards. we spent one day talking from 8pm to 8am the next morning and overall I enjoy talking with him a lot. 

We want to see each other but he lives 15+ hr drive from me. I’m an 18yr old turning 19 college student and he’s 20 turning 21 working. He said he would pay for my ticket/flight to come see him but my mom who I live with currently isn’t really liking the idea of me going to see him first which I understand. However if he came to my state he’d have to get a hotel, maybe even a rental or I’d have to drive him around. Also there’s not much to do in my state and some of the things we wanted to do involve technology that he already has access to at his place. 

Obviously those are minor things but I honestly wouldn’t mind going to his state and staying at his townhouse that he rents with his roommates. There would be a lot of benefits for me and I have a family friend of my moms that is living in the same state so worst case I could always go to him. 

I also thought about meeting up in a different state together where I also have family and he has a friend he could stay with so I’m considering that too. I haven’t brought that one up with my mom yet but I plan to soon. Also keep in mind he said he wanted to save some extra money and plan things out more before I come so we wouldn’t meet till like 1 full month into things.

Anyway what do y’all think? Should I go see him since he’s willing to pay and talk to my mom before hand? Meet in another state in the middle together? Have him come to my state j for the weekend to meet for the first time in person &amp; meet my mom so I can go visit him the next time? Ik it’s soon but at the same time with the length of time in terms of hrs that we’ve been talking it feels longer. Pls don’t b mean I promise I’m not tryna jump into things lol.",03Oct2020,1

133,"So about a year back, due to an error with her phone number, the friends of this girl kept messaging me. They messaged in droves and I got really sick of directing them to her actual number.

One day, a guy that was trying to slide into her DMs slid into mine instead. I decided to troll heavily, first by constantly speaking in a different language, and then, when that didn't scare him off, I started being really annoying and confusing. He stuck around. We became friends of a sort. Apparently my antics made him smile.

Anyhow, I don't 'know him' know him, I have no idea where he lives or any real details about his life. We don't talk like that. I tried in the beginning, but he answers questions in a really weird way that makes it hard to hold a conversation. Mostly I try to teach him Korean on and off for the fun of it or just conduct general small talk.

Recently, he's been telling me that he's cutting and self-harming, and that he's going to kill himself, and he seems to be really having a hard time. I know I am not equipped to help him, so I've been trying to encourage him to get some help. I got the contact details for the local suicide hotline and sent him stuff from the Internet that other people (that went through similar things) said would be helpful.

He's been telling me stuff like this with increasing frequency these days, and I sometimes find myself attempting to talk him down for hours. But he isn't seeking help on his own, nor does it seem like he has any support in his physical surroundings. He ignores everything I suggest, and does whatever, and then comes back to me to tell me he's going to kill himself. He seems to think that getting a gf will solve all his problems and nothing I say will convince him otherwise. 

I'm worried about him but I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any suggestions?",03Oct2020,1

I have two job offers...

1. working in the style/beauty department at Target, where I will be mainly working by myself, yet there is a lot more responsibility.
2. working at chipotle where I will just be scooping the food for customers. It's not a busy store because of covid so it won't have a huge lunch rush like usual.

The pay is a little bit better at Target, and both have around the same hours per week.

135,"I'm an Etsy shop owner and I recently had an interaction with an extreme Karen. I sell personalized shirts for babies, toddlers and adults. One of the shirts I sell says ""Girl Dad"". Today I had a woman (the Karen) send me a cease and desist because she claims to own the term ""Girl Dad"" as well as ""Girldad"" and ""#girldad"" AND their ""Boy Dad"" counterparts.

Legally, she did purchase a patent for those terms in 2016 to sell shirts on her site (which clearly no one buys), however ""girl dad"" is an extremely common phrase for fathers of daughters. There are loads of ""girl dad"" shirts, hats, etc. on the internet, and Kobe Bryant was always known as a ""Girl Dad"".

I guarantee that paying her lawyer to send cease and desist letters to EVERY seller of this merch, costs more than this Karen's actual profits. In this world, I feel that women should support other women, rather than tear them down just because they're petty and they can.

I explained to her that I use my small shop to support my family and that there are loads of other shops selling similar shirts, to which she replied that she essentially did not care. Do you think this lady is being a crazy Karen or should I just let it go?",03Oct2020,1

As a younger kid, I always saw sad and shy side characters on my favorite Nickelodeon shows and thought, “I’ll never turn out like them” until I one day did. Parents and family members will always tell you that it’s good to not fit in and that everyone has a different path they follow in their teens, which I think is partially true. But man, it gets painful when you’re staring at your computer screen for hours into the night hoping to get a notification telling you that someone you faintly know is online. 
Sometimes I think that if this is the way the universe wills, then so be it. But from what I’ve heard, the best parts of your teen years are the ones spent with your friends. I might be caught up in some stupid American teenager ideals, but it’s just depressing to think that I may be wasting a good part of my life in a room staring a screen.

There was a reddit account that I reported and it has since then been removed. They tried to get my location, and stuff like that.
I thought it was gone when I deleted it. Now harmless, just looking through my history using alt account. But I was so wrong.
One of their messages was ""you're so funny"" 
They DM'd me this when they realized their game was up. 
Then, after their account was deleted, a bit later I got a reply on my main account saying ""Your funny"". I've never seen or gotten a message that is so straight up. I knew I was being followed. On my alt account, which isn't related to this at all, I got the same reply. They are both completely anonymous. They weren't linked together at all and I traced every post every comment, to double check because I always make sure no one will find me. I found nothing.

148,"\*Sorry for my bad english.

I live in a 3rd world country, and I hate living here, I hate the low living standards, and I also am a queer person so I don't see a future for myself here. I want to live abroad, especially in USA.  My sister lives there, is a successful academic and kinda popular in my country.

I was always somewhat successful in my stem classes and when i graduated from high school i got into one of the best universities in our country. Right now im in my 4th semester but the problem is I fucked my academic journey so far. And I really don't know what i want from life. I hate my major, but it seems like the only way i can escape is academia. I know there are also other ways, that  you can always go out if you are successful in whatever you do but the other fields standards are blurry to me. I know what academia wants. I know how to achieve it. But I also hate academia. It is like a rope with thorns to me. I really look up to my sis and she  says she is disappointed in me and that i have to find my own way now since i neglected all her advice in the past. (she gave me advice but i didn't applied it). I don't know whether i am lazy or i just actually hate my major.  Even if i hate my major, i don't do any other thing. All my days pass by...sitting. Looking at screens. I feel like im missing out and all my family keeps repeating that to me too. That im in my flourishing youth, that i have lots of time and brain power, that i should invest it RIGHT NOW to ANYTHING so i could have a better future. But i don't do anything. Thats why i feel like a failure. Today my sis said that i shouldn't compare myself to her bc she was always ambitious from the beginning (implying that im not).  I guess i just want to impress people around me so i lie to myself about what i really want. Sometimes i try to imagine what i would do if everyone around me was dead, or if i actually did somehow start living in US, like okay, you got your dream now, what would you do? Nothing comes up to my mind. I always thought i would be a big shot growing up but right now i just feel like shit. Everyone around me, my suuper successful university friends, family, everyone is doing something, keeping themselves busy and investing in their future while all im doing is sitting on my ass doing nothing. I am 21 and i feel old as fuck. By the end of this decade i will be 30. I have nothing so far. No academic success, no job experience, no technical knowledge...Nothing.

I don't know if these are actual desires of mine or a dreams, but I like imagining myself as a musician or a movie director or an archeologist or a game maker or a cartoonist (I can draw).  Sometimes as an economist but i don't know what they do they just seem cool to me.

150,"My friend has terminal cancer. It started in his thyroid and moved to his lymph nodes. He also has COPD. He has spent many years dealing with symptoms and biding time. Steriods are the most helpful, that and morphine, but he is rarely given that. Recently he tried a very controversial treatment called Envita, that we didn't really think would work (and we now don't think did) but he has money so why not, he figured. Over the last few years he's slowly gotten worse with MANY bad days but many good ones as well. He's still very mentally sharp and even works (CPA).

Well 2 days ago I came to his house to watch a Dodgers game and the rest of his steroids ran out. Since then it's been BAD. So I decided to stay here and haven't left since. He screamed in pain all night. He hasn't been able to eat in two days. He is sleeping a lot. (he never sleeps much). He refuses to go to the hospital. Says he's sick of it. One family member said ""make him go"" another said ""its his right to die at home."" He recently injured his foot and it was potentially infected but he wouldn't let me take him to his wound care appointment this morning because he was suffering too bad. At two points today he said ""I can't do this anymore"" and my instant thought was that I need to respect that. But my second thought was, what if he's just out of it and I need to kick him into gear. So i begged to take him in, but to no avail. 

Now he's doing a bit better but unable to really move around much. He's coughing as usual (he always has a lung infection) but seems to be in less pain. He's now verbalizing that he doesn't want to give up. But that he doesn't want hospice and will NEVER go to the hospital again. Although he now says assisted living may be the only option.

I know there is no real answer to this situation. But what would you do? I've already decided I'm not leaving his house (I'm closest to him). He still seems very lucid (now at least). I can't make him go right? I've been making him comfortable and telling him jokes, as well as doing tasks for him. I just worry i should be doing more. I'm sorry this was so long with so many aspects to consider, I'm just scared. I'm afraid he could die any moment. I just want to do everything I can.

TLDR: Friend has cancer, appears to be getting worse rapidly. He refuses hospice and hospitalization. Trying to find the right moral answer, even if that may be a matter of opinion.",03Oct2020,1

The concern right now is his stomach. Like most men, he burps A LOT. However I would say within the last two years he’s had bad stomach pain (and I think he had a blood clot in his stomach at one point). It’s gotten to the point now where he is lactose intolerant and can’t eat spicy food. His burps are very deep and bubbly (it’s disgusting but I know he can’t help it). We found out a month ago that he has a stomach ulcer. He had a virtual appointment with his stomach doctor Wednesday and he has an endoscopy at the end of the month. At his last endoscopy, the doctors were worried that he had excess skin in his stomach. He told me that during the appointment, his doctor asked him if his family had a history of stomach or colon cancer and they do. I’m just so worried for him and am at a loss on what to do or think.

159,"So here’s the back story.
I worked in a factory for 5 &amp; 1/2 years. I left for a number of reasons; racist bosses, feeling unappreciated, and them not shutting down during the Corona virus outbreak even though we lost all of our customers and had no work.
Long story short, I quit.
I was making $14.75 and I knew I’d probably have to take a pay cut but it was worth it because I was miserable.
Fast forward a month or so, I ended up getting a job at a semi-local sub sandwich place (they’ve got a lot of stores and franchises but it’s mainly our state/Midwest area).
I started the job at $9.50.
Which is definitely a HUGE cut but I felt like I could make it work if I work a lot of hours and show initiative. It’s not my favorite job but I love the people I work with and it’s definitely a bit more fulfilling than working in the factory.
About a month or so into working there, one of the managers randomly quit one day.
My GM comes to me and asks if I’d be interested in being manager. I agree.
Some time passes and I’m still not manager but I’m slowly being trained as one.
Then one day they bring in a new guy to be manager. I was obviously a little upset and expressed my thoughts to my GM.
My GM said I was still going to be manager but they brought him in because he’s got experience and they needed someone now.
Now... I don’t know what kind of experience this guy has but let me tell you, he’s so damn slow. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, and he gets so frustrated whenever it gets busy.
I then start doing more management training along with him. I’m learning way quicker than he is and am better at my job.
I receive a raise since I’ve been there for 3 months ($10.50) and I say “I appreciate the raise but I’m not going to be a manager at $10.50”
So my GM says I’ll receive another one as soon as my management status is official.
This past week we finalized me as a manger. When I brought up my 2nd raise, I was told I’d be up to $11.50.
Now let me be clear. I understand 100% that it’s not normal for someone to receive 2 one dollar raises within a span of 4/5 months. And I’m quite grateful.
HOWEVER, I was chatting with other manager and he basically lets it slip that they’re paying him $15.
I get a little upset because I’m still struggling to pay rent and bills and I’m working way harder and longer hours than he is. Also doing a better job.
So I don’t ask for another raise but I do express to my GM that I feel like I’m being screwed. I’m not necessarily asking for $15 but I do think I deserve more than $11.50 as a manager.
She basically got mad (because obviously dude isn’t supposed to talk about his pay) and told me that I’m being ridiculous and need to learn to just accept it.
Am I over reacting? Should I just be happy with what I have and move on? Should I find a new job?

TL;DR: Got 2 raises within a short time but still feel as though I’m being screwed out of what I should really get paid. Found out another inexperienced manager is making way more than me but we have the same status.
Was told I’m over reacting and need to accept it.",03Oct2020,1
160,"She cuts herself and when her mom caught her she didn't say the best thing to help, she just made it worse. I heard the small compliments can help throughout the day or with time spent but It's kind of hard to do when what we do is make jokes and play games. It also deosn't help she lives in Canada and I live in the US.

161,"Ok, long story (sort of) short, a really bad thing happened to me (m17) with a guy a while ago and I was pressured into some things that I wasn't necessarily ready for. I hate calling it ""the r word"" because that's such a huge word but I can recognize that it was not right and not something I was ready for with him and I just let him talk me into it. This event, obviously, really messed with my head and put me in a really bad state mentally. I wasn't feeling whole, I feel more like a sack of meat than a human being. I just feel kind of like I'm existing, not doing much. About 6 months after that happened, my mom got sick. Nothing huge, just had to get her gallbladder out (which happened about a week ago), but the stress from that added onto the stress from the Previous Event, which makes me feel guilty because its not necessarily my stress to have I guess? But look I'm not here to vent, the point is, I'm doing really really bad mentally and I need help. My mom is not against therapy in the slightest, I'm encouraged to go to therapy! And I want to, its just that I don't know if I'll be able to tell a therapist what happened to me because, since I'm a minor, wouldn't they have to tell my mom? I really don't want my mom finding out what happened. I don't want to stress her out even more right now. I'm planning to tell her when she's better, but I don't know how long I can wait without getting professional help. I guess the advice I'm looking for is: 

How can I talk to someone about what happened without it getting back to my mom? Is that even legally possible?",03Oct2020,1

Hi! I'm 14 and a freelance video editor from India. I make very good money compared to the majority of India's population which finally convinced my parents that I can do something worthwhile on a computer. Now, my parents are proud of me af and I feel like quitting.

Here's why. I'm putting in more than 9 hours everyday and I very well know that it's un-healthy. I'm a very smart and intelligent student in school but this doesn't give me enough time to study. But I can definitely get straight A's even while working if I put in the effort. But here's another problem. We had to go to our hometown since our grandfather was in critical condition and at the edge to dying. Well, he passed away. It was heartbreaking for me. Then I found out that we'll have to stay there for who knows how long to finish giving him a proper send-off (indian culture). We stayed there for a whole 3 months and my studies fell down hard, as well as my mental health because I stayed alone with my other grandparents for most of the time and still had to do the immense amount of homework that schools expect you to do along with my freelance career.

I was completely burnt out every single day and still had more to do the next day. Now after I got back, I have around 20-30 worksheets to do which I saved to do when I got back home (the studying conditions in my hometown were not ideal)

Now I have a frik ton of homework, freelance work and studying to do. I feel like I'll quit anyway someday but I don't know when. Should I now?

I know this sound very silly and I have a final decision ready but I thought of getting a second opinion here.",03Oct2020,1
163,"So, I befriended a fellow small Twitch streamer recently. We hit it off and they opened up about a lot of sensitive things. Somethings they told me made me uncomfortable, so I said that and we set boundaries. Then I vented to them, and they got overwhelmed so I distanced myself to give them time and only shot them a message occasionally. During this friendship, I donated $75 to help them get a new mic (stupid on my part, I know), but I want my money back because they've started treating me kinda like crap and I don't wanna be friends with them and I don't give money like that to people who aren't my friends. After opening up and saying they cared about me, they proceeded to say that I needed to be treated the same as their viewers because they don't want anyone to get special treatment. They also said that I exposed personal info about them in their discord. I didn't, the exactly message I said on the topic was ""Oh, I was apologizing because I felt guilty for venting to you that first time we talked."" And they started going on about how they never gave me permission to give out that information and that other people would wonder why they aren't getting the same treatment. They also said they wanted to treat our relationship like ""work"" and they want the positive friendship aspects (like hanging out and playing games) without the support aspect. 


All in all, I'm saying that I want to ask for my money back, but I have no idea how to. I also don't want to be the asshole of this situation, but I definitely no longer support this person. I asked non-biased parties about it and explained all the messages that were sent and they agreed that this other streamer was being condescending and incredibly harsh. What should I do, guys?",03Oct2020,1
164,"My older sister suffers from mental health issues such as borderline personality disorder, depression and bi polar disorder. She has a dependence with weed she uses to cope with her issues and refuses to take her prescribed medication in fear of gaining weight. As a result of her not taking her medication, she constantly harasses my mom and I. She likes to project her own issues with our father on to me by acting as if she was him. We had to move away from my dad because there were constant fights between him and my sister and my mom. My dad is middle eastern, so he was very strict about most things. And now that he’s gone, my sister is acting as a replacement dad to gain some aspect of control. She has a complex of needing to micro manage my life and does things such as snooping through my phone to see what my plans for the day are, and then she asks me about it later to see if I am lying to her.

If I do anything that she doesn’t agree with, she will yell and scream at my mom that she needs to be a better mother and take care control of the situation. My mom does not like to argue or be yelled at so instead of arguing back she will take my sisters orders and make me do whatever my sister says to avoid conflict. However, behind closed doors my mom actively tells me that she has no problem with what I do because she trusts that I will not do anything to jeopardize my health or well being or anything that will get me in trouble. The reason my sister had so many limits placed on her growing up was because she would go behind our parents backs, compulsively lie to them, and end up in situations that could have hurt her. This is anything from drinking and driving, smoking weed and driving, and doing coke with random dudes in Miami that she didn’t know. 

She calls me irresponsible because although I am going to college 5 days a week, and I saved up money with a full-time job all summer and barely spent any of it, that I choose to see my boyfriend instead of working a full time job all year. I have enough money saved that it is not an issue for me and I instead choose not to stress myself out more than I already am. When I see my boyfriend after he comes home from work or school we usually watch one or two shows and then I will begin doing my school work for a few hours and watch another maybe two or three shows before I leave. I will watch shows for maybe two hours and do school work for maybe four. My sister refuses to believe that I do any school work at my boyfriends house, but it is easier for me to do work there because I am not getting yelled and screamed at and told I don’t work hard enough. When I get home around 11pm I will sometimes stay up another few hours if possible to cram in extra school work, and she says if you didn’t spend all your time watching TV maybe you wouldn’t have to stay up so late. I do it because I want to but not because I have to and she also will not believe this. Because of my close proximity to my boyfriend and our schedules I will see him up to four times a week, but he always brings me home at the end of the night so I can take care of things like the dogs and chores around the house. There is no issue with us having boyfriends as my father is no longer living with us, but she resents the fact that our father would always judge her and be mad at her for seeing men. And now that we just live with our mom it is okay. She has cheated on every man she has ever been with (her words) and she wants someone to provide for her without giving much back. She has an ex fiancé that she sees not because she likes him but because he thinks he can win her back and he buys her weed. She has told me she doesn’t like him at all but she likes the attention and the weed. She had lots of fights with the guys that she dates. She says men are too clingy and doesn’t want to hang around them too much and thinks just because she feels that way that I should just see my boyfriend two times a week max and no more. She says her ideal man is someone that gives her and buys her things and doesn’t see her too much.

In my house we made an agreement that we would be responsible for our own things. For example, we agreed that if you use a dish you would wash your dish after, but I’m the only person that has stuck to this agreement and does the dishes after use. But I will still be in trouble if dishes pile up as a result of my mom and sister using them. Not only that, when I worked along side them during the summer I had to take care of the dogs and wash everyone’s dishes just to please my family. But when I would ask for some help around the house they would refuse and brag about how hard they work and that they are tired, even tho I would finish the same shift with the same job.

On multiple occasions my arguments with my sister would become more physical. During one of these physical arguments, the fight ended and she left me alone. However, she felt as though she didn’t inflict as much damage to me as I did to her, so she purposely came and scratched my face with the intent of leaving a scar so I would remember. She always has to win or have the last word, even with something like calling she will call just to argue with me and if I try to argue back she will hang up the phone and not answer any calls back. She has stolen my mother’s phone as well so that she can not inform me of the situation at home if she is arguing with her there. She has taken my mothers car without her permission and would use it as her own with no care about my mothers schedule or what she would need her own car for. 

My mother will not fight her and refuses to let me call the police no matter how physical or angry she gets. She has broken my mothers bedroom door because she didn’t want to talk to her and now she can no longer lock the door. My mother says she will be very upset with me if I call the police because she thinks my sister will never forgive us and will just become more violent towards us. My sister said if she gets word the police are coming she will slit her throat and kill herself with the knife her ex fiancé gave her (and then she said thank you “ex fiancé s name” for giving her the knife and smiled) she says we can’t do anything and will be defenceless and powerless if she’s dead since there is nothing we can do. 

My mom and my sister are both on the lease for the house and my sister refuses to leave, which means my mom and I would have to move. But my mom refuses to leave because she had to move away from my dad and find it’s unfair that she’s gonna have to pack again just to leave my sister. Majority of what we own is my moms, the only thing my sister and I can claim is what we have in our bedroom. My mom refuses to move out because she doesn’t want to move all the heavy furniture again, and my sister has a little amount of personal items. I personally cannot handle my current living situation and I am unsure of what I should do. Some options I had in mind were to sublet for a term or two. My boyfriend has offered me a place to stay but if my dad finds out I am living with him there is a chance he will never allow me back into the home, and since my sister is also my father if I come back my sister will just throw all my things out the door and tell me to stay out. I don’t know how I will afford to live on my own if I choose not to stay with my boyfriend but I will try anything to make it work. I can not move too far since I am in school and don’t have my license, but housing prices are very high in my area and I feel like my best option is staying in a place with 3 to 4 other students. But this obviously will not be a permanent residency and I’m not sure how even if I pull this off how I would proceed from there. I also have a dog and a turtle that I care very much for and I’m not sure any of the student housing will allow them. I care for my pets and my mother and I want to take care of them but my sister is making this an impossible endeavour for me.

166,"This has been in me ever since I was a little kid, I physically can’t help myself from spending hours on instagram, YouTube or reddit when I need to be studying or being productive. Even when I block YouTube on my laptop I still turn off my extension and then just watch again, and when I delete my apps on my phone I just reinstall and then use them again. I hate this, it’s destroyed my life. I’m 20 now but all throughout high school I barely ever studied, causing me to do pretty poorly. And I am certain that if I really applied myself in high school I could have done very well and set up my future. Instead I ended up going to a college I didn’t like because it was the only one that would accept me. Then I failed every class in my first semester because I never studied once and just wasted everyday eating campus food and killing time on social media. Then I went to community college to compensate for my failings, and I ended up graduating (thank god) and now I’m at the college I always wanted to go to, but I’m stuck at home because of the virus. And when I’m at home, I can barely study. If someone pointed a gun to me and my families head and said if I studied they’d take the guns away, I’d probably still end up wasting my time doing nothing. It’s literally my heroin, my cocaine, I am truly and genuinely so addicted I can’t stop. I always wanted to do well on my SAT in high school and I never did, because I spent every moment I had to study on my phone or surfing the web.

168,"I have had this friend for about 5 years now. We are very close. I’ve noticed that when they get into a new relationship, find a new friend, or get a new job I am ignored. I don’t hear from them for months. Until they break up with their s/o. Or have a fall out with their friend. Or lose their job. 

I didn’t mind at first because I understand I’m not their only friend or person in their life. Friends don’t need to contact each other 24/7. Relationships need privacy and alone time. But I’m ONLY contacted when they have no one else. Breakup? im contacted. Lost touch w other friends? I’m contacted. We then hang out almost everyday. We’re driving around the city.

My internet friend has a history of depression and suicide. She was super motivated to get better after she quit her job but suddenly she changed a couple hours ago. She started saying that she's not going to see her therapist and that she's a failure. She took multiple sleeping pills, drank alcohol, and slit her wrists. Then she went to sleep and woke up a few hours later, which is when she punched her wall and broke her hand, and then she decided to start smoking again because she thought that a heart attack would be a less painful way to go out. Then she said that she was going to ""go out"", which I don't know if she means just going outside or killing herself. 

I didn't see the messages until a few hours later because I was also kind of mentally fucked and just had to take a nap. I texted her 2 hours ago, it's currently 6:30am for her so she could be sleeping but of course I'm worried. I don't know if I should call the authorities in her country, especially since her country's official language is not English. Even if I did manage to communicate with them and they were able to find her alive, they would definitely put her in a hospital and then she would hate me. It's fine if she hates me as long as I know that she's okay, but I don't want her depression to worsen because of me speaking up, since from what I've heard, the mental hospitals she has been in are absolute hell and I know that she doesn't like cops.

So in the beginning me and this girl met in 7th grade math class (currently jrs in highschool) we dated off and on for about 2 years, i unfortunately broke up with her all 3 times  however i dont understand why still exactly. I was a S I M P for this girl after i lost her for the last time but just the other day i get a anon phone call asking “do you miss anyone like and ex from middle school...... (5second pause) highschool?” i had no idea who this woman calling me was then i happen to start thinking about my ex again right after i had just fully recovered from really losing her. Then i check my instagram and i unblock my only ex and its to my surprise that i was already unblocked! at this point my mood starts to increase dramatically. we start dming each other for a day and she brought up she has a bf :( (she doesnt have anything posted about him on her ig) so the next day were still talking and she asked for my number and ofc i gave it to her! she realizes that i finally had gotten an iphone and the same night she asked me to ft. So nervous as f*** i say yes and when we get on the the phone my heart start melting asap no rocky and were smiling and yk just having fun reminiscing about the past and all that good stuff and when we hangup she said “goodnight love you” and my head is racing as im in shock from what i just had heard. we then proceeded to do the same thing the next day text and then ft at night and this time we hang up and i said “okay well goodnight” hoping she said love you again snd she didnt so after i hang up about 3 mins pass by about my wondering if i should call back and ask for clarification about what she said the night before so i did just that. she then replied  “okay but what do you want clarification on” and i said “ahh yk what nvm i must just be faded haha” (crying on the inside a little bit) she then proceeded to say “goodnight love you” and i didnt really wanna say it i was kinda upset still so i played the “oh its not the same without the i” and she said “ i love you” so i said it back. now everything seemed to be fantastic but yesterday she left for a camping trip with her bf and mother. she wont reply to me because of her boyfriend and im her ex yk all that stuff. so ive been sitting here all day bestfriend is out of state for something and im pretty much all alone in this. I REALLY think i love this girl she makes me feel like no other but then comes the question what if i do get her and someone is able to just slide in and she keeps them a secret i can’t describe how she makes me feel weve planed on hanging out on multiple occasions when she gets back doing different things but damn mane i just really am lost :/ i want her so bad but i cant be in anymore pain i was thinking i could possibly just become super close with her and try my best to not show emotions and just look for someone else in hopes that she tells me how she feels. what do you guys n gals think i should do:/?",03Oct2020,1

191,"This is my very first post, I dont know much about this but I don't have any one to talk to and need advice. 

Here a little backstory. When I (f22) was a kid, my dad(45) was told I would have learning or behavioral disorders and that I should get tested. Back then having problems like this was shameful and he didn't want it on my record cause it could affect my life. Now I'm currently 22 and I have a son who is 1. I started noticing he's following behind with some of my behaviors. For example, completly zooming out and having drops in moods. I brought this concern up to my mom(43) and she told me what my dad did. I was supposed to be treated for adhd, dyslexia and something else ,she can't remember. I currently have depression and anxiety , I've been to 4 different therapists, all crappy experiences and this bring me to my problem. I lived this long with out being diagnosed officially and I have bad experiences with seeking help, should I just ignore it or should I seek out help and get tested. Will there be a difference after my diagnosis or will it just be another label ?",03Oct2020,1

I applied as a bar staff and I’ve been working there for about 2 weeks now, and have had 6 shifts, but every shift they’ve put me on everything EXCEPT bar. I keep telling all the managers how much I love bar and how I really want to be put on it, and they tell me they’ll put me on it, and then roster me elsewhere. 
Last night, there was a brand new girl at work who got put on bar straight away, when I’ve never been on the bar, and it made me very frustrated. 
I also heard that a girl who doesn’t even like bar has been put in charge of a new bar that is opening up and it really frustrates me. 
I really want to let them know that I’m stern about being on bar or else I’m considering leaving but I’m also terrible with confrontation and am super shy with bringing things up. 
I’m considering calling sick to work tonight because I just have this awful feeling about going there and I feel awful when I’m at work.

Eventually she told me we should stop talking. She said it wasn't gonna work with all the distance between us. She was right and I should've listened but I convinced her to keep talking to me, and I started planning a trip.

Flash forward to today. We both caught serious feelings for eachother, but COVID has come back strong. I started thinking about it and realized we wouldn't be able to see eachother for a long long time. And then I thought about what would happen when we did. The trip wouldn't be free. What happens after we meet and I go home.

I decided it's time to talk to her about it, and I told her we should really stop. I felt terrible. She started crying. She pointed out how that is exactly what she said a while back when I talked her out of it. 

She hates me now. I feel awful but there really wasn't anything we could do. What was the endgame. We would never be able to see eachother more than once a month, and even then I'd go broke going to see her every chance I got. I know it was the right thing to do but I feel like crap for not listening to her earlier.

I also feel like crap because she doesn't want to talk to me anymore at all. Talking to her was a big part of my day. Probably my favorite part of my day.

200,"Since I was a little kid I've always hated my mother's boyfriend and loved my mother.

He's an awful person; he abuses my mom (her words, not mine), and he's an all around douchebag. He was misogynistic and wouldn't let her get a job because he felt like he needed to be the only one supporting the family.

He showed me porn when I was 6 years old, and when i was in middle school he put a magnum sticker on my laptop which got me into trouble with teachers; I had no idea what magnum condoms were.

Once I was 16 I started to realize the red flags of abuse in my mother's and my own behavior. I used to have frequent nightmares about being raped (even though I was a virgin at the time).

I got fed up with it and told my father. He didn't like the idea of his kids being hurt by a psychotic asshole. I had to live with my mother and her boyfriend while also testifying against them in court (a gross injustice and literal fucking nightmare). My mom didn't make it any easier for me; she just agreed with everything her boyfriend said and backtracked on her own words.

I remember sitting on the edge of a bridge, looking down upon traffic as if it was a fever dream. My friend pulled me down and called the cops... my mom's boyfriend said he wouldn't care if I'd fallen and died and he wouldn't have been sad at all; my mom just sat and nodded.

The slowness of the family court led to my father just agreeing to pay my mother (a sum that would basically measure to my child support until I turned 18 and all of the court fees for the both of them) to get me back because he felt that every day I spent there was a toll on my mental health. She literally sold me.

Now that I'm looking more into my mother's past... I found out she was a stripper. She dated a criminal before her current boyfriend and tried to take me out of the country with him.

When I left her to live with my father I left behind a little brother and sister. They won't let me talk to them; I haven't talked to either of them for years I'm not sure how they even remember me.

I feel guilty for leaving my brother and sister there, and I feel guilty when I forgive myself for doing so. Any advice on how to move on?",03Oct2020,1

202,"I’m a 19m and before COVID I was a regular college student going into my junior year. My family has been stuck in our home country since February and they’re still stuck there now, so I dropped out (they don’t know that yet) and work to pay their bills. For a while now, since my job cut everyone’s hours, I’ve only been bringing in between $100 - $150 a week. I used to make over $400 a week, which was enough to take care of what needed to be taken care of while still allowing me to attempt to enjoy life a bit. I’ve been selling weed pretty heavy for a couple of months now to compensate for how little my checks are. I also smoked it a lot to not focus on my problems and my feelings. I move a QP every week and a half and everything was going smooth til I got comfortable and ended up getting almost shot over an ounce of weed, which set me back a lot of money I could have made. I figure I’d rather let God decide what happens with my life than the police, so I don’t ride around with my gun when I “serve” (the gun isn’t registered to me, of course), which is how I ended up in that situation. My fiancé finished her boot camp, but because they put her unit on a two week quarantine before her next station we couldn’t get married when we were supposed to. Two of my best friends are locked up fighting for their lives, one is still in waiting for his court date and the other looks like he’s taking a plea, even though it’s evident that they didn’t do anything. I have no records, no arrests, I’m practically the golden child of my group. I saved up enough money to last me 2-3 weeks, but if I pay any of the bills it’s over for me. I make music, but right now I’ve only earned about 3 dollars in total and I can’t even see that money until 2-3 months from now due to streaming services delay. I’m honestly considering selling CDS or something, I quit my job (I gave a two week notice) because originally I was supposed to be with my fiancé by now and even then I wasn’t getting paid much anyways. I have no idea when my family will get to come back either, what should I do? I want to get a temporary job for at least 2 weeks to 6 weeks (at maximum), but it’ll be pretty unlikely I would get any takers on that. It’s not my pride, but I can’t just beg or ask for money on the internet and I don’t want to start selling again because it’s honestly not worth dying or losing my freedom over weed. I say losing my freedom because I would have to keep a gun on me now since I could have lost my life, but that’s a gun charge, a possession charge, &amp; a distribution charge if I do. Even then, I don’t even have enough money to purchase a throwaway weapon, purchase more weed, and still be able to function without quickly &amp; constantly moving it. I have a future, I know I have a future and even though the path isn’t clear right now, I don’t want to lose the opportunity at the future that I’ve been blessed with over this bs. The sick thing about it is even though it might not sound believable that ounce was going to be my last thing I sold and then I was going to get out of this lifestyle and focus on getting my life back together &amp; building a family with my fiancé. I honestly don’t even want to be on this earth anymore and don’t want to bother my girlfriend/fiancé with the task of building back up a fuckup like me. It got to the point where I was ready to just blow my head off and I wrote her a suicide letter on the Sandbox app, but I’m so happy it ended up not sending. I quit smoking now &amp; it’s been about 3 or 4 days since I have smoked, but I had got so stupidly high that day I couldn’t help but to sleep instead of pulling the trigger.

We communicate exclusively online since we are in different parts of North America but we all call every night and hang out almost every single moment of the day. For the sake of the post, I’m gonna call each person Katharine and David. 


David and I dated for three months in early 2020. We were planning on meeting up but quarantine messed that up. Seeing as I was going into university, we were both afraid of what changes would happen and so we split. 


Fast forward to July and Katharine and I admitted having feelings for each other. We didn’t make anything official for fear of making David uncomfortable, as he already had feelings for Katharine. We began dating after I went to university, but we split two weeks later as my feelings for her faded

David and Katharine have since started flirting and have made plans to date, after Katharine has felt she’s properly figured herself out. Katharine and I are still best friends despite the breakup and we are incredibly close. 

David has had feelings for Katharine for a long time. Part of the reason I couldn’t date Katharine was because I was getting feelings for David again. I regret breaking up with him, he was my best relationship and it has recently occurred that I broke up with him because my anxiety told me things couldn’t work. Katharine has said that if there were no string attached, she would date David, but that she also wouldn’t be too upset if she had to breakup with him or lost that relationship. I feel a lot more passionately honestly, I want him really badly to the point where I fantasize about him very frequently. She and I have discussed our interests and she said that she’s afraid of making this decision and having to deal with the consequences. I don’t want to intervene in what could be a very happy relationship but I feel like I would be a lot happier if I were with David and since he and I only broke up over fears, I feel like we still stand a chance especially since we were a really good match.

207,"I am an individual who suffers from several mental health disorders, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

I landed my dream job in January and worked my tail off. I went above and beyond, even taking over many duties of my superior while still in training, including dealing with prestigious clients and even making several thousands of dollars worth of sales (for which my superior, not I, received the commission).

I have screenshots of messages from my superiors, managers and even the president, praising me for my hard work and telling me how lucky they were to have me. There was even a moment in a company meeting where I was publicly celebrated in front of my coworkers for my accomplishments and even given a small reward.

A week after this meeting, I was fired.

During my time at the company, I had used a couple of my sick days for mental health reasons (but explained them off as physical sickness since I wasn’t comfortable disclosing my mental health struggles). However, after experiencing a terrifying anxiety attack in front of my coworkers (but responsibly hidden from the clients I was working with), I asked for a private meeting with a manager to ask to use my vacation days to seek treatment. I was assured that not only did other employees struggle with mental health and that I shouldn’t be ashamed, but that my request would be granted and the circumstances would remain confidential.

I returned to work after an absence of 5 approved days, making a total of 10 days with my previous sick days. 

A week after returning, I was called into an early morning meeting and was informed that I was being terminated due to the amount of time I had taken off. I was required to sign a paper indicating that I realized why I was being fired, and I left. No severance.

Months later, I am still unemployed and running out of benefits and savings. I am terrified of getting another job for fear this may happen again. That it doesn’t matter how hard I work, I will always be targeted if and when I need to attend to my mental health.

She asked for my phone and took it then texted our boss as me saying that I will work for her.  I texted the boss back and called her saying that I didn’t send that text.  My boss told me that I would only have to work for her in the morning for a few hours.  I called the girl and turns out that she wanted me to work for her in the evening too.

I started a job in operations through a temp service, doing so well as to be hired on full time after a month. A month after that I was asked by maintenance to apply to them. Best thing that has happened to me ever career wise. I have helped implement new things here and there, always with a positive outcome. I go above and beyond for the team working third shift when they needed help there, Saturdays, going out of state to train on new equipment (the only one asked), help on operations, all without complaints. My manager was looking into getting me a raise before Covid hit and merit based raises were frozen.

Now I'm being forced to go back to operations or lose my job. Yes I get to keep my pay rate but it still feels like a demotion. The""contract"" (single sheet of paper) says temporary reassignment for 6 months upon which it will be reassessed. And I will still perform Maintenance duties when needed. No mention of what is being reassessed. I'm really bummed since I felt I finally made it to somewhere my ADD actually helps since I love to tinker. Just because I was a good op I get to be depressed for up to 6 months at which time I feel like I'll be told I'm stuck.

216,"I need some advice, I have toxic ""best friend"" who I have a special relationship with. We are recognised as best friends by anyone who sees us but when you get to know us, it is obvious we hate each other. I tried to be nice to her when we first met but I just couldn't stand how fake she is, shes the typical 绿茶婊 but much more scheming (though she is not smart enough to do any actual damage), we both don't wish well on each other and I am ashamed to say I thought of doing things that could've destroyed her social status(but I couldn't bring myself to actually go through with the plans). She did many minor bad things to me that I just ignored but I can't stand it anymore. Once, she saw the pair of fountain pens I bought from Daiso, they weren't very expensive and she liked then alot so I gave the one I don't really like to her, she seemed very thankful so I was pretty happy. After a few days I couldn't find my fountain pen and was pretty upset about it but reminded myself it wasn't that expensive and that I could buy it again when I go back to Daiso. I basically forgot about the pen until I saw her using the pen during mandarin, I asked her about it and she got defensive, she said her dad bought it from Taiwan and she can ask for the receipt to prove it. I asked her which store did he buy it from and how expensive is it, she said it was from a 专卖店 in Taiwan that only sells fountain pens and the pen is about 300 MOP (~50 dollars), the pen was actually 30 MOP... I then asked her what happend to the pen I gave her, she took it out and yeah, it looked the same, I told her that and she asked a classmate to compare. The classmate agreed with her that the pen looks different which of course it is since I would be an idiot to buy two exactly the same pens. At that time I lost alot of face already so I just let it go, but later on I thought about it and researched the name I saw on the pen, and the results came that it was 100% Daiso quality, made and designed by Daiso, only available in Daiso. I decided to forget about that incident but she did many minor bad things to me again and her bad parts are now noticable by our friend group making her not being liked by our friends anymore.

I know the consequences sound minor but our friend group is one of the popular groups that have alot of influence around the grade, and the students in our grade are all children of really rich and important people that have great impact on the place I live in. I want to protect my best friend since we've been together for a long time though it was really toxic, but I protected her once before from my friend group two years ago that resulted in me being hated by my friend group for one and a half year and my best friend slowly crawling closer to them by betraying me.

218,"I think this fence was put up before my neighbors bought the house, which was in the last year, and I only just recently noticed. The fence is short, but made of pretty solid wood, and encases the fire hydrant on three sides. If a firefighter is going to be using that hydrant, I'm pretty sure they're going to have to chop the fence down, which could be disastrous in the case of a fast moving fire.

Calling code enforcement seems like an asshole move. Leaving an anonymous letter seems like an asshole move. I've never actually gotten to talk to these neighbors, they are very standoffish.

220,"Context : I am quite the sociopath (yes, clinically), I feel very little empathy for others and have almost 0 connection to emotions, I'm incredibly manipulative, enjoy (and am very proficient at) lying and somewhat narcissistic.  


Knowing this, should I enter the field, as I don't believe entering such a field would traumatize me as much as it would most people.  
There are a lot of very f\*d up situations that are dealt with by social services like CPS and lots of people just can't stomach it.  
I hadn't much interest in it and can probably find work in multiple other fields, but while I am sociopathic I am not a sadist (most of the time\*) and making other people happy often benefits me greatly.  
I'm also not looking for money, as I am quite stingy and find it hard to purchase anything that doesn't benefit me directly, regardless of whether it makes me happy, I find it hard to spend.

222,"My bio mother texted me yesterday out of the blue, wanting to catch up. I have always had deep seeded resentment towards her, and I flat out told her that in our conversation. Well, we talk a little more, then I bring something up that she did (she called the cops on herself at my grandparents house. Then, when the cops came, she ordered a wellness check and screamed at the officer when he said no). And she said she doesn't remember that. I know thats a flat out lie and that she is just trying to manipulate me (that's one of her tactics, act like she doesn't remember). After that, I told her to cut the crap or I'll block her on all platforms. She texted me again today, and I texted back. We talked about my childhood with her, and I asked if she actually neglected me. She fully denied it and went as far to say that she would never lie to me and blah blah blah. I know that is false because both my grandparents and my older brother have told me otherwise with evidence. She offered no evidence when I asked how could I trust that she's not lying. Fast forward and I ask a very direct question regarding something else she did, but acted like I didn't remember all of it. She didn't tell me the whole story, put blame on someone else, and conveniently forgot the part where she was involved. I ask if there is anything else she wants to address or talk about, trying to give her another chance to tell the whole story, but she didn't. Should I block her? I would feel bad for blocking her though because I did text her back when she first texted me and I feel like that would just be mean to just leave her hanging and trying her evening.",03Oct2020,1

That was the recent event, but it feels like that’s happened continuously for a long time now. And I’m alway there when they need help or if they are bored, and I feel like they don’t do the same to me.

224,"Hey everyone! Several months ago, I (M/24/USA) found a pen pal (23/F/Singapore) on r/penpals. We hit it off really well and have been messaging each other back and forth nearly every single day since April. A few days ago, she suggested that we do a video-chat, which I happily agreed to. This video-chat is scheduled to happen later today for me (technically tomorrow morning for her, due to the large timezone difference between Singapore and the U.S.) and I'm getting kinda anxious about it as we get closer to T-minus zero.   


We have made pre-recorded QnA videos for each other in the past, so we know what each other looks like and sounds like. However, we have never spoken to each other in real-time. I have never video-chatted with someone I haven't met in person before, so I'm getting somewhat anxious since I don't know what to expect. Also, we have been getting rather flirty with each other over the past few weeks after we discovered that we both find each other physically attractive and are both single. The fact that we both find each other attractive makes me concerned that this video-chat may become rather awkward. Does anyone have any tips or advice to make sure this video-chat goes as smoothly as possible? Hell, I honestly don't even know what to talk about with her... Thanks! :)

225,"So I’ve been through a lot this year, and I’m not just talking about corona but actual personal life stuff that has pushed me to heal and grow. I left a bad relationship and I’ve had to go through the healing process and then growing from that and the whole time I’ve been focused on finding somebody that I can have a healthy and happy relationship with. I manifested this person day and night and was so set on finding him. I achieved things in my life like getting my first job and my drivers license and I also met friends who I connected with really well. I was feeling great even though I was still dealing with being single and also getting over my past relationship. As of about a month and a half ago I fully achieved getting over the relationship and I had no sadness over it. I just became happy that I learnt from it and I’m past it now and I’m so glad that’s finally happened because it was bringing my happiness down immensely. It’s been almost 11 months of being single now and I still haven’t found that person I’ve been longing for ever since I left the relationship. I’m so mad because I’ve achieved all these things for it, I’ve gone through healing myself and I’ve manifested it pretty much every day yet it’s still not here. I haven’t even felt a connection with any guy I meet and it’s making me forget what that connection even feels like. Not only that but things with my family life have braught me down because my sister lives in Canada and never takes the effort to message or talk to me, my brothers have their own lives and I’ve never been too close with them anyways and the only one I was close to had recently gotten a full time job which I never see him anymore. Things with my dad are great and he’s one of the only people I fully feel happy around right now. My mum is lovely too but she’s been busy with her life doing up her house so I never really see her either when in the past I’ve spent so much time with her. I used to find a lot of happiness when with my friends too but that aswell has gone down hill. My best friend is in grade 12 and very focused on her assignments and her boyfriend too so I hardly get to see her, plus her mum controls a lot of what she does and when I do invite her over her mum says she can’t come because she needs to study. Not only have I hardly seen my friends but when I do I have to drive them around everywhere seen as I’m the only one with a license and they hardly ever offer to pay for fuel so I just feel kinda used by them. Some issues with work have put me in a down place as well and I’m just feeling like I want to totally give up. I’m turning 18 in a few days and I just don’t want to feel like horrible. It’s supposed to be an amazing time filled with love and joy and memories but I couldn’t be further from that right now.

So I was thinking of booking a one way and staying for a few nights, and keep the cash in hand to get another one way back if things are sketchy or don’t work out as planned. If all goes well I was planning on staying for a few months just to escape the horrible upper Michigan winter lol. 

Before I book the ticket I’m planning on having a talk with both of them and setting boundaries, figuring out expectations etc. I’m not really sure what to ask or talk about other than that but I want to make sure I have all my bases covered. My friend even said he would pitch in for my ticket. 

I am pretty excited, I would really like to meet this awesome person I’ve known for such a long time but just knowing how shit goes, I want to make sure I’m safe if he turns out to be a scum bag irl!

227,"I posted this in another thread, but I want to hear some advice from other people. Please help. 

 

Okay, so a bit of backstory on how we met.

I met ""James"" last year at school, while he was dating ""Mary."" (I always respected the relationship, never talked to him more than a 'hi nice to meet you' then talked to her only). I immediately had such strong feelings for him but since he was dating Mary I didn't know if he felt the same. I forgot about him a day later and started talking to my now ex.

In January about two-three weeks after my ex had dumped me, I had met James again, and immediately felt the feeling I had again. We added each other on social media and began talking from there. We were (and still are) very happy and immediately tried to see each other as much as possible. I still talked to Mary, being that I still was her friend and didn't want to stop over some boy. When she found out, she was furious. She immediately said I had her ""sloppy seconds"" and that she was ""disappointed in me"" and ""not surprised that we would be together."" I ignored the comments and fake laughed because like I stated earlier, I didn't want to end a friendship over a boy.

One day as they were dismissed for school and I was heading out for gym, (we went to the same building but different schools, so different dismissals) I had seen him and started talking to him. She came up to us with her friend and started jokingly pressing us, saying that ""he obviously missed her because I look so much like her, and that we even had the same hair type."" (We do look very similar but we most DEFINITELY do not have the same hair type). I was really offended by it, and it was obvious she still had feelings for him. I tried to ignore it and not cause a scene, being as we were outside. After that, our friendship had become strained.

I hadn't really thought about her throughout quarantine as a lot of stuff was happening and we had unfollowed each other on social media due to differences of opinions. This past month though, I feel as some sort of spell has been put on me, and I've become sort of obsessed with her. I'm constantly comparing myself to her. I stalk her social media (the ones I have her on) and I feel uglier and less than compared to her. Everyday as I look through her pictures and her story I feel more shittier and like a creep, but I can't pull myself away from it. I've been so jealous of how rich she is compared to me (my parents are constantly fighting over child support, mom struggles to pay bills each month). Sometimes I feel like he still misses her or has feelings for her, but whenever I'm around him the feeling goes away. It's gotten to the point where I want to kiss her so badly.

What is wrong with me? Why am I obsessed with her? How can I stop this feeling of doubt and feeling of being less than?

To quickly clarify,

I've never questioned his loyalty to me. I feel he loves me too much to do so, and I could never cheat on him. I genuinely feel he is the absolute love of my life.

I do have a therapist, but due to my tight schedule (school and work) I haven't seen her for a while, but I think I would be too embarrassed to tell her this story anyways.

I was diagnosed with depression and BD. Could my BD be the reason as to why?

She and I are on ""cool"" terms, but we don't talk regularly.

I don't really know how to write a TL;DR, could anyone help? I apologize for this being long, this is my first post.",03Oct2020,1

My heart aches. I’m a guy, if it wasn’t atleast somewhat obvious, and well I like guys (I like girls as well but I’m MUCH more attracted to men, so basically gay). That’s not exactly why I’m here though. 
 
There’s this guy that I find hot, and I guess I still do (he is bi). Recently I’ve figured out that my views on politics are different than his. Some are not relevant really, but others I find very important, and there’s one or two things that he doesn’t agree with. I’ve been dealing with this for the whole day almost, increasingly the past few hours, and I feel physical dread everytime I think about him. It sticks with me for awhile, and I’m just mildly suffering, depending on what you consider mildly and highly suffering. If you think of constantly having your heart drastically and deeply drop as either, then base it off of that.

I realize that I shouldn’t care as much about differing opinions in politics in relationships, but it’s good to agree on things that are important to you. I don’t want to get into fights over things as stupidly complicated as politics. I honestly would not care as much if we weren’t in such a hot political climate right now, especially of two very contrasting sides, but of course we are! I still think he’s a good person, but I just don’t feel comfortable or know how to feel about it.

I guess what I’m trying to say is how do I get over this? I just need all the opinions I can get from whoever you are. Do I need to try and forget about him? Do I need to try and just ignore it?

Title. 

I am a 23-year-old female and I do not know how to drive, nor do I have a car. I don’t know how to drive bc I don’t have anyone who will let me practice with their car. None of my friends live close to me. Family members not trying to help. I have pretty much come to the conclusion that I will just have to buy a car (somehow without a license?) and teach myself how to drive. I’ve taken drivers Ed twice ($800) but it basically went to waste bc I have no car to practice with. Technically I DO now have a license, but it has a restriction that another licensed driver has to be in the car with me at all times (until I go take my road test). So that’s one of many reasons why I feel like a failure. The simple solution seems like “save up money to buy a car!” but I’m only working part-time (in the process of converting to FT) and all of my money goes to trying to pay off the money I owe my university. Speaking of that...

I started college right out of high school. Pretty much had a bad semester every other semester due to my mental health. I have pretty bad depression. I’ve attempted suicide before. But, I make very good grades whenever my mental health doesn’t get in the way. I started off at a college six hours away from home but then transferred to a college back home and lived with my mom bc I thought it would be better for my mental health. Plot twist, my mom started being emotionally, verbally, and eventually physically abusive and I basically had to make an emergency move to an on-campus apartment to escape that situation. That was $3k (after everything else) billed to my tuition. 

Well, now I am unable to continue with my degree bc I still owe my school this money. I’ve been doing everything I can to pay on it, but it feels like I’m barely making a dent and I don’t know how long it’s gonna take me to pay it off. I’m not currently making enough money to really pay it off in a timely fashion. I can’t afford the payment plans my school is offering me. 

I’ve been lying to just about everyone telling them I’m still in school even though I’m not because I’m ashamed. I have completed 63 credit hours and have about 1.5 years of courses to go. 

I am currently living with a family member sleeping on an air mattress in their living room and I’m just sick of everything. It’s embarrassing. I don’t want to drop out, but at the same time, I don’t even know if I even like/want to continue with my major anymore. I don’t know WHAT I want to do. I don’t know what I’m interested in anymore... I don’t really feel like I have enough mental stability to finish my degree without wasting even more money. My eligibility for different grants and loans is running out. My current GPA is a 2.7 which disqualifies me for most scholarships. I want to get a car ASAP but I can’t do that if my money is going to paying off the money I owe my school. On top of that, I literally spend about $500 a month on Ubers just to get to and from work and the grocery store.

I just don’t know what to do... :/ 
I feel like I don’t have anything accomplished that I should at my age and I just feel stagnant.  Kinda wanna say fuck school all together and just work, get my own car and my own place so I can be where I feel like I should be as a 23-year-old. I feel like school is holding me back at this point. But of course, if I drop out, I think my job opportunities will be severely limited and I’m going to disappoint my entire family. The family member I’m living with right now would probably kick me out if they knew I wasn’t taking classes right now. Also, those 63 hours I’ve earned would just go to waste...

242,"I’m talking about having friends online who you could never see, meet, or hang out in person with. Who could never come over or play sports with you or watch tv as you both eat some popcorn. As opposed to socializing and interacting with people your age in school, and having a circle of friends you can chill with.

I’m asking because a younger cousin of mine seems content with what he’s doing, and that’s just talking to the same 3 people online everyday. He literally fills up his entire day besides school and meals talking to them, and seems entirely dependant on them for companionship (which we all need, but I feel being entirely reliant on any single person for a basic need like this is not healthy and will only go on to become toxic). Also, none of his 3 friends know about each other because they’re all girls with crushes on him, so it’s not like they could all hang out like a regular group of friends. In fact it gets quite toxic when he has to get the other two off his back to be able to give one their turn to talk to him in the day.

It just doesn’t seem right to me. I grew up in the suburbs so I hung out with and went to school with the same neighborhood kids who lived beside me, so maybe my perspective is a little skewed. But still, it seems like he’s missing out on so much by just being content with the friends he has online, and I’m afraid that he’ll even grow to have unrealistic expectations of friendships and relationships. I mean, to be spending your time hanging out with just one person at a time for half a dozen hours? If that’s your idea of friendship as a 14 year old kid, I’m sorry but it’ll be hard to get the right picture as an adult. It’s also different because what these girls each pursue when they’re spending time with him is a (toxic?) relationship, while he only wants to be their friends (trust me, not to be mean but they’re not very good looking girls).

I just don’t know how to approach this situation. On one hand, I want to tell him that there’s a whole world out there and to make a life for himself there instead of online. On the other hand, with the way the internet is nowadays, maybe those growing up can experience the “full package” of growing up with just friends online, though nothing would be able to replace a first kiss, prom, or sleepovers with the boys. But then again, I want to tell him that, if these girls want more from you than you want from them, they’ll never let you go and you won’t be able to experience anything at all. It’s like being stuck in a toxic relationship, even though in his point of view they’re just friends.

What do you guys think is the best way to approach this situation? I’ve living with my aunt and cousin (I’m a recent college graduate) because of a job, and we’ve grown really close during the last 6 months. That’s why I just can’t help but feel like I should say something about this. It’s all he’s been doing for the last half a year, and probably even longer than that.",03Oct2020,1

When I read this email, I felt very hurt. I got anxious my therapist was mad at me, because of this passive-aggressive email. Aren't therapists supposed to teach you how to engage in conflicts healthily? 

Now I am afraid that this is a way for my therapist to gaslight me into feeling bad and thinking I have issues, thus luring me back into therapy. I feel very conflicted and don't know whether to confront him about it. HELP!",03Oct2020,1
245,"I can’t tell if something is wrong with my boyfriend and he wants to confess something to me, or if it’s just typical drunk antics.

After a year of dating, me and my boyfriend got drunk together one night - like we typically would on a weekend - except this time, he started uncontrollably crying. He’s definitely a “man’s-man” with kind of a macho personality, so it was extremely strange to see him like this. 

I drunkly confessed something about my childhood and the trauma that I had experienced, and shortly after is when his tears started. 

I tried to console him and asked him what was wrong, but all I could make out between the sobbing was: “I try hard to be a good person.”
I asked him to further explain (after he had calmed down a little) but he just kept saying: “It doesn’t matter, it’s just going to make things worse.” He fell asleep shortly afterwards.

The next day I asked about it, and he said he doesn’t remember or know what I was even talking about.

Well... tonight it kind of happened again. I was scheduled to work an 11hr shift (10am-9pm) but was cut early, around 7:40pm. I gave him a call on the way home from work, and he was leaving the course and on the way home. When I got home... he was already there, kinda strange since I was only a few minutes away from the house when I had called, but whatever... right? He must have been close.

When I got home he was sitting on the couch and acting strange, quiet, and really somber. When I asked what was wrong... he said a couple of his work buddies were fighting on the course today and it was getting him down. He explained that it was work issues and that he was going to stay out of the middle of it. A few minutes went by and he said he wanted to go back and hang out with the same guys he played the course with today. It was annoying because I rarely get cut early - but I said that’s fine - just don’t drive drunk - I could tell he was already tipsy. He insisted he was fine and left. 

I put on a movie and finished up some last minute school work. At this point it’s almost 1am, he’s been gone for almost 5 hours now... I’m thinking about to go to sleep so I can open and work my 12hr shift tomorrow. But then I hear the garage door open. He walks up the stairs... and he’s  bawling uncontrollably. It takes him a few minutes to calm down before he tells me that he punched and knocked out his work buddy Jay. He said his other friend Matt and Jay got into some type of altercation... he got punched in the face... and then ended up punching Jay. I told him to calm down - you guys are all drunk and just need to sleep it off. Talk it out in the morning.

I assured him that his friend would forgive him in the morning and that he doesn’t need to cry over it. That’s when he said, “that’s not why I’m crying.”

Any question I asked after that was met with an: “I don’t know...” and an extremely sad intense look in his eyes. Something in my gut kept telling me that he wanted to confess something to me, but he couldn’t bring himself to say it. He randomly bursted into tears through the next hour, and kept saying his friends wasn’t the problem. 

Then he started getting weird, and cornering me against the kitchen wall and grabbing me.... to the point where my dog had to intervene and started growling and barking at him. Then, he started to corner my dog and intimidate him... and I had to grab him by the arm to physically stop him. He went upstairs and fell asleep, and then I started writing this. 

Is he just being a drunk asshole and needs to be put in check in the morning? Or are these warning signs of infidelity and/or someone withholding the truth? Let me know your opinions because I’m not sure what to think right now.",03Oct2020,1

247,"I am a male in my 20s, and ever since I was a young teenager, I have been getting off to My Little Pony porn or ""clop"". The first pornography that I was ever exposed to was clop and the first image which I masturbated to was clop as well. I have had multiple girlfriends and been in normal relationships, but I still have fantasies about ponies and when I am single and view pornography the only type of porn that I ever want to view is pony porn. I'll look at regular porn, hentai, or furry porn and just get creeped out by it and sorta feel like it's weird (I'm not sure how to explain it). Even when I'm not viewing any porn at all, I tend to fantasize about ponies... I avoided porn and masturbation for like 3 months one time and still had sexual thoughts about the MLP characters. The worst part is that I'm attracted the most to the more feral and anatomically correct art and love traits like crotch teats and drawn mare vaginas. I obviously understand that zoophilia is wrong and I would never have sex with a horse, I'm not even attracted to real horses. 

Anyway, I feel like this sort of thing is not normal for someone who is in their 20s. I've tried to force myself to be aroused by other types of porn, but I've always failed. I'm worried that I programmed my brain to only get off on pony porn. I don't want to talk to a therapist and I don't want to tell anybody else about this interest...",03Oct2020,1

I go to school for 3 hours a day do my work then go home and either play games or masterbate. I work on the weekends for 6 hours and then repeat what i usually do.

I don’t even feel comfortable talking to my closest cousins since I get afraid.

But I’m not happy I just feel bitter because I’m not ever going to get to be that happy in my relationship. I don’t want to be bitter, either. I want to be happy for them but everything that my brain is telling me is sad and bitter. 
I feel like I’m putting in too much effort but I don’t know how to stop. I try really hard to not care or just chill sometimes but I just get thoughtful and like to make people’s day. I don’t even mean it but then I notice I’m suddenly burnt out and it’s because I’m carrying all the effort.

258,"Basically, 2 years ago, my boyfriend of 3 years and I broke up. A little while later, I started seeing someone else. However, my ex and I were clearly not over each other and were still texting daily. A couple months later, I stopped talking to the other guy and got back together with my “ex”. We’re still together now.

The problem is, I can’t help but feel bad about how things ended with me and the guy. He was nothing but a gentleman to me, and was so sweet, respectful and kind, even when I had bad days and was a little cold/distant. When we stopped seeing each other, I didn’t really give him an explanation, I just started refusing his invitations and telling him I was busy. 

On one hand, I want to send him a message to give him an explanation, make amends, and thank him for the great time we had together. I don’t want him to think it was his fault because it wasn’t. On the other hand, I feel like it would be disrespectful towards my boyfriend if I message the other guy, even if it’s only as a friend. Then again, maybe it’s a bad idea to message him 2 years later; maybe it didn’t really matter that much to him and it hasn’t really affected him. 

What should I do? 

Tldr: Should I apologize/thank a previous romantic partner, or would it be disrespectful to my current partner (or simply weird, since it’s been 2 years)?",03Oct2020,1
259,"Well long story short. 

My teacher did something cool with us, we weren't allowed to do (nothing illegal or dangerous but not something we were ""allowed to do because it wasn't on the plan"") There were videos made of it.

Somehow it got out, first I didn't even think about but I had this vague recollection of a situation were someone who wasn't supposed to see the video may have seen it (another student), who in turn went to the his own teacher, who went to the principal. (I guess). And my teacher had to justify himself in front of the principal (no further trouble I believe).

My teacher have said they know who is the culprit and they have 5 days to tell them. (Don't know if they really know who was it though)

Now, I am not 100% sure if it was me, I guess it's like a 50/50 to me right now. My teacher was angry though and we have just written an important assignment. So I am afraid to just come out and say it was me, if I am not even sure that it was me. It may have been someone else too, which would have gotten me into trouble for no reason.

I am deeply ashamded if it was me. It's so out of person and I am disgusted by the possibility of it having been me. I don't know if/don't believe they would easily forgive me and I am afraid of being treated like a criminal for the rest of school, if it really was me. How it may have been me: I let one person see an unrelated video on my phone who may have skipped through more than they were supposed to and may have seen the video they shouldn't have.",03Oct2020,1

263,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year now. We've known each other for almost 10 years though, and our entire friendship/relationship has been pretty long distance. 946 miles to be exact. I've met her before in person, but we didn't get much time together. Almost our entire time knowing each other though, we've wanted to be together.

A former ex mentally abused me throughout our relationship so I do tend to ask for affirmation from her.  Like, ""are we going to get married?"", ""why do you love me?"". Things like that. Every time up until about a week ago, the answer has been ""yes of course we're getting married."" Its always been a certainty. But I asked that again this past week, because I was having a particularly bad day with my family, and we'd barely been able to talk since We've both been busy, and her answer is suddenly ""Nothing's certain, we've only been dating a year. We're still seeing how we fit with each other"".

I've never gotten this answer before. She started saying I ask her for affirmation too much, and that I expect too much of her. Then she told me she wanted a break.

Not a long one, just a week of not talking to each other to see how it went. When I jokingly asked ""are you going to date other people?"" She kinda stone-face answered with ""well I don't have anybody in mind"".

Today is the 4th day of the break, and she posted to her IG story a quote, ""You can teach them to love you, and it's okay to leave if they aren't willing to learn"".

After this, I kinda broke the rule and texted her asking what that meant, and if I should be concerned. It said she read it, but never answered.

I really don't want the relationship to end because I do truly love this girl, but it really seems like she isn't as invested in the relationship as I am. It seems like she wants out but doesn't want to say it. Im always happy to fulfill her requests for affirmations because she does ask for them too, just not as much. And I always go out of my way to be a sweet boyfriend (she opened an Etsy store recently, and I was her first customer. She wanted a fortnite skin for a while, i bought it for her. I mailed her my favorite jacket because we didn't know when i was going to be able to give it to her, things like that)

I'm at a loss and I really don't know what to do. I don't have many friends outside of her, and the friends I HAVE asked about this whole thing kinda thinks she's being off too. Any advice is greatly appreciated, because like I said, I have no idea what to do.",03Oct2020,1

But what caught me off guard is that she immediately asked to be friends and for my number and said we should hang out very soon right after saying she liked my outfit. 

Now I have really bad social anxiety, so it’s a possibility she’s just way more outgoing than me and I’m not used to it lol.... but part of me feels sort of worried that somethings a little off here. 

It sounds dramatic but I’m afraid that she’s one of those girls who sort of brings in girls to be trafficked. 

Like I honestly feel bad saying that because she seemed really sweet and I actually do really wanna be friends with her... but something in my gut (possibly just my anxiety) is telling me something isn’t quite right.

This in part has contributed to my depression and anxiety. I don’t handle those feelings very well, it has lead me to cut and over eat. When I try to talk to my parents they completely disregard everything I’m saying, telling me that things aren’t that bad, or that I need to grow up. 
My mother had also been telling me that she thinks my father is cheating on her, I don’t think that’s something that should be discussed with your child, at least one that isn’t even old enough to vote yet. I feel like she is trying to turn me against my father. 
Sometimes we get in really bad arguments over stupid things when she drinks, and I’ll tell her that I don’t like the person she is when she drinks, she’ll always say something along the lines of “ so I’m just a bad person to you then” or “ oh so what fucking adults can’t drink now”. It hurts when she says those things, especially because we are not financially well off, we never have been, and my parents have wasted god knows how much money over the years.
Right now she is mad at me because we were talking about Covid-19, she doesn’t believe it’s real but won’t give me any evidence to support her claim. She always gets mad when I ask for evidence and says that I’m targeting her and attacking her beliefs.
One time my father had seen that I cut when I was sleeping, I had cut a few days prior, and flipped on me. He held a knife to me saying “ here if you want to cut somebody cut me, do it, cut me”. He said I was doing it for attention, which never was the case because my cuts were always hidden, and he didn’t know I did it until that moment. He pulled me out of bed and asked me what the fuck was wrong with me. I was crying so hard I could hardly speak. He punched a hole in my wall and made another one by slamming my bed against it. Because I was sleeping and hadn’t eaten dinner, both of my parents accused me of being on drugs, which wasn’t the case. I was sleeping because, I was super tired, I worked every day after going to school, and back then on the weekends too. They called me a number of things that night, a bitch, a liar, a brat, an attention seeker, a slut. They accused me of doing a number of things as well, doing drugs, sleeping around, cutting for attention, trying to kill myself, and going around town talking shit behind their backs. I’ve never talked shit about my parents until now, I’ve never slept with anyone, I’ve drank or done drugs, I’ve never cut for attention, I’ve never tried to kill myself but honestly, anymore, I do think about it.

275,"So I(19m) broke up with my girlfriend(20f) of over a year last year. She was a great gal, but I was not happy at the time. Everything felt stagnant, and I did not want to do anything. I stopped caring about my hygiene and began laying in bed more often. It took a lot of convincing to get me to do anything other than playing video games.
Everything beside that was great, and I really did enjoy the times we were together. I think I was just depressed. I started neglecting her feelings and needs. I had a hard time even wanting to have sex, and I didn't put forth any effort to get her off. Before the sex was great, and we both had amazing times.
We had rocky times in the past, but I always felt like we could move forward and move on. This felt different everything was stagnant, and everything was stale.I decided that I was going to break up with her for her sake, and I did. This was my first love, and giving it up for her sake was one of the hardest things I have ever done.
So I have been trying to get back in the game, and find a girl to fill the hole she left. About a month after I broke up with her I thought I had made a mistake, and started talking to her again. I was happier, and I told myself it might work out this time. I talked to my friends about it and they said to give it up, and move on, don't hurt her again. I felt like such an asshole giving her hope and taking it away, but I took their advice.
Ever since that falling out I have been trying to find another special gal, and have had no luck. No one is willing to give me a chance, or the time of day. I still feel as if I made a mistake breaking up with her.

TL;DR 
I broke up with my girlfriend of over a year a year ago after feeling depressed, and as if the relationship was stagnant. I broke up with her for what I thought would be best for her. I have been rejected repeatedly for a year now, and my thoughts keep coming back to her.

Ive been taking medications for two years now (lexapro 10mg, adderall xr) and a well-known side effect of this is low sex drive, difficult to get a hard on (for the most part), etc. My gf knows this and she understands and she's actually really supportive of me and my mental health. 


So like we started having sex 2ish months ago and it was really great but after some time my performance started to dip down a lot. I can't even do shit, cant get an erection, and basically masturbation by myself takes too damn long. This happened just last month. I was worried as hell but I opened this up to her and reassured her it doesn't mean Im losing interest or whatever and she said she's cool with but I definitely feel and know she's NOT cool with it and I think she's just saying those to make me feel okay about myself. 


This whole thing is making me anxious as fuck and yeah right I know sex isnt the most important thing in a relationship but it's a part of it and if I can't even do anything, what if she loses the 'romantic' interest in me after some time?

286,"Im a 16yo boy. In this summer I went to the countryroad. I was so happy at the time when there was nothing to worry or get afraid of. 13 people(those are my grandma’s kids and their kids) came in. For 3 months all of them were treating me like shit. I do their jobs for them. They couldn’t do that because they were born and raised in a city. What an excuse to not to do something. Instead of appreciating things ive done for them, if I make a any small mistake they just becomes aggresive and starts hitting me.(I block their stupid punches so i didnt get beaten).it hurt me so much mentally tho. There was also  a girl from neighbor house who is 1 year younger than me. I finally got the chance and confident to talk to her after thinking about it for 6 weeks just to find out she was leaving 2days later. And yea I got her Facebook and started chatting with her. Suddenly her dad/mom picked up her phone and red our convo(I didnt say anything other than asking about each other). Her dad/mom started harassing me saying that theyre coming at me and having a face to face convo, what a kid with a sharp tongue ill tell your parents etc. it was so stressful to think about I couldn’t slept for 2 days. And finally school starts and its a place that I temporarily forget my problems. I do my homework well and I like to play pc games. I get home do the homework, clean my room, kitchen then I turn on my pc. Just after starting to play my mom and dad just shouts YOU NEVER DO YOUR SCHOOLWORKS ALWAYS ON THAT PC, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GRADUATE?!. It just adds more mental pressure on me and I’m barely still going on T-T I just wanna live non stressful worrying life they all treat my like shit please give me some advice I beg you redditors
TL:DR- everyone treats me like shit and mentally pressuring me thinks I can do anything

287,"I’m currently taking AP Statistics, but I’m not doing well. My grade is a C+ and it’s almost the end of the first quarter which means that the deadline for dropping a class for the semester is coming soon. 

The problem is that I’m really struggling with the tests and quizzes. I get the lectures and understand the homework, but as soon as I take a test/quiz is like I have never seen the material is my life. I simply don’t really get statistics. I’m a good math student, but this course is so confusing to me. I study very hard and pay attention during classes, but something is not working. 

I’m taking another two AP classes on top of this one, and I’m doing very well on both. Stats is the only class in which I feel like shit being in. It makes me feel so bad and stupid. I don’t really see the need to add more stress to my life on top of the one I already face. 

I emailed my counselor about dropping the class but she basically guilt tripped me into staying. She said that it looked better on my transcript that I’m challenging myself with this course, and that it would be hard to switch to another course since the semester has already started. She told my to talk to my teacher and I did, but he said the same stuff she told me. He did say that he bumps letter grades with a +, so my C+ would be a B- on the report card. But the class is really taking a toll on my mental health. 

Should I drop the class? Or should I stick with it at least until the semester ends?",03Oct2020,1

292,"Earlier this year, my brother passed away from an OD. It’s been extremely difficult, and this entire year has been the absolute worst of my life. I just feel the need to move to a state far away, try to maybe clear my head, be on my own for a while, start a new life. I’ve been feeling this for a few years now when his addiction was at its worst. I just feel trapped here. Like I will spend my entire life in this one place that holds too many bad memories. I already have burned bridges regarding friendships because of my own depression with having to live with an addict. I absolutely hate my job and can’t find another one that is worth leaving for. I’m nearly 30, still living with my parents, and have never been on my own for longer than 4 months. I just need to run away.
The only issue is- I am very close with my family, and that would mean leaving them behind, including my parents who are struggling immensely with my brother’s death. I also already have two other siblings that have moved far and they rarely see them. The one sibling we see about once or twice a year, and the other every few years. With the death of my brother, I believe me moving far away would just be too many of my parents’ children leaving them. When my one sibling moved, my father was so depressed for weeks and cried frequently. I could never imagine putting him (or my mother) through that, on top of the grief they are already experiencing.

Lot of things happened since I last post on Reddit and I already have posted on aita, relevant to this one so Im going to summarize it. Its kinda long but please bare with me. Also apologies for my English its not my native language. 

I(20f) two bestfriends Matt and Liz(both 20). We were in a big and lively friends group together and we have a really close friendship with Matt. Our mutual friends ships us aggressively and butter me up to Matt when Im not around persistently. It only happened once as I know cuz Matt told me that but apparently it happens all the time when they hangout and they hangout pretty a lot. 

I didn’t like this kinda talk especially about me and my bestfriend because its really started to mess with our friendship. Also I told him several times that this kinda talk makes me really uncomfortable and asked him to end it, they dont talk about this if Im around. But Matt started to act different towards me. Hes an affectionate guy and we kinda messed around with the topic at first as like its kinda our private joke and laughed about it. We called eachother pet names and stuff but I already calling all my friends with these so it didn’t bother me at all. But he kinda became suave and bold with his comments towards me. I always change the subject far away from lovey dovey stuff when I talk with him but he started to claim that I was playing hard to get etc. 

When I talk about a guy that I like or talk he started to put out my excitement and started doing some really annoying comments on my tastes of men and stuff. He gets offended when I dont text him couple of days and says that Im too busy with my lovers etc. 

I bring the topic to him but he always parry it and claims hes just joking around. So I stop bringing this kinda talk to him cuz it clearly making me really uncomfortable. I only talked these kinda things with Liz in our private calls and I always warned her not to tell Matt because the way he acts makes me feel guilty about it. She agreed with me and said that she suspected Matt has feelings for me for a long time. I didn’t want to believe her or think otherwise about our relationship so I didn’t comment or anything. 

Couple of weeks ago I got an an angry call from Matt. He told me that while they were hanging out our ship topic rose up again and a drunk Liz couldn’t hold the beans in her mouth and blabbered them everything that I told her not to. He was frustrated he said that am I that afraid to have or talk about a bf because I think he has a crush on me. I was so shocked and angry I couldn’t express myself clearly that we hangup awkwardly. I texted him to tell him the whole story instead of a drunken second hand words but he just ignored me for a week. He also told me not to talk this thing with Liz or any of our friends cuz he said he didn’t like to talk ‘behind his friends’. I wasnt there when all this shit happened so I didn’t know actually what happened or told and I couldn’t asked them either. End of the week he said i could call him and talk. So I did. I told him the truth that i dont think he has a crush on me but this ship thing is really disturbing me etc etc. He listened and agreed with me. We chatted a little about normal stuff and ended the call. Next day I texted him but he didn’t really talked much.

Fast forward to today nearly 3 weeks later we still haven’t talked. Liz noticed and called me to talk about it yesterday. Matt repeatedly told me that i cannot talk this with Liz so I couldn’t said anything to her and I was still kinda mad at her for betraying my trust. But she guessed the situation and I couldn’t hold it anymore. I told her what Matt told me and said I dont trust her anymore because of this. 

Jokes on me. Apparently the Matts version of the story wasnt the real one. Apparently Liz barely drink that night. Matt and one of our mutual friends, who started the whole ship topic, talked privately about how we should date and he needed to ask me out. Liz said that Matt really got convinced and hyped up all about this and actually planning to ask me out and reveal his feelings, thats when she stepped in and told him to stop. She said she didn’t betrayed my trust and simply told him that the whole situation made me uncomfortable and how he’s sabotaging our friendship and him and I couldn’t be anything more than friends. And apparently Matt got really upset about this. 

He dont know that I know what actually happened now. Im not planning to tell him this or ask him why he lied. I just want my friend back but he really is ignoring me. He acknowledged the existence of his last crush and simply took them out of his life. I dont want that to happen to us but I dont know what to do. I really need advice. What should I do?",03Oct2020,1
297,"Hi!

So, my parents have passed away a few years ago when I was 20 years old and the only relatives I have left are my aunt, uncle and grandfather. We are a small group and my grandfather is the most amazing person- we have always had a good relationship and a mutual understanding of each other. My aunt and uncle are okay, they have been nice to me, but lately my aunt started acting very strange and her behavior over my actions has created an immense rift in our family and caused both me and my grandfather a lot of pain.

What happened was that two years ago and shortly after losing my parents I went traveling by myself, on a scholarship abroad and I decided (out of some sort of escapism to remain living abroad) I have since kept in active contact, calling and video chatting with my family, always keeping them up to date and when I was able to, travel back to visit.

Recently, I lost a lot of money and could not afford paying my phone bill and I had to denounce my contract with the phone company, planning to keep my number and switch to a prepay as soon as I resolved my financial situation. The phone company cancelled my number in spite of me wanting to keep it and I had no idea that I could not be called anymore (was not notified by them). So when my family started calling the number could not be reach, something they failed to let me know over facebook chat where we also talk sometimes. Instead of telling me they can't reach me, my aunt started texting me on facebook a long message, calling me names and accusing me that I gave up my number on purpose, so that they cannot reach me (although they can, over the internet) calling me ungrateful, selfish, accusing me that my life abroad has gone to my head and a series of other vulgar remarks.

This is not the first time my aunt has been acting like this. Each time I stepped out- in her opinion, she starts aggressively accusing me that I turned my back on my family, along with very aggressive remarks on my person. When she acts like this, she does it out of the blue, without prior discussing what is bothering her. This time it was too much for me and I replied that she is an insane person and I wish to be left alone if she sees me the way she says she does. 

Unfortunately, this scandal has affected my grandfather who is deeply saddened to see us fight. He has a weak health and is 85 years old. I called my grandfather as soon as I could use a friend's phone number to explain the situation and promise that I will acquire a new number as soon as possible. Still, he was called by my aunt who was crying over the phone, saying that I was the one who sent her insulting texts which was not true. Now my grandpa doesn't know who to believe and I am scared this useless drama will get to him.

Living abroad and not being able to resolve these problems in person, I feel defeated by the situation and at the same time extremely angry that my aunt is turning everyone against me.

If anyone has any advice on family drama or how to proceed forward please let me know.

 **td;lr**  after the death of my parents, my aunt is acting aggressive towards me, picking over a situation where I lost my phone number and not being able to call her back, she turned the family against me and I don't know what to do",03Oct2020,1
298,"Today Instagram let me know that my brother had an account, and that I should follow. When I clicked on it I found that it was a fetishized furry account. It specified things about his sexuality that I rather not know. 

And it also mentioned that he is bi.

I guess this could be ignored by most people, but we come from a VERY conservative family, and my brother has truly always been an enigma. Very shy. He doesn’t date (that we know of), and he keeps to himself. 

I am feeling a lot of emotions, for a couple of reasons. First, the bi part. I truly don’t care what his sexuality is, but I know that this is probably something that he is repressing and I KNOW my family would have a hard time with it. How do I help him feel seen without bringing up his secret.

Secondly, furry fetishizing makes me really uncomfortable. Mostly because I feel like my brother should be out there finding true love, rather than getting instant gratification from an image of something that is not real. I want him to feel seen for who he really is. Idk if this makes sense.

I am also afraid that like me, his other contacts will find his account and he will be outed unknowingly. Which would cause him distress, and he already suffers from depression and anxiety. 

I guess if anyone has gone through something similar reach out?",03Oct2020,1

300,"hi there! i need some advice because i’m really indecisive lmao. i like to hear outside perspectives before i process my own decision. not sure if i should think logistically or follow my emotions/well being. (also tldr at bottom)

some context: my mom and her ex’s relationship is coming to an end. they’ve been dating for a number of years - they bought a house together, etc. however, her ex can’t move on from her past actions and gets very angry to where he throws and breaks things. he bottles up his anger and he explodes. we’ve moved out temporarily 2 times over the past 7 ish years? we moved back in 2 years ago.

my mom is trying to get her name off of the property and he’s making her pay for the costs. when he was angry, he wanted us out of the house. gone. he calmed down and was showing concern about my academics (i’m a senior in hs) and asked if we wanted to stay living here.

their relationship issues has definitely had a toll on my mental health (i’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, currently on meds) and in my point of view, their relationship is toxic. the past is constantly brought up and they can’t move on. i know he’s a good person at heart, but he can be pretty mean to my mom and i get pretty anxious when they fight. i’ve been ready to call the police a number of times in fear of his anger.

anyways, my main issue is deciding on my living situation. my mom and i are able to stay with my aunt (pros: save money, help support each other financially (her husband is not living with them - he cheated), no rent (just help w/ bills) and also getting away from such a toxic environment/household. cons: no personal space (my mom prefers to have her own place) and moving is quite a hassle. we will only be there for a short period of time before i go off to college and my mom would have to find a place for herself). my other option is to stay in the house that my mom is getting her name taken off of (pros: don’t have to move stuff, personal space. cons: i assume we would have to pay rent like a tenant(?), he would still be in our life and i’m not sure if that would give either of them closure. feel like it would take a toll on me too.

tldr: mom and ex are splitting, her name is getting taken off of the property but we may have an option to stay in the house. is it better to leave the toxic environment so my mom and him can get away from each other, or would it be better to stay here since i will be going off to college and she will be eventually looking for a new place?

Well long story short.

My teacher did something cool with us, we weren't allowed to do (nothing illegal or dangerous but not something we were ""allowed to do because it wasn't on the plan"") There were videos made of it.

Somehow it got out, first I didn't even think about but I had this vague recollection of a situation were someone who wasn't supposed to see the video may have seen it (another student), who in turn went to the his own teacher, who went to the principal. (I guess). And my teacher had to justify himself in front of the principal (no further trouble I believe).

My teacher have said they know who is the culprit and they have 5 days to tell them. (Don't know if they really know who was it though)

Now, I am not 100% sure if it was me, I guess it's like a 50/50 to me right now. My teacher was angry though and we have just written an important assignment. So I am afraid to just come out and say it was me, if I am not even sure that it was me. It may have been someone else too, which would have gotten me into trouble for no reason.

I am deeply ashamded if it was me. It's so out of person and I am disgusted by the possibility of it having been me. I don't know if/don't believe they would easily forgive me and I am afraid of being treated like a criminal for the rest of school, if it really was me. How it may have been me: I let one person see an unrelated video on my phone who may have skipped through more than they were supposed to and may have seen the video they shouldn't have.

305,"As someone who believes firmly in evidence-based logic and scientific reasoning, I shed my religious beliefs during middle school. It was a combination of being told that people I loved would supposedly go to Hell just for not believing in God, hearing people preach about love only to turn around and be homophobic and sexist, and realizing that there's as much proof of the existence of Santa as of God.

However, the problem is that since then, I have always looked down on religious people. When I meet someone who is religious, I instantly can't help but internally lose all respect for them. All that I can think of is that if they really read the Bible cover-to-cover like I did, then they'd find countless contradictions and ridiculous rules. From my perspective, anyone who genuinely believes in religion is, to put it bluntly, brainwashed.

I do know, though, that thinking this way is extremely judgmental. Obviously, I don't voice these opinions out loud or berate people, but it feels wrong to feel so radically prejudiced against people for their beliefs, and I know this mindset bars me from getting to know some really interesting, good people.

This unfortunately resulted in me growing up where if a book I'm reading has a female protagonist, or if a fanfiction has a ship between a guy and a girl, I will cast judgement or immediately be not as interested or expect the writing to be awful.

This, of course, just isn't true or fair.

Of course there's tons and tons of great female characters in media that have been portrayed excellently. But I recognise that I have ill feelings towards women in fiction in general for no reason other than they're women, despite being a woman myself.

How do I deal with this? I can't exactly call myself a feminist if I have all this internalised sexism.",03Oct2020,1

I have became friends with this guy for quite a while. He is the type to be shy. The more I’ve got to know him, I’ve become interested in him. ’m wondering if there could be any signs of interest or that he’s just being nice and nothing more? 

When we talk he always smiles wide and looks away and we always laugh whenever we speak.

We have things in common and one of them is gaming. So we added each other and have played with him and his other friend.

He would make comments like one time he was spectating his friend then said he was going to watch the real pro now and asked who and he said me. Even when I told him not to he still would and tease me, making comments on my gameplay. But he also gave advice to help. 

I would appreciate any comments thanks.",03Oct2020,1

317,"So there’s 3 girls. The first, is one I’ve been friends with coming up on a year in January-ish. I’ve kind of had an on off crush on her for a while, but our relationship has been mixed. We started off alright, but then I did some shit that made her feel uncomfortable and she didn’t like me anymore. But we’ve moved past that and I feel we’ve gotten closer as friends over the past few weeks. I’m still not completely like, into it cause I’m still Tryna make her feel comfortable but I think it’s working. But like, idk I just, like I wanna be friends with her, but there’s also a sense of wanting to be in a relationship. But she isn’t ready for a relationship, liek she went out with someone else in our friend group for a couple weeks but she broke up with him cause she felt she wasn’t ready, so it’s like, idk. Idk if I even want a relationship, liek even just cuddle buddies or whatever the fuck. So idk if I have a crush on her.

The second girl is soemoen that goes to my school. Quick little backstory, I used to go to an all boys for 5 years but now I go to a mixed school. The thing is, I’ve barely talked to her. Like, I just started to get feelings when I saw her. She’s in most of my classes but we have the exact same timetable. We walk home a similar way for the most part as well. I did accidentally throw a paper throwing star at her a couple weeks ago but I said sorry and shit. We’ve barely talked but we have a few mutual friends if that means anything. I just, idk I just saw her and started to get like, fuckin idek if there feelings or not man it’s just so difficult.

The third girl goes to the school as well, and she’s actually a friend. If I Walk a different way home then I can go with her and a few friends and on one of those days, like last Monday, we held hands for a bit. I can’t remeber exactly how it happened but we did it as a joke and started being a fake couple. It lasted a couple days until she found out I had a crush and was like “so you got a crush so we’re gonna stop now cause I don’t wanna ruin your chances” or some shit like that. But like, idk if I do actually have feelings for her or if it’s just cause she showed me affection. 

It’s just difficult yk, and especially since cause like, the order I got the crushes was girl 2, girl 3, and then girl 1, but In-between girl 2 and girl 3, I told a friend that goes to the school I had a crush, and left some hints as to who it was. But then the day after I got a crush on girl 3. The hints still refer to both tho so it’s like, the selection wide and I’m not telling anyone who it is cause idk how I even feel. They don’t even know I have more than one crush so it’s like, it’s just so hard. I just dk how I feel.

Any help on just, what to do or how to approach the situation is very appreciated, thanks",03Oct2020,1

322,"Hi. I just had my wisdom teeth removed yesterday and my husband has been taking great care of me. I have been in immense pain from it and spent most my time home sleeping it off. 

Tonight I woke up sobbing at about 430 am. Uncontrollably sobbing and wasn’t exactly sure why right away. My husband first I heard him saying aw baby baby and ran over to my side of the bed. I expected him to hug me or kiss me or console me some way. 

Instead he took the pain pills from my nightstand and asked me how many I needed. I told him I’m due for one but I think I’m crying from a bad dream. I just felt so sad and depressed out of no where. I only remember bits of my dream. 

I told him I did take 1 ibuprofen a few hours ago that’s why I don’t think I am in pain. He said you can’t be afraid of the pain pills. That made me cry because I was sensitive and i told him I thought I was doing what’s best and I am sorry. 

He told me nothing to apologize for and he went back into the bed and sat on his phone. I cried in the bathroom because I just couldn’t stop. I have been blowing my nose and just quietly sobbing in bed next to him now. He hasn’t touched me or hugged me or asked if I am okay. 

He just sat on his phone. This made me feel worse like he didn’t care about me which Made me cry more. He’s directly next to me he knows I’m crying he sees it. Not once does he touch me. He then put his phone down and turned around in bed.

I feel so sad now and all I needed was a hug and asked if I was okay. If this was him I would have been cuddling him and trying to make him feel better. I feel myself slipping into more sadness. I can’t get myself to stop crying and he’s just asleep next to me.

How do I ask my husband to console me without being direct or idk hurting his feelings? This is the worse time for me to be feeling depressed when I need to concentrate on healing.

I’m Sorry if I sound like I’m being overly sensitive or maybe petty. I don’t know why i feel this way. This isn’t the first time he’s ignored me when I’ve cried in bed. I know he loves me and in the past he told me he didn’t know how to help me when I feel sad. Any advice?",03Oct2020,1
323,"Backstory: I (16M) have had an actual doctor tell me that I have Sensory Integration Disorder (SID) and Rejection Sensitive Disorder (RSD) and both of them have always gifted me with problems including insomnia, physical pain whenever I get hugged, and pain/bleeding from ears in response to loud noises and more. I also put my problems into joke forms and make myself and others laugh to get rid of them, and in this case I say ""My momma has always called me special.""

I have always had mental issues and during high school it has gotten way worse and my insecurities have definitely hit an all time high. I have never had a bunch of friends and I can only think of 2 people who have been really good friends of mine and I don't talk to either of them anymore as they both moved out of state. I am ""friends"" with everyone but I am afraid to get close to anyone because I am afraid to be hurt again. I have terrible insecurities and self-doubt and I have always been a sensitive guy (the three main reasons why my ex is now my ex) and I don't feel as if anyone likes me or have any reason to. I used to spend all my time at the working out or learning new things because I want to impress people so badly and hope to get others to like me. It finally started to get better and I had a dream of what I wanted to do when I was older until everyone said i would never make it and i knew to ditch the people who said that but it really affected me and put me down again. 

Sorry if it didn't make a ton of sense as I have not been the biggest ray of sunshine in the last couple hours and I will respond or edit for clarification.

Since turning 16, I’ve obviously grown a lot as a person, forming my own ideas and opinions instead of being his carbon copy. Even more recently, we have grown so far apart.. over politics. 
My father and I are no saints, don’t get me wrong. He’s a depressed alcoholic with a lot of regrets, and I’m an anxious spitfire of an 18 year old. We just don’t believe in the same things. I will occasionally repost things onto Facebook, following my political views. Most are jokes or laughing at the stuff I find ridiculous. But it seems a lot of my family stalks my Facebook.. because lately my dad has confronted me about posting stuff about BLM or Pride, most recently, me laughing at the damage that Trump is causing. This upset some unknown aunt or uncle, and they confronted my dad, who then got in my face, yelled at me, told me to shut up and stay in my place, and even broke the door open after I got the last word.. which he apparently wanted. 
I feel like absolute garbage all the time. I don’t post as much anymore, but they still find some way or another to nitpick at the stuff I believe in. I am the first person in my family that is not straight, by the way. I feel like my father is just so embarrassed by me. It kills me. He used to be everything I looked up to and now he just insults my intelligence, tells me that I’ll regret my younger self when I get older, and more. I’m just so tired of living with him, but can’t afford to move out just yet. Obviously there are good moments, but it takes more than 1,000,000 hugs to fix 1 hit (not physical). 
I’m so tired, feel so low, and can’t stop crying at this point. What should I do? I’ve tried talking in the past but it’s usually just arguments. I just wanna feel like my house is home again. Why does he let his family get in the way of the one he created? How do I do this..?",03Oct2020,1
326,"This is kind of long so please bare with me. Everyone in the post is 15. There is a TLDR at the bottom. 

I ordered my boyfriend a star map of our first kiss for our 1 year anniversary. I know the date but I was struggling to find out the time. All I knew is that it happened at the same time as a  fireworks display in my town. I thought it might’ve been between 17:00-18:00 and a friend that was with us at the time said around 18:00. I felt that was too vague because that’s a whole hour difference right? I also thought that was still too late. 

So I asked this girl that me and my boyfriend are no longer friends with (she is quite the character) and she said she had pictures of the fireworks at “coming to a close” at 18:50 so I thought it maybe happened around 18:36. I asked her a few times just to make sure but she didn’t answer. There was also a 50% off (£40 before, now £20) limited time deal that was running out. 

So I thought I had to buy it quickly (last night) to get the deal. Turns out she read the date wrong AND the deal is still valid today. She said the time of the picture was actually at 16:50 not 18:50 so they must’ve started around 16:30. 

What do I do? I can’t cancel the order because it was customised. I paid £30.25 or something with tax, a frame and delivery. I would’ve been fine if it was out a few minutes but not by 2hours!?

But crossing the street while all the cars are stopped makes me feel like I have an audience and people are watching me which makes me super self-conscious. Also, past experiences made me fear crossing streets. I never knew when I could go especially on roads that intersected. One time, I crossed the street after standing at the crosswalk for like ten minutes even though I could clearly go sooner. And when I finally went, the light turned green and I disturbed traffic. I also went while oncoming traffic was coming from afar and was yelled at by a guy in a big semi truck. I also fell off my bike while riding across a big street because i was conscious of how I appeared. I looked at oncoming traffic with embarrassment.

I am a high school senior and I am graduating next week. I had a math teacher for two years and he has helped me through basically everything this year. Due to my great interest in math, I became very close to him from the beginning of last year and ever since he became my favorite teacher. During my final year of high school (which is this year), I had many personal things going on and he always asked me if I was okay and he basically helped me through depression. He has a reputation of being strict and not having any personal conversations with his students but I realised that we have a lot of conversations about our personal life so I guess he thinks of me as one of his favourite?

This is basically my last opportunity to thank him because I can tell that he doesn't friend his students after graduation so I want to thank him for all his support across the two years and expresses my gratitude and respect towards him. I am going to handwrite the letter but I have drafted it on my laptop and it is just below 1000 words.

Also crazy to me how I met my boyfriend at 19 (well 2 weeks before I was turning 20) but like ima be 22 now but it’s only been almost 2 years since we been together even tho the age gap between 19 and 22 is like 3-4 years but obviously I was nearly turning 20 at that time. 😂

Idk if I’m just confusing everyone now
But I feel so sad like I was depressed about turning 21 that it went away so quick that now I wish I was 20 turning 21 again instead of 21 turning 22. I mean why couldn’t I have just been born in 1999 or 2000 instead of 1998. I know it’s barely a difference but I feel so odd. My friends who are born in 1999 are so lucky they gotta worry about turning 23 next year. 
I’m still the same as I was at 19 I mean it wasn’t that long ago but I’ve been seeing how 19/20 and 21/22 are meant to be different.

Last week, someone stole food from me. I let it go, cause I didn't really care, I don't mind sharing, I'd just prefer if the person asked first.

Earlier this week, I noticed something missing, again. And again, I decided not to say anything.

Yesterday morning, I noticed something missing again. This time I decided to grab a piece of paper, write ""Please, don't eat food that does not belong to you! Ask first. Thank you!"" and put it on the fridge. Someone replied by writing ""Please, don't MOVE food that doesn't belong to you. :)"" which is fair enough. I'll admit, I did move one or two things that didn't belong to me before, although I know some of the others have been doing it a lot more. Thing is, when I came back to it in the evening, someone had drawn a middle finger, and someone else (probably one of the girls) had drawn a heart and a sun. So I chose not to be petty or anything and didn't react to the middle finger.

This morning, something was missing again. I'm getting really tired of it. Now, I don't want to do any witch hunts and accuse or interrogate people. I'm the kind of person who gets along with most people. I don't want to hurt the relationships I have with my flatmates (except the one who's been stealing my food), so I don't know what to do.

This is something that has been around for a long time, but I’ve not paid much attention to it until now.
When I am alone, I find myself saying things out loud unintentionally.
What I’ve noticed so far that it can happen whether I’m calmed or stressed. It also happens regardless whether I’m thinking a lot or absent minded or even watching YouTube/Netflix etc..
Earlier today I blurted out about self harm while folding washing with no prior trigger and said “hey, how’s it going” in a different accent while stacking the dishes.
Some other things to note is I twitch when stressed and, if related, I have Essential hand tremors since birth. This doesn’t happen when I’m engaging with people that I’m not comfortable with, I have sometimes said things out loud around family and friends (but very rarely)

I’m 26M and am interested if anyone experiences or knows someone who does and if I should seek any medical advice.

This course is 2 years so how do I get to the end of it without burning out? I was working yesterday and was close to tears for a good chunk of the shift purely bc I'm tired and stressed atm. Any healthy coping mechanisms and advice is greatly welcomed. Thank you!",03Oct2020,1
355,"Hi guys!

I am a high school senior and I am graduating next week. I had a math teacher for two years and he has helped me through basically everything this year. Due to my great interest in math, I became very close to him from the beginning of last year and ever since he became my favorite teacher. During my final year of high school (which is this year), I had many personal things going on and he always asked me if I was okay and he basically helped me through depression. He has a reputation of being strict and not having any personal conversations with his students but I realised that we have a lot of conversations about our personal life so I guess he thinks of me as one of his favourite?

This is basically my last opportunity to thank him because I can tell that he doesn't friend his students after graduation so I want to thank him for all his support across the two years and expresses my gratitude and respect towards him. I am going to handwrite the letter but I have drafted it on my laptop and it is just below 1000 words. I don't want him to think it's excessive or think 'wow this kid took this to a whole new level' so I would love to hear your HONEST opinions about this! I am planning on delivering the letter on the day of graduation with a small gift!",03Oct2020,1

I’m just so tired that I have no energy to do anything to make myself feel a little better but sleep. How are y’all getting through this year? Or if you are diagnosed with depression what’s something that helps you? I feel it’s a combo of both for me. Thanks for any advice and I hope you’re doing better than I am. :),03Oct2020,1

358,"Okay so my (F19) best friend (F19) and I have been dating for two years. We were friends for about a year and a half, maybe two years before that. My problem is that I’m having difficulty working out my feelings towards her. We both care a lot about each other. We spend every day together without fail. We’ve gone on holiday together, lived together for weeks at a time. We’ve been there for each other during our roughest times. A year and a bit into college and we’re still just as close as we were in Highschool. I love her very much, I really do. But I’m not sure it’s the kind of love that she wants us to have. I don’t know what to do. I feel awful. It’s literally tearing me up. She told me she loves me more than anyone else in the world. And that even if we did break up we’d still be bestfriends. And that means so much to me. She’s my rock and I’m so afraid of hurting her or worse, losing her. And I think that’s why I haven’t said anything sooner? I’m being selfish. And I know I am. I really care about her. And I’m going to try to put her emotions ahead of mine. But I don’t know what to do and I’m so lost. I can’t even figure out my own feelings and it just makes me more distressed. I went through a hard time a couple of years ago and I think as a self preservation tactic I kind of numbed my feelings. I’ve been finding it hard for four maybe five years now to really feel much, Other than negative emotions. So part of me is hoping that maybe it’s that reason that is making it hard for me to figure out my feelings for her? I have quite a lot of depressive periods (nothing diagnosed mind you) but when she’s away I miss her terribly. It just seems to me that the only times when I feel really strong emotions are when she’s gone. Or when we’re in a fight. And it’s just that I miss her and I don’t want to lose her. And I feel so alone I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to cause her any unnecessary pain, she’s been through enough, losing family members etc. She also has quite a bit of childhood/family related trauma. So yeh.

But, me dating older people didn't end there. Back in 2017 I dated a guy that was 4 years older than me. I don't know if It's just a thing I'm into or something else?? It just kind of happens.. and I was wondering If there's something wrong with me? Could it be something to do with my family?

362,"This is too much of an information that I unfortunately know but when my mom and dad were doing it one time my mom said “are you done?” and my dad thought she was saying “Dan” during their intimate time. My mom tried to explain everything to him but ever since that happened, my dad would always get really angry when hearing the name Dan (imaginary ex) or Ray (mom’s true ex a long time ago). When he hears those names on movies/series/commercials or even our friend’s name he would look at my mom and would grin and would shake his head and start saying things like “slut” and/or “fucker” to my mom.. Growing up... I had to watch that and it really hurts seeing my mom suffer from that kind of abuse and I would always just try to break that by opening a new conversation. It is really traumatising to the point where I even HATE those names. But, I don’t wanna say all what I feel because I know this thing hurts 10x to my mom. I was still in highschool when that happened and I am married now and I am moving to another country to my husband next year and I am worried sick that my mom will get so depressed and I know that she is now because she’s been giving me hints how she has panic attacks sometimes..

During dinner, my mom and I were eating and I know they fought about that again because they seemed off and not talking to each other. My dad said “fucking slut” while looking at his phone but we know that he is trying to say that again to my mom. I didn’t even think and just said that he needs to stop doing that because he has been traumatising us and that is just not right. He said “fuck you” to me and “who do you think you are?” I held back and refrained myself from saying “this is my house” becuase I know that that is just disrespectful and he would take that to his grave.

I have two older brothers and they don’t even know what’s happening here because they don’t live with us anymore. I feel so helpless but I have to be strong for my mom and this is so stressful and just sad because sometimes they are super OK but most of the times they are not.

363,"So some backstory. I (F20s) broke up with my ex bf about 3 years ago. We fought towards the end our relationship. I never stay friends with any ex boyfriends I ever had. I think it's weird. Well I started dating my current bf(M20s) about 2 years ago. Months into the beginning of our relationship, he mentioned a conversation he had with this girl on instagram and I asked who she was and he said she was one of his ex girlfriends. I asked him if he normally stays friends with exes and he said yes. I told him I found it weird and mentioned that I never stay friends with exes. He eventually removed her off social media (I never asked him too) I do believe he still has his old highschool crush on his friends list on facebook (possibly other exes too since there's other girls on his friends list) I never brought that up to him though. After he told me he removed his ex girlfriend ''because of me'' I told him he can talk to his exes if he wants too.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to 2 years later. This past week my ex boyfriend tried re-adding me on social media. I told my boyfriend I want to ask him why he tried re-adding me and see where it leads (assuming he wants a friendship with me). (**Side note**: I'm open to friendships with exes since this year because 2020 has been horrible so why not show kindness by being friendly with people from the past) Anyways, my boyfriend flipped out on me saying that I'm a whore and that I'm cheating and I'm only telling him this now because I fell guilty of cheating. He then told me one of his ex gfs hit him up on snapchat the other weekend. I told him how hypocritical he is being because he use to be friends with his ex girlfriends on social media. I also mentioned that I should be accusing him of cheating too since his ex gf hit him up on snapchat and he's ''feeling guilty of cheating'' too.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1996 my dad bought that house ( back then you could barely call it that)  and over time rebuilt it himself with his own hands and a limited budget. There's  two much smaller houses in the back yard. One where my 22 yo brother lives and one is empty for the time being. 

My dad now 70 yo asked me if I wanted to take over this house (so that he could move out to the smaller empty one), first I would be a tenant paying only the operating costs. And then when the day comes and my dad turns it in, I would mortgage the house (it has no mortgage currently) so I can buy out my siblings and give them their part of the inheritance currently tied up in this house. 

Should I do it? What could go wrong?

368,"Story time.

One night in late August I ran out to the gas station to grab something. Since it was a quick trip I hopped on my motorcycle just to feel some wind on a hot night. I decided that quick trip wasn’t enough so I cruised through the neighborhood. I came upon a 3 way intersection and came to a stop. I noticed something moving on the sidewalk/road off to my left and the streetlight on the corner didn’t do much to light up the way. After a couple seconds of staring at this object I realized it was a large woman. She must have noticed me about the same time because she called out and said that she’d been run over. I called out back and asked if she was ok, could she walk, do I need to call an ambulance, etc. She insisted she was fine and just needed a ride. Now, this is a large woman, and my CBR isn’t the biggest bike, so I told her no. I again asked to call an ambulance, she persisted and then began to stumble/walk to the other side of the street just ahead of me and sat down on the curb. It’s like Friday night around 10 so I assume this lady is just hammered drunk, and I was about to pull out my phone and call 911 when a truck pulled up from behind me and blocked the intersection. A man got out and started talking to her and there was a younger guy in the passenger seat. I pulled up to the passenger side and asked the kid what was going on and he said “She actually got run over, we were following the guy.” So I stayed for just a few minutes until I realized the cops were probably coming. I said to the kid “Hey I’m not exactly legal, you guys got it?” He said yeah so I rode off. 

I was browsing our neighborhood app the other day and saw that the mother of this woman was trying to find the one responsible and asked anyone with information to call their attorney. I’m conflicted, because I don’t want to call it in and have them realize I was driving illegally, but I don’t want to let it go unpunished. I don’t know anything about the driver that ran her over, though I’m sure I passed him on my way through. I don’t know if I’d be of any assistance anyway, but maybe I could. I’m not sure. What do you guys think?

TL;DR I found a woman who had just been ran over and now her mother is asking for information. I was driving a motorcycle without a license and I’m afraid to call the police with information.",03Oct2020,1

370,"I started my current job just over two years ago. At that time I worked with a certain woman who I became very close too and about 6 months ago started dating. 

She no longer works here but all of my coworkers know her obviously and a few of them attempted to make a move many times before I did and were all shut down. When we first started hanging out together we dealt with many of those guys butting in with the “why him but not Me” whining but we ignored it. Well one coworker has had a hard time accepting that she’s with me and isn’t interested in him. He still occasionally messages her and tries to make a move. He’s usually drinking and once she finally got rude about it he backs off.

Last month our supervisor quit and this coworker is filling in until they find a permanent replacement so he’s technically my boss. He’s also started trying to contact my girlfriend again. He’s not being aggressive like he has in the past but still he knows his advances are unwanted but he doesn’t care. He can’t get it through his head that she would want me and not him.

We have both gotten fed up with him and the other day at work mind you he makes a sexual joke about her I front of me and other coworkers. When we were alone together I politely asked him to back off. This is where he started screwing with me. He is still messaging her, even when she doesn’t respond he will keep messaging and he doesn’t say anything when we are around others but when we are alone he makes remarks about her to me. He also has started treating me obviously worse then the other employees under him. 

How do I handle this? On one hand I’m furious and want to break his nose but I know I can’t. Obviously being polite isn’t working.

374,"From a young age, music has always been my main interest. Throughout my teens I've always managed to find and create for myself music-related projects, I put hundreds (if not thousands) of hours into practice of my craft and sometimes, sacrifised other areas of life (school, social) to work on my music. Nothing makes me happier than music and I'm happy with the choices that I made.

Coronavirus really messed up my country and I found myself rethinking the career choice that seemed obvious to me til now. Yes, people need art. I know that because of the hugh importance art had in my life. The music I created also never shied away from political subjects. But art won't feed pepole. It won't right injustices or make the world more peaceful.

I've been thinking of choosing a career that helps people in a more direct way. Maybe follow the steps of my social worker sister, maybe, since I'm spending the next two years doing civillian service (an army service alternative in countries with conscription, basically voulenteering somewhere for two years), I'll spend that time trying to realize what I can do in our local LGBTQ and human rights organizations. Maybe, in an older age, I'll try getting involved in local politics because I swear that the authorities do nothing about inequality in our town. I know I can have music as a hobby, and I probably would, but it wouldn't be the same.

377,"This is a throwaway account, and my first post. I'm writing this on a phone, so excuse the formatting.

I'm a 17 M (almost 18). I have been procrastinating things for longer than I can remember. It's like it has been inscribed in my personality now. School was not that big a problem since I'm an above average person, intellect wise (I think). I have always been this guy who finishes the tasks just before the deadline, never starting well before it's late. I always think that I'll execute the plans I make  better the next time, but the next time never comes. It's like it's a continuous cycle of me disappointing myself and the others. I don't think I have ever achieved anything to my actual potential. It's like I make half assed attempts to somehow get through things, I end up getting through most of them, but there's always this feeling of regret that I could have done better, a lot better. 
I don't really care about what others think of me, but I feel bad for my parents. They literally are the perfect folks you could ask for... understanding, supportive , always put me and my sibling before themselves, and etc. Even though this almost second nature of mine has not caused any problems academics-wise, it takes a toll on my mental well being. I know that I'm just 17 and that there's a long road ahead, but this tendency of mine scares me shirtless. It's like I'm watching myself destroy my own life. Even though I know what to do and how to do it, I can't do anything. Tomorrow never comes for me. It feels like I'm laying on a bed watching someone trying to kill me and I can't lift a finger, and guess what, that someone's me. 
 While there have been a select few failures, I don't feel any remorse at all?! I can't understand my own behaviour. While there were no academic problems, I went through one hell of a ride emotionally. About 8-9 months back before my 12th std  boards, I went into this immensely gloomy phase for a couple months maybe. (For the Westerners out there, 12th boards are the final exam for High School Seniors? or  equivalent). I don't think I was depressed (I think depression's more severe and long term), but the counselor (therapist) diagnosed it as Anxiety leading to depressive episodes. Depressive episodes that would consist of a lot of self-loathing thoughts and intent to go ahead with the next step (I won't go into much detail, since it could be triggering for some). There was no self harm involved and I was normal-ish three months later. The reason again being my inability to act on my problems. It's like I am trying to not let the sand slip out of my palm. 

Thankfully there were no severe repercussions, and since  my parents were really supportive (which apparently a bit rare for Indian parents), I did well in the exam and got into one of the  the best colleges there is (in my field).

But, I have returned to the se tendencies again. I go on disappointing myself again and again and it's a continuous cycle I feel. One of the reasons I did well previously (college) was that I was lucky (It was a close shave and everything could have gone to shit). It might feel like Academics are the only important thing in my life, but that ain't the case. My behaviour severely affects other aspects of my life too including the people who care for me, and that makes me feel guilty. But then again, I can't do anything to change this. It's just I feel really weak, and overpowered by my own actions, if that makes any sense.

I know it's been a really long post, and I am really thankful  if you have read it in its entirety. It's just that I'm worried for my future (since the decisions I make now are going to have 'real' and long lasting consequences). Also, I feel bad for my folks. Two of the most self-loathing thoughts that came to me in my 'down period' were that my parents deserved better and that the would be better off without me.

I feel like recently there is something my gf is hiding from me, even though she tells me she loves me and wants to marry me etc. We are so similar and alike but I feel like 90% of our conversations are about other guys. All the guys she follows, guys that dm her, guys that shout Pervy things in the street while we FaceTime and even guys she sees when she’s out and about. She’s always mentioning guys.  


I’m not an insecure or jealous guy but I feel like it’s all she talks about. I have brought it up with her the other day but she still does it. I feel like it’s something she just does. Anyway a situation happened where we said at the start of the relationship that we don’t mind if we like other people’s pictures on Instagram etc. So I liked a few girls pictures who are people I know and we are kinda friends. She obv stalked and saw and started following loads of girls I follow. She then brought it up with me and said she doesn’t like it. But I went on her page and saw she likes other guys pictures. When I said she can’t have it both ways she kept denying she liked other guys pictures. But then she went on the guys page and unliked all his pictures and then she was shoving her phone in my face to show her innocence.  


Now like I say, I know insta is a joke and liking pics don’t bother me, but it’s the fact she lied about liking other guys pics and got mad at me for it and then proceeded to clear the evidence even though I am onto her. She also had 2 other Instagram pages where she pretends to be a internet troll and she prank calls loads of guys. I know that some of these guys she calls are people she used to talk to and possibly even dated idk.  


There’s just a lot of red flags that I’ve tried to ignore and I haven’t brought up my frustrations with the other stuff cos she’ll just deny it as well and say I shouldn’t worry.

So I’ve just moved into uni 2 weeks ago and pretty much every night my 2 flatmates and our other friend from uni just play some stupid pranks on me pretty much every night we go drinking. 

They are just small harmless pranks like moving all my food and shampoo around the flat for me to find in the morning. 

But recently the past few days I’ve been feeling really sad and down (due to some serious family stuff) so I haven’t been drinking as much and been having early nights instead of going out to parties with my mates. 

All my flatmates know I’ve been down recently and know that I’ve actually got some real shit going on (pretty much ended up crying myself to sleep the other night) but they’re still just taking the piss every night although they know I’m not in the mood and it’s not a good time to play stupid little pranks on me.

The only real problem I have with these pranks is that they only play them on me for some reason, they’ve never moved anyone else’s shit or anything of the sort.

Not sure what to do-I may just explain I’ve been really struggling with family stuff and I just want them to not touch my things for a bit.

386,"This is a throwaway account, and my first post. I'm writing this on a phone, so excuse the formatting.

I'm a 17 M (almost 18). I have been procrastinating things for longer than I can remember. It's like it has been inscribed in my personality now. School was not that big a problem since I'm an above average person, intellect wise (I think). I have always been this guy who finishes the tasks just before the deadline, never starting well before it's late. I always think that I'll execute the plans I make  better the next time, but the next time never comes. It's like it's a continuous cycle of me disappointing myself and the others. I don't think I have ever achieved anything to my actual potential. It's like I make half assed attempts to somehow get through things, I end up getting through most of them, but there's always this feeling of regret that I could have done better, a lot better. 
I don't really care about what others think of me, but I feel bad for my parents. They literally are the perfect folks you could ask for... understanding, supportive , always put me and my sibling before themselves, and etc. Even though this almost second nature of mine has not caused any problems academics-wise, it takes a toll on my mental well being. I know that I'm just 17 and that there's a long road ahead, but this tendency of mine scares me shirtless. It's like I'm watching myself destroy my own life. Even though I know what to do and how to do it, I can't do anything. Tomorrow never comes for me. It feels like I'm laying on a bed watching someone trying to kill me and I can't lift a finger, and guess what, that someone's me. 
 While there have been a select few failures, I don't feel any remorse at all?! I can't understand my own behaviour. While there were no academic problems, I went through one hell of a ride emotionally. About 8-9 months back before my 12th std  boards, I went into this immensely gloomy phase for a couple months maybe. (For the Westerners out there, 12th boards are the final exam for High School Seniors? or  equivalent). I don't think I was depressed (I think depression's more severe and long term), but the counselor (therapist) diagnosed it as Anxiety leading to depressive episodes. Depressive episodes that would consist of a lot of self-loathing thoughts and intent to go ahead with the next step (I won't go into much detail, since it could be triggering for some). There was no self harm involved and I was normal-ish three months later. The reason again being my inability to act on my problems. It's like I am trying to not let the sand slip out of my palm. 

Thankfully there were no severe repercussions, and since  my parents were really supportive (which apparently a bit rare for Indian parents), I did well in the exam and got into one of the  the best colleges there is (in my field).

But, I have returned to the se tendencies again. I go on disappointing myself again and again and it's a continuous cycle I feel. One of the reasons I did well previously (college) was that I was lucky (It was a close shave and everything could have gone to shit). It might feel like Academics are the only important thing in my life, but that ain't the case. My behaviour severely affects other aspects of my life too including the people who care for me, and that makes me feel guilty. But then again, I can't do anything to change this. It's just I feel really weak, and overpowered by my own actions, if that makes any sense.

I know it's been a really long post, and I am really thankful  if you have read it in its entirety. It's just that I'm worried for my future (since the decisions I make now are going to have 'real' and long lasting consequences). Also, I feel bad for my folks. Two of the most self-loathing thoughts that came to me in my 'down period' were that my parents deserved better and that the would be better off without me.

396,"Hey guys, so I'm a 18 year old computer science university student (in my 1st year, 2nd semester). I have people around me who are much more financially literate/have been doing more than I have. I still live with my Asian parents (in Australia), and I feel like I haven't done much.

I know a friend who has learnt to invest in stocks and build flyer miles to fly business class holidays when he was 17 and I feel so useless for not starting earlier (I've started looking into miles now, but I wish I could've done so sooner as I've always loved aviation travel and finding ways to fly high)

I even know fellow 1st year university students who have been actively participating for big companies and it bothers me thinking that I'm basically just a heads-in-books person who hasn't participated much.

I feel like my dad makes excuses to keep my head in the books and I'm still restricted on who/where/what I do. He'd probably even get pissed at me for applying for my OWN credit card/building miles without his permission (even though it's something I've always wanted to do and still earn from helping and working).

Yes, I prioritise my education and want to climb up the ladder, but I feel like I haven't done anything to build myself or do anything to broaden up my other skills and talents. I've worked in retail for a couple months and occasionally help my parent's business, but that's it.

I've hardly had any opportunity to volunteer or do any extra-curriculars after high school (both due to COVID and strict dad) and I feel like aside from my academics, I got nothing else to offer.

397,"(Title seems weird.)  
Hello! So there's something that bothers me and I feel kind of ashamed of.

I easily sweat a lot when I'm nervous and that makes me ""smell through"" my deodorants quickly. Washing the armpits with soft soap (advised by my dermatologist) twice a day. Shaving the hair away so there's only very little if at all. Still, deodorants labeled with 24 or even 48 hours usually only last about 15 hours max and after that I start smelling. Some clothes make it worse so I try to avoid close-fitting things and also some materials. I prefer using perfume only when I feel like it.

Furthermore, my skin ist very sensitive so I need to take care of that as well :(

I've tried with an antiperspirant and it worked great until my skin started acting up like crazy. After researching about it I got a bit worried about the aluminium in it which is under suspicion of causing breast cancer. That's why I'd prefer deodorant instead (which makes me sweat more again - ahhhh!).

My goal would be to feel and smell fresh for at least 24 hours so I don't have to worry all the time D:

Could you share your own experiences and tips? I've read about [nuud](https://nuudcare.us/) but the reviews are either ""works perfectly"" or ""doesn't help at all"". Not sure if I should test that or if it would stress out my skin even more .\_.

My boyfriend and I have an incredibly special bond and I always cherish our moments together. But lately I have been considering that I do not feel the same way as I did once, however, I think this is completely normal, though.

When we met, we were very young and had no responsibilities or a care in life, but as years passed and we both got more serious (about life), and got jobs, responsibilities, etc... We're not meant to feel the same way, right? There is still love in our relationship but we're not going to have butterflies in our stomach everytime we see each other like we did once. As a relationship progresses feelings change, but as long as there is love, admiration, and respect things can work out and a couple can still be incredibly happy and have a healthy relationship.

403,"Reposting because I got no response last time.

Hi, I am an 18 year old girl from Sweden. Just wanna put a TW since this has mentions of rape &amp; pedophilia, and sorry for bad formatting since in on mobile. When I was 11 me &amp; my best friend  (W, same age) at the time would hang out with kinda bad people. (people who smoked &amp; drank, skipped school, basically troubled kids like us) and most of them were older than us. There was this 16 year old guy, let’s call him N. I thought that hanging out with older guys was the coolest thing ever at that time, being a naive &amp; damaged 11 year old with low self esteem. Anyways, me &amp; N started “dating” at one point. I was 11 and he was 16. I didn’t think it was wrong back then, I just thought it was cool to be with an older guy. One time me &amp; him planned to have sex, I went over to his house and we did some things but we didn’t actually have sex, thank god. I broke up with him a few days after that. A few years later I had heard from W that N had raped two girls (I think it’s 3 now) and I thought it was horrible, but I was in my early teens and didn’t really think anymore of it. I hadn’t thought of it in a long time until a few months ago, and I remembered all that he did including being with me when i was underage. I anonymously reported him to the police( I have done that twice now) but didn’t expect much of it and I didn’t know what else to do since I don’t have any proof of anything he has done. I saw him today which is what made me write this post. I just want him dead or in jail. I don’t know the girls he have raped personally, and I don’t think it’s a good idea to reach out to them. I heard from one of my friends that he raped one of his friends sisters and that he also apparently does or sells drugs now, but again, no proof. Please tell me what to do. How do I get him in jail? When I saw him I got so mad and just wanted to glock him right there lol, but I don’t wanna get into trouble &amp; I don’t want him to know I’m getting back at him.

405,"I’m 18M, during my first year of uni in Australia. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really enjoying it and making friends, but I’m never doing the things that you should be doing in the 18-25 year old phase of your life. I don’t go partying or clubbing or gambling. I don’t make dumb decisions and end up with great stories. I don’t have wild nights. I don’t do anything.

I don’t even know how it ended up like this. I’m a social guy, I love to talk to people and to make friends and was popular in high school, went to parties and what not. 

But it feels like my life has stagnated and I don’t know what to do.

I think this is partly due to the fact that I’ve just grown away from all of my high schools friends, unfortunately I was one of those guys who was friends with everyone and good friends with no one, which has left me with a severe lack of a social circle in 2nd phase of my life. 

I hope in part that it’s just do the online learning and a lack of social interaction, but deep down I know nothing would be different if covid never happened at all.

In the last couple of months i think my life, my body and my relationships became worse and worse and I am not really mad about it i guess. I am a 18 year old male virgin who lives in Istanbul. Before the pandemic life was at best ok. I sucked at school but had a lot of cool friends who helped me. I went to highschool partys and had gf from time to time (they broke up with me usually after only 4 weeks of dating). I had arguments with my parents quite often but we got along most of the time  but after the virus my life started to deteriorate. Fast. Obviously partys stopped and by the start of the pandemic I didn't have a gf unlike most of my friends. I had a argument with a close friend of mine at the start of the pandemic because he was treating the rest of the group like shit. And because of reasons I am not going to explain all other guys sided with him.(they said they wanted to be neutral but kept talking to him and playing games while they ignored me). This thing hit me big time. I am a sensitive guy and I value my friends a lot. Maybe too much. I slowed down my studies and this made my mom very mad. We had big fights because of this and even our neighbours heard us shouting. To feel happy again i started to eat more. I smoked cigarettes. I was 90kg when pandemic started now I am 95kg. I had red scares on my body (2 years ago I gained a lot of weight in a short span of time and red scares came out near my belly button which is not good for a 16 year old) these scares that l mentioned have GROWN now and they are a turn off to girls. I don't really care about them but they are becoming a bigger issue in my life. Life turned into a shit hole but thinks started to look up after a month. I patched things up with my friend and were in good relations now. He came up to me and said he was sorry. I did the same. I am back on my friend group. I started to work more and more so mom and dad were pleased. I started to do better in exams. I made new friends in my cram school and they are all really nice to me. Everything is looking up expect my body and girls. This is a now a year without a gf for me. I masturbate every fucking day and literally feel like shit afterwards. My body looks like a barrel and I hate it. I was a loser before that 80 percent of my school thinks I am a fat idiot. But now i think the same too. There are good things and bad things in my life right now but i can't manage to fix the bad ones. Every time I decide to lose weight I fail gloriously. I literally beg my friend to talk to his gf so that the gf can find a girl for me.( he is a real Chad so he helps me out but I now this isn't right) so I came here. Reddit. I need your advice to lose weight and find a girlfriend while in a global pandemic. If you have any questions please do ask. If you want to criticise me please do.

I’m 16 and have been working a part time job for over a year now and have received little to none of my money from my checks. My mom puts all of the money into a bank account that I don’t even know how much I have in. Anytime I’ve ever asked for money she will only give me around 30$ from a well over $300 check. I’m not asking for the full $300 ish but I don’t like walking around with no money. And I have been asking for my debit card now and every time I do she either dodges the question or asks what I could possibly need money for.

424,"My dad is emotional abusive. He uses fear as a way to control me and get his way with me. He's a conspiracy theorist and he knows him talking about his theories triggers my anxiety. He talks about it on purpose because he knows I turn to him when my I have a panic attack. He makes bad, depriciative comments about some of my clothes. He's gaslighted me about him hitting me when I was younger, which still gives me panic attacks. He yells so much, even thought I have told him I don't like him yelling. When I talk about my feelings towards something with him, he just blames my feelings on me being over dramatic and too sensitive. But when we are with other people, he treats me like a trophy. Saying how I'm such a good girl, how I'm such a nice person, how I don't drink, how I don't smoke, don't do drugs, have ""meh grades"" (even though my grades are mostly B and As, by the American system) and he puts his arm around my shoulders and treats me like his pride and joy. This year I started realizing how toxic he is, and a few months ago I read an article on emotional abuse and I most of the points fit. I did some more research and I came to the conclusion.
He doesn't allow me to go to a therapist. And the worst part is that most people think yelling at their kids is normal, at least in my country. If I told people about how he behaves, they just think he's an overprotective father. My own mom took my dad's side saying: ""oh when you have kids you'll yell at them too.""
I am in the darkest place I've been in a long time. It's not normal to have panic attacks because of your dad. It's not normal to cry this much because of your dad. It's not normal to be afraid of your dad.

I'm currently in a bad financial state. I'm a Med student, so you already know the cost of my education. Though I have money to eat and to live in a doorm, I don't want to financially challenge my parents when it comes to paying off that student loan. 

Because of my college I can't work as a waitress or something, because all my time has to go in studying. 

So, my wish is to try and put myself through college by selling feet pics. That is not the only way I plan on earning money but it is quickest way for now. 

I have a few questions, so if you guys could please be kind and answer me (if you are experienced in that area) and I would be eternally grateful.

1. Does this job have any risks (as in: can someone use those pics to do something illegal/bad?)
2. Is instagram a good platform to do so or is there another, better, platform?
3. When it comes to payment, is it risky or safe to use my Paypal/Visa/Mastercard account (as in: can someone steal money off that account if I put information about it)?

Thank you very much in advance.",03Oct2020,1
428,"I started working as a freelance content writer, writing topics about my country, for someone from Belgium. He pays me 15$ an hour and didn’t have any problem with that, but he asked me for many weird things that make me feel suspicious, for example, last year when i first got the job, he asked me for a physical exam (blood test) and also eye, dental exam saying that this is a normal procedure for any freelance student in Belgium, and now it’s been a year, he is asking for a new one. He also asked me once to make a short survey about the topics I studied in university back then and its grades, like a self evaluation. He asked me for a schedule about the countries I visited in Europe and how long i stayed in each.

Doesn’t it sound weird? If he didn’t pay I would know for sure it’s scam. I must say that he has other freelance students working for him from my country(Palestine). Is it possible that he is asking for these things for a study/survey? Should I not send him anything?",03Oct2020,1

434,"I am going to preface my major life decision by giving you guys a little context in light of my situation: 

I am 20 years old, living with my parents. I work in a car dealership as the sales &amp; marketing consultant. I take care of social media marketing and lead development. I’ve graduated from a college in business management marketing. Here in Quebec we have schooling called cégep in between high school and university. 

When covid rolled around I decided I would finish my cégep academics and take a break of one year to work until online schooling would cease. Unfortunately I’ve realized I do not have the personal discipline to do well in academics when I’m studying from home. Online school is not built for my lifestyle. I informed my parents that I wouldn’t be going to school for at least a year. To no surprise m’y heavily education driven parents were quite unhappy. It caused a stir but eventually they realized I wasn’t budging so they agreed. 

Now, this car dealership is owned by close family relatives. My father discussed with the owner (his cousin) that under no circumstance was I allowed to work anymore than 6 months. As aforementioned you’ll notice I had decided a year off. It’s important to preface that my parents never agreed to 1 year but I felt as though they never disagreed either. Which ment, when I spoke to my cousin about 1 year he agreed and assumed I had convinced my father. I have full intention with no second thought to keep my word and go back to school in September. 

Last night my parents and I (mostly my father) had a massive argument about wether I was going back to university in January or September. It blew up and caused me to have a massive emotional break down in front of them. We have to note that from my perspective I was working for a year, therefor I planned a multitude of things related to investments and bettering my financial situation. From my fathers perspective I was working a semester. So, the argument exploded in the end. 

M’y father shouted louder than I’ve ever seen, an obvious reaction to his anger towards the fact that he never graduated and I putting that pressure on me. He ended the conversation by saying I have three options. 

1. Work and pay rent 
2. Go to university 
3. The street

437,"Throwaway account here. I’m currently doing university homework on my friend’s couch. 

So last night, while I sat in the kitchen, my parents came in and starting preparing for dinner. My dad mentioned to me that Trump had COVID and started venting to me that some people were making memes that he was going to die. He said that “in no other presidency did people hate are president so violently.” So I told him that there were presidents in the past who were literally assassinated. He got agitated and started venting how Obama didn’t have to deal with this, so I told him that Obama didn’t use inflammatory language like Trump. My mom joined the conversation, and while responded to her, my dad started screaming at me that I was being disrespectful for interrupting. My mom went upstairs and my dad started yelling about things that were off-topic. He told me that I’m too bias because I’m always critical about Trump and that I’m never critical about Biden, so I told him that we were literally having a conversation about Trump and that we could have a conversation about Biden. I said that I didn’t like how creepy he was towards woman and how and how he opposed bussing for desegregation in the 1970s. But then, my dad cut me off and yelled that he didn’t want to talk about Biden and said that I should change. I asked how. He screamed that he didn’t want me to change but that I should change. I told him to stop yelling, of course he said that he wasn’t yelling. I told him that he just forgot his argument as he was yelling and to look at himself. He was pacing around the kitchen and screaming at me while I was sitting down the entire time. Then he started making personal attacks at me and said that I was screaming (in fairness I was really was yelling). He said that I’m angry all the time and that he’s tired of me (this isn’t true, before last night, I was his favorite because I had never engaged in arguments with him like my siblings). This was the first time that I had ever raised my voice at him in the 19 years I’ve been alive. My mom came downstairs and told him to calm down. He made another personal jab about how I should speak as I was leaving the room. I turned around and screamed: “How am I supposed to react? Am I supposed to just take this crap? I’m yelling because I’ve matched your energy. How am I supposed to respond?” 

I went upstairs where my mom was watching television because she wanted to be with me. My dad came upstairs and stood in front of me and said: “I’m going to take a shower and you’re not going to be here when I get out.” He was referring to me leaving the room (I think). 

So I went downstairs to our living room. My mom asked if she could watch tv while I did homework. I asked her what I was supposed to do and recounted the entire conversation to her. I pointed out that if I brought home a boy and he spoke to me like my dad just did, he’d get turned out of the house and they’d call him abusive. I pointed out how this was how my dad treated my brother, they have an altercation like this every other, if not every, week. I asked her if this was how I should let men treat me. My mom told me that he’s be angry for a little while and then he’d apologize. Then I asked her if that wouldn’t happen and she had nothing to say. I talked about how my dad started an argument with a political bias, but then accused me of always being biased towards Biden. As he was walking down the stairs, I told my mom that “he’s a hypocrite, and I’m talking about my own father, not Trump.” 

My friend said that I could stay with him via text, so I got up from that conversation, packed a backpack with my laptop and chargers and drove 40 minutes to stay with him. My boyfriend visited me and I explained the situation. And now I’ve woken up on a couch. My mom texted me saying that she missed me and that she wants to get things resolved. Apparently my dad is out of the house and still thinks that he’s right. I told her that I didn’t care if he thinks he’s right and that he shouldn’t talk to me the way that he did. Then she told me that a family friend (a financially stable Christian family friend) offered for me to stay at their house. However, I’m skeptical because my parents, including my dad, are very close friends with them. To assume that they’d monitor me like big brother would actually be inside the realm of possibility. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel guilty for letting myself get agitated to the point of screaming. This is where the immediate story ends, so if anyone could offer any guidance, it would truly be a blessing. 

If it may help to get a better picture of what’s happening, here’s some further background information:

* My dad immigrated from a war torn country as a 10 year old
* He’s served on active duty in the US army and has toured Europe 
* He’s finished a year at army war college and is in the process of getting a higher chain of command (he’s used to yelling at my mom to yell at my siblings and I as a form of discipline)
* My parents moved across the states from the rest of my family in Texas to Ohio, therefore, I don’t have a cousin or aunt that I can crash with unless I feel like hopping on a plane 
* I’m completely financially dependent
* My father is a multimillionaire and I still have a joint bank account with my parents
* He can easily drain all of my accounts because, for the most part, my money is truly his
* I was given his VA benefits to help pay for my college studies (they pay half of my tuition and give me money for room and board, but I’m on my last year with the program)
* As a child, he would scream a lot and I would just take it (e.g. he screamed at me for being curious about professions other than law when I was 11 and screamed at me for wanting to learn Mandarin in middle school)
* He approves of my Film major because I’m also double-majoring in English (a back-up for law) because he believes that I’ll fail to get into the industry. 
* Our family just lost my grandmother (my dad’a mom) a month ago
* I’ve been overwhelmed with 18 credit hours of online classes
* I hardly have time to work my part-time job

438,"So we have been dating for 6 months. We had a huge fight a month ago because she felt like I didn’t support her enough. We argued but the following days we were actually starting to talk and having small dates. Trying to recover but then I bought her a gift as I always do when we get upset and she felt like I was buying her forgiveness. It was a week ago.. we talked and she said she needs space and she has to think if this relationship is moving forward or not.
Ps: I’m going away for 2 weeks so at minimum she will only talk to me in after those 2 weeks.. I wanted to talk in person before that she says she has to put herself first now and just think what’s best..

441,"
I’m going to preface this by saying sorry for the long post but I don’t know where else to go for advice, I’ve never had a father and my grandad died when I was young so I don’t have any male in my life to give me some good man-advice. I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to read this because I feel like I’m going to explode if I don’t get some opinions or conversation about this ha-ha. 

So I’m a 20 year old guy, going into my third year of college and do pretty well in school, have a good job (Apple) and have a pretty good life (besides my dad leaving and my stepdad being an addict but that’s not to do with my problem). 

I have a girlfriend who I have been with for over two and a half years and have been living with her for about just over two (we got together just after our final exams of school). I’m going to be completely honest in this because I want to paint a complete picture. She’s really great, we have so much in common, she’s funny, smart and kind and me and her family have such a close bond that I’m basically part of the family. 

She’s not attractive really but that’s not why I fell in love with her, it was for her personality and how we clicked, she’s overweight and doesn’t have a traditionally attractive face by any means but it never bothered me because she made me happy. 

But since last December I just haven’t been completely happy in the relationship, I don’t find her attractive at all anymore and my sex drive towards her is non-existent, I actually go out of my way to avoid sex with her. The actual relationship itself is still really good we still get along like a house on fire but that is the only problem, I do not have any attraction towards her at all. 

To complicate the situation, going into my second year of college last year my friend group started becoming friends with a girl who is in my same degree. I started chatting to her in college just in a friendly way and we became friends and as she was friends with mine, we hung around a lot. The only problem is I think I’m completely head over heels for this girl. She is without a doubt the most beautiful woman I have ever seen; she is really funny and nice and completely my type personality and looks wise and we have quite a lot in common. Now I need to mention the fact that I would never,ever,ever cheat on my partner, I was cheated on before and its soul-crushing, so don’t think that I got any ideas. 

But I really don’t know what to do, I have developed feelings for this girl since last December and they only got stronger and stronger up until around march and I have a feeling she shares them at least somewhat. Because of lockdown I didn’t see her for around six months so tried to reject the feelings I had and ignore them and it worked for a while and my and my partner got on ok during summer, I was actually considering breaking up in February. But now that college is back these feelings have come flooding back. 

The thing that’s stopping me from breaking up with my girlfriend is what we’ve built together, we live together, our families are great friends and I’m great friends with her brothers and uncles, we get on great and I know that if we didn’t break up we would last for a long time. But I have been quite unhappy in it because of the lack of attraction coupled with my feelings for this other girl. But I am scared that if I break it off with my girlfriend that it’ll be a massive mistake, maybe this other girl doesn’t feel the same way, maybe she’s completely not for me and it wouldn’t work out. Also down the line when I do settle down what if the family doesn’t get along with me as well as my current girlfriends do and I threw it all away because of my feelings for another girl. These are just some worries I have. My girlfriend has no idea of my thoughts on this and thinks everything’s ok. 

I really don’t know what to do, any advice would be welcome. I don’t want to break my partners heart but I don’t know if I can ignore my feelings.",03Oct2020,1

443,"I have this friend who's going through a rough time with her mental health right now. Right now, she lives a state away from me, so I don't talk to her in person. She's done very questionable and shady things concerning me and my friends in the past (asked our friends what they would do if she killed herself even though she was never planning to, gossiped about me and other friends, talked about her private sex life with her now-ex-boyfriend in graphic detail without his permission, etc.). 

I admit that over the years I've known her I've given her a lot of chances that she probably didn't deserve because of how long we've been best friends. I broke things off because of her drug habits (smoked weed even though it's illegal in her state) and refusal to take quarantine seriously (she's still going to parties, going on dates, and having sex with people; she's only 15 years old) pretty recently.  But I decided to reach out to her again and let her know she can contact me or my mom if she needs help with anything and we started talking again. 

She told me she was quitting smoking and that she was talking to a guy but believed it wouldn't be a good idea to date right now with her mental health. Well, that didn't last very long. She told us a few hours after that she was going to keep smoking but make sure her dad knew when she was doing it (??). She's using weed but not medication for her mental illnesses. She doesn't a card that would permit her to get medical marijuana and uses it pretty much solely for recreation. She also told us a day after we talked that she was going on a date with the guy but he was ""different"" from every guy she's ever dated (she says this a lot).

Well, long story short, I was tired of doing this again and again and told her exactly what I thought of this ""different"" guy that she's talked to for a week and told her I was sick of her lying to me. She told me she's never lied to me and that I was the one causing problems in our relationship. I told her she was insane and that I was just going to mute the conversation and leave. She didn't say anything after that.

Is it even worth it to text her again? Should I apologize for what I said? I admit it wasn't the nicest way of putting it at all. Is it even worth it to try to maintain this relationship?",03Oct2020,1

This year has been really chaotic and a mess for me. One of the most important people in my life died a few months ago and I've been struggling to keep everything together. I'm considering this b/c of my mental health, I've started crying at work which is really embarrassing. I'm working 15 hour shifts with 3 hours of sleep because I can't sleep anymore. I'm falling behind schoolwork and have to keep asking professors for extensions.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm burned out from my current position as a cashier. There has been an obscene amount of drama and toxicity between management and other co-workers/bosses that directly affects my workflow. (Can't get sidework finished when two people leave before they should to ""punish"" their boss so I have to deal with lines of customers. Because of this I've gotten yelled at by a couple customers for the wait time and ended up crying) and we are working with a skeleton crew so I have been working 15 hour shifts a few times a week.

I'm not worried about how I'll pay for school because I receive aid from the gov. to pay for it. When lay offs happened in the beginning of covid, my partner was able to relax on unemployment for 3 months before they found another job. I really want a chance to relax too.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that makes me hesitate is my partner saying that while they support me, they like my schedule with my current job because it works with their schedule (we only have one car but even then I'm fine with uber while I save for a car) and the fact that people are struggling to find jobs during this time.

446," 

First off, months ago my mom told me a story about my learning issues growing up, or more so, my lack of motivation for doing basic things.

When I was three/four, I knew how to speak. I just didn't want to because...why speak when you can get everything you want by simply pointing, right? My mom took me to this doctor and apparently I was written off as lazy and I needed to be encouraged to speak more, which worked but I was still never a talkative child. If anything, I enjoyed making random noises.

Then when I did speak, maybe around 5 and on up, I needed reward systems to do the simplest things. Like cleaning my room, or making a good grade, or simply to enjoy something that I never wanted to do in the first place. Like, to continuously sleep in my own bed/clean my room, I promised that a new tv in my room would solve it. Of course that didn't work but I got a tv and didn't have to wait until Christmas to get it. This sort of thing happened continuously and it was the easiest route to get what I wanted and simply motivated me.

I never truly enjoyed much. I was happy but nothing ever truly connected where my happiness was at a constant. I'd get something and throw it away afterwards because the enjoyment of having it wore off and I seeked a new high.

In high school, anxiety, depression and the inability to focus had completely came in. Lack of organizational skills. Everything I touched just became a mess, literally. I was on meds and nothing seemed to have worked. I found hobbies only to realize that I wasn't good at them only after trying once, and just stopped doing them all together. I felt numb about a lot of things and was hard to manipulate situations, if I'm being honest. I couldn't move things the way that I wanted and felt pushed into a corner. It was not a happy time for me.

In college. I never fully had the idea panned out until one morning, after graduating High school, my mom woke me up to apply to my nearest CC. I picked the closest thing I was good at within the 10 minute time span. During the Bio courses, I realized that I had an idealization of dreaming about what I could be and how I would do it yet, the motivation never settled in. I got bored easily. Couldn't focus. The classes demanded a lot and I wasn't given anything in return, and it was a lot easier to cheat or have someone else do the work for me. I'm going on age 22 and I'm still in college for some reason. Today I have assignments due and realized that I don't want to do them at all! I would drop them if the money I spent wasn't looming over my head. I don't care, much about anything. I just like taking an easier route just as I do for everything else.

My father and his side is just like this but my mothers side of the family is completely different. A lot of my fathers family are criminals because they like easy, fast, bunches of money, they're very emotionally aloof, take easiest routes of everything and just cold people in general. I did something at a place I won't reveal that was a federal offense and luckily, I was just let go. It involved money and I was tired of putting in stress, and spending hours I felt like being alone, to do something I never really wanted to do, and being paid low wage for it... if you know what I did then, you get the drift.

I have no idea why I'm like this, but I am. I've tried to do things the right way, go through the processes, but I cannot operate that way at all! I hate processes. If there's an easier way to do things, I will do them. If there's a shortcut, I'll take it, even if it means deceiving others",03Oct2020,1
447,"I'm at a crossroads with my manager at work. My phone is having issues since I dropped it in the toilet which to my benefit kept me from receiving over 5 calls and text messages on every social media platform last night about whether I could work today because they really really need my help. I’m a university student who just had a concussion from surfing earlier this week, both of which she knows about. On one hand, I'm willing to work part of the day, but on the other I'm feeling coerced in a way or like she's trying to guilt trip me. If I give her a hard no, I don't know if my conscience can handle that feeling of letting everyone else down, but if I say yes, I'm taking a chunk of my day away that I was planning on using for cleaning my apartment before mom comes in tomorrow, being with my dog, and doing schoolwork.

448,"I'm a 25yo man, college post graduate. I haven't even ever touched a girl, forget kissing or having sex. From the last few months I've had an urge to have sex with any beautiful women i see, if they're older than me. I'm unable to help myself and i think I'm becoming a bad person having these lusty feelings. After watching most of the movies and adult films and porns I've been having very wild fantasies at night (including threesome with another man and woman)

449,"Throwaway account here, hopefully this post won’t get removed.  I’m currently doing university homework on my friend’s couch. 

So last night, while I sat in the kitchen, my parents came in and starting preparing for dinner. My dad mentioned to me that Trump had COVID and started venting to me that some people were making memes that he was going to die. He said that “in no other presidency did people hate are president so violently.” So I told him that there were presidents in the past who were literally assassinated. He got agitated and started venting how Obama didn’t have to deal with this, so I told him that Obama didn’t use inflammatory language like Trump. My mom joined the conversation, and while responded to her, my dad started screaming at me that I was being disrespectful for interrupting. 

My mom went upstairs and my dad started yelling about things that were off-topic. He told me that I’m too bias because I’m always critical about Trump and that I’m never critical about Biden, so I told him that we were literally having a conversation about Trump and that we could have a conversation about Biden. I said that I didn’t like how creepy he was towards woman and how and how he opposed bussing for desegregation in the 1970s. But then, my dad cut me off and yelled that he didn’t want to talk about Biden and said that I should change. I asked how. He screamed that he didn’t want me to change but that I should change. I told him to stop yelling, of course he said that he wasn’t yelling. I told him that he just forgot his argument as he was yelling and to look at himself. He was pacing around the kitchen and screaming at me while I was sitting down the entire time. 

Then he started making personal attacks at me and said that I was screaming (in fairness I was really was yelling). He said that I’m angry all the time and that he’s tired of me (this isn’t true, before last night, I was his favorite because I had never engaged in arguments with him like my siblings). This was the first time that I had ever raised my voice at him in the 19 years I’ve been alive. My mom came downstairs and told him to calm down. He made another personal jab about how I should speak as I was leaving the room. I turned around and screamed: “How am I supposed to react? Am I supposed to just take this crap? I’m yelling because I’ve matched your energy. How am I supposed to respond?” 

I went upstairs where my mom was watching television because she wanted to be with me. My dad came upstairs and stood in front of me and said: “I’m going to take a shower and you’re not going to be here when I get out.” He was referring to me leaving the room (I think). 

So I went downstairs to our living room. My mom asked if she could watch tv while I did homework. I asked her what I was supposed to do and recounted the entire conversation to her. I pointed out that if I brought home a boy and he spoke to me like my dad just did, he’d get turned out of the house and they’d call him abusive. I pointed out how this was how my dad treated my brother, they have an altercation like this every other, if not every, week. I asked her if this was how I should let men treat me. My mom told me that he’s be angry for a little while and then he’d apologize. Then I asked her if that wouldn’t happen and she had nothing to say. I talked about how my dad started an argument with a political bias, but then accused me of always being biased towards Biden. As he was walking down the stairs, I told my mom that “he’s a hypocrite, and I’m talking about my own father, not Trump.” 

My friend said that I could stay with him via text, so I got up from that conversation, packed a backpack with my laptop and chargers and drove 40 minutes to stay with him. My boyfriend visited me and I explained the situation. And now I’ve woken up on a couch. My mom texted me saying that she missed me and that she wants to get things resolved. Apparently my dad is out of the house and still thinks that he’s right. I told her that I didn’t care if he thinks he’s right and that he shouldn’t talk to me the way that he did. Then she told me that a family friend (a financially stable Christian family friend) offered for me to stay at their house. However, I’m skeptical because my parents, including my dad, are very close friends with them. To assume that they’d monitor me like big brother would actually be inside the realm of possibility. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel guilty for letting myself get agitated to the point of screaming. This is where the immediate story ends, so if anyone could offer any guidance, it would truly be a blessing. 

If it may help to get a better picture of what’s happening, here’s some further background information:

* My dad immigrated from a war torn country as a 10 year old
* He’s served on active duty in the US army and has toured Europe 
* He’s finished a year at army war college and is in the process of getting a higher chain of command (he’s used to yelling at my mom to yell at my siblings and I as a form of discipline)
* My parents moved across the states from the rest of my family in Texas to Ohio, therefore, I don’t have a cousin or aunt that I can crash with unless I feel like hopping on a plane 
* I’m completely financially dependent
* My father is a multimillionaire and I still have a joint bank account with my parents
* He can easily drain all of my accounts because, for the most part, my money is truly his
* I was given his VA benefits to help pay for my college studies (they pay half of my tuition and give me money for room and board, but I’m on my last year with the program)
* As a child, he would scream a lot and I would just take it (e.g. he screamed at me for being curious about professions other than law when I was 11 and screamed at me for wanting to learn Mandarin in middle school)
* He approves of my Film major because I’m also double-majoring in English (a back-up for law) because he believes that I’ll fail to get into the industry. 
* Our family just lost my grandmother (my dad’a mom) a month ago
* I’ve been overwhelmed with 18 credit hours of online classes
* I hardly have time to work my part-time job

TLDR: An argument with dad over politics escalated and now I might be couch surfing for the foreseeable future",03Oct2020,1
450,"I'll start of by excusing myself for possible mistakes as english isn't my first language as well as bad formatting and/or to much text.

Now to get straight to it, I(m19) fell like my life is nothing but a big useless mess, and could really use some advice on how to go on about it.

I'm not even sure why but till now, I felt like I'm beeing followed by misfortune. Sometimes I really feel like I was created with the intention to see how much shit you can throw at someone without having them give up on live.

To start with I grew up in a ... kind of toxic family I guess? My parents were almost always fighting and my grandparents didn't really show much intrest in me and my siblings as well. I especially remember the times around my birthdays would be hell. My parents would without exceptions always have huge fights and wouldn't talk to each other for months or one of them (mostly my dad) would just leave fir multiple days straight. And all for the most stupid reasons and logically, as an effect they would overall be really pissed at everything else too including us children. 

Since those days, it's very hard for me to build good connections to other people and even my other siblings... while I can let them closer to me to some degree, as soon as they seem to overstep a boundarie I always start to push everyone away from me and even though I hate myself for doing so I can't really stop myself from doing so no matter how much I try to ... It's just like ... I don't even have the words to say it ... It's like I have two sides to me and ... while one side of me craves for just a little love and affection, the other desperatly tries to fight of everypne getting to close... 

The thing is, I just don't feel happy. To be exect, I can't even remember a single day of my life on which I wasn't just sad and tired of myself at at least some point. There always has been some point at which I'm alone with my thoughts and it always seems be like ""why are you even doing this to yourself anymore?"" And that really pisses me off as I consider myself as someone who doesn't give up on thingseasily.

Till now there was none but one person which somehow got through to me which is my, to this day still girlfriend(f23). We've been together for almost 3 years now. But even this relationship has turned more than a little toxic to this point which I described in an post a couple weeks ago too. (If you dear reader would like to look that one up too feel free, it would be greatly appreciated and hello and a big thank you to the people who helped me with useful advice back then if you shall ever come upon this)

To make the long story short, she kind of doesn't wanna break up but doesn't really wanna work on fixing things too and it's just extremly painful and harmful for me as she will intentionally do things she knows I can't deal with again and again,... for examples sometimes she just won't talk to me at all which kind of puts me in the shoes of my father about 10 years ago. I'm sure you can think of what that does to me.

It just seems like I'm trying to fix things while she's just like always saying no to everything I try to do or doesn't react at all. 

To talk facts, I'm damn affraid of beeing alone and never finding love again. 
A buddys grandpa I knew used to have a saying which I think summs up my fears quite well. ""You can't ever find true love, without before loving yourself"".
Sorry for the bad translation. It's translated from German in which it goes along like ""Du kannst niemanden lieben ohne dich selbst zu lieben"".

I'm just affraid of losing her and beeing all alone all over again, not beeing able to ever find my one true soulmate.

The thing I'm most confused by is, I really don't want much of live. I very much only have one thing I want in live which is that I want to find my one significant other which returns all the love and affection I provide. Just a relationship on eyelevel. Where you fix your problems together in peace without huge fight and so. I just wanna find that special someone, marry, have children, provide for them and give them all the opportunities I  can provide to give them acces to a succesfull live, and loving, caring family so that when one day my day comes I can close my eyes with a smile on my face in the middle of my loved ones so to say...

Still, I feel like that's totally out of reach for me which is extremly depressing.
I'm really affraid of somehow somewhen becoming that one sad old man in the neighbourhood which never found his place in this world and spent all his life sad and all alone cause he couldn't let anyone close to him.

I don't want to live in the past anymore. I'm just done with beeing this depressed, sad type of myself. I know this really isn't me and I know theres more to me. There just has to be more. I just reallyhave no idea on what to do to turn my life around. I tried to start by losing weight and stuff hoping that would make me happyer but well ... while I lost around 25kg since the start of the pandemic and actually like my looks by now I feel like I'm even more sad then before.

I'd just really appreciate any kind of help you can provide. Maybe someone was in a similar situation and can share their experiences with me. I'd really appreciate it.
And thank you very much dear reader for sparing your valuable time reading this. Thank you.",03Oct2020,1
451,"I’m a pretty introverted person. I have a couple of close friends and I don’t like to hang out with people often. Recently some of my closest friend started hanging out together almost everyday. They hang out for hours during the day and then at talking until midnight. Of course they invited me but I wasn’t really interested. I’ll want to hang out with them about once a week but anymore than that I just start feeling exhausted. 

This wasn’t a problem during normal school but now we have so much more time on our hands and they are hanging out every chance they get. 

I don’t have a problem when they are hanging out and I don’t feel left out until I finally do hang out with them. Then they have a ton of inside jokes and I feel like I’m on the outside of the friend group.

453,"For context, I live in a student house of 5 people. We have all been really close friends since we started university and we've been living together since the start of the 2019 academic year. Since living together, one of my housemates and I have begun a relationship. 

About a week ago, my partner and I were told by our other three housemates that they were looking for a new place to live next year, but that they didn't want to live with us. 

The reasons they gave were that my partner could be stressful to be around during exam period and that both of us hadn't stepped up and pulled our weight around the house. Not much else was given as a reason as to why I should go. 

Granted, these things are quite accurate, butneither me or my partner were exactly satisfied with the answers they gave. Firstly, my partner is doing a intercalation in a different course next year, so they won't have the same exams or exam schedules ever again. They don't have to revise together or talk about the same topics. And concerning the helping around the house, yes, both of us can be very messy, but nowhere near as messy as one of our other housemates, who leaves dishes out until someone tidies them for him and plays music loudly and plays video games while we're all trying to sleep.

Either way, I am trying to put it behind me so we can all still be friends, regardless of whether we live together or not. I'm prepared to move in with other people if that's what keeps us together as friends. 

My partner has taken it worse and sees it as a sign that our housemates don't want to be friends AT ALL anymore (which isn't true because we all spend lots of quality, fun time together). 

My partner either wants:

- All of our current house to stay together next year (which doesn't seem likely right now) 
- For me and them to live together on our own (no other housemates) 
- To live completely on their own.

My partner does not want to move in with anyone else, because they don't want to move in with people they don't know, even if the new housemates were on our course. They don't want them and I to live in two separatehouseholds. 

I have tried my best to convince my partner that we can still be friends with our old housemates and find somewhere new to live, with new housemates. My partner doesn't want to hear it. 

I'm not ready to live with just my partner next year, and I'm worried that they'll be isolated if they live by themselves, and that they'll become more depressed because of it. 

I just feel like my life is being split in two, I'm stuck between the two halves and I'm being force to choose a side. I don't know what to do. 

Any advice very welcome :)",03Oct2020,1

462,"Ok so I've been working at my current job, a mid size chain coffee place named after an animal. For essentially 3 years now, I'm 19. 

I've only worked 2 jobs before this, both seasonal and shorter. So the job I have now was my first solid and stable job. My job has always been super stressful, but it was enjoyable for the first year until I moved locations. Then the stress became dread for every shift. I didn't work for a few months from COVID displacement, and I have moved locations again but that dread and stress has again reminided me why I wanted a different job in the first place. 

I get paid 12$ which is decent, but has not raised at all in the last 3 years. I also get tips which range from 4$-17$ a shift, on average is usually $8-12 which is nice. But its long hours on your feet with 0 breaks. You only get a 30 min unpaid break if you work 8+ hours, so if you work 7.5 hours, no break. It's also always insanely busy, you have to work fast and get an order out in 3 min or under, and it's lots of physical labor. No nail polish allowed, dangly earrings, shirts with anything on them, hair up, headset which has given me ear infections, and no long necklaces or bracelets. Overall this job has aided with amplifying my stress. And I dread going to every shift. Closes were bad as well, I no longer close, but I used to and it's definitely the most task loaded shift. 

Regarding COVID the company hasn't been doing well either. 2 stores in my area had managers and team members with COVID and they shut down for about 3 days and just opened with ""reduce hours"" and no testing for other staff. No masks in drive thru were you are face to face with hundreds of customers and people touching your hands. We also have wellness checks before a shift. I have been experiencing symptoms that is required for me to be sent home. I was told to lie about it. My manager also let someone who got tested for COVID work immediately after. This hasn't just been a COVID issue, I was forced to work with pink eye, flu, and colds numerous times. You can't call in you have to get your shift covered. 

There are also no bonuses or anything like that for employees, I have again been working for 3 years and no raise, I was offered a promotion last year because I work insanely hard thinking it will pay off, but the promotion was a 1$ raise and only on MOD shifts scheduled, so it wouldn't affect my check more than 20$ most likely as there are multiple shift leaders. Raises aren't really a thing there, and the employees I know who got a raise, it was only about 0.10 cents.

I'm looking to work at target which is 15$ an hour, and seems to be less stressful and hectic from the people I know who have worked there. Can I get advice on what to do? I'm nervous to switch jobs as coffee chain named after santas sleigh pullers is all I've known since I was 16-17. I think I'm ready to move on from this job but my parents also say I should stick with my current one as it looks better on a resume for loyalties sake. I used to love my job, it was relatively easy but extremely repetitive and mind numbing at times. But I feel I have outgrown it. Maybe I just need to decrease hours? Thank you!",03Oct2020,1
463,"I last made a post here about not finding myself interesting, and that was just a scratch on the surface of whatever self esteem issues I have.

I made this post due to quite bad mood dips the past few days as I felt that my close friend “got tired” of texting me. It happens quite a few times. We usually text almost daily, with her asking me hows my day, what am I doing, discussing homework, etc. and I would reciprocate as well. Occasionally, such as one instance 3 months ago, she stopped texting me for a good 4 days and afterwards apologised and said she was busy. But those 4 days were the most agonising 4 days because I was so scared I lost another friend. After she clarified that, I was relieved and fine again. And now that this is happening these few days, my mood starts to dip again. I know you’d think I’d have learned my lesson. While I don’t consider myself overly clingy and I recognise that people have their own lives, may sometimes be busy, may sometimes not be in the mood to talk, I can’t help but start worrying “what if this is actually the last time she stops texting me?” and this sends me into panic and agony.

Which brings me to my main issue. I have thought about this to myself, and I sort of figured that the root cause of this is: my fear is that my friends will leave me after finding newer, better, funnier, more entertaining friends. This revelation clicked and it all made sense now.

Ive always been so anxious and fearful of mass events, college orientation camps, mass meetups, start of school, and for the longest time I thought it was social anxiety because what these events had in common was... people. Crowds. But that didn’t make sense because I love making new friends, I’m sociable. If you met me, on the outside you would think I’m a confident bright college student, not the emotional insecure wreck that I am internally. It now dawned on me that I was so anxious at the beginning of every year and in these “freshmen camps” because I was afraid that my friends will find even better friends and leave me. That they will have such a great time meeting new people, making new shared experiences, inside jokes, texts, that they have no more time for me. That I’m just another temporary person until they find a better replacement. And that freaks me out. Because I’ve spent 2 years (junior and senior year in high school) being a loner just to get good grades to enter medical school, and those were the worst 2 years of my life. This insecurity isnt without reason though, I notice I’m usually the one initiating a text with most of my friends, asking to go out, etc. Which is why that friend I mentioned above who initiates conversations with me is someone I hold so special in my heart. For once I don’t feel like I’m always chasing for people’s attention and affection. And the thought of losing her is killing me although I am old enough to know that likely won’t happen, its the very primal visceral childish part of me that keeps gnawing at my insecurity: “she’s stopped texting you because she went out with a bunch of new friends and formed a new friendship group, you’re a spare tyre now”.

This rant sounds so childish for a 21 year old college student and reading back I feel like an idiot. But I really need help and I have no idea how to get myself out of this dark hole of insecurity, self pity and catastrophising everything. How do I deal with all this?",03Oct2020,1

466,"I’m 21, living in the Netherlands. When I arrived here at 14, I had a hard time with finishing high school and won’t get into details, but I failed my final exams and therefore had no diploma to really apply to a college or university, which was my first goal unmet. 

I have no proficient Dutch as I was in an International School, so only spoke English on a daily basis. I can speak proper Dutch now, but not to the extent of a full-time study in the language. It’s cumbersome and I did follow a lower level study (MBO) in Game Development, full-time, in Dutch. I didn’t finish it. 

I am now studying Mathematics (Wiskunde B) to try an entry exam for people without a diploma (Toelatingsexamen 21+) at a college nearby of middle-level (HBO). I will be applying to Computer Science, and then after one year, bridge to a higher-level (WO) study in Computer Science. 

This is the only path I have found by myself. It’s difficult to find other resources or possibilities, but I do not really *love* Computer Science. I just see it as a job opportunity versus what I really want to do, which is Marine Biology or Astrophysics. Now, technically speaking, both of those fields have a lot of competition in the job market, and barely even have jobs. I’ve just always been passionate about the two of them. 

Now I wonder what’s the best path to take. Perhaps I should just suck it up and follow through with Computer Science since I’m already en route for the entry exam in March 2021, or just instead follow what I love doing and somehow find a way to live off of what crumbs those two fields would give me.

If anyone could give me some advice about this, it’d be greatly appreciated.

TLDR; I don’t have high school diplomas and have one current possibility to enter a course (Computer Science) that I know I won’t enjoy working in. I love Astrophysics and Marine Biology but they don’t give good job opportunities at all. It’s difficult to find Biology here in the Netherlands. I really do love Marine Biology the most. 

Should I follow through with Computer Science?
Should I just drop it and find a way to apply to Biology?
Do any Dutchies have advice for universities or know of any other opportunities?
What’s my best bet for the moment?

467,"Hi all, 

As per the title, I’ve been in therapy for around four months and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

One of the main things that I have mentioned while in therapy (to only my personal therapist, if that has any bearing on the answers), is how my step-father is extremely stuck in his ways and is closed off to change, which prompts regular arguments between my biological mother (who is 11 years younger) and him, who are married, and now this causes me stress and anxiety at home. 

For example:

Today (03/09/2020), I asked my step-father to use the sauna, as it is therapeutic for my mind and body, in a number of ways. 

He told me “no”, after quickly asking my brother if he was going as well, and having received a “no” from my brother. 

I then reminded him that my mother and he had promised me yesterday, the use sauna “tomorrow” (today). 

He said that “there’s no point in going if only one person is going” and “you could go tomorrow with everyone”. 

I reluctantly agreed, knowing that I would not win an argument with him, when my mother chimed in and told me that she had promised me that I could go yesterday and that “it was fine” and to “go turn it [the sauna] on”.

My step-father confronted her, repeating his earlier statement that “there’s no point going if only one person is going”, with my mother saying that “it doesn’t matter if the sauna gets put on two times a week, some families have it on every day”. He seems offended and looked somehow betrayed, but remained silent, at least until I was descending the stairs to go downstairs. 

My disgruntled step-father cursed under his breath, “at one time, once a week [going to the sauna] was okay, now it’s two times a week, when did this change?”

I went downstairs and turned the sauna on, filling the water bucket with water. When I came back out into the foyer in our downstairs, I heard my parents arguing about how my mother has supposedly acted like a dictator and didn’t respect my step-father’s judgement, as described by my step-father. My step-father also expressed how he wants to “agree on things”, the definition of that being for him, in my experience, essentially forcing his will upon my brother and I, under threat of punishment if we express too much disagreement. 

My mother retorted, saying to him, “this is like a power-game for you”, to which my step-father replied, “no it’s not, I just wish you wouldn’t overrule everything I say and that we could agree on changes [to the schedule”. Now, my mother doesn’t come even close to overruling “everything” that my step-father says, and like I will describe further in this post, just takes a more relaxed and less rigid approach to parenting my brother and I. 

I recorded an excerpt of their argument without either my mother’s or my step-father’s knowledge, and the recording is now stored on my phone. 

This situation highlighted perfectly that which I had expressed to my therapist, in that even the smallest changes to his rigid schedule, in which my step-father tracks the amount of times that we, as his immediate family, use the toilet each week, have naps, go to the sauna etc, make my step-father sour. When my mother, who is much more laid-back (she doesn’t spoil us by any means, she just treats my brother (14M) and I, more like adults than my step-father), disagrees with my step-father, and an argument erupts over something incredibly minor, it causes me a lot of anxiety. 

Now, having provided context, onwards to my question: 

Can I show my therapist today’s recording and those of past arguments over similar events to substantiate my claims (not that she has ever expressed or even hinted toward not believing me, but to provide her with an opportunity to gauge my situation more objectively then simply by me telling her)? 

Is it illegal for her to not report my having recorded my parents without their consent or knowledge? 

I’m asking these questions, as I do not want my parents to find out about the recordings for the time being, at least, or to cause them any more embarrassment than is needed, but more to simply express the true scope of this issue and how it is affecting me? 

I live in Finland, by the way. 

So, any advice? Thoughts? I know this isn’t the right sub, but, uh, AITA? Any further comments? 

Thanks in advance 🙏",03Oct2020,1

478,"I'm in the US. I've received a notice from my states labor department stating that they had overpaid me in terms of my unemployment. For the entire time I requested unemployment. Which was only a little over a month between April and May. I was let go from my previous job at the end of Feb. Was hired at my new/current place of employment at the beginning of March, where I worked for a week or so before Covid hit. Then I was still technically an employee, but my employer went to lockdown and minimal staff for a month or so in order to keep their business afloat and to ensure I had a place to work. During this time I gave them a few weeks to recover and then tried finding another job, and eventually was forced to apply for unemployment at this time. 

They are requesting 75% of what I got back, for a time I had only $100 of income. This total does not include the extra money they tacked on for Covid. I have a choice to disagree with the amount of to ask for a waiver if I feel I cannot pay it. I am torn on what to do exactly. 

I can try for a waiver, but with my current income and my partners (not married) income, it looks like we are sitting pretty good. But in reality we are just getting by and paying it would mean losing my entire savings. I'm afraid to put my housemates/partners income down because they do make so much more than me, and idk how the government is going to view that. 

The option I was leaning towards was a disagreement with the amount. Like I said, it's 75% of the help I received, during a time where I received only a $100 paycheck for the time I was responsible for 2 months of rent and car and vet bills. And during a time I had to drive across the country to help move my deceased grandmother's belongs. I am just unsure what to include in my explanation of my disagreement. Do I need to attach proof of my income and employment? Obviously it's be a formal format, but what would the department of labor need to her to hopefully decrease the amount they want back? 

TLDR: Department of labor wants 75% of the unemployment benefits I received during lockdown. To request a waiver or to disagree? And what to include?",03Oct2020,1

480,"I do not know exactly how this subreddit works as I’m new to it and only just skimmed through the rules, so bear with me if I’m missing anything. My (15F) friend (also 15F) hasn’t been feeling the best mentally for a few years now. I only just discovered this year that she was suicidal and it wasn’t because she told me, I discovered it by mistake. Ever since, she’s been letting everything out to me. I asked her to speak to the school counselor at some point cause I don’t know how to handle these situations, and because her family isn’t necessarily supportive to get her to talk to a therapist. She refused and told me that only if counselor asks her to talk, she will. She did not mind me talking to the counselor about talking to her, so I did, although I did not disclose too much information, only what’s necessary. It’s a start, but she however isn’t finding the time to talk to the counselor nor is she able to open up when talking to the counselor. She mentioned once that it was too tiring to reopen up to someone else and it was nerve wracking.
Today she told me about something that was very concerning and I know if she opens up anymore to me I’m not gonna be able to handle it further, because that’s too much weight on my shoulders and knowing that she might do something to herself is not only scary and concerning, but is too much of a responsibility on me. I know it might sound selfish but it’s genuinely affecting some aspects of my life and I do not want that.

My question is what can I do in this situation? I already tried helping and I can’t leave her and ask her not to talk because I know that currently I’m a source of comfort, even if it is very little, but I also have wanna focus on my own things like schoolwork.

I don't have problems to make friends. People really like me. Like an inspiration thing. I studied all my life in a private school with other privilege people, even more than me.

I had too many experiences in my life that took me out of this bubble those people lives. That made me a real person that don't care bout this meanless things. I think those are some reasons those people inspire in me.

Two people in particular bully and make unsalted jokes about everyone else, and most of the time they're the only ones laughing at these jokes. You can't confront them because if you try they'll focus the bullying on you. You can't speak up because they'll talk over you. You simply can't do anything because they're so immature it's impossible to reason with them. What's worse is knowing that one of them is simply a douche with no future, living off of his moms money and flexing brand clothes bought by her, all the while making fun of the rest of us cuz in his vision we're poor. Then there's the girls in the group who just talk everyone behind their backs, spreading false rumors.

I got my flu shot last week on September 24th. I am not supposed to have my period for another two weeks, so that can’t be it either. I am taking vitamins (D, Zinc and C) to boost my immunity.


Today I woke up, ate Greek yogurt and some Cheerios because I couldn’t be bothered to make breakfast (the yogurt was not expired). I took my vitamins, and after a while (within an hour/a few hours) I threw up. 

Other Symptoms:

My nose has been a little stuffy for the past few days

A few days ago I had a headache

I’ve been feeling a little fatigued lately (and I can’t tell if it’s because I’m tired or if it’s more than normal).

I know I have to get tested but I’m at a loss as to how this could have happened (if it is covid). 

I spend maybe 30min-1hr outside my room. I wipe my doorknobs. I use hand sanitizer every time I touch something. I throw my clothes in the dirty laundry when I go outside. I haven’t seen any of my friends in person. I wear gloves as often as I can. I never, EVER touch my mask or take it off outside my room. I wipe my keys. I even wipe down/wash my groceries.

I don’t have a job, I’m a full-time student. The most interaction I have with people is passing them on my way to get food or talking to my roommate. 

I did everything I could, and yet somehow this is happening to me. I really hope with all my heart that I’m just being paranoid. I tried to be as responsible as I could given the circumstances. ",03Oct2020,1

My mom and I aren't getting along. I wont go into too much detail but to say there have been huge breaches of trust, that I have tried to stand by her through is probably enough. 

She will accuse me that I'm being short and awful when I havent said or done very much to her and make it into a huge argument that I end up apologising for regardless or if its founded. 

It started so out of the blue and suddenly this time that I tried to defend myself. Well that didnt go well and she has now said that she wants me out of the house. 

I can't convey the hurt. I have stood through several big things with her and loved her unconditionally and to have her treat me this way is killing me. Shes cutting me off based on an argument that I was short with her (I wasnt I was just cleaning) and ungrateful and unhelpful (I was cleaning as I am supposed to). 

If I came of short it really wasnt meant that way- and completley unintentional- but that didn't matter. It still turned into a huge argument. 

Shes now saying she shouldn't ever mention anything and that I gaslight her. And she obviously shouldn't ever tell me when I'm wrong. 

I'm seriously doubting my sanity and my memory at this point. 


It doesnt really matter who is wrong though I just want out. I have no money (I've given all my savings to her) no job ( she convinced me that getting one may screw us on taxes), and only a car and some carriers for my 4 cats. I only have a tank of gas so I doubt I'd get very far without prior planning.

530,"I’m 19, I’ve had 10 years of experience in retail as a manager in a small business at a young age. I’ve decided that it would’nt look good on a resume and make me look privledged so I shorted it to 5 years and decided not to work as a manager in a family business. 

I’ve worked for A monopoly in New York State as a
call representative for 17.50/hr, but they decided to change their systems during me and my colleagues “on floor training”. The call center couldn’t  implement an efficient guide to make the transitions smooth so the 34/40 trainees quit at around the same week. I cling in hope that they’d concentrate their supervisiors on that group that was left, but instead they sent their supervisors to help their other workers outside the training, slowly we had 4 workers get fired and I’ve had been left with 2 desperate parents who knew that they would simply fire us last 3 workers and start a new slate, so I quit, no point having “fired” on my name.

My older sister, didn’t graduate high school, had a kid at a young age, got hired at a well paying call center that paid 19/hr. I have more work experience, I’ve graduated high school with well beyond the credits needed, passed multiple regents exams. Yet they turned me down at the job. 

Biased on parents, women, POC my sister said. They do care about their employees they’re a government funded health organization. They just don’t have the room to fortunate, Responsible people, who perhaps want their merits cashed in and not be behind when they were told they’d be ahead all the time?

So I job hunt for 3 months and find a small retail store that hires me for being experienced with retail, they’re also couldn’t believe I worked for that monopoly, especially after they relised my birthday and how during the interview they thought I was in my 30’s.

I’m well built, I’ve had experience unloading entire 18 wheeler trucks filled with 40-70 pound dense supplies alone since I was 12, I’m a confident hard worker who’s used to taking shit.

Turns out they needed workers really bad, very bad part of town, robbery every 2 months but I’m used to worse. I’m working 68 hours a week for these guys for 11.50 and hour... they had me train crappy employees and turns out those employees that were getting replaced every 2 weeks are getting paid 12.50 an hour. No breaks, no bathroom, alone, bad part of town but not the worst. This is I’m sure illegal but I just need some cash to go to college but COVID made that impossible.

I’ve stopped armed robbery alone, I was commended verbally. Whatever, as long as I can earn these peoples respect.

I hadn’t gone a week with these new employers, I was working for 10 months. I hadn’t gone a week, without my schedule changing twice a week. And they say it’s because I don’t have a wife or kids...

So despite being their literal most flexible, reliable, respectful, worker. Because I’m not irresponsible. I get shit on. They’ve took my overtime hours off and started working me the absolute worse hours for 37 hours a week, I demand more or if you’re going to abuse me with the worst hours give me better pay? Instead they gave me a .50 cent raise and gave me 30 hours a week and I’m working the hardest hours of all time and do you want to know why? Because the other employees are all women, and they need me, the man to do the heavy lifting, for less money for less hours for a worse schedule. The women get 3-4 days off but work 12 hours a day. I work 5 of the order of inventory coming in that’s always late or early so I’m on call like a surgeon.

I've always been in front of a pc. Started to program pretty early but never really complicated stuff. Did my school in the IT direction, did my training in the IT direction and am now studying IT. I'm almost done but struggling to write my thesis. Since the last post I made about this problem I wrote exactly zero words.

I'm in home office since the beginning of corona (it's a dual studying system where I also work for a company), constantly calling in sick due to my depression. I'm also just not good at what I do. You should think I am since I've never done anything else but you can do IT for decades and still not learn anything new. I have no desire to learn anything new. 

I actually have no desire to learn anything. No ambitions. The only thing I did for a while was sport but I was on a plateau pretty quickly which frustrated me a lot.

My gf recently broke up and moved in another city. She is good at her job, meets tons of people, going out all the time .. I'm not using any social media but it's enough to just look at her for me to feel terrible about myself. I feel like I'm missing out on anything she has. 

And I'm also missing her like crazy. I always had the tendency to be a lot happier in a relationship. Suddenly I could do things for her instead of myself because that's not a good enough reason apparently.

As mentioned above my ex moved to another city and now I feel like I HAVE to move out as well. But I don't know where and when. I'd like to move where she lives now but I'm scared to meet her.

That being said, I'm about half of what women want and nowhere near what women will accept.

I've never been diagnosed with depression but I've felt worthless for years now and it has been getting worse lately. Its crazy how genetics determine success in life in every aspect and there is nothing I can do to improve my situation.

545,"Hey guys. Writing this from a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'd really like some advice if anyone is willing to listen. I have two master's degrees, one in Scandinavian Studies and another in Ethnic and Civil Studies with an emphasis on patrilineal power structures. I am 34 years old today. I've spent about six and a half years doing research through a Norwegian online degree program, and I am now roughly $350k in debt.

However, I wasn't worried about this, since I was promised a position in the department at the same university to continue working and researching in my field. I was terrifyingly excited about finally getting to fly over and live and work at the university for the foreseeable future. Maybe even find Mr. Right, since I haven't had great luck in romance here in the states. However, Covid busted all my hopes of doing that.

Once things weren't so bleak, I decided to reach out again and ask about when they'd be reopening. A colleague then told me that the university is now roughly in full swing at the same department where I was planning to work. I was devastated. I had heard nothing of this, and I felt that they completely overlooked me when they at some point made this announcement and went back to the grind.

I contacted about three people from the department, asking why I wasn't told anything of this, and they all told me something to the effect of: ""we're only working with minimal staff at this point, so we'll let you know when things change and we can hire you."" Who the hell are these people who meet their requirement of oh-so important minimal staff? I'm likely the most highly versed scholar in 15th century Dano-Norwegian patriarchy and the House of Oldenburg. Yet that doesn't seem to mean anything to the same people who I worked with for the last several years.

I live on a road where there is a asbo living there too. He doesn't  come across as a beggar more of an asbo type but he is.he is a bit intimidating sometimes and I know he regularly gets into fights and has been prison before  and sometimes asks for money. I say no but I am still worried that he might want to attack me and get money.i know that he asked an old lady for some money and when she didn't give it to him he took her handbag and then the police were called. I also know that he bullies people younger than him taking their money. From my understanding he doesn't have any friends as he just uses people for their money as he doesn't work.He asks a lot of people for money in the area. he also knows where I live.

I soon will get a new job where i will need a car to travel. I am worried that on my way to the car or as I get back from work he will approach me and ask for money or try to get in the car. I am not a confrontational kind of guy but I will just say to him nicely no but I am worried he might do something.i will make it clear to him that we are not friends and that I don't want him bothering me .

I have unplugged/ re-plugged the router&amp;TV MANY times, waited several minutes, the problem still persists. The problem is: I can do just about everything --- except have a video play.

Can someone please tell me what is going on? How can I do almost everything in the apps, and the internet works GREAT, but it freezes up the second I try to play a video?!

I haven’t been happy at my role for a long time, but I’m nervous about quitting before Christmas and during a pandemic. I’m not sure how much more I can take. My line manager is unbearable and berates me constantly. My colleagues are so stressed and overworked they’re not fun to talk to.

Since March I’ve been working from home and conducting everything over zoom. I broke my own laptop working for the company, was told they couldn’t get me one. Bought a new one costing myself 400 pounds which then was accidentally smashed and only given a company laptop after that.

I don’t feel valued, heard or appreciated. But I worry there’s nothing else out there for me and I will regret quitting with the current situation. 

Any advice?",03Oct2020,1
555,"I will start off by saying this isn't a suicidal help post,Whilst I have had suicidal thoughts,and continue to,I think I've come to terms that I never actually could mainly because 1 I love my brother too much to do that to him and 2 I want to experience more in life before I would consider it.

Basically im early 20s,and for the last 2/3 years my mother has been a constant negative impact in my life,it started when we got into a fight and I had to physically defend myself as she began pushing me,I ended up overpowering her but cut myself in the process,she isn't an abuser but is definitely not afraid to get physical,she is (in my opinion) an extremely stupid,emotional,presumptuous and delusional person,1day we will be fine the next she is trying to get into a verbal argument at any chance she gets.

Another main route of this is rent,currently I pay I'm assuming a low amount  (40) my problem isn't how much I pay but simply the fact that she isn't understanding of the situation im in,I want to save up to both move out and eventually short after go on vacation(to celebrate new begginings) I know life isn't usually all that fine and dandy but it WOULD be if she was understanding and lowered rent until I saved up enough,baring in mind I have looked after my brother for atleast 10 hours every week for the last 3 years without any pay (I know I live here but I was told I should still be payed)
I buy my own food
I usually pay for electricity
I don't use many appliances here because I feel extremely awkward around her,I try and avoid her because I know any conversation can lead to an argument,she says I talk to her differently than anyone else and shes right but I can't tell her thay that because if I did?she'd just have a go at me.

The family situation is beyond repair with me and her and I would call her by her first name (if I actually did she would snap at me though) but for now I call her mom,outside of that though I don't consider myself related to her.

My point of this is asking 
1.if anyone has been in a similar situation?
2.if I may have any medical conditions that I don't know about by the sound of it
3.how do I cope with living with her until I move out.

I will clarify that the relationship is beyond repair imo I have no intentions of fixing it,I know ""you only get one mom""etc all that stuff but literally anyone else I know makes me happier,and she has done nothing but be an extremely negative impact over the last 3 years (and imo probably more than that but I just didn't realise because I was young)

Hopefully this makes sense,thanks.",03Oct2020,1
556,"Hello people. I turned to Reddit to ask this since I do not know how to talk to other people about it so here it goes...
I have an awesome circle of friends, we have been hanging out for around 5 years straight now and it has been going great. From the circle, I have only two friends I trust THE MOST, I am going to focus on one friend here since the post is pretty much about him. I trusted him pretty much the most out of all people till now, I noticed that he started to be very tense with me and he just tries to convince me into doing various things. Luckily, I have a mind and life of my own so I deny if I do not have the time or just don't want to do the specific thing. It happens pretty frequently, such as today. He called me trying to convince me into going somewhere, but I did not have any time. I told him nicely, and he just hung up, so confused. His attitude with the other people in the circle is very different than ours, and I cannot continue with that much negativity, but on the other hand I don't want to leave and ruin my friendship with the others in the group that have done absolutely nothing to me. Any help around this? Thank you and have a nice day.",03Oct2020,1
557,"I understand that to most people, this answer has an obvious 'yes' response. However, I feel that my situation might be a bit different.   


The relationship I have with my grandfather is a bit weird. I haven't seen/heard him in 2 years (almost 3).  Before that, I saw him about once a year on Christmas gatherings. He never asked me about my education, always forgot my birthday, etc. He isn't this way towards my nieces/nephew. They received birthday gifts, they kept in contact and so on. I couldn't care less about the material gifts I didn't get. I simply felt like since he did never put any effort into keeping in touch with me, I should just do the same. That's why I stopped going to his Christmas parties at the age of 18. I am 21 now.    


Earlier this year, he had something happen to him while he happened to be in the hospital. I don't remember what it is exactly, but if he didn't happen to be in the hospital at that time, he would've been gone already. They did some emergency surgery on him, and he recovered okay-ish. He went home some days after. Even though all of that happened, he never reached out to me, neither did I reach out to him.   


Apparently there are complications with his surgery, and he will need to be operated again this wednesday. Chances are that he will not survive the surgery, so they asked him to get all the paperwork done in case he deceases.  My grandpa does have some contact with my dad, which is why I know all of this.   


This has left me wondering if I should call him, and if so, what do I say? I don't feel like I have anything useful to say as he clearly isn't interested in me. I would go to the morgue and the funeral, but only for my father, who would really appreciate me being there. Having written all of this down, I feel like I still have some resentment towards him for not caring about my existence.   


If he dies during the surgery, my life literally won't change in any way, shape or form. The major reason I am conflicted over this is simply the fact that maybe one day I wish I would have said something, and would regret my decision.

559,"Hi my name is Alice. I am 19 and more or less an orphan. I ran away from home when I was 13 because of a lot of child abuse and yeah struggled myself to adulthood.
I spent the time to the 18th birthday at my aunts place which wasn't nice either but better then before. The problem there was psychological terror.
In addition to that, I discovered that I am transgender and also demisexual which was very shitty in a conservative radical muslimic/Catholic family.

After I turned 18, things turned better. I met my bigger sister and we moved together. I lost all my old friends because my parents still tried so much shit to manipulate me and the whole psychological terror destrpyed my trust and yeah....I leaved them.
Now I am 19, we life together for one year.
She is the most important person in my life, I love her in a non-sexual way. She is just my bigger sister and I am so happy that I met her but I am also very sry, that she must saw and help me through all the suffering from my past problems. Don't get it wrong, I am in therapy and I have PTSD but still...it is very hard for me to let go....and now we come to the Advice part:

Next year, my big sis, who is BTW 2 yrs older, want to live together with her gf and wanna move to a different city. I definitely wanna follow her, bc atm I cannot imagine a life without her. Now I have two problems job and operation. Atm I work as an bookseller(learn to be) and it is a 3 years contract, my sister do the same and our last exam id at the same date. The thing is, that after this exam, Idk what to do. Planning is very hard, because i have a genital surgery which makes me 2 months unavailable to earn money. My bigger sis, said it would be okay if I stay with them until I find things on my own and can stand on my own feet. 
But I don't know how...I don't wanna be apart her, I want that surgery immediately, I dont wanna be alone again. I am scared.
Everything feels so shitty atm, she said it isn't the ideal solution...but yeah the ideal solution would be if I don't need that surgery because I have the right body, if I know how to flirt and get a relationship. I am not the girl who is interested in Sex, for me it is trust and bonding, and this is the reason why I got friendzoned a lot. I still don't know the difference from flirting and getting new friends....because whenever I think: Oh that person is my type....I don't wanna have some Sex...I wanna know them  better and make probably some romantic stuff, like a picnic. 

So pls, I literally don't know what to do in the moment am crying and hope to hear some wise words.
Has anyone some good advices or Tipps? Maybe what I can do for the future and the flat problem? The romance thing? 
It would be very nice to hear some solutions maybe, because even if she(big sis) say I am not an anchor that pull her down, I feel like that and are afraid to lose everything again.

560,"In March 2019 i started to become friends with this girl from my class. The more days the more friends we became so when we had summer vacation and we really were connecting and I started to have a big crush on her and I think she did on me, I noticed some of it but we were to chickens to say anything. In the middle of the summer vacation she was my best female friend and I was her best male friend we talked a lot, from morning to night. Our friends started to notice and started to say stuff like, name and name sitting in a tree... Yeah that. We always chuckled when they said it which really means something.


I never told anyone about the crush and neither did she and one day I ran out of stuff to say so I told her everything that happened and she did too. Everything was perfect and that was the best summer of my life. 


In late August 2019 I f*ck*d up bad. I started accusing her for things I thought she did and she didn't like it a bit. She was real sad and I said the dumbest thing ever ""keep crying I don't give a shit"". A month later she was happy again but hated the f*ck out of me.


That leads to March 2020 we started to become friends but never close to the same. Never texted or never talked in school, well sometimes in handcraft class. 
I knew I missed her and it killed me to think that I hurt her. She later texted me that she know I didn't mean it but nothing more. I didn't have her snap, ig or other things. 

Our school was closing because it was turning into something ""idk"" but we all in my class split out ways, I came with 2 of my friends while the rest 12 in other ways.

Well summer 2020 was shit. It went so fast everyday and I hated it. I started a school called ""west side school"" and she something else, but until I realized West Side School was a shit school and Im starting a new school next week with all my friends who already go there but I found out she goes to that school. I thought what can I do to restore the connection, I don't need another bad summer this was already sh*t.

I’ve owned 2 cars. The first one was an old clunker I bought for 2500 outright. It lasted me a little over a year before it’s issues from how old it was just became too much and I had to get rid of it. 

In June of 2019 I financed my first car from a dealership. I got an awesome deal on it too. At the time, my sister and brother in law came with me to the dealership to help me through the process since financing a car through a dealership is a huge thing and I wanted to make sure that I was making all the right choices in regard to buying the car. 

Unfortunately, I totaled that car a few nights ago. I’m really upset about it. I’ve decided this is my issue alone and I’m going to deal with it alone. I’m already in talks with the dealership I got my last car from as well as enterprise about getting a new car. I have representatives from both agency’s that seem pretty keen on helping me through the process and helping me with my budget but car salesman also just want to make a sale so I’m wary about just taking their words on things.

1. How I should interact with their family members, and alleviate their children's worries as they are helping to nurse her on top of their busy work lives. I would as much as possible try not to cause any further grief, but instead provide emotional support.
2. How should I explain it to my children as well? I would like to teach my kids to interact with their grandaunt / family members with respect and compassion.

Kid in front on me smashed it with a stone (what the hell, why would anyone do this) and I picked up the poor guy, his shell was broken and part of it (about 1x1 cm) missing in the wider part of the shell. I cleaned the hole and patched him with a piece of plastic spoon and tape. I put him on top of a box with some food and water and continued my work. He was producing this brown-black liquid and some kind of sticky stuff and I though he was not gonna make it.
Five hours later I picked him up with the intention to put his body in a forest nearby and he moved and sticked his head out of the shell. I was immensely happy! I brought him home and here I am writing this. He retracted back to the shell, but when I gently poke him, he moves. Also the liquid stopped flowing out of the shell. 
I put him in a container with tomatoe slices, piece of salad, water and some flour (I heard it helps?).

I'm new to Reddit and English is not my native language but I'm trying to explain my situation as simple as possible while keeping the post as short as possible that you guys can help me with the least amount of time.

(Hey It's me from the future and I have to say that I'm sorry that I wrote that much of Background story which isn't that important if you have any questions to help me please ask those questions I'm gonna reply instantly)

Ok let's go into it
I'm a fifteen years old boy born in Germany. My mom (55yo) is from Colombia and my dad (65yo) is from Argentina. 
My dad and my mom met in Germany but they both already had kids before meeting each other. My dad was married to a German woman and got 2 Daughters my half sister which are 34 and 32 and my Mom got 28 years ago my Brother with a guy she barely knew and to this point everything was still fine. She and her Mom raised my Brother but then 6 years later my Mom got pregnant again from another guy she barely knew and because Colombia is a pretty religious country she was afraid to tell her Mom and my auntie told my Mom that she should go to Germany so her Mom wouldn't notice that she was pregnant again and she would have a better future for her kids. My Mom liked the Idea and therefore she flew to Germany but left her at that time 6 years old son because they hadn't enough money to buy two Planetickets at the same time. So my Brother was left alone by his mom with my Grandmother in Colombia while my Mom gave birth to my second Brother and worked a bit. But after a while i think it was a year and a half my first brother also got to Germany but they grew up they with a lot of Obstacles. They grew up without a dad, the affection from my mom was very limited because she worked a lot and then needed to get track of the baby she just got, they were pretty poor, they were the only kids who were lightskins/black and got teased/bullied their whole schooltime etc... 
But I think that it got better and some time I'd say at the time my first brother was 16 my Mom met my Dad and they moved to a pretty nice home and everything was fine they got married and shit. 
Then my Mom got unplanned pregnant again with me 
And Because my Mom is religious they didn't abort me lul. 
Ok then when myself was also there they moved to a bigger house and again everything fine.

My first Brother was bad at school but it didn't really matter because he was really good at soccer and was about to get a Professional Soccer Player but then he turned 16 and numbed his childhood pain with Alcohol and Cigarettes and other drugs and after a while he quit school. Now he's 28, an alcoholic for a lot of years, has a bit of an Criminal past and has a lot of debt but he lives with a cousin of mine without needing to pay rent but my Mom needs to take care of him. 
But my Mom is mentally ill she is pretty narcissistic and a horder and taking care of my alcoholic brother is a pretty big deal for her and yesterday my dad told me causally that he's going to divorce my mom after our vacations. 
It doesn't hurt that much because my Dad and Mom were fighting constantly and my Dad always told me if that is too much for me he'd divorce instantly and therefore i already was comfortable with the Idea of a divorce and it also will have good sites like: The House won't be full with shit and i can have a social life with inviting friends over and so on. But it was really unexpected like the rejection from my crush but the rejection isn't that important. 
But if someone wanna know im gonna anwser the questions and if something isn't clear please ask im gonna reply as fast as possible
And Thanks a lot to read until here and as I already have said I'd really appreciate and love it if you have any advice for me:)

574,"Hey guys. Writing this from a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'd really like some advice if anyone is willing to listen. I have two master's degrees, one in Scandinavian Studies and another in Ethnic and Civil Studies with an emphasis on patrilineal power structures. I am 34 years old today. I've spent about six and a half years doing research through a Norwegian online degree program, and I am now roughly $350k in debt.

However, I wasn't worried about this, since I was promised a position in the department at the same university to continue working and researching in my field. I was terrifyingly excited about finally getting to fly over and live and work at the university for the foreseeable future. Maybe even find Mr. Right, since I haven't had great luck in romance here in the states. However, Covid busted all my hopes of doing that.

Once things weren't so bleak, I decided to reach out again and ask about when they'd be reopening. A colleague then told me that the university is now roughly in full swing at the same department where I was planning to work. I was devastated. I had heard nothing of this, and I felt that they completely overlooked me when they at some point made this announcement and went back to the grind.

I contacted about three people from the department, asking why I wasn't told anything of this, and they all told me something to the effect of: ""we're only working with minimal staff at this point, so we'll let you know when things change and we can hire you."" Who the hell are these people who meet their requirement of oh-so important minimal staff? I'm likely the most highly versed scholar in 15th century Dano-Norwegian patriarchy and the House of Oldenburg. Yet that doesn't seem to mean anything to the same people who I worked with for the last several years.

I haven't heard or received any other information regarding when I might be able to take this next step in my life.

A couple months later, after me deleting him and repeatedly saying NO, he started to bother me again, this time replying to my comments on a friends post.

This only happens sometimes I guess so I started to wonder if it was me. Maybe what I say is boring but I don't know, it started to make me feel less inclined to join convos and Im scared of being ignored if I do join do I just don't join. The only time they do respond to me is if one of them respond to me then the other gives a response alongside them and maybe it's me being idk oversensitive or whatever I don't exactly know how to describe this.. They're not mean to me and they do talk about me in some of their convos- not in a bad way though. I've tried speaking to them about how I feel but I'm very much unable to properly describe how I feel so I kind of put it into a joking manor kind of,  but I still felt bad. I figured that I was probably the problem and it makes me feel worse. Especially at night when I have nothing to really stop me from thinking about this, it keeps me up and I can't stop myself from thinking about it, it stresses me a lot and sometimes it ends up making me cry and makes it a tad bit harder to fall asleep.

Since the first time, he’s cheated on her with two other girls.

He’s been with his girlfriend for almost 6 years now. He says that the spark is gone between him and his girlfriend and he doesn’t have a desire to even have sex with her anymore but because they live together he’s unable to break up with her. I’ve urged him to make a decision but he comes up with excuses as to why he can’t every time. He says he doesn’t see himself with his girlfriend, meanwhile, the girlfriend is thinking that he’s going to propose any day now and wanting marry him.

590,"I 22 F moved back in with my parents because of covid. I'm a university student, so this makes the most economical and practical sense.

My cousin 23 M has also moved in with us. He is a university student as well. His family lives in a different country (very different time zones) so it makes sense for him to stay stateside this semester, even if school is online. We did not know him well before this, so he is much like a stranger to us.

I've just come to really resent his presence.

1. He never talks to anyone. Not even a hello, good morning, how are you. Unless he needs something.
2. No privacy. Since he's basically like a stranger to us (our entire family), and also as he does not interact with any of us, the family home no longer feels like a home. Can you imagine having dinner with your family every day, and there's just some random person there? Who never talks but is always able to listen in on what the rest of your family is talking about?
3. For example, if any of us get in a fight with each other, it's extremely uncomfortable as if it feels like there's a spectator watching and judging us.  

   1. I'm sure we've all had our tiffs with our family members, but it's always behind the privacy of closed doors. Now it feels like we have to be careful in our own house as there's really no sound proofing or anything.

Really the loss of privacy is the biggest reason for resentment. I don't appreciate having to tip toe around him and whisper about things I could normally talk about out loud in my own home. Even stupid things, like asking my mom about a yeast infection.

The thing is, he is not with us out of necessity. His parents send him enough money every month for him to rent on his own, cover all his living costs and then some. He has gf, and will often do conjugal visits to her place for days or weeks at a time (driving his white bmw to do so).

If it's COVID he's worried about that's stupid too, because me and my parents go out to buy food stuffs so if any of us got sick it'd be inescapable.

He's moved in with us since March/April, and only yesterday declared he would move in with his gf after I very inconspicuously had a conversation about privacy in front of him.

I guess, I'm very curious people of reddit. Is this type of behavior normal? Would you, if you were in his position, move in with your relatives rather than your gf? It made a little sense at the beginning of COVID hysteria, but even then.....

In the beginning there was an opportunity to build a bit a of relationship with all of us...but somehow that never happened.",03Oct2020,1

I can only get a mediocre job in the US (I’m in telecommunications) which would essentially make it impossible to put a down payment on a house for at least a decade or more. In China, I can get similar salary but this money goes so much farther there and we could probably buy more than one apartment in the same period of time. The schooling experience would be the same (American school in China). 

The problem is:

My wife’s family are overbearing and in some ways quite toxic. They would likely show up at our place unannounced and expect us to essentially share the parenting of our son (it’s a cultural thing, but it drives me batty to have someone challenge my parenting). My wife and her sister have an extremely catty relationship, so we would have to put up with petty insults, too. In Chinese culture, we could probably avoid these toxic family members but cutting them out completely would be impossible.

600,"so I've been out of work for a while and my last job fired me due to having a pseudoseizure but they claimed it was for me having an allergic reaction. because of this, I was scared of getting a new job because they said I was unemployable. I got the guts back up and put out about twelve applications for different places and I finally got an interview to work as a cashier at a big chain hardware store. I'm really excited but really really nervous, I really want this job and I don't know when I could get another opportunity for a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

so my first question is what should I wear? I pretty much only own old teeshirts and jeans and one pair of converse since I always wear my sandals but I figure sandals are out lol. do I need to buy a new shirt? and like what kind of shirt? like polo or button up? and I have short hair should I do it like casual or fancy looking?

&amp;#x200B;

and the second question and arguably more important is I have Tourettes syndrome. around people and at work I can mostly keep it to twitches and squeaks and the occasional word but I have to tell them because as my mom says i ""look like a drug addict"". how do I bring it up without them automatically thinking I can't do the job? its a customer service job and a lot of people assume that Tourettes is just screaming obscenities and while I do have that part I have that 98% under control. 

&amp;#x200B;

and third, how do I explain why I left my old job? I had to put on my job application that I was fired and the reason and I put because I was working in a kitchen and had to go to the er twice for allergic reactions. if they ask about it should I just stick with that? or should I tell the full story about how I scared the owner's son by having a pseudo seizure so they were looking for any excuse to fire me without violating the ADA and they found it once they found out my manager didn't report my second allergic reaction because he knew what would happen (i had no idea he did that)

They'd spread lies about me and were sometimes physically abusive, one time effectively breaking my bones. That all messed with my head a lot.


We went to different universities 2 years ago, 3 of us studying the same thing. One of them will now be transferring to my uni and wants to move in with me since ""she knows me"". I don't think she realises what she did back in the day as she acts super friendly now, but then again, she was known to be ""a friendly snake"", being your friend when she needed you and crushing you the next. 


I do not want her to move in with me. It will be hard enough to have to follow classes with her, let alone have her in my safe space 24/7. I'm afraid she'll try to be friendly again, but I won't let her do that. 


Unfortunately, I do not decide whether she moves in or not. We live with 9 in our house and our landlord decides who moves in. I can't ask to have a specific person not living with us. 


She still thinks we're friends. I think she never understood that she was bullying me, and still doesn't. I do not want any contact with her, but I can't tell my former ""friend""/bully that. She might accuse me of lying and will probably spread ""her side"" to our follow students. That's happened before, and because she's so 'friendly and compassionate' (she works with children with a development disorder in her free time and volunteers, she's basically an angel of you don't know her well) people might just believe her.  I didn't go to therapy for months to let her start to get into my head again.

607,"Hello, long time lurker, first time poster here. Please excuse formatting errors, I'm typing this on mobile. Also, English isn't my first language. 

So for some context, I have a small friend group of 8 people, 3 of us being very close to each other. For the sake of anonimity, I'm going to call the other two close friends H and O. 
Our backstory is basically that H and I being best friends decided to study together in online school back in March, when our school moved online because of the pandemic. Two weeks later O joined us and we started studying together. O and I started chatting after doing the homework, for around 5-8 hours a day. We opened up to each other and we know stuff about the other that no one else does. In around 2 months he started acting weird with H, constantly picking fights with her, that would result in him saying nasty, often quite sexist things to H. 
Afterwards, he'd never apologize. I tried talking and reasoning with O, but he always blamed the whole thing on H. I admit, this is a major red flag but I overlooked it partially because he would either convince me of him being in the right or treathened to hurt himself or others  and I wanted to keep an eye out for him. 
September comes around, school starts in person and everything seems alright. O and I were talking to each other sarcastically and we'd play-fight, but never anything serious.
Until he decided to randomly ghost me (in person and online). It was weird since we never had a day without talking for at least a few minutes and he knew I had trauma surrounding a friend doing the same thing. So H and I decided not to talk to him either. If he doesn't need us, we don't need him. 
H and I started hanging out, just the two of us a lot of the times. We started having fun without him. It was honestly refreshing. H didn't get insulted daily and I finally had some alone time which I couldn't have imagined how much I needed. And O noticed that. He came up to us on Friday and basically told us that we can apologize for not talking to him and blamed the whole thing on H. I asked him why he did it. He said it was so him and  I would stop fighting. I knew he was lying. I told him I don't want to talk to him because of what he did. He just insulted H's religion and left. 
After school H told me that two people from the friend group stopped her and asked why we bully O. O told one of them that I never know what I'm talking about and simply not to take my word for anything. He also has been spreading rumours about H and I in the whole class. He also kicked H on the leg that day, so she now has a bruise on her thigh. 
After school H and I decided to talk to his other closest friend we'll call V. I mainly wanted to ask V if O is ok mentally and what his problem really was with me. She told me O is the usual mentally but he thinks I have a crush on him and not talking to me will magically solve everything. I never had any romantic feelings for him ever. He knows everything about my love life, even who I have feelings for. It's not him. 

Now, I have no clue what I should do. So please, give me some advice

She literally had to go through the billing statement and told me why I was spending much. Which is fair enough, so I tried to change how I spend and all that.

However, it seems like she has gotten on my nerves a lot. I am doing my best to not give in and react, but I don’t even know if she’s aware herself of how the way she acts can affect others.

An example is playing music. She (and my mom) claim that my other sister is playing music too loud yet she plays music just as loud. I honestly don’t mind some of the music, but she’s just kinda being hypocritical.

Also she has to keep announcing things and talking almost nonstop. I get that she can do whatever, but it’s just annoying if it has to be like 2-4+ hours long.

An example is when she would go to my mom when she was asleep to tell her that Trump has coronavirus. That was the same day, she kept telling everyone and their dog that she has so much work to do. Yet she was still kinda behind.

She kind of just puts me on the spot whenever my dad talks to her about something. She barely tries to even listen to him and just does not want to have proper discussion with him.

620,"A friend of mine (16F) has recently been coming to me (18F I’m her drum major) for her problems and at first I just thought she was really fucked up but when I was talking about it was some friends (we were planning a sort of “intervention”) we realized things weren’t adding up. 

The biggest one is that she’s been telling people she has an eating disorder, she says she starved herself for days on end and she went to a restaurant with me and some others and she ordered a 4 piece chicken kids meal ate half a tender then played with her food And just moved it around in her plate while she kept glancing up at me while doing it like she wanted me to notice and comment on it. She also told me she doesn’t eat during lunch but we found out from another person who eats with her that she eats lunch everyday, she forced one of my friends to come out with her own past struggles so she could have something to “relate with” which was really triggering for my friends but she thought it would be better for the other girl to have someone who really understands.

she also faked OCD because she says she’s going to “freak out” every time her pencils aren’t perfectly lined up on her desk (there’s a difference between mild discomfort about things and actual OCD). 

She self harms and takes pictures of it to show one of my friends as if it’s like “look I actually did it!” 

We have proof she’s faking panic attacks, and also pulling people out of marching band rehearsal so they can “help calm her down” 

She’s recently decided she has “a very mild case of Tourette’s” because sometimes she gets cold so chills when she’s not even cold. A mutual of ours has actual Tourette’s and she’s been telling stories about specific tics she’s had in the past but they obviously the mutual friends tics because I’ve known him for forever. 

I watched her pick a cold sore on her lip during a sectional rehearsal until it bled, she then squeezed it and rubbed the blood on her nostril and told the tech in charge that she had a nosebleed. She’s fake passed out during school (put her head down on a desk like she was sleeping, then didn’t answer the teachers attempts to wake her) she finally woke up and did the worst acting job of not knowing where she was and the ambulance was called, she then suddenly remembered everything and tried to refuse to go because she felt fine.

Her parents also don’t help because they believe every little thing she says so if I were to tell them what’s actually going on they most likely wouldn’t believe me. I could just cut her off but she’d use it as an excuse to self harm, I’ve seen her do that with others before and I had always taken her side and tried to comfort her but now I see why the other people left. 

She’s really hurting and upsetting me and my friends but we’re all she has left, as horrible as that sounds. None of us know what to do or how to handle the situation.",03Oct2020,1
621,"TW: mentions of trauma and depression (not specific), and slight animal abuse

Disclaimer: This was 7+ years ago when I was still a child.

My boyfriend (M21) and I (F20) are planning on moving in together in the near future (we've been dating for almost 2 years) and I know that he will want to get at least one dog. I'm not really an animal person because A) I'm allergic so I can only be around hypoallergenic animals and B) I just think they can be gross sometimes. I can see why people love them so much and I'm glad people do but it's just not really my thing. My boyfriend REALLY loves dogs and I think its really sweet but I feel bad keeping this from him.

I should probably explain myself. When I was younger I was going through some traumatic experiences and I developed depression when I was around 9 years old. I won't get into the details but I was being mentally abused by my dad and he hit me a few times as well but I don't count that as physical abuse so much. My mom was trying everything she could to have total custody over me and help me deal with my depression. 

When I was about 10-11 I got a pet dog. My dog isn't the best behaved, especially when he was younger. When he would bark a lot and wouldn't stop, when we were able to get him inside, I'd see my older family members give him a quick smack and put him in his crate for a little bit. So I would see them do this and do it as well and I wasn't exactly going light either. He never had any bruises of cuts on him after that and then after I would do it I would feel really bad and I'd hold him and pet him. When I was about 12-13 I realized how wrong it was and I stopped.

I feel terrible for what I did, and I've gone to therapy for that and the other stuff that happened in my life. I was using her as an outlet for my built up anger and I NEVER should have done that and I regret it immensely and I will never do it again. 

My boyfriend knows about all the other trauma that has gone on in my life and he has accepted me and I know he supports me. He's the sweetest and most understanding person I've ever met. We've never fought and we're very open to each other. We agree that communication is key and that's what we do in this relationship.

I know keeping this from him is wrong. A part of me wants to keep it from him because I don't want to break his trust or lose him. I know I would feel bad if we got a dog and he found out I was lying to him (I know not telling someone something isn't necessarily lying but in this case it feels like it). 

TL;DR- I was going a traumatic experience in my life and I took my frustrations out on my dog when I was 13. I know that is wrong and I feel absolutely terrible. My boyfriend wants to get a dog when we move in together, which I'm fine with but I'd feel bad if I me keeping this from him is wrong.

Please help me, I really need advise.",03Oct2020,1

624,"I bought my new boyfriends sister in law a travel cup and got her name engraved in it to personalize it for her. The cup itself wasn’t super expensive but the engraving was a bit pricy. After I received the cup back from getting it custom engraved, I accidentally scuffed it while it was in my car (careless on my part I know, I just didn’t think it would get damaged!) and I cannot get the scuff off of it. It hit something in my car that had black paint on it or something, so now there are marks on one part of it.
Granted, they aren’t super intense lines or anything but it is obviously imperfect, it looks like someone accidentally marked it with a pencil or something, but would it be tacky to still give it to her? I can’t really afford to get a new one engraved and plus I would hate to waste an entire travel cup since it’s a nice brand and has a personalized engraving on it. They’re not snobby people or anything by any means but I did want it to be perfect so I’m just feeling unsure of what to do. I am going to see them tomorrow also so I need to figure it out kind of fast. Also if anyone knows a tip to get the color scuff off, let me know! I’m trying to see if I should get a new one or just gift it anyway and apologize for the mark.

627,"So today while at work I found a corgi who looked young but smelled bad and looked skinny. She was running around our parking lot and she almost got hit a few times. She actually entered the store once and got really scared until I was able to calm her down, and once I did she wouldn’t leave my side. She put all of her trust in me to save her in those few moments. So I took her to the local vet to see if she was microchipped, she was but it wasn’t registered. In my area this normally means that the Amish people use the chips to basically tell which dog is there’s and also to use it for their puppies to know which litter they came from(AKA a puppy mill). They said they would let me know if they found the owner. 

So fast travel to later on today an Amish guy walked in and was just shopping around and he looked like he was basically meant to run a puppy mill, he asked me if I had seen his dog because another associate asked told him I knew where it was. I of course had to say yes I have seen it and where it was at since he already knew it was me who knew. He wouldn’t even refer to the corgi to a name or even to a gender, he didn’t seem to even care and wasn’t in any big hurry to go get her or anything. So now I’m left literally crying because I feel like I let the corgi down, because she trusted me enough to get in my car and go to a place of safety. I feel like I gave up my own dog to a new bad owner. What can I do to make myself not feel like a piece of shit right now? Or should I try to ask the vet to not give it back to this guy? I just need some sort of answer as for what to do. I might have some time to lie to the vet since the guy didn’t even know his own dogs microchip number so he probably won’t get it till Monday.

At first everything worked out great, he payed a bit more towards our bills than me, but it has slowly gotten to the point where we split the bills 50/50, leaving me with 50 bucks to pay for groceries. While he does pay for my groceries when my money runs out (and sometimes activities he really wants to engage in) I'm left with literally nothing, while he is right on his way to buy some new piece of tech he really doesn't need. Almost all additional money I get, eg. from my grandmother to get something for myself, goes into paying for groceries, etc. My parents urge me to talk to him about not splitting the bill 50/50 while he thinks my parents should give me more money, because I still owe him some money from all the times he had to cover my expenses at the end of a month. I don't know when I'll get a job either because of Corona.

17 [M] From South Africa with no real life social skills (My only friends are people I met online and have never met in real life.) due to growing up in a town with nobody my age. Homeschooled but my schooling stopped 1 year ago. Currently I am waiting for my parents to get internet installed in our new house so I can begin my online GED course. Due to the remote area I live in there is no work/part time jobs I can take while waiting for internet to be installed. (5th month of waiting) Our family owns 4 diffrent propertys around SA I had been speaking with my parents (Stoners) for the enite year about moving into the house we own in Cape Town once the contract with the current tenants expires with my 2 best friends who currently reside in Cape Town. After 10 months of discussing this with my parents my older sister (Favorite Child) asked for it 1 week ago and was basically just handed to her on a golden platter with no complaints and my request has all but just been forgotten after already speaking to both my friends if they would be willing to share the house (both them and their families said yes) I  feel frustrated. I've grown up in this town alone basically (Sister was allowed to move to a diffrent town at the age of 16) (If I had a issue with something in school etc. I just got told to figure it out myself) with no friends until till about 2 years ago. I've gotten to point where I feel like just packing up and disappearing I loathe my parents due to broken promise after broken promise.

640,"I just started college this semester and am living in the literal most antisocial dorm ever. My roommate is no help either as a social outlet. Everyone is moving out to the better dorms which I might do, but will decide in a few days. 

I began the rush process and have been dropped from all but 2 houses, and find out tomorrow if they dropped me or not. If I was dropped I’m seriously unsure what I’m going to do. I was hoping to use my new sorority as a social outlet but now it looks like I might not even make it through the entire process. 

My major is extremely challenging and the workload is overbearing. I’ve stayed in every Friday and Saturday doing school work because I have no one to go out with, and even if I did I couldn’t imagine how much going out would set me back on studying and schoolwork. I’m thinking about changing my major because I don’t see any break in sight. 

Overall I’m most upset about my social life. I feel like such a loser not going out but I legit have no one, and the friends I have made have found their own thing.

642,"My dad and I have an abnormal father-dughter dynamic. We hardly ever talk unless its a family dinner and even then I avoid conversation. He's a narcissist and was very emotionally/mentally abusive my whole childhood. As I was segueing into adulthood, he disowned me because I didn't follow his ""commands"" during life-altering decisions. By disown I mean, yelling and screaming, telling me to fuck myself, telling me he had wanted to get an abortion when my mom found out she was pregnant with me and wished he'd been able to convince her, that he was officially getting out of my life, that it would be the release of an unwanted burden, and finished off with ""you won't hear from me again, have a good life"". That was when I was 19. 

I didn't hear from him for years after that, but it wasn't like he just dropped me and moved on, he went around to all the friends of the family, twisted the story, and talked shit on me to the point where people were calling me out of the blue to admonish me for treating my father the way I did. Essentially my out-of-staet college financial aid was messed up becasue he spent months avoiding me about filling stuff out and sending his tax returns in. He asked my mom to get the needed loans becasue we missed the window for grants, and she said she would do that at a cheaper school. Neither of them are rolling in money and out-of-state tuition is ridiculously expensive. He wanted me to stay in that state and work on gaingin residency for two years and then go back to that school. I didn't want to take 6 years to get a college degree so I decided to no longer go to the school of his choice and to move in with my mom and work on transferring to an in-state school for the cheaper tuition. I told him i though he was part to blame and that's when he disowned me. After that debacle I hit my breaking point and didn't contact him becasue I was done begging for crumbs and pining for a normal father daughter relationship and trying to make it happen by abiding to his every whim. Thats just the tip of the iceberg- but suffice to say, we arent close. 

I moved in with my grandparents where he also lives. We have settled into a new phase where we tolerate the presence of the other and act cordially- which is a big improvement. He no longer gives me shit bc I stand my ground which he hates. However, his complete lack of interest in my life or being an integral part of it still remains. I am 100% accepting of this dynamic, as I do not expect much from him in terms of being ""fatherly"" due to past experiences. My focus is no longer on the damage he has done, but growing and healing from it. 

I have a boyfriend of two years who is fully aware of the dynamic and history between me and my dad. He is supportive and understanding. My dad knows I have a boyfriend yet has shown no interest in him, has never asked his name, occupation, or to meet him.  I do not want to offer ""fatherhood"" to him on a silver platter by doing all the father things for myself like insisting he meets my boyfriend, which in my mind is a normal thing for a caring father to do. 

My boyfriend hasn't expressed interest in meeting my dad either. I live in a compound style living situation where everybody has their own self-contained ""unit"" so my dad any boyfriend don't cross paths when he's over to see me. 

My grandma who is my dad's number one enabler wants to me to bring my boyfriend to my dad to introduce them because she thinks it will be awkward for them to see each other on the property. My argument is that they are grown men who know how to introduce themselves to new people, if my dad cared about what was going on in my life he would assert some sort of involvement or would express something other than complete indifference towards me, I accept the dynamic that exists between my father, however I am not grasping for more and if he wants more the can ask for more becasue he was they one actively and directly removed himself from my life. I truly believe he doesn't care, so I am not going to force it on him to be involved beyond what he expresses he wants... he expresses no desire to be involved. She thinks I am being mean and crazy.

643,"I work in order fulfillment where I fulfill roughly 1000 orders per 8 hour shift for 3 different departments. I am also relatively new (3 weeks). Yesterday I showed up for my shift and had only been working for about 20 minutes when the Lead of another department, with the same shift start time, came into my area (where there were 3 other managers and a second fulfillment associate who has worked there for over a year) and decided to call me out by name by saying "" u/gt465, stop messing up orders. It really slows us down over there and makes our job way more difficult."" The only problem with her statement is that I had not fulfilled any orders for her department. In that moment, I was busy fulfilling other orders for other departments so I just nodded and said ""Ok"" just because I was thinking that she's probably stressed and its just not that big of a deal for me to reply to her statement. 

Fast forward to 30 minutes later, she comes by and makes some passive aggressive comment about the difference between two products while correcting another order that was filled before my shift. I still dont respond to it, because its just not something I need to respond to. 

Then later on, after Im past the frustration, one of the managers walks in and looks directly at me and says ""You need to stop messing up orders. Its getting really frustrating."" And AGAIN, I just nod my head and say ""ok"", because I was aware that he had been dealing with some bigger issues and he was just frustrated most likely. 

Like Im not sure what the best point to stand up for myself here is. I understand all the frustration that was caused for them, but I just got constant rebukes for the prior shifts' errors. 

My main question is if I should just let this all slide, unless they try to write me up? Or should I just pull a manager aside before my next shift and give a quick explanation of not appreciating being called out, by name, for errors that I cant even be associated with? I dont think this would even be remotely serious enough to involve HR but I just thought I would throw that out there. My first choice would be to find that Lead today and just tell her that I know she had a frustrating start to her shift having to redo multiple orders, but I dont appreciate being called out in front of multiple managers when the error cant be mine.

We had both apologized and things were looking up, but then I inadvertently set her off again (genuinely did not mean to) and she started yelling at me again. I muttered under my breath walking away ""I hate my life"" (it's been a rough one but I still shouldn't have said that.)

She thought she heard me saying that I hate her, so she stomped into the living room and yelled that she hated me and that she wanted me gone. I tearfully tried to explain to her that I never said that and would never say that to her. I said it once to my mom when I was like 8, ""I hate you and I wish you were dead,"" and her look has haunted me ever since. I apologized profusely for it, but it always haunted me. It haunted me right up to a year ago when she died in September 2019 and I flashed back to that fight we had when I was a kid, wishing I could take it back.

I would never, ever, ever say that to or about my wife, or even think it. I shouldn't have said it about my life. I don't hate anyone in the world. But she won't listen to me, and she says that I'm gaslighting her when I really didn't say it. I swore on both of my dead parents' graves, I swore on my life and the life of our pets that I never said it, and she won't listen to me. So she's kicking me out.

I don't have anywhere to go or anyone I can crash with. I guess it's my fault for saying I hate my life, because now I'm being shown how much worse it can get. It's cold where I am and I don't want to sleep on the street.

Does anyone know what to do? I tried to apply at quick loans or cash advance places online but my credit is so shot that everyone is auto-denying me. I have an overdrawn bank account, no way to get a loan, nowhere to go. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm in a nightmare. And the worst part is my wife screamed in my face that she hated me and I never even said that to her. She's the person I love most in the world and I'm being punished for something I never said.

She gave me things to work on, things to do to make our marriage better. I did all of them. Doing more of the housework than I was before, finally managed to land a job after months of trying, applying to others so I can get a second job, I've been kinder and more patient, slower to anger, and we get in one fight where I said I hate my life because she was mean to me and we're behind on all our bills and I've got new back pain, and I shouldn't have said that I hate my life, but now I'm being punished for something I never said. I've never said anything even close to that mean to her, I've never laid a finger on her, I have yelled in the past and I've stopped doing that since. Everything was about to get better and now I have less than nothing. I feel like I'm in hell.",03Oct2020,1
646,"So I posted a similar question in r/businessschool already, and am just waiting for a response or two so figured to try here as well.

I’m currently a freshman in college with an intended major in Biology on the pre-med track. However, in a span of 4 weeks (lol), I’ve realized that I just like the sciences simply because it all comes easy to me. I don’t really know if I could handle all the years of school that would come with trying to become a doctor. I’ve always been interested in business and have had multiple business ventures throughout my 18 years of living, but never really took it seriously.

My university doesn’t offer Business Administration as a major. The only options are: Business Analytics (which doesn’t interest me), Finance (w/ multiple different concentrations), Operational Management, and Marketing. I need to choose one and then plan on minoring in Public Health.

My dad has his MBA and figured that a major in Operational Management would be best for my new career path plan. However, Marketing sticks out to me more, but I don’t really know if it’s a good major and would give me what I’d need to know for MBA school.

Either way, I could just take electives for either one and major in the other, but I’m just stuck between which one would make the most sense in the long run. I don’t want to change my major more than this 1 time lol.

P.S. I know I should major in whatever I like and my dad told me either way he’s fine with whatever decision I make because he’s not the one in college right now, but I just want some outside opinions as well. Thanks!",03Oct2020,1

649,"Disclaimer: this post may sound very self-centered but I need some help.

So, my parents came from an underdeveloped state in India to Delhi(the capital city) with a very modest job in hand. They grew, improved, and got to a point where they could educate us(me &amp; an older brother) in decent schools &amp; colleges.

Now, I've been one of the top students throughout my life, (yes. I'm very modest.) and got into a good college (B Tech course, Computer Science).

However, I'm always lagging behind all my peers irrespective of how much I work, how much i try to socialize and get to know about various possibilities, I somehow end up with a much more average reward as compared to my peers who have parents or cousins or uncles who are doing very well for themselves and have a lot of knowledge in the field.

I always find myself at the very end of this line of 'elite' kids who have a much much much broader idea about the world and the field we're in. This makes me die inside as I see myself clearly working wayyy harder than most of these people, but being unable to grab opportunities which I simply didn't know about.

What do I do? I feel like there's no point in working anymore if at the end of the day, I have to accept the fact that fate has a lot to do with all this. I feel like I just need to stop and accept being average, because there seems to be no way to catch up with a generation.


TL;DR

I'm pissed that people with relatives with knowledge in the field can easily get by while I (who has no such relatives) have to work hard to get even the slightest of genuine opportunities.",03Oct2020,1

My boyfriend and I are long distance and we have been together for almost 2 years now. We’re both gamers and that’s how we originally met, by gaming. But he is a hardcore gamer compared to me. For the past week and a half, he’s been neglecting me for this new game that came out (Genshin Impact) and he’s been playing it all day everyday. I’ve told him how I felt about it and he just doesn’t care. This isn’t the first time it’s happened too. It happens almost every single time a new game comes out. We’ve been arguing everyday for the past week about his addiction and he is making no effort to change himself. Last night I broke up with him to see how he’d react, and he was and still is unphased by it. What should I do? Do I give him another chance or should I leave him for good?

1) English isn't my first language, so I'm truly sorry if there are mistakes.
2) Slight mentions of anxiety and harassment
3) Long post ahead
I met my group of friends some years ago, when I was really struggling. It was simple: I was reading a book about my favourite music genre, they noticed and started a conversation with me. I was so excited to get to know them, because during that time I didn't have friends. But it seems like the only thing we had in common was our music taste. It all started great, they included me in their group. We would go out sometimes, make jokes and laugh, share food and songs together, etc. I would help them every single time they felt down, suicidal or when having a mental breakdown. I even did research about how to proceed when someone is having a panic attack, because one of my friends had them. I thought that was what friends did, help themselves when bad things happen. I would invite them to my house, get them to places with my car and lots of other favours and things they needed. I would give them advice and hugs when they needed it. But some things were wrong, and I didn't realize until this quarantine, where I had enough time to think about all this. As we couldn't go out of our houses, the connection between us suddenly stopped. They stopped talking to me, replying to my messages, and doing all the things we normally did abruptly. I firstly found it strange, but I thought that maybe they were busy and couldn't answer me. It doesn't seem like that. They are still talking to and seeing each other, doing all the things we did but without me.
I think what made me realize all of this was my birthday. It was months ago. I stood nervously all day waiting for a call or even a simple message congratulating me. But I didn't receive either of them. On top of that, I turned an age which is (or was?) very  important in our friend group. When all of my friends turned this age, I worked my butt off to get money to buy them a nice present. We would put all the money we could get together and we would all buy a present that we knew the birthday person wanted. As you can imagine, that also didn't happen either. I was just so excited to guess what they could've surprised me with, but I didn't even receive a sweet. I know friendship isn't about material things (honestly speaking, it doesn't hurt me as much as the not-messaging-me-for-my-birthday thingy), but I never received a gift from them on my birthday or on another date. And I tried to always get them at least a little pressie, so it saddened me a bit. So as I was all dissapointed sitting on the couch, I realized they also weren't on my rough times either. When I was sad or stressed, they used to tell me that I was overreacting. When my social anxiety surfaced, they told me to stop overthinking and that it wasn't that serious. Years ago, a mate used to insult me, kick me and push me. They told me they had to stay neutral and couldn't do anything. They reduced it to a friendly way of communication. Luckily, his stopped a couple of years ago.
But still, I miss them. Even though there were times like this, we also had some happy moments. I don't know if I should try to talk to them again, at least to know what was the reason that they left me out of the group. We never fought, we never had an argument, so I don't get what went wrong. I haven't spoken to them since their birthdays (I decided to wish them a good day despite the situation. They responded with a thank you and then the conversation ended).

659,"I am 14 and an only child. My father and mother divorced each other when I was about six because my mother found out that my dad had basically started a new life with another woman without telling us, I never really liked him after that. I have basically lived with my mom since then and I see my dad during weekends and vacations. My dad has his own family with two kids and I have become pretty close to them, they are basically my brother and sister. My dad is kind of narcissistic and very short-tempered, he is also very rich because he owns a glass manufacturing company. On the other hand, my mother is a nice person and very friendly, she doesn't really have a good job and my dad is paying for my school. For the past 7 years I have had no problem with living with my mom and once in a while spending weekends and vacations with my dad, but that started to change when my dad started trying to get me to start living with him and we constantly started having arguments about it. My parents both love me but absolutely hate each other. My dad often calls my mom words with the equivalent of bitch, cunt, and shitface, my mother does the same to my dad. The whole situation worsened when I found out a few days ago that my dad and his family are moving to the capital of my country (the same city I live in). And coincidentally it is very close to the apartment I live in. He recently started saying passively-aggressively that soon ill realize that it would be much better living with him.

I love my mother so much more than my father and I would honestly never move in with my father, but he is the person who is providing financial support for both of us (he didn't leave us with much when the divorce happened) and my mother is having a hard time financially getting back on her feet. My mother would be absolutely heartbroken if I left her, but my brother and sister also love me very much. But if I don't go with my father he could potentially cut us off and I would have to say goodbye to all the people I have been friends with since I was like 4 in school.

661,"I have suspected my friend/roommate (we are both 18f and go to the same school) was lying on a few occasions, but never had solid proof. She would often tell a story about something that happened to her on one day, but then on a different day tell it again and add some really astonishing detail. Like one day she would say “I went to this friends house and he told me he had a crush on me, it was really awkward”, and then another day she would say the same thing but then add “oh and he also just came in to the room naked when he told me.” It always seemed like she was just trying to make herself more interesting, but I still decided for a long time to give her the benefit of the doubt. Then a few weeks ago, we started having problems with wasps being out on the balcony of our place. When she found out, she told me that we had to keep the balcony and windows closed at all times now until we got the problem dealt with, because she was extremely allergic to wasps. I said it was no problem, I would never want to make her feel unsafe. She proceeded to tell me about a time she was stung and went into anaphylactic shock, and how she was all alone and would’ve died if she hadn’t had he epipen on her. We talked about it for a while and I asked her questions to make sure I knew what to do if she was stung. I said something like “oh yeah don’t you always shoot the epi pen in your thigh?” And she responded “No, I had to shoot it where I was stung in my upper arm, so the medicine could get there quick enough.” That was when I knew she was lying, maybe not about being allergic to wasp stings but definitely about the severity of her allergy. I work in childcare and I have had training done for administering epipens, I knew that was not how it worked. I even looked at some medical website to make sure. I was pretty mad and weirded out at this point and wanted to confront her. I mean, of all the things to be dishonest about?? But I still thought she was maybe just confused, and not flat out lying. So a few days later I said “Hey by the way, where do you keep your epipen so I can help you if you get stung?” She responds “Oh, I don’t have one right now...my parents think they are too expensive.”, stammering and not making eye contact the whole time. That confirms for me her whole story is BS. I know her parents are very concerned about her wellbeing. She suffers from mental health disorders and they pay for her doctors, medication, and therapy. She has some chronic stomach issues and they pay for the all the medical stuff she needs in that area as well. She doesn’t work or pay for anything she owns, he parents do. There is no way they think an epipen, for their daughter who has gone into anaphylactic shock before, is “too expensive” when they will buy her literally everything else she needs. So now that I know this, should I confront her? Why would someone lie about having an allergy? I don’t want to end the friendship but I can’t take someone lying to me. If she is lying about this, she probably has lied about other things too. I’m at a loss here.",03Oct2020,1

Plus, I was going through Insane anxiety problems. (People say that grade 10 is the hardest year in high school). I've done my comics as one of my coping mechanisms, and even despite my anxiety, I still pushed through so I don't want this comic project to be for vain. Also I post concept art and other art on other sites, including this one. I've asked people help and they keep saying that to get your art out there, just post it on as much sites as possible. I've done that but nothing came out of it.

sorry if this sounds petty but I've seen other art that looks below average, and average quality and somehow, they still get a ton of comments and constructive criticism.  I want my comic series and other art to be high quality and Attention grabbing but one of my most effective methods of motivation to continue is to get some comments and constructive criticism on my stuff. I've posted 5 of my comics on DeviantArt but I haven't gotten any advice on how to make it better or motivating comments. I'm just one person. This is an indie comic I'm making. I've drawn and written it probably for over 500 days, and I was in high school no less. I'm not asking for  exaggerated worship and praise over my comic, I just want to know other easier, effective and perhaps cheaper ways to advertise my comic. I don't know how to make a website and I'm aware that posting your stuff on forums that aren't related to it at all makes potential people veer away from it in annoyance.

He says it happens about twice a month. He’s very frustrated and wants to know whoever is doing this.

He has a few hunches of who it might be. But some of these feuds happened long enough ago, that timeline wise it doesn’t make sense for such a late retaliation.

He has started to implement cameras. But he’s 70 and isn’t computer/tech proficient.

He came flying out of the office, screaming at me like I've never heard before. I can't stress enough how completely inappropriate it was. I grew up in an abusive household and I have never had someone scream at me like that.

I went straight to ownership and explained what happened. Ownership was sympathetic, agreed he had no ability to change my duties, and expressed seemingly real concern about the encounter and said that they had raised the issue of anger management with the supervisor before, etc. Ownership gave me the rest of the day off with pay.

On Monday, when I go back into work, I'm a little concerned that the supervisor is going to want to talk first thing when there is no one else in the office. I'm a woman, my supervisor is male. Is it ok if I ask that a third person be present? I am no shrinking violet and can handle myself but his rage over a slammed door was scary. Advice?",03Oct2020,1
674,"I have no problems opening up to acquaintances, online friends, even complete strangers. But when it comes to opening up to those closest to me, especially face to face, I just freeze up out of anxiety.

This is starting to be a huge problem, its resulted in poor communication in relationships and close friendships, I can't talk about my needs or feelings with those who may legitimately be able to help, its resulted in me not dealing with issues I'm having in my life because I know there's someone in my life ill inevitably have to talk to about it.

675,"summary: im working on a big painting for one of my friends but im doubtful if it’s worth it, as she hasn’t been a great friend to me lately.

So i’m an artist and I’m about 30% of the way into this huge painting that I’m gifting for my friend’s birthday coming up soon. It’s an image I know she’d really really love. But it’s a lot more effort than usual as I’d never painted this type of style or image before. 

It’s gonna take a big chunk of time away from my main art. She has no idea yet that I’m working on this for her. 

This friend has really disappointed me this year and there’s been a few issues. She blamed me at some point in the summer for not prioritizing her, meanwhile I was helping my family move into our new home, working full time, and my sister was in the hospital having heart surgeries. It turned into a way bigger issue and she even accused me of trying to purposely avoid her... Later after this, I had a very private conversation with this friend about something in my life that had been bothering me, and she ended up airing it out to a whole party we were at, making a joke out of it. 

Also, when it comes to my birthday she rarely ever gets me a gift and if she does, it’s usually something small she’ll buy for me, something I’ve been needing. Like paint or a digital memory card. 

Im conflicted whether I should be a good friend/ “bigger person” and push through this painting for her.. or just scrap it and buy her something small.",03Oct2020,1
676,"Today, my mom asked me, ""What would you do if someone you knew saying that they didn't want to live because they broke up with their partner?""

I told her that I was only 15 and therefore did not want to think about that kind of situation yet (I actually have had to have these conversations with some of my friends, but I do not trust my mom with this information). My mom said she was asking me because her sister (my aunt) was upset about her boyfriend. This conversation ensued:

Mom: She needs to learn not to take things so seriously. \[Some other comment about the breakup\]

Me: I mean, I would be much more concerned over the fact that she does not want to *live* than the fact that she broke up.

Mom: Yes, but she doesn't *mean* it. She takes everything so seriously. All she does is complain about him \[boyfriend\], and she never takes my advice.

Okay, first of all: I have done a *lot* of research on how to confront someone in this type of situation. I have also been trained as a camp councilor on how to handle this situation, should the emergency arise. However, even if I had not, **I think it is common sense that you do not tell someone that they are just being dramatic!** On top of that, I know from experience and from being present during her conversations that my mom often offers advice when not asked, and then she gets mad when the advice is not followed. Thus:

Me: But did she ask for your advice?

Mom: Huh?

Me: Did she ask for your advice? Maybe she just wanted someone to listen to her.

Mom: \*getting annoyed\* Well, I can't just sit around and, what, listen to her complain all day?! 'He did this, he did that,' I'm tired of hearing about him! We can't all just go through life complaining all the time! I don't want to do that!

This is where I got annoyed. See, my mom has the habit of treating me as the dumping ground for her emotions. She tells me all her problems with my dad, her siblings, and her work. As a kid, I loved this, because it made me feel mature. However, I eventually started hating hearing her talk bad about my family. It was different for the people I did not know (for example, her coworkers), but with loved ones, it was taxing. One time, I carefully and *politely* asked her not to tell me about the problem because I did not want to hear her speak bad about my dad that day. Her reaction?

""You're my daughter! It's your *job* to listen to me! If you don't listen to me, then who will?""

What.

I stopped saying anything and simply let her dump her problems on me, even on the days when I did not have the mental energy to deal with her. In addition to this, she has the habit of lashing out when she is mad. She says very hurtful things, but according to her,

""I shouldn't have to apologize. You should be able to tell when I mean it and when I don't.""

Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds to me like she's basically saying, ""When I am in a bad mood, I should be able to say whatever I want to you, and you should just let me do it without taking it seriously."" In other words, I should just be her emotional punching bag, which **she has actually admitted to using me as in the past!**

In addition to this, I am not allowed to feel negative emotions.

Fear? *""Well, what do you want me to do about it? It's all because you aren't mindful enough.""* (I have literally been diagnosed with anxiety)

Anger? *""You choose your feelings. You shouldn't be so sensitive.""* (Also, I have been explicitly that I am not allowed to get angry or annoyed with her)

Sad? \*yelling\* (Need I say more?)

So, back to the main conversation: apparently, she can't bear to listen to someone else be upset for once.

Me: \*sick of holding in fury for the past year\* Why can't you? I do it all the time.

Mom: Excuse me?

Me: \*calmly\* Why can't you just listen? I do it all the time when you want me to. You complain about Dad and all your siblings, and you don't see me getting mad at you.

Mom: \*flies of the handle\*

The rest I will summarize, but apparently, me making *one* passive-aggressive comment is terrible (so, I'm assuming that we will be ignoring the fact that she makes several *openly* aggressive comments whenever she is in so much as a bad mood) means I am a terrible daughter. Yep, I am an atrocious daughter, and I'm supposed to just listen to her, but I can't do it right. Then, she started telling me how she would *never* talk to me about her problems again, just I watch!

This is where I started feeling a little guilty, but I am sick of this routine happening whenever I try to tell her about anything (and usually, it actually happens when I confront her calmly):

1. I hesitantly confront her about something.
2. She tells me that I am wrong to feel that way.
3. She tells me how I am a terrible daughter, and how, *now*, she will *never* do \[insert thing\] again.
4. I feel guilty and take it all back.
5. She forgives me.
6. Things go exactly back to the way they were before.

I am just so. F-wording. Done.

Does anyone here think I am just being a \[insert bad word of choice\] drama queen? Does anyone have advice on how I can tell who is at fault?",03Oct2020,1
677,"A few months ago I started a new job in the kitchen.. everything going good. One of the cooks is this girl who’s a year older than me and we get along great. And I consider her attractive. I know she’s taken so I didn’t think much of wanting her. Yet overtime I think yeah I like her. At first we didn’t talk much. After a while we did and got along great. I really enjoy her company. Oddly enough I think she may like me too even tho she’s taken (Just from noticing certain things she does). She told me she has depression and I have a gut feeling she may have some other mental illness, however I can’t assume. After she opened up about that is when I began talking about my past experiences with my mental health (I’m doing way better mentally now as I quit doing drugs which I did for 3 and a half years straight) and I think that’s when she started to feel comfortable around me and open up.We talk a lot and she sends me pictures of what’s she’s doing almost everyday at random times, which I don’t mind at all and enjoy. I also think maybe she’s getting bored/tired of her current relationship as she’s been with her BF for 3 years. Last mutual shift we had she said my BF wants to meet you. I asked why she said. You’re an odd but really interesting person to be around. She straight up told me I first I thought you were weird but once ya get to know you you’re great. I am of mixed mind on this. One thing I will say is I will absolutely not hit on her or try to get in bed with her while she’s taken as I consider that straight up inappropriate. Yet I kinda want to be around her more.",03Oct2020,1
678,"For some quick context i've known this person for the past 2 years when we were both 16 and very quickly did she become someone who understood me as a person and a best friend. November 2019 she told me that she had a thing for me which I accepted and January 2020 was when we had an official relationship start, which was also my first relationship. In April she broke up with me because she had a lot of fears build up like impermanence and going off to college and not being able to see me for months, which I accepted and let her go. She still wanted to talk to me because she didn't want lose a friend, which I also accepted because i felt the same way. 

She's a wonderful person but she has an overwhelmingly pessimistic attitude that I couldn't handle. She also say things like assuming I was completely dependent on her despite me never having to ask her for help with anything (I think it was because of the way I expressed myself to her). She would casually start insulting me in the middle of a conversation making me feel shut out, she's a brutally honest person but it just felt hurtful. Over time this would make me feel less comfortable opening up to her. A month before she left for college she told me she wanted a last kiss which i was originally hesitant on accepting but it just lead to us making out. Around the same time after that she would randomly start getting touchy with me which after that, when she stopped seeing people because she was busy leaving for school she says on her instagram story that she likes to lead guys on for the attention. When she finally left for school she stopped consistently talking to me. Part of me feels like she never loved me but I think that is just something I tell myself to hopefully get over things.

Even with this in mind she is still one of my only friends, she is still someone I like to talk to and would tell anything and everything, and I think she still wants to see me during her Thanksgiving break (I say assume, because she said something about seeing a friend of ours, and all 3 of us usually hang out together).

679,"i live in southeast texas, and i am white. i dont say the n word and believe no one other that poc should say the n word but i believe poc can use it if they want to.

yesterday my white boyfriend was singing along to rap music and said the word every time it was said in the song. i was absolutely confused as hell, cause he's really sweet and i know he's not racist. when i called him out on it he said its only a slur if you say it with ""er"" and that since he only said it with ""a"" it was fine and didnt mean anything.

i really disagree with that and dont think he should be saying it at all. 

today i brought this up to a friend to confirm i wasn't the only one who thought he shouldn't be saying it. the conversation ended pretty quickly when in her arguement for why no one at all (invluding poc) should say it, she casually stated that african americans and white people are both EQUALLY responsible for slavery as a whole. it was then that i realized she's insane and i def needed a second opinion from someone other than her.

682,"So I am somewhat new to posting to Reddit, but I'll try not to make this too long. So a little backstory....

My now fiance (lets call him Samuel) and I have been together for over 6 years. He is my rock and i love him to death. He recently proposed to me while we were on a vacation at the beach. I was so shocked and happy (of course i said yes). 

I of course had no idea about him wanting to propose, I also had no clue that our close friends knew about it. Originally, my fiance and I were planning a normal vacation and told my best friend (lets call her Tara), and our other friend (Henry) that they should come, being as we all worked together and desperately needed a break from work. Tara approached me about inviting her boyfriend of a couple months (Jason) who also works with us and I really liked. We said of course, it would be fun. We have all known each other for over a year and we hang out all the time. 2 months ago Jason and Tara started dating and they both seemed happy.

So the plan was simple.....Samuel and I were getting there on a Friday (the day he proposed) and Tara and Jason would get there Sunday, as well as Henry. We had so many plans and ideas for what we could do. I really wanted Tara and I to have a girls day (I know that sounds cliché but she's my buddy and I figured the guys could go do some bro stuff, idunno) Plus i was so excited about being engaged that I wanted her and I yo go celebrate.

Soo Sunday roles around, Samuel and I were walking to neet Tara and Jason at a restaurant near their hotel (they arrived wayyy before Henry, also at a different hotel that's over 30 mins away). We were sort of annoyed because they were totally wasted already and hadn't even gotten ready as Samuel and I had already arrived at the restaurant. So we get their, and can't get ahold of them.....nothing.... Finally after 20 minutes, Tara calls me FRANTICALLY crying. I swear I'm not being dramatic. I immediately start panicking and ask what's up. Here is the summary of what happened....

She and Jason were drunk and started arguing, then it becomes worse and Jason punches a hole in the hotel wall... I told her to immediately leave the room and go to the boardwalk outside the hotel. Samuel and I hurry down to their hotel and find them outside arguing. Samuel and I comfort them individually and try to see what happened. They were so drunk and were not making sense. They both had slightly different versions of what started the fight. Tara said it was all his fault because he got too drunk and started acting weird.  Where Jason said she started it by calling him a b**ch and would not communicate with him. How it happened wasn't as much of a concern as much as making sure everyone was safe.... but one things for sure....there was a big hole in the wall...

Now before anyone says ""why would you listen to what Jason said???"" Please understand I do NOT condone violence in any way. My father was abusive and I don't f**k with it at all. I was shocked when i heard Jason did this because I've known him for a while, I didn't believe him over Tara, it was obvious he punched the wall. They BOTH have some really toxic traits and honestly when they started dating I was nervous because I felt they weren't going to be good for one another, but I wanted to be supportive. I know they are good people, and I love them both. I have had arguments with both of them in the past and I know that they both do not ""play fair"" and they can be bad with communication. Now Im not perfect obviously, and we all have things that we need to work on.. So I always try to be understanding with people.


So after a few hours they eventually calm down and talk. We refused to leave the hotel until they were calm.  After a while, Henry gets to his hotel and we slightly fill him in on what happened (Tara just told him there was an argument). We all eventually go to a restaurant (it was so awkward) Tara kept crying and Jason kept trying to order beer, which we told him might not be a great idea. But we tried to keep the mood light. Jason and Tara leave the restaurant and say they wanted to be alone. I told her to message me because i wanted to make sure she was okay. Henry felt bad and wanted to save the night so we went and got drinks.

The following day we all tried to get breakfast but Tara says they were going somewhere alone. Around 2pm we meet up to play mini golf. Its still so weird and there's tension but again, we tried to make it fun. Throughout the game, Tara kept making jokes at my expense, which we mess with each other and joke around but it kind of made me feel weird, given the situation. After we played for about an hour Tara says how they were about to leave and go home. I was honestly sad because we didn't get to do anything together at all. They eventually left.

Henry and I talked about the situation and he said it was selfish of them to not be able to keep it together for me since they knew Samuel was proposing to me. I don't know how I feel to be honest. I am more mad at Jason i think... And I feel selfish for thinking she owes me an apology but then again I feel that they should have been able to keep it together for 36 hours. Then part of me feels horrible because how could they have known it would happen? The one thing I do know is their relationship is toxic.

This is somewhat of a side note but I do honestly feel that Tara is someone that holds a grudge. Like if this happened to her, she would never speak to the person again. I also think she won't be the first one to talk about it (shes stubborn AF) We all work together so it will be tense no matter what. Part of me wants to talk to her about it but im not sure if I should. Am I being crazy or selfish? I know everyone has bad moments but this was something Samuel had planned for sooo long. Please tell me what to do....

TLDR: My best friend and her bf got into a fight that lead to him punching a hole in a wall right after I got engaged.",03Oct2020,1

My question is this should I email my professor? I am in an intro to creative writing Class, so we were post to do a peer review for this project that we are working on.

In short I was pretty much the only one in my group that did anything other than posting the project. 

Should I email my professor and see if they are willing to give my advice for the project?

Earlier this year I adopted 2 cats ( a mama and her kitten) because at the time I thought I was a cat person. Unfortunately I didn't do any research about owning a cat (like those 'Things I wish before I owned a cat' youtube videos) cause I had cats when I was 9 and I thought it was nice so I wasn't ready for what i got myself into which I take full responsibly for.

Overtime I realized that owning a cat wasn't for me at all. I have a lot of work to do at school, not a lot of free time ( I got the cats on a school break) and I don't find caring for them as fulling as I thought it would be.

687," I  recently got into my ideal master's program in the US. Things have been  progressing well, and I've been able to attend classes from home. I  really begun to have problems when I realised I wasn't happy anymore.

I  was excited at first, but seeing all the awful stuff in the news  (racism, climate change, etc.) has really robbed me of any hope for the  future. On top of that, I took out loans to pay for it, and the state of  financial inequality makes me feel like I'll never pay it back. I try  not to get sucked into the pessimism of subs like [r/LateStageCapitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/) or [r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/)  but they're making more sense to me these days. I have a pretty  thorough understanding of the international system (that's what I'm  studying) and everything just seems fucked.

Lastly,  although I'm an American, I'm also black. I've never had any real  experiences with blatant racism and I don't know what to expect or how  to deal with it. I've never lived in the US for longer than 3 months, so  I've never really felt like an african-american. I don't know what the  impact will be on my life or how to react to it. Its scary to think that  you're whole life can be ruined just because of the colour of your  skin. How do I deal with the police, or getting followed in a store or  with a racist boss?

Colourism in  my country is a bit easier to navigate if you know what to do, and a lot  of it is less about the colour of your skin and moreso about being  close to some concept of ""whiteness"". It feels like a white man can be  anything he wants, but a black man can only be a white man.

I'm an 18-year old guy who recently moved with my parents to a different country, i.e the US. My parents have always had somewhat oldish views on how you should proceed with your school and life, my mom especially. I have personally always had some difficulties speaking with my parents about  what I want to do with my life. Currently I have started community college in the US and don't have trouble with school, today however I told my mom that I was thinking about going back to the country I'm originally from, as school would continue to be online next semester. When I mentioned this my mom immediately got angry and asked me if I had any plan about what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to work for a year and then do half a year as a gap year. In those 6 months I would travel with my friends and to take a break from school and then start university in my own country. 

She told me off and said that she didn't want to discuss this as she believes it to be a waste of time and I would be ruining my future. If my mother was a person I actually believed to understand my reasons for wanting to go back, I would tell her why I wanted to go back. The reason I don't believe this is that neither of my parents have ever given me any kind of emotional support, which I will sum up to the fact that my mother doesn't believe in therapy and my dad said that the reason I had suicidal thoughts  was because of ghosts. I struggled with these suicidal thoughts for 3 years from I was 14 till I was 17 and the only reason I don't have these thoughts anymore is because I have absolutely amazing friends. I seriously believe that both my parents need therapy but that is not why I want advice.

Currently I'm considering buying a plane ticket back to the country I am from so that I can do whatever the hell I want. I have money tucked away and I know that my best friends will help me out if I choose to go back. I will of course speak with them before I do so. Though my parents are amazing in some aspects I feel that my mental health is degrading as I don't have the same support I had in my own country, I do have friends that I do stuff with but they pretty much know nothing about me. They are only guys and I usually open up more to my girl friends(friend-zone space included). I want advice on whether or not I should just buy this ticket from my own money to go around the hassle of discussing with my parents and rely heavily on my friends for a while. 

I don't have a problem severing my ties to my parents if need be but I still like the rest of my family such as my brother(who has moved out already and lives in my country) and still want contact with them.

First of all, he always gets on people's nerves. He whistles really loud at home, and I can't concentrate at all. When people ask him to stop, he just ignores them. His whistling is so high-pitched and off-pitch that it makes me very uncomfortable. He also has bad eating habits. When we eat, he eats with his bare hands, and he often leaves a ring of sauce around his mouth. He sometimes drops food on his clothes, and he continues to wear the dirty clothes, even though he has tons of other clothes. For example, if my mom cooks a lasagna, he would eat with his bare hands. It's just terrible when he does that.

And when he takes a shower, he spends about 30 minutes in there, and uses up all the hot water. He leaves his dirty razor and dirty underwear on the shower floor. You won't believe how many times people have stepped on his razor and cut their skin by accident. He throws his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor, and it's really gross. When he brushes his teeth, he leaves the water on the whole time, and he literally leaves the used floss hanging on the towel rack to dry. I don't see why he has to reuse the floss; it's super gross.

The worst thing is that he has digestive problems. He constantly farts, and it's really loud. It's a really gross, wet sound, and it smells bad as well. He drinks milk straight out of the jug, which probably makes his farts stinky. He has an ugly unibrow, and it's really thick. It's so ugly, and he needs to get it fixed. He burps a lot, and he burps when he's around other people.

He uses around 70 rolls of toilet paper each day. He just wads it up and throws it in the toilet bowel, and he doesn't bother to flush afterward. He does it at other people's houses, and it's extremely embarrassing. He stomps loudly on the stairs, and he farts in front of people. He wears a pair of really skinny gray sweatpants, and he constantly plays with the Velcro on the pockets. He doesn't apologize for grossing others out, and he just laughs at people when they complain that he is gross.

When my dad gets angry, he burps and farts about 150 times a minute. He storms up and down the stairs, yelling the whole time. He often takes a book and smashes the kitchen table with it, and then he   drags me and my siblings to bed, ,even though it's only 4 or 5 in the afternoon. I don't see why he has to punish us when we did nothing wrong. He also throws stuff around the house and threatens to divorce my mom when things go wrong. He's really intimidating, and he's really annoying as well. I can't believe he is my dad.",03Oct2020,1

696,"So this might come across self entitled or selfish but I’m so upset right now. I should give a bit of a back story. 

I haven’t had the best couple years in terms of jobs, been at uni for 4 years getting a Master’s and haven’t been able to find anything after it. I won a serious amount of money and I absolutely wasted it all, My parents have been paying for my rent for at least a year now and yes I do feel bad for not being able to contribute because I wasted all my money. 

But I’ve just moved back in with them and started working in the business I’ve worked a full 2 months within their multiple pubs and restaurants and been paid £400 for the first month and £300 for the second month. I’m £2k into my overdraft and I just feel im never going to be able to get out of it. 

I absolutely understand my current financial situation is the fault of my own and I just feel I’m now being punished for that, which you know is okay I suppose but I just feel so shit about everything at the moment. I can’t seem to find a job in my profession and working with my parents is not really doing anything financially. I know my parents are trying to teach me a financial lesson on how to value money but I just feel destroyed I’ve worked literally full time doing long shifts and looking after the business to get not much in return. 

Honestly reddit am I being too childish and selfish? I know I need to learn the value of money but I just feel so mugged off, give me help teach me how to handle money, don’t just under pay me considerably because now I don’t even want to work.",03Oct2020,1
697,"My title sounds a little bit more simplistic than what is truly going on in my head but I wonder often if what I am doing now is really a solid choice of career. I just landed a job and I’m making more money now than I ever have and I love the company and my coworkers so much and my boss has made it clear he sees a lot of room for advancement. In fact, it’s easier than my last position and I get paid more for it. The best part is my family can now afford things we need and even some of the little treats we don’t need but just want on occasion.

However, I can’t help but think that I’m not using my degree at all and I have so many great skills. Let’s just say it’s more of an analysis type job (in a really good and solid industry) and I’m more of a social and free spirited type person. I get a certain level of pleasure out of it because I get to help and support people and that really fulfills me but otherwise it’s not an intrinsically challenging or interesting position.

I took several of those free personality tests online (I know, they’re kinda hokey) and they all suggest vastly different careers than the job I am in now. They are all within the spectrum of what I went to school for and what I pictured doing. I had a job within my career field right out of college and burned out pretty fast but I always thought it could have been the company and my own inability to set work-life balance priorities straight. 

I’m older and miles more mature. I have a family now and I’m in a different place in life than when I graduated college. I can’t just go grab a low paying internship or follow a passion project. I want to enjoy my kid and my spouse and all that we are working together to build.

My greatest happiness is supporting my family and finally getting to a certain level of financial freedom and happiness. This was one of my goals coming into 2020 and so I feel very proud that I’ve accomplished this after years of debt and instability.

So, should I just be another cog in corporate America or should I leave to do something that fits my personality and passions? Am I way over-thinking this?",03Oct2020,1

700,"Probably cliché feeling of emptiness, blah blah. But I don’t know this time it feels legit, like I’ve said something similar before but what I probably meant was that I was tired of being sad. This time, I genuinely feel absolutely nothing in life anymore apart from occasional study related stress, which doesn’t make sense since I stopped having hopes and ambitions. You can say this is a depressive episode, but I’ve had those in the past, I usually go on a self destructive spree, like smoke a lot and drink till I puke my guts out, but right now, that’s not the case at all, in facts I haven’t had a cigarette in a week, and a drink in two. This past week and a half has been identical, I wake up, drink coffee, go to uni, come back, eat, do a homework, play something quick like among us, or watch a show or something with no enthusiasm whatsoever, soon as I get a little bit tired I go straight to bed. In facts, I’ve been trying to stay up late in the weekends, but I find myself too tired to do that. My friends always ask me to hangout, I make up excuses like I’m tired or whatever. Ever since the last time I had intercourse and couldn’t finish too, I stopped being attracted to girls too, which is funny cause now I can talk to any girl without thinking about it, like this girl I used to find super hot before but I was never able to say a word to her, now we talk on a daily basis but it doesn’t get me excited. My parents are always calling me to talk and I’m like, sorry I honestly have nothing to say. Even when my sisters call to put on their kids, whom I usually get excited to talk to, I just decline them. Yesterday my best friend whom I haven’t spoken to in a month called, and I was just like yeah yeah cool good to hear from you.

702,"Possibly relevant personal information first, I am a 17 year old straight guy.

I kinda got rejected by a girl. It's more complicated then that, but that's the basic jist of what happened. The two of us were planning on meeting up this Saturday, but she's been acting kinda strangely and seems to want to change those plans. Seems like hanging out with me is a chore she has to get through rather then something she'd enjoy. 

Either way, all of this really frustrated me. It's not her fault though. She has every right to like someone else and be with them. I never really allowed myself to get to attached to her as a crush anyways. However, it still left me feeling angry. I've been struggling with my mental health over the last year and I feel a lot better now. I understand that my fear is a natural reaction and that from that fear came out anger, frustration and other bad thought. I've lost trust in her and feel like I don't wanna have anything to do with her anymore.

So what should I do? How do I redirect these negative feeling into something else. I understand that they are just psychological and biological reactions if my body to rejection, but that still doesn't stop them from hurting.",03Oct2020,1
703,"Hey guys. 

I think you deserve this just as much as anyone else. 

Please know that you're worth a lot and this world wouldn't be the same without you. Please please please respect yourselves. Take care how you approach women so your messages won't end up on Facebook on some social media platform by some frustrated weirdo adding the #MeToo. Don't let any woman bring you down and tell you you're worthless, don't let any woman humiliate you or disrespect you. Don't settle for anything less than the 100% the perfect woman for you. Any mistake one of your partner's is making towards you address it straight away and if she says things like ""this is who I am. You either like me like this or you don't"" break up with her immediately. That's a massive red flag. Stop dating just for the sake of dating. Being single is 100 times better than being with the wrong woman. Being single is 100 times better than being even in a decent relationship. In fact any relationship is worse than being single. Focus on yourselves, work hard towards your dreams, help society progress and play your part. If any woman is in the way ... Remove her. Your dreams and career will be there for you long after any woman lost interest and started comparing you with other men and thinking she can do better. You deserve more, you deserve the best and you should go out there and take it. No matter what. 

With respect, from a guy who learnt way too late to treat myself with respect and remove the toxic and negative people in my life. 

All the best, good luck and keep your heads up. You're not the enemy.",03Oct2020,1

I feel bad for him, because he is not trying to be nasty, but when he speaks it is so self-congratulatory, repetitive and lecturing (in a 'let me show off how intelligent I am' kind-of way). He is not particularly intelligent. 

I am aware that he does this because he is insecure, and needs constant validation, but I still can't help but being really triggered by it.

When he repeats himself a lot, I shut him down directly. I have also tried to gently explain to him that is is annoying when he speaks to us as if we were bord yesterday. It hasn't really worked so far.

708,"This is about me (M16), my uncle (M50) and how he treats my grandma (his mum).

Ever since I can think, my grandma got treated bad. By many people, not only my uncle. She never confronts anyone about anything, since she knows that people will just scold her. She already has mental health issues, the whole family knows about it, but nobody every speaks about how bad some people treat her.

My uncle for example is pretty manipulative (at least in my opinion). Even tho he's 50, he whines about being the middle child. He also blames my grandma for not spending enough time with his son. It's not her fault, my uncle and his family are living quite a while away from us, where as my family and my other uncles' family live right next to each other. 

Today, my grandma didn't want to go on a walk with my uncles family, she said she had stuff to do. She's preparing 4 cakes for my other cousin, who's first communion. Plus, she isn't the fittest anymore, but she would never admit that.
He started blaming her again. Saying, she should spend more time with her grandson.
I said that she does spend time with him, I mean we all just sat together, having cake and coffee. It's not like she's avoiding anyone.
My uncle got unbelievably mad at me. He started screaming at me. I told him he was being very manipulative. Obviously he wasn't listening, just asking me why I even care and telling me I don't know anything. My uncle also said that he was just ""saying his opinion"", but when I said that I was just telling him my opinion, he said that he didn't care.
He kept the fight going, always had to have the last word, while I already tried to get away from it, since I realized that there was no use talking to him.
So I started to bring the dished from the table to the kitchen. He took that time to talk to his wife, who was trying to calm him down. I stood about 1 meter away from him, when he still talked about me. So I said something relating to the thing he said about me. 
Then he yelled at me, because ""he was talking to his wife, not me!""

A few hours later I went back to my grandmas to ask her something. My uncle and his wife were there as well. I heard them whispering about my present (my birthday was 2 weeks ago and since that's the first time we saw each other again) but my uncle just said ""No. Not now."" He didn't even look at me.

I really don't know what to do. I don't want my grandma to feel bad. I want my uncle to stop trying to manipulate her into doing things she doesnt want to do. I thought about trying to talk to him, I'm probably going to offer him a calm talk, but I dont think thats going to work. Either he's gonna start yelling at me again or he'll say ""There's nothing to talk about"".

I also kind of feel bad for standing up to him, my family usually doesn't do stuff like that and I'm afraid that it'll split my family even more. I know that my parents and my brother are on my side, my brother is also pretty sure that my grandpa is on our side, but still. I don't want to be the reason for trouble. Also I dont want to put my uncle in a situation where most people are against him

I know I could've handled the situation better, maybe trying to talk calmly to him about it, but I kind of snapped, because I had to witness that stuff for 16 years now.

I've told people this and they make excuses for my parents, I'm done with excuses, what my parents are doing is immature and neglectful.

An example of this is, I'm taking AP gov this year and I had a unit test, my dad always tries to take over my studying and force me to ask for his help which is something I didn't want or thought I needed.

714,"I have a friend of 7yrs who I consider my closest friend. She knows some deeply personal things about me that no one else knows (btw I hate opening up about personal things so this is important to me) and vice versa. However, this has been a very rocky friendship which I would class to be toxic (more so in the past then now). 

We had a toxic friendship for the first 3 years, didn't talk and hang out as much for the next two since I left the friendship group but reconnected for the last 3 and became so much closer. 
She is depressed and has childhood trauma which is affecting her now but she hasn't gone to see a professional about it. It started with her opening up about serious things to me which I obviously listened to which helped however it slowly became every topic we've ever had was her venting about her problems for hours. She was often sad and pretty negative about things. This lasted during those 7yrs but got much worse in the last 3.

I listen and give advice to help find a solution or a way to fix the problem since that's my way of helping people but it came to the point I couldn't handle it anymore. I became the therapy friend and had serious emotional burnout where I didn't even want to be around her anymore. I slowly started to resent her which I absolutely hated because she's going through so much. 
I have told her so many times to speak to someone professionally but for 3 yrs to now she hasn't done so despite saying she will. 

My other friends have said that I can't keep on putting her first when it's starting to affect me a lot but how can I not help her when she's going through so much. I don't know, its just frustrating to essentially be her therapist (listening to her talk for hours about her problems in every conversation we have) when she won't actually get a therapist which she can speak to for free.

A huge part of me doesn't want to be her friend anymore but I hate that I feel that way since I'm the only one she can talk to about this and its not her fault. Also, she has a fear of abandonment, that no one wants to be around her so because of this I haven't told her how I felt. If I'm not her friend anymore or I confront her about my frustrations it will affect her significantly. She's also quite impulsive and gets defensive really fast therefore I always avoid saying things which would make her angry (lowkey intimidating).

725,"I want to stress that I’m UK based so the ages discussed here are legal.

At the start of this year we had a new girl start in our office, it was my job to train her and over the next couple of months we struck up quite a strong relationship/friendship.

She’s absolutely beautiful and has a great personality but she’s 17 and I’m 28 so initially I was not interested whatsoever, even though it’s legal I just wasn’t into it, and she had a boyfriend when she started. I was quite happy to see her at work, have a joke and a laugh and then go on about my life.

Then after a few months I was made aware that the other people in the office thought she was into me and was actually laying it on quite thick. As my brain wasn’t even thinking that way I hadn’t really picked up on it but after that I thought I’d keep an eye just to see if she really was or if it was just playful and friendly and everyone else was blowing it out of proportion. 

Around this time she broke up with her boyfriend so was single. This is when the inevitable happened on my end, now I was aware she might be into me, and I was definitely picking up there was something there now I was looking for it, I started thinking what it might be like to be with her. Now I’m not saying I caught feelings or anything like, but knowing that a beautiful young woman who I got on with like a house on fire might be interested in me definitely awoke something in me. But I maintained that due to the age difference I wasn’t going to make the first move, I’m not generally interested in 17 year olds but in these circumstances I could overlook the age difference but I wasn’t going to step to a 17 year old.

Then lockdown came. We were no longer going into the office together and eventually she lost her job due to the pandemic. Initially I thought well without that face to face contact interest could wane and that will be that, but we messaged throughout and spoke on the phone/FaceTimed for hours, and it was generally instigated from her side so we kept up a relationship. When we were allowed to see each other we did, and then during this time she moved out of her parents home and moved into a place on her own.

Now this is where a conflict comes in. I think she’s a little weirded out by the age difference but does have feelings for me, however she’s a 17 year old girl with her own place and plenty of guys her own age chasing her, like I said she’s gorgeous and has a very unique personality, you would be attracted to her for that alone. She’s slept with a few of these guys, but I don’t really have a problem with that, she’s single and can do what she likes, but I do wonder where that leaves me.

The way I look at it, I can’t be with her because she’s of an age where she needs to live her life, party, make mistakes, and just live the life of a young person, it’s what I did when I was her age so I know that being in a relationship with someone who’s been through all that and isn’t necessarily what she’s looking for right now, she wants to be free and I respect that. 

But like I say, I know she has feelings for me and for me I can’t say I have deep feelings for her but I am attracted to her and I get on with her like few people I’ve ever known, so I enjoy her company. On a deeper level I was in a bit of a funk for a few years before meeting her following the passing of my father, and she really gave me back parts of myself that I hadn’t seen for years, and the confidence of having someone like her interested in me made feel like I did still have it, I started to feel like me again.

So my predicament is, do I essentially ensure that I’m friendzoned so that on a selfish level I can keep her in my life and keep enjoying the relationship we do have, with the thought that maybe one day we’ll both be ready to be more serious. Or do I distance myself and let her live her life and just appreciate the time we have had together?

726,"I used to be an amazing student, and have such dedication and discipline in my life. I used to get good grades, have lots of friends, go out all the time, e.t.c... Now all of that has gone to shit and all I do is sleep and do the bare minimum for school. This is unlike me and it has all stemmed from my deeply rooted insecurities about my face. I can't do anything without focusing on how ugly I am. (TW) I have even considered suicide over this, and recently it has gotten really bad.

I don't know what kind of help I should get, or if I should even get help. I genuinely am really lost and don't know what to do right now. It's really affecting my daily life, and my relationships with my family and friends because I keep pushing them away. 

Any advice for what I should do is greatly appreciated, I have no idea really where to start. Thank you for anyone who has read this as well, I appreciate it a lot &lt;3",03Oct2020,1

729,"So we have this stray cat who basically adopted us a week ago. She’s very pregnant. We’ve made her a box and lined it with blankets and fed her, and she’s been sleeping in the box. (We’re almost certain she’s chosen that place to have her babies because she’s in the box almost all the time) 

Today my mom looked over the cat, and basically said that she looks like she might be having her kittens within the week. (My mom thinks it’ll be tonight or tomorrow, because the cat might be having contractions?)

731,"Sorry for the long post. I feel like I have to fully explain my situation if I want to get informed advice. TLDR: My brother won't follow social distancing guidelines, my dad is easily confused, and I'm poor.

I'm a woman in my mid-30s. I got married immediately after college, husband made great money so I became a housewife. No kids. So even though I have a bachelors I've never had a ""grownup job"", only the jobs I worked to get myself through college. 

My father is retired, on social security, and he has Alzheimer's and diabetes.  My mother passed from cancer about 2 years ago.  My husband left me shortly after my mom died.  I moved in with my dad to get back on my feet because I had no savings, no income, and his house is paid off so he wasn't asking me to pay rent.  The other reason I moved in with my dad is because he gets confused, he doesn't cook or clean, he lets the yard get overgrown, he has trouble managing his finances, and so on. Someone has to help him, he really shouldn't be living alone. And I obviously have domestic skills.

I got an entry level job, which is all I could find because despite having a degree, I had a decade+ work gap. I make \~$16k/year, which would leave me pretty desperate if I had to pay rent, at least around here. But since I don't pay rent, Dad and I are doing OK, all things considered.  It is exhausting caring for him, doing all the housework while working full time, and he doesn't help with the house or errands or anything at all, he just makes messes and hangs out all day. But I know that's just how it is, it's the hand I was dealt and I gotta do it.  We split utilities, food, household stuff and repairs, and property taxes. We pay for our own phones, transportation and healthcare.  I now have around $20k in savings. I will gladly accept advice on budgeting and financial health. I live frugally but I know I have nowhere near the amount of savings I should have at my age.

Then corona hit.  I am now working from home and I thank the Lord for letting me be home all day so I'm here to remind my dad many times a day that he has to wash his hands and wear a mask, that he can't go to restaurants, invite friends over, hang out in the neighbors' houses, ride in friends' cars, share food with people... I don't really know what he does or how safe he's being when he leaves the house, but I try my hardest to make sure he knows the rules so we can both stay healthy.

Now here's my immediate problem. I have a brother close to my age who lives on the other coast, but he still keeps all his stuff in his old bedroom here at Dad's house. I feel like as long as he doesn't own his own house yet, it's reasonable to store his stuff here. He likes to visit this city frequently to hang with his old friends, and he always stays here at the house. But he hasn't stopped this habit since coronavirus began!  He lives in a city with a lot more cases than our city, and he still flies here every couple months and stays with us, even though I asked him not to.  My dad is in a high risk group due to his age and health issues, and I have an immune disorder, but my brother won't hear it. When I tell him he can't stay with us, he keeps saying things like ""I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable! I just need to come do some stuff :)"" Then he takes an uber from the airport and just comes inside and settles in, no precautions.

I can't fathom why anyone would think it's just fine and cool to be in an airplane with like 200 people for 6 hours, then in a little car with a stranger, then require 2 high risk people to let you stay with them, but here we are. And I'm sure that if he thinks this is fine, there's no way he's social distancing in his daily life. He has a good job so he can definitely afford a hotel room, but he just won't stop! I've asked my brother if he needs something from his room I'll go get it for him and give it to him outside, but he says, ""I need to check out the house and check on Dad to see if he's doing okay."" As though I'm useless and letting Dad waste away! I get that we all worry about loved ones especially during this pandemic, but I'm not letting him starve and live in squalor, you know? And brother never helps me around the house, or organizes papers, or mows the lawn, or literally anything that would be useful for our dad's well being.  He just eats our food, uses our internet, sleeps here, and goes out with his friends. Which again, under non pandemic conditions, is fine, he's family and he's welcome here, but saying ""I have to check on Dad"" is a weird empty excuse when he doesn't actually do anything to help, LOL. 

Dad and I always do a 2 week quarantine after brother leaves, which is a big headache for me because I have to police his movements and he gets mad at me that he can't go out and do stuff. And obviously the point of us doing a quarantine is just to protect other people in case we got infected, it doesn't do anything to help us stay safe.  My brother doesn't respect me telling him not to come here because I'm not the homeowner or his parent.  Of course I've explained to my dad at great length why brother needs to find somewhere else to stay, and Dad always seems to understand and take it seriously.  Dad then tells brother he can't stay with us, but then the instant brother starts talking, Dad forgets what I said, forgets about the virus, and is just excited to have my brother come stay with us.  My brother knows that Dad will agree and I won't, so he has stopped telling me that he's coming and just calls Dad to tell him the day before the flight, or the morning of -- which means we don't have a heads up to stock up on groceries for our quarantine!

I'm seriously at my wit's end here.  I don't know why brother thinks that when all the people who live in a house have told you not to come over, that's an invitation for a debate.  When saying no doesn't work, how do you keep someone out of your house? I know that my presence at Dad's house is keeping Dad in better shape than if he was living alone.  I make sure he has fresh food to eat, I keep up with home repairs, I keep things clean, I do the yard work, and most pressingly I remind him how to stay safe from COVID on a daily basis.  I know that I'm better off living here than trying to make it alone, at least financially, even though I spend all my free time doing things for my dad.  But if I'm unable to prevent potential contamination from coming into the home, is it more important for me to move out to at least protect myself??

I'm not too skilled at adulting because I spent my young adulthood dependent on my husband.  Technically I did the household budgeting in my marriage but we were doing so well that we didn't really have to make hard decisions.  My understanding is that you should make 40x rent in a year (or rent + utilities?), which would put me at a rent limit of about $400, which is truly a joke around here. I found one old guy on craigslist who was renting out the living room of his 1 bedroom apartment for $430, and that was the closest I've found to my budget. I looked up low income housing, which only requires you to make 1.5x rent in a month (I make 1.6x!). If I could give up transportation (walk to work whenever we have to go back in person) and try to live 100% off food stamps, but still add to my savings account every month, that would leave me about \~$140/month for medical care, veterinarian/pet care, clothing, and household/personal needs. Seems pretty destitute to me and I'd feel awful for leaving Dad alone, but would it be worth it to make sure that I won't get corona, after all I can't help Dad if I'm dead, right? I could still call him every day to ask if he has food and remind him not to get in people's cars.  Hopefully it would just be temporary until the corona passes, then I would move back here? (And I'd have a mess of a yard, house, and papers to tackle all over again.) I already applied for food stamps to find out if I could afford to move out, but I was denied because I don't pay rent here. I assume and hope that if I moved out, I would then be accepted for food stamps. That seems really scary and risky to me, to move first without being able to pay for food, but I don't know what other option I have. I don't know, I feel out of my depth here.

Or is the risk of Dad catching the virus without me there to remind him greater than the risk of my dumb brother spreading it to us from his city/the airport/airplane/uber/his friends? How do I get my brother to stop coming here? Spend a couple thousand to ship everything from his old bedroom to his apartment across the country?  Buy a gun and guard the front door from the porch? Move both Dad and me into an apartment together, leaving the house empty so my brother can use it as a pied a terre? Bubble suits all around?  Just suck it up so my brother won't hate me, and cross my fingers that we all make it through this?",03Oct2020,1
732,"So this is somewhat embarrassing but I need answers. This may be a little explicit and TMI as well so if you’re not cool with that I understand. I haven’t come into a problem where everytime I put on a condom almost instantly my dick will go from erect to flaccid. I have no problem having raw sex but it’s not ideal for obvious reasons. I googled and apparently it is a somewhat normal problem among men and a condom can cause ed. I don’t have regular ed as I get strong erections it’s just literally I put the condom on and in like 2-3 secs its floppy. :( Apprently it may by that it’s too small for me? However I’m pretty certain I can’t wear magnums i’m only 6 inches on a good day lmao so regular fit should fit. Snug is too tight i’ve tried. Has anyone else had this problem? I am thinking of trying the magnums but i don’t want to spend the $ if they won’t fit.

735,"Hey guys. 

I think you deserve this just as much as anyone else. 

Please know that you're worth a lot and this world wouldn't be the same without you. Please please please respect yourselves. Take care how you approach women so your messages won't end up on Facebook on some social media platform by some frustrated weirdo adding the #MeToo. Don't let any woman bring you down and tell you you're worthless, don't let any woman humiliate you or disrespect you. Don't settle for anything less than the 100% the perfect woman for you. Any mistake one of your partner's is making towards you address it straight away and if she says things like ""this is who I am. You either like me like this or you don't"" break up with her immediately. That's a massive red flag. Stop dating just for the sake of dating. Being single is 100 times better than being with the wrong woman. Being single is 100 times better than being even in a decent relationship. In fact any relationship is worse than being single. Focus on yourselves, work hard towards your dreams, help society progress and play your part. If any woman is in the way ... Remove her. Your dreams and career will be there for you long after any woman lost interest and started comparing you with other men and thinking she can do better. You deserve more, you deserve the best and you should go out there and take it. No matter what. 

With respect, from a guy who learnt way too late to treat myself with respect and remove the toxic and negative people in my life. 

All the best, good luck and keep your heads up. You're not the enemy.",03Oct2020,1

739,"I have two friends [19] who have erratic emotions.
I know one of them considers suicide often but tbh I probably wasn’t being as aware or sensitive to the situation as much as I should have been. I thought he gave up on the idea, but I really have no idea what he’s always thinking and it doesn’t seem like he ever wants to share. Or maybe me not wanting to be intrusive comes off in the wrong way and maybe it makes him think that I don’t want to hear whatever he has to say. Not sure, but I am oblivious to a lot of things because he lives 6 hours away from me now. And so obviously the only form of communication I have with him is through the internet. But I am worried because he said and did a few ominous things but I was being stupid in my emotions and arguably busy and I probably wasn’t asking him how he was doing enough.
But basically he doesn’t tell me anything. I have no idea why he feels the way he does. How do I get him to tell me? Does he even WANT to tell me? I know this may sound insensitive but does he even want to be helped?
My other friend always complains about how she thinks her family doesn’t care enough or how she is sad and frustrated that her family doesn’t realize that she’s depressed and trying to stop self-harming. I know her feelings are valid. I know that I should help her in some way. But I have no idea what I’m supposed to say. So all I tell her is that I care about her and other people care about her and are sad to see her hurting herself. But all she does is brush it off. Is that even a good approach to comforting someone? And idek if she even wants me to say that to her. Maybe she just wants to vent.
But I want to help my friends. Except every time I think of something to say, I think to myself, “I’m so tired. Why am I telling them wishful things when I don’t even know what’s worth living for in life myself?”
So then I contradict myself and I end up not knowing what to say.

740,"I always watch movies on how its great to have a sister, but I have always hated my sister. Even now that we have grown up. Ever since we were kids there has always been rivalry between us. She would make degrading jokes at my expense in front of her friends and our family, and they would all laugh at it together. Now that she is married, instead of her, its her husband that makes hurtful remarks, and since he is the eldest in all the siblings, he feels the need to control everything around us. 

On my wedding with only my immediate family and my husbands aunt and cousin, my sister always talked bad about my clothes and my hair etc, and praised my husband in front of his family. Her idea was that his family was supposed to say something nice to me. But of course they didn't. That whole day I was the butt of all the jokes, with them making fun of me and nobody standing on my side.  His side of family went as far as to say I was bought for 10K, the money signed into a contract, but is never really given, and both my sister and mom were laughing. And I knew that his family was just laughing at all of us. 

I screamed at my sister that day in the car, and was told to apologize to her by my mom. 

Now I'm just sick of her. I try to mend things by calling her over to my house, giving her presents, but honestly I have a lot of pressure, and my nieces is one of those kids that find pleasure in annoying people. So we had a fight. I can't avoid them, cause they are all the family I have. But I hate to be around anywhere near them. I can always forgive my sister, by my brother in law is just out of boundary and so is my husbands family. I don't know how to deal with the whole of them. 

As I said I have a lot of pressure from studies, sometimes I cry on the phone to call my mom they all hear it and make fun of it. I don't have anyone to confide it. I don't really have any friends because of lack of confidence people can smell from a mile away.

I didn't want to intervene right then because I was afraid of making it worse for the waitress, though I wish I had. 

The waitress left and this lady is complaining to her husband about it, who is just laughing (at his wife I'm pretty sure). I felt like I couldn't talk. I'm very nonconfrontational.

743,"Some background info. I grew up in a pretty “low income” family. I mean we seemed pretty rich on paper but we weren’t. Both of my parents came from old marriages and had me and my sister. My father had to pay child support for 2 kids and also my half sister from my mothers side. On paper my father made a lot even though he was a blue collar worker cause he worked mad overtime, but that money always had somewhere else to go besides us. So when I was pretty young my family filed for bankruptcy. We weren’t in the best financial place my elementary and middle school years, never went on vacations, always had hand me down clothes. I knew I wasn’t going to get much help for college, so I absolutely busted my ass to get scholarships. I had the thought process “I wanna make sure my kids grow up rich, and I’ll take them to Disney and pay for their tuition” and all that stuff. I absolutely love my dad and all he did for me, but I just wanted to use what he gave to me and multiply it for my own family in the future, and for myself. And that’s what they wanted for me.

But along the way, my family never got on well with “rich folks”. We lived in NYC and we called them yuppies there. We’d always poke fun at them when we saw them walking their fancy dogs or walking around in designer in what used to be a very bad part of the city. We’d blame our problems on the rich. We’d compare ourselves to the rich. Half the time they weren’t even rich rich, just in a significantly better place than us. But I mean what else could you do. It wasn’t a good thing to do, but when you’re a family that’s busting your ass and barely able to make ends meet you have to blame someone. Looking back we were definitely blaming the wrong people, it was definitely a much bigger problem with our economic system as a whole. But I digress.

*SKIP TO HERE IF YOU DONT WANNA READ MY RANT*

That brings me to now. Now I’ve been out of college for a few years, I got my degree and a pretty well paying job. I’m comfortably living, and I’m living a dream. But I’ve found I can’t enjoy it as much. Whenever I see something really expensive I wanna buy, I think back to all the awful stuff we used to say about rich folk. So I don’t get very extravagant stuff even if I really want it, and I tend to try to “hide” how much I make. And god damn this sounds like such a first world problem, and it is. And it’s good to save and donate your money and all, but this is why I busted my ass. I don’t wanna feel guilty cause I really did work hard to get here, but I just can’t help it. And on top of that I feel even guiltier when I think things like this cause I know there’s people who would kill to be in my shoes. And I know there’s probably people who worked just as hard as me but didn’t get as far cause they might’ve been dealt an even worse hand. But at the same time I don’t wanna worry about my own children being perceived as the rich snobby kids one day, and me being perceived as the parent of the rich snobby kids that let everything slide. I want to preserve my family values. Though I worked for my money and I wanna use it, and I want to benefit my family as much as possible with it. I honestly don’t know what to do.

750,"About a year ago, life was great. I was living the best possible life, had great friends, went on trips, and even got into my first choice school. I moved to a different country to attend college and things started going downhill from there. I met this girl with whom I clicked very quickly. About two weeks later, we had sex but the condom broke near the end. I pulled out quickly but it was too late now that I think about it. Two months later i start having the classic STI symptoms, burning during urination, painful ejaculation, etc. On top of that I notice tiny warts on my penis. So I went to a urologist who had me tested for every possible common STI. The test results kept on coming back negative. In the meanwhile he gave me doses of doxycycline, ciprofloxin and azithromycin. I ended up eating antibiotics for 3-4 months which I think upset my stomach and I started getting constipated. As a result, i ended up developing hemorrhoids. About 10 months later, I changed my urologist and the new doctor diagnosed me with chronic non-bacterial prostatis and gave me some supplements as medication. I also went to a dermatologist  and had the warts removed twice by electrocautery. Now about a year later i have started taking antibiotics on doctors advice, small warts are showing up again the hemorrhoids are worsening (might need to remove them surgically). In the meanwhile, I haven't been able to go home for about a year and the country I am in has a different language. I don't really have any close friends here. I haven't told my family about the warts and pay for the wart treatment from the money they send me for monthly expenses. I don't know what to do anymore. There was a time when I used to believe in God and whenever something happened I used to pray and that at the very least helped me relax.

756,"For context, my issue is with anxiety. Really intense anxiety that makes it hard for me to remember things, focus, or learn anything new while it's happening.

I haven't had a job in almost a year now. My last job was as a cashier/stock boy, my new job the same. A year ago I was getting a lot better with my anxiety, almost to the point where I could feel comfortable almost anywhere, so working in service was bearable, and sometimes fun, as I got to challenge my anxiety, but over the time that's passed since then, the isolation and limited contact with the world outside my home has reverted my anxiety back to it's extremes.

I already know that I'm going to have anxiety attacks on the job for the first few weeks, which I can get away with them when it comes to helping customers with transactions, but my anxiety affects my memory and intake of information more than anything, so I know that I'm going be braindead during my training, take in nothing, piss off my boss, and just further exacerbate my anxiety. 

Does anyone have any techniques, advice, or suggestions that might be able to help me with taking in information during my training in any way?

Thank you in advance for any help.",03Oct2020,1

I was with my gf for about 1.3yrs together and before that we talked about 7 months so yea 2 yrs of pure communication. I love her soo f-ing much like she is really nice and she is so similar to me but except for some stuff. So here is the story we argued 2 months before like at beginning of August and I said that i have something to tell her and she was like what? I smoked last year only for a month while I was working a seasonal job in kitchen and this year july and august it isnt like everyday but sometimes. And she got pissed af. I called my friend cuz i didnt know what to do i was afraid of losing her because of this and he said I will talk to her and he talks to her and he actually helped. Ok we went out few days prior to this she says i want to smoke a cigarette to see why are you smoking and i said no and she said i wont be with you if you dont allow me and i said ok she couldnt smoke it all and I took the pack and threw it and i promised to her i wont smoke anymore. So last day of august she asked me one morning if i lited a cig after the incident i said yea but just one not anymore and she got fing pissed. I begged her to not leave me and everything i cried and yea i said i wont do it again and she said like ok. Fast forward to 19. September we were talking through video call and we argued a little bit and i started apologizing my fault and everything. I hung up and she said like im sorry if im sometimes a butthole just ignore me because i still havent forgot that incident ok. I was happy because she finally confessed because i was scared that she would break up with me idk why. And now we got here 2 days after my birthday which is 27.9 yea we hung out a little bit and we started kissing and she said did i smoke i said no and she was like tell me i wont be mad i was like legit no she was ok then it was just my imagination ok. I took her to the bus as the other bus came my friend came out if it and i remembered that night before we smoked like hookah so it could be that and I told her that. Through text because she hooped on the bus and she was mad like a lot and said i want couple of days to talk less i need to think and i asked again my friend what to do. Nextday i started talking like why are you like this and she said i broke the promise twice its not a problem that you smoke but its problem that you will hide it. And i was like im sorry so yea. After a while she said i dont know what to do but only thing i know i dont want a relationship now i need to cool of maybe later we can connect and be together again. I was devastated i felt like an idiot but everyone i asked for advice everyone of them said its ok i understand her but thats not the reason of breakup. She said she loves me and wants to be by me but yea. I said let me work on myself and we could talk again. I want her back I really want her back i built her confidence, i gave her the audacity if someone tries to manipulate her she could say f off she couldn't do it before because she was innocent child like legit and I am rn in bed crying af 3 days have passed since last communication.help me reddit and again sorry for grammar and other stuff if you are confused about something hmu.",03Oct2020,1

764,"Long story short... I've friendzoned myself. Four years ago I met this girl. I was interested but I didn't know how to communicate at that time. I was insecure and didn't have the balls to tell her how I felt and what I wanted from her. So I basically told her one day that I had some feelings but they were long gone and that I hoped we would be friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Current day we're still friends. Technically I would describe us at best friends. She and I (yes I'm a dude) have a weird kind of relationship though. When she comes over to my place we basically do everything a couple does except the sexual stuff. We cuddle, we snuggle and we sleep in the same bed. She also rests her head and body on me while in bed.   


I'm pretty inexperienced with women and tbh I don't know whether or not this is normal for a boy/girl friendship. Weird thing is that I enjoy this, but I know this isn't healthy for either of us. Neither of us EVER had a relationship before so... yeah.

765,"This is gonna be a long onw, but i need to do this to feel better. I am not a karma whore so do not upvote this post, i don't want attention nor do i want pity or compassion. With everything being said let's get into it.

This happened for a few months now so it's nothing new to me. It's depression. I actually made a post here a few months back about it. And i won't get into it, but something i recall is a person giving me a few tips and reccomendations. And they actually helped me, for a little while. But now it's back, and it's worse than anything i've expereinced so far. Which is very weird because i am currently in the best part of my life, i am 16, i found a girl i like. And i am talking to her a lot, i've got experience on things i love to do, i got a dog which is a great little companion and i lso just got accepted into the school i want to go to today. But still i've never felt more useless or unaccomplished in my whole life. I know that depression is very common around teens my age and how they do it for attention. But i think most of it comes from people i thought i could call friends.

Friends are suppossed to help each other, and no. Telling someone that they are a fatass and constantly make them feel down doesn't mean that you are helping them, tough love isn't love. It's ignorance, because for the past couple of days i've been feeling worse than ever because of things that happened. Like today, when i was talking with some friends about my workout schedule, and then one of them comes out and calls me a liar. Because how can i do 150 push ups a day and 150 crunches a day and i can only do 25 seconds of plank. And i tried to explain to them that i do the plank last, and i have very little energy left and i am not as exhausted as i was when i started. Because when i started i wasn't exhausted, but the more i did. The more exhausted i got. And they kept calling me a liar, a fatass, i should learn to lie better. And that i probably don't even work out. For the curious people. I am 95kg and i do consider myself a very fat person, and i also feel like i will never be able to get rid of it. 


And it's not only my friends, it's also me, i keep procrastinating, i keep making mistakes, i keep letting everyone down and i also keep letting myself down. I cannot stand seeing myself. I mean to the point where i would avoid people taking pictures of me, looking in a mirror or seeing a picture of me online. I hate them all, i do not find myself as an attractive person in the least, and i do not think that i can be a nice person if i tried.
I wish to have someone i can call a friend and i really wish that i would look normal. Instead of the fat kid that always ends up alone, and everyone thinks is a creep.


And i also find something rather ironic, i was talking to a few people in a server today, and telling them how to get rid of problems like anxiety or depression or insecurity. And i told them that it's ignorance. Literally ignoring them until you forget about them, and it's ironic how i deal with problems like this with ignorance. Yet when i am asked what i like about myself, i don't know how to answer. It's not because it's a hard question, or because i cannot think of something in the moment. It's just that i don't love myself, nor do i love anything about myself. I hate every single bit of me, the way i look, the way i act, the way i spek, the way i think and even down to the way i dress.

And tonight was the night, my final breaking point. Thinking about my life and how it will end up, and i wasthinking of genuinely ending my life, even creating a twitch account to stream ending my life, let people ask me why i am doing it, answer their questions, and then either jump off or stab myself to death, that's why i am writing this. It's my last attempt at trying to save myself. Hopefully if i read this 10 times i'll think about the consequences, and how it will affect everyone around me. And sure, it might hurt my family for the next few years, maybe even 8 or 10 years, but it will pass. Time hurts every wound, they will forget about me once, and they will enjoy their lives again, who knows. Maybe i'll wake up as if nothing happened and i'll get to change the outcome? Many people find death as scary, fight now tho. I find it as an escape route. Of escaping from this body that i hate, this mind that is so filled with toxicity and hate and it's just so useless. 



That is all i wanted to say, i am open to advices from everyone. But i will repeat, please do not upvote this post, i do not want karma. I wanted to let it all out. Maybe it will help me in some form",03Oct2020,1

768,"What’s up guys,

A few weeks ago, my buddy was out and left me at his place for a few hours. While he was out, his girlfriend came downstairs where I was chilling and decided to hang out for a bit.

While we were hanging out, we got to know eachother a little better (I had only really talked to her briefly at this point), and bonded over different things, like music, etc. She also confided in me over some relationship problems she was having between her and my buddy, and also between her and my buddies sister (they all live together). She asked me if he was cheating and stuff also.

I also confided in her about different struggles and whatnot, and she was really cool of course (she does counselling). Overall I felt it was a really cool experience getting to know and bond with her.

Well, anyways, when I came to his place today they had gotten into in an argument while I was like right in front of them. Right after the argument, his girlfriend told me that while she was out of town the other week she had “thought of me” while listening to some song. It was a metal song, a genre of music we bonded over while hanging out before. Well, the name of the song was titled “Whore”, and basically was all about being someone’s whore and shit. And she showed me another song by a band named “Between You and Me”.

Mind you, she had totally changed her tone and had been giving me those oh so familiar eyes all the time while briefly speaking to me. It sort of felt like she was angling the phone a certain way so he couldn’t see the title of the “Whore” song, and she zoomed to a certain part of the song that talks about all the kinky shit while playing. 

My buddy was right beside us but was off in his own world doing whatever. I’m not sure if I have explained this all the best, but if I could put it in layman’s terms, “it was a vibe”.

What do you guys think? Does this sound like she was hitting on me? Or maybe trying to make him jealous?",03Oct2020,1

But it appeals to a larger audience. Makes me easier to relate to and many of my smarter friends have explained to me that they enjoy having someone who they can explain topics or ideas to someone who listens, even though I am very well versed or educated on the topics myself without their knowledge. 

I am a well educated person who loves the classics, enjoys developing their diction, plan my days and events very carefully, have a great time reveling in deep symbolism of film and literature and most of all tackling deep philosophical topics. But this existence is very lonely and I struggle to find anyone who can relate, especially when it comes to dating. 

I am a gay-asexual man in a time where gay sex is easy to come by. There have been times where I have feigned being a ""himbo"" and overly sexual desire in my partners so they feel wanted, validated and open up to me and hopefully find some kind of connection. I feel like I'm lying to them and it seldom lasts and the time I expressed my disinterest in intercourse it ended poorly in a way I dont care right now to experience again. 

I keep hearing in every form of media ""Oh just be yourself"" but I was myself for a very long time and that life sucked. I was lonely. People were combatative if I tried to correct them or challenge their views in a friendly manner to discover or discuss a topic; my life was a youtube comment section. I was often deemed ""a smartass"" and perceived as ""overly polite and untrustworthy, schemey"". The only time I'm myself is at work where my professionalism has earned me a number of promotions and a good reputation or in moments of crisis.

772,"Is it wrong / unhealthy to want a girlfriend?

I’m 24. I’ve done a lot in my lifetime. Travelled all around the country with old friends, played in many bands, went to school for a little while, now I run a small business with two other guys. 

I recently moved back home to try and settle down a bit. I know I’m still young but I’m in a place where I’ve kind of exhausted myself from partying and fucking around and that’s not what I want anymore. I want a real genuine relationship with someone I can love and trust and share happiness with.

Problem is, while I do have friends, most of them are settled down and we never really go out anymore. For the most part I work a lot during the week and usually spend time with family in my free time, maybe work out a bit or hang out at the skate parks. Usually BS with everyone there a little bit. 

I’m in a place where I really really want a girlfriend. Ive always been casual and now I want to know what love feels like. I feel like it might not even be real. Everything I read on the internet says I shouldn’t care about it and I should just focus on my own life and eventually it’ll happen but I think that’s a lie.

778,"I'm 20 and male, and I have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. I have a lot of sensory issues, but the main things that set me off are repetitive noises, unwanted touch from people, and cold temperatures. I'm also introverted and have a hard time when I have to constantly socialize.

I found a job at a gas station working their overnight shift because that's perfect for my sleep schedule lol. My dad says they are never busy at night, so I'll just be on my own cleaning and stocking shelves for most of the shift. They have plenty of places to be alone for a few minutes when it's just me and two other people working in the store.

It doesn't seem that bad from the orientation I went to, but they might want me to stock the beer, soda, and ice cream. Going into some low temp cooler from a warm room is far worse for me than constantly being in chilly 40 degree weather if that makes sense, and I'm very worried about not being believed if I try to get out of doing things like that. I wear a coat and bulky clothes on windy days, even in 70 degree weather, and I've been told that the workers in stores are very suspicious of me thinking I'm shoplifting. But I am black, so it could be that too.

The manager told me in the interview that they are frustrated with their employees and are looking for people who can show up on time even if they are addicts.

TW assault/graphic descriptions 



I hate my body, most specifically my vagina/vulva .

I have had various trauma through medical issues (I have gynae stuff, and bladder stuff) and sexual assault, and have over time ended up really hating my body . I disconnect from it . 

I make sure I wash and dress and stuff but anything else is a no go . 

I can’t use tampons, to have sex of any sort would seem impossible . I can masturbate to orgasm but doing so is more for tension relief than for pleasure iyswim . 

I’ve never had a relationship, I think I’d be too scared to have a physical one .

Most recently I’ve been asked to catheterise myself 6 times daily due to my bladder and I’m finding myself feeling physically repulsed at the thought . In the hospital clinic they suggested I squat over a mirror and cough, to visualise the necessary parts - I can’t do that without feeling nauseated .

That appointment led to continual panic attacks - I’m now on beta blockers to try and calm back down .

784,"What are the odds of me, at age 16, to start in the music industry with absolutely no experience? So before you say that I have no chance, please hear me out. I always loved music, but no one ever really supported me. It was more like, you know, a day dream, a passion, real life means math. So I spent many years with this mentality. But this year I came to the realisation that I could actually do something abut this. For one, I am not tone deaf. Not at all. I also have a lot of raw talent. I feel like I would be able to connect with people like no other through my music. Like combinig the dreamy synths of the 80's with the confidence of rap and the appeal of pop with motivational and relatable lyrics. So if I start right now, taking piano, guitar, logic pro x lessons, and music theory lessons, intensively, do you think I have a chance to be ready until the fall of 2023? To like, move to US and attend a music college. And after to sign with a record label. One chance. Out of a million.",03Oct2020,1

786,"So, until last week I (15F) was sure about wanting to be a doctor, but now I'm confused. I've had a problem deciding what I wanted before, but after making some research I really liked medicine and just had a feeling that it was for me. Although, at some point I started questioning if I'm good enough, because I usually have a lot of trouble  making decisions, especially  if they need to be made quickly, and I'm worried if I would be able to handle such a stressfull carrier. So my biggest problem was the fear of dealing with the patient's life. Then my second interest, biomedicine, popped up again. It deals with a lot of my insterests (biology, chemistry, math, human's health...) but it's mostly laboratorial and I don't think I would want to work with only research and no contact with the patient. So I am confused. Both are great, but I don't know if I prefer contact with people and possibly end losing their life or working with such an interesting field and researches, but having pretty shallow contact with the patient. Also, would I na able to handle the stress of a doctor's routine?",03Oct2020,1
787,"Hey everyone, sorry in advance for the wall of text. I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible. If you want some more context feel free to browse my posting history, you'll probably get a decent idea of what's going on here. 

Here's the deal; I'm a 27 year old guy with zero relationship experience. Never had a girlfriend, still a virgin, never even kissed anyone. And it's certainly not for lack of trying. I've been on every dating app you can imagine, read a ton of self-help books, tried therapy for the longest time, asked out women in appropriate settings, etc etc. I also live in a decently sized university city with a large, diverse dating pool, so that's not the issue either. 

I spent a few years ""working on myself"" and being the best version of me that I could be. Got in really good shape, found a fashion style that worked for me, developed hobbies, made new friends, etc etc. But my success (or lack thereof) when it comes to dating has never changed. I've lost count of how many times I've been rejected. Women have laughed in my face when I asked them out, called me names, or otherwise made it very clear that I made a mistake by trying to talk to them.

It's gotten to the point where I just have to face facts. Being 27 and with zero success in dating is a gigantic red flag in and of itself. And even after going on that journey of self-improvement, I'm still just not physically attractive. Being in good shape and dressing well can't really help much when your face isn't pleasant to look at. 

For the longest time I kept trying, thinking that something would change, but now I'm at the point where it's just time to face reality. 

As a result I've decided to call it quits. I know people like to say that ""there's someone out there for everyone"", but that's simply not the case. If it was going to happen, it would have by now. And to be honest, trying to date has just beaten me down to the point where I'm done making a fool out of myself for something that isn't going to happen. 

So here we are. I'm trying to find a healthy way to cope with this problem and move on with my life. I know that there will probably always be that part of me that yearns for love and intimacy, so it's going to be a matter of finding something that can replace or at least mitigate those feelings. 

So far I've tried a number of approaches to keep those feelings at bay, with varying amounts of success. My hobbies work well as a distraction, but only to a certain point. A lot of the times I'll be out doing something I enjoy, and then my mind drifts to the thought of ""this would be so much more fun with a partner to share the moment with"". Then the depression and loneliness comes rushing back. Spending time with my friends helps a little as well, though it still feels a little hollow and empty. 

I think my subconscious mind is messing with me as well, particularly when it comes to dreaming. Ever since I started having problems with dating and the feelings of loneliness, I started having dreams of being with a partner. Most of the time it's just mundane stuff; making dinner together, watching movies, going out on dates, you get the idea. At first I'd only get those dreams maybe once a month or so, but now it's almost every other night. And to be frank they're awful. Not in the moment of course, but as soon as I wake up reality hits me like a truck, and it takes all the strength I have just to crawl out of bed after. 

So in essence, there's three main things I'm trying to accomplish:

1) How do I come to accept the fact that I will likely spend the rest of my life without a romantic partner?

2) How can I cope/handle that dynamic in a healthy way?

3) How can I mitigate the subconscious desire for a relationship/romantic interest so that it stops interfering in my daily life?

I'm trying to find a therapist that will actually work with me on this but so far I haven't had much luck. Most haven't dealt with this sort of issue before. Others seem stuck in the mindset of ""there's plenty of fish in the sea"" or ""you'll find someone eventually"", and won't accept the fact that I'm done with dating.

I'd really appreciate any advice, kinda feels like I'm at the end of my rope here.",03Oct2020,1

790,"The title may not make sense with the writing. I’m kind of venting, kind of asking for advice, so don’t really bother with me. 
Hi, im New here(literally just came). Im a 17yo male that lives somewhere on the African continent, I’m not really good with introductions, nor at expressing myself, nor am I an expert in english so please don’t bother with my grammar and spelling mistakes. Going straight to the point: I live an enclosed live. I’ve always lived. I only use to go out to school then home then eventually some family house sometimes. My mom is pretty much abusive, my father is as well but in a lowercase. I can’t get out, except by studying hard to go to a new country do my college years. The bad part is that in failing math ever since my 8th grade. That’ll be an obstacle. But what I’m here to talk about is my love life, mostly. As someone with so low social skills I don’t really make friends often nor easily. That’s why I care about my friends. I treat them more as family then my own family. And love life is something I treasure even more. Well, im not successful at it. I’ve only had two girlfriends. Both exes now that I treasure as well as my friends. The first one was awesome, we lasted for an year and 2 months. Then she broke up with me. After a year she went to another country. The same country that im going to college. The second one was an LDR, on this same country im going too, we lasted around 2 years. I’m someone that doesn’t really let feelings go, so I think im still in love with both, even after all this time we’ve been apart (years). Well, right now I was talking with one of then, and she was telling me how she met this one guy that’s 23 (she’s 18) and how he was a really nice guy and all. And I was glad for them. I am. When I told her that, she said that I’m not that glad for she being with another man. Even though we’ve been apart for 3 years. And she was right. Every time she spoke to me about some new boyfriend or girlfriend I had this weird feeling until they broke up. Cold on my skin, but my insides were getting hotter, I get cold chills running down my spine, my stomach starts aching and I start ever so slightly trembling, I clutch my mouth until my teeth start hurting. these are my physical reactions that stick out most. I think that I know this feeling, since I get it every time my mom starts yelling at me and talking down on me, and I go back at her. This fear mixed with anxiety feeling. I know I shouldn’t have this feeling. But I can’t stop it. Its with both my exes and my mom. For different reasons though. I’m a very lonely person even around my friends. I’ve been trying to struggle with my mental problems by myself, my personality disorders, my imposter syndrome, my not so real depression I guess. I feel them But I don’t accept I have them, as they aren’t as strong as normal people would have them, nor they have been actually diagnosed so I don’t really know my problems, just a rough estimation of what they might be. This makes me feel faded away from all those who I care about, except loved ones. I only feel actually not lonely when I’m around them. My hooks. I guess that that’s why I can’t let them go. And hearing them actually having other human beings that they care much deeply... it’s a cycle I can’t get away. Just like my life cycle. It’s everything the same in the end. I don’t really know what my cry for help is. I don’t really know nothing, except that I, for more that I try, can’t stop liking these girls, and can’t stop having this feeling when they are with someone, when my mom starts hitting me and my sister and I can’t do anything. This helplessness, this fear and anxiety. I don’t know whats wrong with me. But this is the first time I can vent so much in my life. Its kind of easying. I want to cry.",03Oct2020,1
791," Let my preface this by saying that I've been drinking heavily, so I'm sorry about that.

So tonight i had 3 friends round mine for drinks. We were going to play monopoly, watch a couple films and have a good time. Now I don't have many friends, these 3 are the only ones I have, and I've known them for a number of years. Now one of them, a chap called Marcus, is a bit of a dick. He doesn't mean to be, but he really is. Most of the time, he's fine, but when he's bad, he's bad, and tonight was the straw that broke the camel's bacl. He has lost a great many friends over the years, and always blames them. He always blames other people for the things that go wrong in his life, blaming the teachers and other students for himself failing the course... for three different courses, when I and everyone else knows damn well it's him who's the problem, except he never looks inwards. He's a toxic person and everyone knows it.

The real issue comes from the fact that I don't have many friends, Myself and my other 2 friends agree on all these points, but the problem is that I feel as though I need him more than he needs me.

794,"So my school has recently implemented online proctoring through a proctoring system that records you through a camera and flags you for suspicious activity that the TAs and professors can later look at. Problem is, before I knew the program even started recording, I had taped up a piece of paper with class 1's work on it because I wanted to turn it in and not forget about it right after the exam for class 2. It was a stupid move, I don't know why I decided to do it then, but I know I got flagged and that the professor/TAs might suspect me of cheating.

Then at another point I had turned my head twice to the side because I was flagged nearly 10+ times for bad backlighting, and I thought of adjusting my chair height to maybe see if that would fix it. But I hesitated twice and didn't and now I'm afraid the professor's going to think I'm suspicious.

This story starts 8 years ago, when I was 19, one year out of high school. In high school I was a very involved in marching band. I worked for my band director teaching kids how to march and stuff for a few summers after I graduated, so I was relatively close with the staff. For those who don’t know, competitive marching bands often have several instructors who teach specific sections - one for woodwinds, one for brass, percussion, a few for marching, etc. These are usually college students or young professional musicians looking to make extra cash. There was this woman who taught one of the sections. Let’s call her Carly. Carly went through the marching band program at our school, and graduated before I was a freshman. She also had several family members go through the program, and her parents were very close to the band organization in terms of fundraising and stuff. By the time she was on staff, Carly was about 24 or 25 years old and already out of undergrad. 

One weekend in the fall, I was visiting home from college for the weekend. I had a few friends who were still in high school/band, and I ran into my friend - let’s call him Juan- at a party. Juan was 16 and was a bit of a party animal. He was tall, charismatic, and funny- definitely not your typical high school kid. He was already very drunk when he arrived at the party. The first thing he says to me is, “Bro, I’m about to fuck Carly.” 

I assumed this was bullshit. Carly was way older, a teacher, and seemed like a generally normal person as far as I could tell. Not that it is super important, but Carly is an incredibly attractive woman. So not the type you would “expect” to be a predator. (I now know this is a dumb way to look at it.) Juan was also not directly one of Carly’s students - she taught a different instrument, but they would interact in marching lessons. All of this added up to me thinking Juan was obviously full of shit. But then he showed me the texts between them. 

She was sending him selfies, asking him about his day, and saying “I miss you”, etc. He told me that she had randomly offered to give him a ride home one day, and they exchanged numbers. They had hung out a few times, and she invited him over to her house when her boyfriend was going to be out of town for the upcoming week. She said she wanted to get drunk with him and go to a concert together. Among the most disturbing things that happened was that she told him that she had felt similar urges before, but that he was the first student she actually wanted to become close with. She also made him hide in a bush when they spotted another student from band at the same park (which is honestly still hilarious to Juan and I, even years later). 

So, given that I had plenty of evidence that Juan was imminently about to fuck Carly within a matter of days, I immediately called my band teacher the next morning and told him what was going on. Our conversation was very short and tense. The following Monday, Carly was brought into his office and fired immediately. The band director also brought the matter to the principle of the school. During these meetings, Juan denied that anything had ever happened. He didn’t want to “ruin her life” over something that never actually happened anyway. Juan bragged to literally every person who would listen to him about what was going on, and thus he was obviously seen as a hero at school for almost banging this beautiful older woman. 

So fast forward to 2020. Carly is now married to her then-boyfriend. I hang out with Juan, and he tells me that he has been thinking a lot about what happened. Over the years, we have talked about this incident multiple times. He has thanked me many times for helping him avoid becoming prey by alerting the authorities. But as we both get older, we now realize that the situation was so much more fucked than we realized at the time. Juan was 16 - I don’t blame him for wanting to hook up with this woman. And at 19, I at least had the moral clarity to report it, but I guess I didn’t think it was my place to push it further once she was acquitted (for lack of a better term). I definitely judge my band teacher more harshly now than I did at the time - now that I am old enough to be a high school teacher myself, I realize I would have reacted completely differently, and made sure she was barred from preying on any more kids. Juan told me that he saw on Instagram that she currently teaches at multiple different high schools- apparently she faced zero consequences besides being fired. 


So the question is: What do we do? Do we try to confront her about it? Chances are she will either not respond or just deny everything (she deleted all the texts/DMs immediately after the incident). We could also alert the schools she now teaches with, although again, we have no hard evidence. I am a person who believes that people can redeem themselves, and deserve a second chance. But the older I get, the more I think that child sexual predators are in a category of their own. If it were my child or my student in that situation, I would have rained hellfire on her. I also recognize that if the genders were reversed - a 25 year old man preying on a 16 year old girl- the man would probably be in prison or a registered sex offender. I truly do not know what the right move is, but I know that Juan now sees himself as a victim, and regrets letting her off the hook. Thank you so much for reading this long ass post. Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR Years ago, a 24/25 year old female band instructor tried to hook up with my friend, a 16 year old male high school student who she met at school while teaching. She faced basically no consequences, and is still a teacher. My friend now realizes he was a victim and wants closure/justice. What should I do?",03Oct2020,1

Hi Reddit...so there's this guy that I've had a crush on ever since the second I saw him, at first I brushed off whatever I was feeling because we are colleagues and I thought it was just infatuation because my feelings were initially based on his looks but it has been over a year now and as I've gotten to know better him my feelings have only grown stronger.

I feel so warm and fuzzy around him, I get happy whenever he is happy, I find myself automatically smiling whenever he speaks, I never get bored talking to him no matter how dull the topic is, I feel sorry for him whenever he is stressed, being around him feels so comfortable and safe and I kind of look up to him and admire his hard working nature and ambition to succeed in life. He has such a positive personality and is so nice to everyone he meets, he's so charming. I love his quirks and cute little mannerisms.

But I know that nobody is perfect and he has his flaws, sometimes I think he acts a little big headed but then other times he is really down to earth. I feel like I'm missing something when I'm not around him, I feel as if when I'm not with him I'm just waiting for the next time I am with him. The last time I ever felt this strongly about someone was 7 years ago...I can't tell if the reason I feel like this about him is because guys rarely show any sort of interest in me and he does even if its just because he's being polite or because what I'm feeling is real...

TL:DR I've had a crush on a colleague for over a year, can't tell if it's infatuation or love. Need advice on how to get over this because I love my job and don't want to jeopardize it...(we are both in our mid-twenties).",03Oct2020,1
812,"Here's the thing. I don't *want* him out of my life. I care too much and it feels like a betrayal to all the love we shared. My boyfriend is my best and currently *only* good friend. The closest I have to friends are a few girls I text sometimes from my college, who I haven't seen since March (thanks COVID19 and my college's decision to only teach online this year). If I leave him I have to start over, maybe move in with some strangers in autumn 2021 (if my college returns to in person teaching/lectures) and meet new people. My parents love my BF and they think I have it *altogether* at the age of 21, that BF and I will move in together in autumn 2021and then marry in 5 years etc etc. For a long time I did feel like I had life sorted after meeting seemingly the perfect guy for me, at 18. 

I've had doubts and pushed them away a lot since May this year, but for the last 6 weeks or so, I've felt like I can't marry him ever. The thoughts of moving in with him next year makes me feel scared and trapped, because then I can't leave and it's the next step towards marriage. I used to fantasise about this stuff and see wedding dresses and think ""wow, the day he asks me to marry him will be the best day of my life!!"".

 My issues lie in different ethics I guess. He is OK watching Logan Paul videos which a) are aimed at 10-14 year olds and b) the whole suicide forest fiasco?, for example. He used to enjoy reading erotic stories of incest as a teen. When I was disgusted he didn't see an issue with it, until I lectured him. I feel like the right guy wouldn't have ever liked this crap? His former crushes, real and celebrity, have always been very skinny, I'm short, curvy and 120lbs, so that isn't me. I have a bad relationship with dieting and food and feel like I'll never be skinny enough for him lately, even if he makes it clear I am and he likes women with my shape too. He finds any woman over a size 6 gross?!? Whenever he hears about a rape/sexual assault celebrity allegation, he will ask ""eh did it really happen/how do we know she didn't make it up?"", he takes an innocent until proven guilty stance, I hate it. He is OK following Conor  McGregor, a man constantly accused of this crap. He is also a super picker eater, won't eat salad or any dish with onions or peppers. I can't tell if I'm nitpicking or if these are genuine issues? I feel guilty even typing this as he is such a sweetheart to me and maybe I'll just die alone if I'm stupid enough to leave?

813,"My girlfriend and I have had unprotected sex a few times, all very recently, and we're pretty sure everything is okay. One of the times though, It is possible that I did, um, ""finish"" inside, and I need advice as to what to do if she is indeed pregnant. (We are both 16 years old)",03Oct2020,1
815,"I'm 22 and there are so many major games I haven't played. I've never played a Tomb raider game, a Zelda game or an Uncharted one. I got into gaming later than most (16 years old) so I think that might have to do with it. But it always impressed me when I meet someone who's into gaming and they played all the classics and are super knowledgable about the hobby? Is this a common thing or am I just a noob ? Lol",03Oct2020,1
816,"we’re both 17 and last week saturday me and my crush went to go get ice cream and went miniature golfing. it wasn’t a date. after that she’s been quiet around me, like she still talks to me but it’s not the same. i tried texting her on thursday to see if she wanted to play xbox, she never texted back but when i saw her at work she says “sorry i couldn’t get on last night”, so she saw it but didn’t text me back. today i texted her “hey are you feeling any better today” cuz she didn’t feel good yesterday when we talked at work. and it’s been almost 3 hours and no reply. i texted her again saying “i know your not gonan leave me on delivered again 😂” and she still didn’t reply and that was a hour ago. but she’s online playing xbox. like me and her talk a lot in person and we tease each other a lot and make fun of each other as a joke ofc. but ever since we hung out she’s been different. it makes me feel like i did something wrong and i even asked if she was mad at me and she said no, she used to reply to my texts all the time, super fast and after we hung out she just stopped texting me. 


Edit: idk if this means anything but she’s homeschooled and she has depression. people thinks she likes me back but i honestly don’t know anymore.",03Oct2020,1
817,"Context:
I just got out of a relationship due to my mental health and my lack of ability to be consistent (with anything) but I really miss sex and also the feeling of female company......hopefully you get what im saying.

So I want to still have sex but not be dedicated to one person cause I dont want to hurt anyone else, I dont know if I feel wrong for wanting this or not but I would only want someone that wants the same (or multiple people that want the same) so end of the day i want everyone else's view on this. Am I a piece of shit for wanting sex or not?",03Oct2020,1
818,"At the beginning of the week, my hamster died. Now, my cat ran away. I wasn't even over the first before the second happened. I don't know what to do. I can't deal with it. 

I don't know if my cat will come back but I'm still hoping. But I'm beyond sad and don't know how to cope.",03Oct2020,1
819,"This is kind of a fallow up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hfhfbi/my_goal_of_opening_a_wildlife_park_am_i_doing_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

So go read that one to get an idea of what I’m talking about! Though it’s a bit outdated compared to what I’m planning now!

While I’m happy to have gotten the responses that I got, it still left the question of “Am I Doing The Right Thing” completely unanswered.

I wanted to know IF I should in the first place!

While I do want to give Non-Releasable Wildlife and Endangered Species in need of a home a home. I don’t want to see them pace for hours, or worse, suffer a Mental illness like depression or neurosis because of it!

But sometimes, the alternatives are few, and though I can’t know for certain what’s going through any of these animals minds, I don’t think they’d want to die!

Plus, I’m the case of the endangered species, Captive breeding can be very helpful in conservation. There’s a lot of species that have it to thanks for their continued survival!

So I guess it’s really not a black and white issue. Which makes all the harder to truly figure out!",03Oct2020,1
