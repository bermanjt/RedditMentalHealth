7,"My name is Anon, and I am trying to find some way to get my sisters out of the grips of my mothers' poor life choices. Over the past 4 years, my two younger sisters and I have been dealing with my mother's and her boyfriend's abuse. My father was in prison for three years and is unable to do anything to help my sisters. I am also unable to take any action to get my sisters out of the situation for good. My mother, most of all, has failed to realize the damage she is causing to my siblings, especially my youngest, who is 8. I am worried my sisters are going to be psychologically damaged for life, and I am afraid my mother will not stop making bad decisions until she is seriously hurt or something awful happens that may have been preventable. I dropped out of high school while participating in her escapades of moving in and out of her abusive boyfriend. Currently, I am on my own doing very well and am beginning to get extremely concerned about my sisters. My mother has packed them up and moved from North Carolina to Maine and back again over 5 times. Displacing us from our lives and causing a disruption to my sister's future. I do not remember the exact amount of times she has done this. Still, it is addictive and narcissistic behavior. She will split with him and move in with my grandmother. After a few weeks of doing well and getting a job, she will find some way to get in contact with him and will pack everything up, including the girls, and move back south to be with him. My middle sister is named Anon, and she is 14 years old. She had told me before that she was cutting, and I am worried that she will start again now that my mother plans to move back in with him again. My 8-year-old sister has severe anger issues and attitude problems that have been getting consistently worse over time. I am looking to find any way I can help my sisters and get my mother out of this vicious cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent this to a helpline type thing that I will not name. To clarify a few things, the abuse, as far as I know, is purely psychological and mental. Both my mother and her boyfriend have been verbally abusing both of my sisters. I am trying to see if there are any legal things we can do but so far nothing me and my dad have tried has worked. We tried getting one of those orders that wouldn't let my mother move them back and forth but it got denied. We got CPS involved and after interviews with them, nothing happened. I plan to call to try to open up a case again and also see if I can get some of the police reports from what has happened in NC. To give background I am 19 and have been renting from family, supporting myself 100%, and I stayed in Maine after the second time she moved all of us up here.

I apologize for any wordiness, grammar issues or errors.

11,"How can I know who talk to? 

So I moved cross country in September and it seems like nothing has gone right since then.

I moved to make finding a job easier but I'm broke and feeling like a disappointment when I've had countless interviews and nothing.

I got on really well with my housemates at first but theres one asshole that makes living here uncomfortable so everyone spends their time elsewhere (bar me who has nowhere else to go) so I spend all my time alone.

My boyfriend who lives in the same city is always super busy at work so I see him once a week, if that. And hes made all these promises about advancing our relationship and meeting his parents (met them for less than 30 seconds, he seemed super uncomfortable) and introducing me to his friends here to make me feel less lonely but he hasnt. And when I brought up how lonely I felt (I'm too scared to fully bc hes having an insanely stressful time at work and I dont want to overburden him) he just said he wished there was something he could do (implication being but he's too busy to)

Also what if I ask him why we're not progressing and he realises it's because he doesnt actually want to be with me.

To top it off all of my best friend has moved to australia and my friends from home are radio silent when I allude to the fact that I'm out here struggling. They get uncomfortable and dont wanna talk about it. My friend is moving here in a couple of months and was talking about how shes gonna have to start finding friends to live with and get a group together and I was like ooh I'll hopefully have a job by then can I get in on it and she literally did not say a thing. Like, total silence.

I have one friend in this city that I've seen like 5ish times since I moved and I don't know when or how to know if I can talk to her about it? And I feel so humiliated every time I check in and have to be like nope no job still looking

12,"[WE WERE HELPED, THANK YOU!!]

Hey! This is one of my first reddit posts and I'm kinda nervous because I never thought it would have to come to something like this, but my (23m) trust, as well as my fiance (22f), my other roommate (21m), and a former roommate who is still suffering (19f) are at a loss.

*TL;DR - My roommate B-Man has us in $2300 worth of debt we were unaware of. He is now demanding that we pay him this money despite the fact that half of the things he charged to us were never agreed on or were snuck onto our expenses without telling us, including things he needed himself. None of this was written down on a contract, most of it is undated he-said-she-said from B-man, and the only thing we agreed on was the $100 a person for myself and my fiance. I firmly believe he is doing this in order to keep us trapped in his house until we have nothing left to give. Any advice?*

**The Beginning**  
Our ""friend"" (32m), let's call him B-Man, offered us a place in his home which he has had for about a year and a half, maybe two years max. This was back when my fiance and I were still casually dating, about 4 months ago. It was a sweet gig to think about, because he offered to only charge us $100 to stay there! We would have our own bed, food, hot water, and a place we could stay at together, since our relationship was strained from the lack of time together. Obviously we accepted! We shook hands and were excited to move in. Our 21M roommate was already living with him at the time, but was couch surfing to allow us the bed in the second room (thanks bud!). The 19f roommate has moved out back to her parents house in South Dakota by now, but was still paying him back for some money she had agreed to pay back to him. She was uncomfortable staying with a man nearly twice her age, but she felt she had no other option if she wanted to stay in Nevada with us for a while.

**The Beginning of the End**  
Four months go by, September 2019 to December 2019 we're having a great time! However, there's something in the back of my mind that says something isn't right. By November, our payments were raised from $100 for both me and my fiance each (which we agreed on later) to $700 without any warning. The math he was using didn't add up, so I asked B-Man for the spreadsheet he keeps for Resident Expenses. He doesn't give it to me until October, and refuses to show me any receipts for the power, the water, or the wifi bills. He will continuously either avoid the question or say that he's ""trying to keep things as fair as possible"". I didn't find out that he had not given the RE Sheet to the other two living here as well, so I sent it to them yesterday.

So, after doing some math and comparing the receipts he kept in a box on the counter (B-Man is a freelance contractor and has been keeping receipts to write off when tax season comes around), we find out that he has been charging us for every little thing that we ask him to do while we have been running around buying things and filling up his gas tank unaware that he's double charging us.

***For Example:*** I asked him to get balloons for a birthday party for one of our mutual best friends. He bought the most expensive balloons he could find and added them to my resident expenses without telling me. He has double charged us for gas that we put in his car every time we take the car out. We put $20-$25 in per use. He has charged us for movie tickets that we both did not ask him to buy for us and that he offered us under the impression we would not have to pay him back. The biggest problem that we have is that he charged us $25 for a doctor's visit that we never attended. HE IS MAKING US PAY FOR HIS DOCTOR'S VISIT BECAUSE WE WERE BEGGING HIM TO GO DUE TO VOMITING, NOT EATING FOR 6 DAYS, AND ALLERGIC REACTIONS. These are just some of the 33 total things he has overcharged us with, amounting in him demanding we pay back this $2300 that came out of nowhere, ON TOP OF OUR $700 MONTHLY RENT.

In regards to our 19f roomie, she let us know during our pseudo-investigation that B-Man had been contacting her demanding that he get's more money from her to pay for bogus charges she didn't agree to, despite her being unemployed and her having already given him approx. $1200 already.

**Background on B-Man**  
B-Man is a damaged individual. He's a Left-Brained man, very logical and very frugal. He spends a majority of his $3k a month paychecks buying anime and video game figurines rather than buying body care and non-rotten food. He would rather save a dollar by buying rotten lettuce at the grocery store than paying that extra dollar to have something edible and fresh. I would describe him as an incel with the behavior he's exhibited. We have had to confront him, as young 20-somethings, about going to therapy but he insists that doctors and therapists do not know what they're doing. He has to be the smartest person in the room to be happy, and he has to have control over everything 24/7. He and I constantly butt heads about this because I'm the leader or matriarch of our group of friends. 

A lot of people look up to me, but he constantly has to make sure that he's number one. We're sure he has a mild form of autism (Asperger's maybe) and we KNOW he has an extreme form of OCD in regards to 'cleanliness and perfection', but he refuses to go anywhere to find out. We've sacrificed a lot for him over the past few years, and we feel unfairly treated and upset to learn he's been taking advantage of us this way.

**In Conclusion**  
Based on the situation, we have been contemplating legal action, but \[again\] as young 20-somethings, we have no idea what we're doing. We just want to be done with the situation, but letting him suck all of the money we have out of us isn't in the plan. We've already all agreed that other than an even split of the rent, utilities, and groceries (which we plan to pay him; it's only fair), all of the other charges are completely unwarranted. Any advice for this kind of situation? We'd really appreciate anything we could get.",29Jan2020,1

I've talked to her about how her work has been affecting our relationship, but she doesn't seem to get it. She just apologizes and promises she'll be more present whenever this project or that paper is done. I know I'm never going to be #1 in her life (she's told me as much). Should I break up with her or resign myself to a life of being #2?

33,"So, I started this position (call center type work) a week ago today. It’s a very small department in a very large, state of the art building. There are only 4 employees that take calls, and they hired 2 through the temp agency. So 6 total. 

The first week, I just listened to trainer on the phone while she navigated the computer, taking orders/payments ect. She is fast on that computer, boy. Like I’m impressed or something. Trainer been there 3 years. And she flips through 3 different screens getting information from 3 different sources. 

Side note: other trainer with a real nice, soft spoken guy, that’s a hell of a trainer. Takes his time and explains shit.

So today, I go in this morning knowing I was going to be taking ALL the calls, as I was told before I left yesterday. 

I show up early and review my notes. I have excellent phone skills, and am a really genuine person at heart. So talking isn’t the issue. I know the product, I answer the customers questions correctly and smoothly.  

The problem you ask? IM TOO SLOW navigating the computer (adjusting accounts, sending emails, texts, logging calls. It’s a lot of steps. And I’ll forget something and she’ll get excited, but she always waits just long enough to make you uncomfortable. Then when the call is over. (Most of the times the call is fine) she just tells me how slow I am. “Your calls have to be under 3 mins, and you have to do everything needed to be done by the end of the call. (It’s my first day talking and navigating. My 6th day there.) And she telling me that by 90 days I’ll have to meet that criteria. 

Side note: ALL she does while I’m on the phone is look on Facebook and text her boyfriends.


Then she goes on to tell me that she told my supervisor that I was good with everything, but just “really slow.” She told me that, and I was like “I’d rather go slower in the beginning to be thorough, and reduce mistakes,”  “Well you’re gonna have to be a lot faster!!!”

I have the rest of this week, and next week of training, then I’m on my own. 

MY QUESTION: should I:

say something to my temp agency lady about what’s going on?

Or

Say something to my supervisor. That I understand the speed requirements after 90 days, but to chill the fuck out so soon in training. 

Or

Say nothing at all, and let her bitch at me for the rest of training? 

It’s just really frustrating when you trying to learn a new system and just get rushed through it. Had a 50/50 shot to get the good trainer,  and air balled it!

It started very mildly where I'd make sure to wash my hands if I was going to eat after being on the bus or train.

37,"Ok, so here’s the deal: I went from an internship last year to a remote job to a new offer for this year. It was intended to be 10 hours a week, 15 max., paying pretty well and offering me great opportunities, I was stoked. But now I realize that ”15 max“ is most likely going to be the usual case, bordering on 20. it’s also a lot of responsibility.

At this point I should mention that I have a bit of an off relationship with the boss. He was very touchy and didn’t respect my boundaries during my internship, which is why I had to be kind of rude to him and decline any sort of personal relationship, because I didn’t know where that would lead him and I didn’t wanna find out. He also sometimes didn’t pay me for months and then acted like it was an issue with his bank, which I don’t believe at all. 

Back to the situation now: My main issue is, I really wanna take the opportunity and also need the money. But it’s also my final year at college and next to all those exams and my thesis, I am working two other jobs next to the one I am talking about here to support myself. Plus my mom is recovering from cancer therapy right now, which means I spend a lot of time trying to support her. That part is also emotionally taxing and takes up a lot of my energy.

All in all, the stress is getting to me and starting to seriously impact my mental health. I feel weird about it, but I want to put myself first and quit this job, because it would lift a huge weight off of me.

But the firm is very small and they already calculated that I would be overtaking huge projects. It would be a pretty bad blow to them to just quit out of the blue after they relied on me. On the other hand, this is only my first week and I haven’t even signed a contract yet, so legally I would be fine. However, I don’t want to hurt their business. The boss is very slow at finding new replacements, so there would be nobody to cover my work if I just quit for a while and they’d be in trouble. It’s just that I have all my deadlines coming up by the end of the month and next month, so if I really want to quit for the sake of my mental health I should be doing that now. 

My plan right now is:
- not sign the contract but say that I falsely estimated the workload and want to quit 
- offer that in the worst case I‘d help to cover some of the prep work for the upcoming projects but not actually get involved in the projects up until the end of February (and hope he doesn’t take me up on that too much)
- teach my replacement so my boss doesn’t have to. 

Would you recommend me to change the plan?

And, more importantly: How the hell am I supposed to tell him that? He’s gonna be super mad at me and as I said we have a very weird relationship, so just thinking about that conversation makes my skin crawl,.. any tips on communication strategies or self-confidence?",29Jan2020,1
38,"A long story short while I was going through a divorce I made a poor decision and I joined a website called OnlyFans and posted content to earn fast money.

My appointment isn't for another 3 weeks so it's much earlier than I wanted to tell people and I don't feel like it's appropriate to tell people the news while they are grieving. I'm having some issues with fatigue and nausea so I'm concerned with what people will think or will start to guess what's going on. A lot of these people we would have had to tell over the phone because they live very far away so it would be nice to be able to tell them face to face. I worry it would be insensitive to tell people now but also worry that if we wait they might be upset we didn't tell them while they were here. I also think people might be upset if we tell them because it puts them in a position where they want to feel happy for us but don't feel like they can.

50,my best friend and i met about 8 months ago. it wasn’t that type of “when i saw his face i knew he was the one” kind of story. i thought he was cool and stuff so we started hanging out. eventually we got closer and i learned he had a girlfriend that he’s been with for over 6 years now. although he’s been with her that long she doesn’t treat him well and there is a lot of evidence she is cheating on him. I fell for him about 2 months ago and i decided to tell him how i felt. he took it better than i imagined and we decided to stay friends but have boundaries because he also admitted to having feelings too. whenever we hang out he is really affectionate towards me and treats me as if I’m his girlfriend. we don’t kiss or have sex but he gives me a lot of hugs and tells me he misses me a lot.  a couple days ago he mentioned to me that he loved me more than i loved him. the next day i tried expanding to him that i was still on love with him and he shouldn’t play tell me he feels that way if he doesn’t mean it. (he is the type of person that says “just kidding” after everything.) he refused to believe i was in love with him and tried comparing me to his girlfriends best friend who he felt that way for but in a “friend” way. the rest of the conversation was him trying to convince me that I’ve confused my feelings and it’s not actually love. yesterday while walking with him around our college campus he told me he loved me multiple times and called me “babe”. it made me uncomfortable so i snapped and told him to stop. he sounded serious but then admitted later it was a joke and was expecting for me to laugh at it? i hate the fact that i am in love with him now. although he is STILL with his girlfriend that he claims makes him miserable he is overprotective over me and wants to be with me rather than her. this guy is my best friend. i don’t know what to do. :(,29Jan2020,1

57,"I've worked here 6 months as a resident assistant and am shocked at how horrible it is in so many ways. It's so much worse than I could ever have imagined when predicting corruption, economic illness/ignorance, neglect and so on.   


Long story short, my main concern is NOT about causing a sh\*t storm, controversy or getting threatened myself (e.g. losing my job). I have another job that's much more important to me and I have a very positive reputation in many communities I can utilize. My main concern is that the damage and toxicity is throughout the majority of the adult housing program system and I have a lot of info that suggests many people will turn a blind eye. My organization owns tons of properties and is one of the 6 largest in the adult housing industry for my state in the USA. The CEO, among other CEOs of these nonprofits, were featured on the biggest news cycle after a natural disaster left people homeless recently.  


They have a surprisingly great public reputation driven by a strong corporate marketing team. I see it and it makes me disgusted because on the ground floor, our residents are being used to sell stories of saving them and giving the poorest people great housing communities. It's literally blatant lies. Under normal circumstances, I expect this building would be condemned and multiple huge lawsuits in play, even criminal charges. That's not what I want, but that's what I'd expect.   


What I really want are people to take it seriously who will make an impact so we don't continue to stagnate and march towards the cliff-edge- where something so bad happens it causes damage that can't be ignored.   


As far as the problem, mainly the reality is we receive insanely huge amounts of money to be an ""affordable housing"" solution and provide a community structure, yet we don't do that and leave residents on their own. We also accept the wrong applicants with extremely high-needs, who are often uninterested in making improvements to heal and transition into independence. It's so dangerous and chaotic, that alongside severe neglect, we have the following issues daily:

\-dozens of trespassers 24/7 blocking/squatting in bathrooms,   
\-such severe lack of community that residents can’t discern trespassers,   
\-hazards like needles, blood spatter (from heroin), sewage water, poop, mold and more,   
\-flooding kitchen sinks and bathrooms usually due to maintenance issues being neglected;  
\-general maintenance issues neglected for 3-8+ months, such as broken stoves, extreme heat loss, unsecured mailboxes;  
\-exit/entry doors &amp; fob systems neglected until they break and people are almost stuck inside/outside OR anyone can get in;  
\-individuals constantly drunk or high and in conflict with others or attacked/mugged;   
\-frequent stealing of anything moveable, police show up every other day on average (often doing nothing);  
\-frequent lease violations and eviction notices with intent to criminalize residents or alter facts;   
\-domestic violence issues and vulnerable adult abuse;   
\-personal, medical and mental health issues fester for weeks with nobody checking in or helping  
\-frequent threats of fights or violence by guests, trespassers or residents towards others  


Our building repeatedly is the cause of news stories in this zip code about safety and increased danger, crime etc. This neighborhood,which has always struggled, is rapidly declining economically for multiple reasons- it's had a 33% increase in violent crime Sept-Dec 2019. Our building is a hot-spot.  


Despite all of this I'm really happy and grateful I've been able to build genuine and trustworthy relationships with residents- it's a source of wealth and community-based power that may be handy.  


Additionally, the managers have no clue what I'm up to, though they occasionally narrow the boundaries of my role even more mainly out of fear of being scrutinized- they simply are ignorant of real solutions here and are afraid of reflecting on life... realizing they are more welfare-dependent than anyone in the program by having no actual skill-set and taking a paycheck for 40 hours just to do 1 hour of measly paperwork. They end up filling their time by shuffling around crises like it's a lifestyle. The excess money would be at least 25% more than our program needs but the funds go to extremely expensive repairs, court evictions, police bills (for using police too much), and resources drained from disrepair (water, heat, electricity).  


All recommendations are very much appreciated. I'm concerned with the serious apathy and how widespread it is, that many people will just reinforce the current state until it falls apart. I'm questioning about going to the media due to my skepticism of even the people and departments I'm reporting to. I want to drop a bomb that can't be ignored once it's this transparent.",29Jan2020,1
58,"So just recently, I was trying to ask to see if my girlfriend wanted to go work out with me.

64,"TL;DR: Ask old friends why they've dropped our friendship, or just move on and find new friends?

Im wondering if it might be at all beneficial for to try and get closure from a handful of people who seem to have dropped our relationships.  I fully accept adults have many things going on in their own life, but the specific cases I'm referring to really feel like straight up friend-ghosting, which is new for me.  I also accept that we all have our own agency, and it's certainly not my intention to attack, corner, or induce anxiety in anyone else.  

The only way I could glean any insight from this experience is to get honesty in return, which I'm thinking is highly unlikely to happen.  I can't recall anything I'd done to ruin these particular friendships, but if there is a way I can be a better friend for a new person in the future, or more considerate, I would be happy to know rather than repeating whatever behavior may have caused these rifts (if indeed it was my behavior).

Also, I just don't have many friends at this juncture of my life, so this information could be vital to righting that ship.  It's pretty crushing to be a 30-something in a new city without social support, and if I'm to get anywhere making friends, wouldn't it be good to have this information?

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22 and in college. Yesterday, I was helping coach a children's choir in order to impress my teacher. The kids were between 5 and maybe 13, and they were just wonderful. Truly heartwarming. I couldn't help but feel like I'd be a great dad if I had the will for it, but I digress.

At the end of rehearsal, this kid no more than 13 comes up to me and talks to me about teaching me how to play Pokemon (we had been talking about it earlier in the rehearsal), but while we're talking a thought pops in my head: ""Man this kid is cute as fuck"" but not in a cute baby kind of way, in a sexual way. I catch myself in the moment thinking that, creep myself out, slap his back and said see you next time. Worst part is I think my teacher caught the vibe as well, because her body language and demeanor changed after.   


I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Not the kid himself, but the fact that I actually got turned on by a kid no more than 13 years old, and thats being generous. I've always been great with kids, but I started being uncomfortable around children since about 2 years ago at a family gathering, when someone told me to stay away from the kids because it was making the adults uncomfortable. I wasn't doing anything at all, especially nothing of a pedophilloic nature, so just the mere accusation was enough to infuriate me. Since then,  I've felt it best to stay away from kids altogether. This was one of the few times since that I've stepped up to help a children's event, and despite how fun and inspiring it was, this one thought has completely taken over my mind like a parasite. I feel like I just proved everyone right, but I could just be way in my head about this. Is ANY of this normal? Besides therapy, what can I do?",29Jan2020,2
80,"About 7 months ago I ended a relationship I had with a guy (23) I met on Overwatch (dear god please forgive me). For the entirety of our relationship, he had been hiding the fact that he would flirt and chat with multiple under aged girls he would meet online. I only found out after I had visited him for the 3rd time, and was on his computer while he was away at work. Long story short, his discord showed me more than I needed to know about his relationship with these 12-13 year olds. After that, I left him (obviously), and I reported him for pedophilia. Now I am in a happy, healthy, relationship, but I can't stop associating small, harmless, things my new bf does with what my ex did. I am horrified that his hobbies and interests will develop into something grotesque. To make matters worse, I have anxiety attacks just thinking about pedophilia, and find myself in screaming matches trying to prove to the weebs incels on the internet that their nsfw art of 12 year olds is wrong.

81,"Hello! I need some help coming up with a good reply. About a year ago, I started rapidly losing weight without trying. To be honest, I needed to lose weight and I’ve been losing at the rate of approximately 10lbs a month and I could still stand to use some more. I felt like garbage in general and after some testing I was diagnosed with an auto immune disorder that is fairly common in my family. Unfortunately, whereas this condition is typically fairly easy to get into remission, I have so far been unable to do so and continue to lose and feel ill. I don’t look sick, I just feel sick. I don’t have to miss work much but I am uncomfortable a lot. So here is the issue....not many people know of my condition and I am uncomfortable talking about it so they think I am just losing weight on purpose. They ask me how I’m doing it and if I lie and say “Diet and exercise” they want more details. Sometimes they are really rude and ask if I had weight loss surgery. I’ve even overheard people speculating about it behind my back at work. It’s just one more thing on top of an already stressful event. I don’t want to talk about my weight, I don’t want to hear people telling me if I keep it up everyone will think I am anorexic, I don’t want people asking about my exercise routine or for keto recipes. How do I politely tell people my weight is not a topic of conversation? Even compliments have started to make me extremely self conscious because they never stop at just the compliment.",29Jan2020,1
82,"Looking for advice for something that has just started to make me feel emotional.

Context: I’m an aunt of six wonderful people, 1 of which has epilepsy. Because of this, her reading levels are a bit behind, so I take her to her tutoring center 3x a week.

Issue: Theres a tutor, probably around my age (27) who just acts like I don’t exist when I walk into the center. I have to stay there the entirety of my nieces tutoring due to her seizures. Staff prefers I’m on site. I say hello to this person every single time I walk in and out and I get the cold shoulder every-single-time. Of course she greets all the other parents kindly.

Im back tracking my thoughts to see if I did something wrong. Like do or say something? Im feeling like a shitty person at this point.

One of my personal goals in the last year was, and has been, to make sure that Im always kind to others.

I tell myself to ignore it, move on &amp; if she doesn’t say hello or goodbye, then oh well.

On the other hand, I want to feel like Im not being blatantly ignored and being rude to. All the other staff members are very kind to me.

83,"In my early twenties and nearing the end of my final year of university. I think it’s pretty obvious I’ve never been in a serious relationship, nor do I have much experience with talking to women.

There’s somebody at my university who I’ve grown to like over the past couple of years. We’re on separate courses but worked briefly on a project together a while ago as I was friends with somebody in her group at the time. Didn’t talk to her much, but I enjoyed her company and she seemed nice. Since then we haven’t interacted much beyond exchanging smiles once or twice after passing each other around the local area.

I would really like to actually speak to her and get to know her a bit, especially since I’ll be finishing uni soon so I’ll likely not see her around again once it all wraps up. Is there any way I can start a conversation with this person without seeming like a complete weirdo?

84,"My roommates are a married couple who are both 24 years old (2 years older than me). They have two dogs that they adopted from the shelter. One is a pit/hound mix who they got about three years ago, and the other is a pit who is about two years old and they adopted when he was eight months old. 

Let’s call my roommates L and P. P works as a fisherman in the summer, and in the winter he drives an oil truck. He’s typically gone from 6am-5pm. L works as a schoolteacher, and is gone from 7am-5pm. However, when they both get home, they usually only stay for a few minutes before leaving for several more hours, and don’t get ‘settled in’ for the night until 8 or even 9 some nights. 

They keeps their dogs crated all day long…

From 7-4 the dogs are always crated. Then, typically 4-5 days out of the week, they are briefly let out to pee around 4 or 5pm, and then put straight back in their crate while P and L leave the house. They even crate the dogs when they shower!!

The dogs are NOT bad behaved. They do get into the trash if left unsupervised, but that’s normal for any dog! They are also hyper, but I think that’s because they don’t get exercise or attention. I legit cannot remember a time when the dogs have been walked or played with outdoors. In fact, P has said multiple times that he hates the dogs, and he only stands on the porch and holds them on leashes when he takes them to pee (so they can barely move!). One of my friends also revealed that P once told her he couldn’t wait for the dogs to die so he could replace them with golden retrievers who “would be much better dogs”. I feel so sick. 

Now, I’ve only been living with these people for about 3 months. I work from 9-4 most days (sometimes I get out earlier). Even though I live on the second floor for the most part aside from sharing a kitchen (we share a barn house) I still go downstairs and immediately walk the dogs and play fetch a bit with them when I get home, but they’re still stuck in there most of the day, and I worry about them!

Their crates have no toys or water. P and L claim that if they leave them water, they will mess in their crate. When I suggested leaving the dogs out of their crates for the day, they claimed the dogs would be destructive. Nothing I have said is really being taken seriously. I absolutely hate P, and he also makes me very nervous. I am pretty sure he abuses his wife, L, but I haven’t caught him red handed. As for L, I know she loves the dogs, but she still works and is gone ALL the time, and clearly doesn’t prioritize the dogs over other things. They both act like the dogs are perfectly fine, but it just screams abuse to me. They don’t hit the dogs (but P yells at them a lot). And they feed them twice a day, but that’s about all the attention these poor dogs get. 

So my questions are, should I report them (I think I should honestly), and how do I go about doing this? Will I need to gather evidence first, or can I just call and tell what is happening? Can I tell them that this is neglect? And who, exactly, do I call? I’m a rather shy, nervous person who hates causing drama, but I really can’t stand this much longer. Someone give me advice please!!",29Jan2020,1

My older brother (25) has been living with me and my parents in a 2 bedroom apartment for the last year and a half. My parents work very much so they’re frequently not home, but when they are, they sleep in the living room or my room to not bother him.

He brought over a girl, and he promised me he wouldn’t let her stay over. Turns out as I’m returning from the gym at around 7am, he walks out with her. Mind you, I’m the only other person in the apartment all night, and I feel extremely uncomfortable having a complete stranger in my home. I called my mom when he left, and my mom ended up kicking him out.

104,"Hey guys,

In high school, I was depressed, mostly unstable, and trying to process trauma. During high school, my junior and senior year were the worst years for my mental health. I pushed and lost a lot of people in my life because of my actions and behavior. In hindsight, I can see how toxic I was. I'm in college now (20 F), going to therapy, taking medication, and overall, just trying to better myself.

I'm finally processing my trauma, I've been diagnosed with bipolar/borderline personality disorder, but have missed out on a lot of friendships, and missing my old friendships. I want to apologize to my old pals from high school.

I want to say I'm sorry for my gross behavior and that I now see how wrong I was. I want to say I'm better now. I want to know how they are doing.

My question of advice, I guess, would be, should I mention I'm seeing a therapist? Should I mention that I was going through things that I couldn't process, which in turn, could have been the reason my behavior was so gross?  (Gross as in clingy, jealous, extremely depressed, and unpredictable.) 

I have an idea of what to write them, I just wanted to know if it would be appropriate, as I want them to know the reason, and that I don't act like that anymore.

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you. :)",29Jan2020,1
106,"Unpleasant childhood experiences that lead to development of dysfunctional coping mechanisms and an incredibly weak and unstable sense of self.  Mostly enmeshment with a severely narcissistic mother.  I don't need to detail the abuse to feel justified in my pain anymore, which I think is probably a sign of progress.  It was that bad, and that's that.

I'm 27 years old now.  I work as the office manager for a prestigious local law firm.  I have a little boy of three and a half, and he's Well-behaved, loving, developmentally on-track, and (mostly) kind.  I have a boyfriend who pushes me to become more independent, self-sufficient, and confident, but who also enjoys taking care of me.  He's not always patient, no one is - but he's pretty grand.

I went no contact with my mother six or seven months ago.  She briefly elbowed her way back in when my grandfather died and I acquiesced out of respect and love for that great man.  Being in touch again for those two or three weeks reminded me how nauseatingly inhuman she truly is - she simply could not shut up about how she was going to spend all of his money.  She got shitty with me for being 'depressing' while she was getting excited about getting some new Ugg boots with the inheritance.  Now that the memorial service has come and gone (she didn't attend), she's back on the block list and I... am drifting.

I've got all the makings of a good life.  I clawed my way out of an abusive cycle, found a man who adores me and encourages me to implement healthy changes.  We diet and exercise.  I quit cigarettes, opiates, robo-tripping, pot, alcohol.  He taught me how to give my son stability and structure through patience and consistency.  We have a nice home with a fenced-in backyard.  We don't have money problems.  I have a psychiatrist with whom I have a very solid rapport that we built together over the last three or four years.  I found a therapist I feel comfortable talking to and who I believe generally actually cares.

I'd like to think I'm pretty self-aware.  If I weren't, it would have been too easy to follow in her footsteps.  As it is, it's not like I came out unscathed.  I'm not perfect and sometimes I can be awful.

But I've done so much work, hammered so many barriers to rubble, stared down every demon I could conjure.  I always believed that the fastest way to improve was to jump in over your head.  But now I'm swimming and I barely feel the current.  In fact, I barely feel anything.  Not happiness, but that's okay.  A pompous teacher once informed me that happiness is a mood, not a destination.  I would like to be content, though.  Does it come with time?  More work?  What kind of work?

CBT, DBT, talk therapies, coping techniques.  Peaceful place doesn't work for me.  I imagine fairies in the forest, I imagine dancing mushrooms, I sit on an imaginary ice chest filled with freezer burnt chicken nuggets that's meant to contain and lock away all of the ugliness I can't deal with until it's safe to open it again.  Goddamn lock's been busted, and I'm not heavy enough.  I even asked my man to help me sit on it.  Am I not imagining hard enough?  Where is the magical peace this is supposed to bring me?  Am I not doing it right?  Defective after all?

I'm just tired.  I'm so goddamned tired.  It isn't a question of whether I love my man and my boy, and it isn't a question of whether the good outweighs the bad or whether my problems are temporary.

I'm selfish.  I know that.  Maybe as selfish as my mom.  Narcissism must be in me somewhere.  

Given the choice, I would leave - to sleep, perchance to never dream.

We don’t leave them alone with our children, and since we don’t enjoy spending time with them, they visit our children once a week while our babysitter is here. (By contrast, my wife’s parents babysit often, go on vacation with us, etc.) So they’re always upset at us.

My mother is currently not talking to me. She’s gone through periods of a few weeks or months like this before, saying she’s too hurt to talk to me. But of course they want to keep up their weekly visits while the babysitter is here.

Should I allow them into my home, and have them spend time with my children, if my mother is unwilling to talk to me? Or should I risk making our relationship even worse by keeping her away for now?",29Jan2020,1
121,"I would especially like to hear from survivors of sexual assault who have gotten through their trauma in a healthy way. 

One of my best friends just told me that she got sexually assaulted by a boy she trusted after a party when she was on a study abroad. This happened recently in December. She is suffering and having nightmares, and she can't report him because he lives several states away (she doesn't want to have to fly back and forth for a trial that probably nothing is going to come from.) She is in therapy, but can barely sleep or eat. She cries all the time. She uses to be a happy person.

128,"Hey redditors, I’ve come here because my ability to concisely make a decision has somewhat dwindled as of late, and what better way to settle a moral conundrum than by referring to the mob for advice. 

I’ve recently turned 29(M), I have an okay job driving for a big company, and I’m starting university in a month. However in the last two years, my brother and two best friends left the city to pursue careers in other cities, and adjusting to life without them has had some challenging moments. I am far less social, and being an INFP I tend not to actively seek any new friendships let alone relationships. It feels like I have not laughed properly since they left, which I only realised recently, and on the whole it has honestly felt like an empty existence. I miss them tremendously! But it hasn’t been all doom and gloom: I stopped smoking marijuana in late 2018, dramatically cut back on cigarettes recently, I read, eat healthy, meditate and exercise more. So I am not giving in by any stretch of the imagination, I just think it’s important to illustrate that you can make some really solid moves in your life and still feel the crushing weight of it all. 

A few months ago I ended this ridiculous relationship with my old manager - a woman 7 years my senior, with a kid... A relationship that felt like an affair the whole time and one that I felt I couldn’t say no to, dragging on for three years with an endless oscillating cycle of extremes. Feeling on edge and hyper-conscious at work, basically paranoid that everyone knew (it was meant to be a secret but as far as I know people got the hint). So it is with some happiness that I can claim all of that to be behind me.

Enter the Crush. Well, she entered years ago. A girl at work only a little younger than me. The first time I ever saw her I was taken aback and immediately asked the compulsory “who is THAT?” question. It took ages, a long period of just saying “hey”, which moved on to short amicable interactions, and has now developed in to what I would call a playful and flirty friendship. About 8 months ago I did ask her if she wanted to join me for a drink, regrettably via text, but I still did. She said she was seeing someone, although she was flattered and that she thought I was genuinely a great guy. No worries, in some way it felt like a relief. I drifted back to said relationship with my manager, getting swallowed by the emotional toll of it all, until she finally left for another role.

I was free. I couldn’t believe it. I went on to sleep with her a few more times, feeling sicker and sicker with self-disgust every time afterwards. It wasn’t fair on her to lead her along in such a way, and it wasn’t fair of me to even put myself through this dopamine fuelled sick cycle of masochism. So finally one day it just stopped. I stopped.

Work has gradually become far more enjoyable, with only a slither of paranoia induced anxiety left. I can still feel it but it is faint and fading. In the aftermath of all of that, I started to see my crush as light at the end of tunnel in some sense. I would start to think about her more and more, following solid interaction after solid interaction at work. I don’t see her there too often, but when she’s there I am VERY aware of that fact and it is quite an exciting feeling! So I went away for a weekend and my stomach was just pumped full of butterflies. It wasn’t good, I literally couldn’t get her off my mind.

I caved in to these incessant thoughts and rashly texted her plainly asking if she wanted to meet at the markets that afternoon when I got back. She said no, but a nice text back and forth emerged from this. I still felt totally embarrassed that I would even ask such a thing, particularly via SMS, and that I should’ve just left it to keep working on our friendship naturally.

Anyway a month or so passed, and then I had four weeks off work, a nice excuse for some breathing space. On holiday I did dream of her a fair bit, but nothing unreasonable and I was able to just let it go. Upon my return, things got back on the right foot and pretty quickly. Feeling confident and happy, after work one day I texted her something funny about the day, and this is where I start to get confused... I am getting very enthusiastic replies, decent emoji ratio, endearing flirty humour, and what feels like genuine interest. I made a point to behave more chilled out and to work on getting to know her patiently and that seems to be working - not feeling anxious after sending a text and genuinely feeding off the vibe of the conversation irl and over sms. I’m trying to maintain my chill, but I still think of her like, all of the time... 

So now, I’ll be moving to a new place, starting a degree, which feels like having something to stand by and be proud of, knowing I am working towards something. I still have a handful of friends here who I’m making more of an effort to see, and in general I’m striving towards a better life. 

The question is, how do I proceed with my crush if it all? I don’t really know if she is single or not. That’s problem number one. Problem number two is, do I take action at all? I.e. do I keep actively texting her? I made a point to not do that because I don’t want to be annoying, but I keep getting tempted to because I really want to talk to her... our interactions have been the highlight of my life for the last year. From what I can see we’re pretty darn compatible, a similar sense of humour, we’re both creative, we’re both very friendly people. I see her maybe twice a week for small windows at work and do my utmost to make those meaningful, fun interactions. She mentioned casually that she was telling her sister about me, about little things that happened at work or something I told her. She has done this a few times actually. She also came up behind me and playfully scared me the other day, touching my arm... seems small but it all counts I guess! 

What could be happening is, I don’t see many people so the ones that I do I develop feelings for. I could be projecting an entire fantasy on to her in the aftermath of a shitstorm. She could be a symbol for something I don’t have, or perhaps I just think she’s better than me and I am desperate to be that “good”, to be accepted / validated or something like that. In some ways I feel like I love her, I can see myself with her and I just know that it would actually be amazing... but I also know those could be (very?) irrational thoughts... yes my decision making is off fucking kilter.

My only relationship for the last three years was so unique and so emotionally draining that in some way it’s like I’ve forgotten how to even do this! I simply don’t know how to proceed. Apologies for the novel, couldn’t help apply a fair bit of context to this otherwise very first-world-problem. Any advice you have will be truly truly appreciated!

130,"I am 28. I live at home with my father. I have no money to my name do mostly to an addiction to trading that no one really knows about. I have been really good at hiding it. My addiction has caused me to make horrible decisions in my life. Much of my lack of full-time employment has come from chasing losses in trading. In a sense I was too good. I would turn $500 into $5000 in a week only to blow that trying to make $100k on high leverage instead of being happy with $5000. I would get a job and in my head it was always temporary because I just needed those couple paychecks and I could flip it into $5k again, stupid right? Except for that fact that I would do that, time and time again. $400 to 7k in three days, $100 to 5k, $500 to 5k etc. etc. Never once did I make the withdrawal, always blew the money. This has gone on for 3 years and no one really knows. My brain as a result is not in a good place. I am smart, I have an engineering degree, I am capable of anything I put my mind too, I just got myself into a horrible situation honestly and obviously I can't go back. I want to move forward with my life. I want to start a career, save money but I am fucking stuck. Two problems. I broke my foot, I told everyone around me it was healed. In reality it hasn't healed, I owe the doctor $500 that I have been dodging and I need surgery. It hurts to walk. I can't afford surgery, though I have insurance. I would love to simply work a restaurant job but my foot is actually fucked, so I am trying to get a desk job but because I have no ""speciality"" despite having an engineering degree, I can't seem to get a job.

135,"Since I'm not sure yet whether we have legal options, I'll post here where the rules seem less constraining.

My 65/yo mother decided to move from South Dakota to California to be by me (her son). She found a company to help her move called ""All Pro Moving LLC"" HQ'd out of Florida which has turned out to be extremely shady. She asked to have her stuff delivered around 01/15, so they agreed to pick up her personal items ($&gt;12k in items) on 01/06 (22 days ago as I write this). She received an initial price quote to get her to agree to the job, then they basically conned her into paying extra to not lose her $1,000+ ""deposit"". After agreeing to the price change, they picked her items up on 01/06. After not hearing from the company around the agreed delivery date she tried reaching out to get an ETA. When she wasn't getting hung up on, she was met with rude staff with condescending attitudes basically saying things like ""you're calling again??"" ""it'll get there eventually.""

All she wanted to do is move to be by her son. She took a large chunk of her savings out and packed everything she's ever owned just to be taken advantage of by this trashy company.  After reading reviews for this company on Yelp/BBB, it's clear that many people have had similar issues with this company and I am concerned that some/most of our stuff may never even arrive.

After complaining with BBB/FMCSA the company reached out to us last week with an entirely different attitude, basically stating that the call was being recorded and that ""our stuff is in transit."" When we demanded a delivery date or a location of our items, they stuck to their fake script saying it's ""in transit"". The fact that they don't even have a delivery date after 3 weeks is a huge red flag to me.

We aren't sure they even know where our stuff is and it's making my mother physically sick. They have all of her life's belongings. After filing complaints with BBB/FMCSA, what are our best options forward Reddit?",29Jan2020,1

Since I am on the job hunt I am worried that growing a beard will come off as unprofessional for interviews/networking events.

My wife and I are a lesbian couple. The assistant is close in age to us - two years younger than my wife - and is ""supposedly"" straight.  

They sit behind the same desk together, which was fine when they were doing training but it's been almost 7 months.  

At the company Christmas party my wife chose to stand next to her assistant vs me, didn't get in line with me for food (chose to wait with her assistant) and when I returned from getting food they were sitting down next to each other.   When I confronted my wife about this she said, ""my assistant doesn't know anyone so I didn't want her to feel lonely"".   At this point the assistant has been at the firm for over 5 months.

However, at the end of an exhausting year last year where I still ended up working for two days after the office had closed for Christmas, they popped a performance review on me. I was incredibly overwhelmed at the time and said that I wasn't ready, it wasn't a good time and could it be postponed. I'm still waiting for the new date but today I stumbled across my boss's notes about me and all of the wording she used was extremely negative and there wasn't a single positive comment. She had noted things like how I'd refused to operate a chairlift when there were disabled people in the building - a chairlift I have no training in using and when someone did try to teach me it failed to work so I wasn't comfortable using something I had no training in with an actual human on it.

144,"I have sat in the library for the past 2 hours sitting on page 1 chapter 1 of my abnormal psychology textbook. I have a midterm in 2 days.

I'm in my 3rd year of university, but I feel like I'm reaching the end of my rope. My grades and motivation have been getting worse and worse since I started. I went university because my mom wanted me to go, and everyone else was going. I personally never thought about what I was going to do after high school, I always had good grades, so I felt like I never had to worry, and I was just going with the flow. I went into Biology because I was good at it in highschool, and the career prospects seemed good, but I hated chem so much and I started to hate biology too by my second year. Halfway through my second year, after dropping from 5 classes to 3, I switched to psychology, and this year I switched to a different university because I needed a fresh start. I really like learning about the mind and I like figuring people out, and I love helping people like my friends and family work through their issues, so I want to become a therapist. Obviously there is a lot of school behind that: Standard psych degree with a 4th year thesis, masters, PhD, etc. The problem is, I've been getting worse at school every year. Last semester I barely passed one of my mandatory classes, and I need an average of 75 in all my mandatory classes in order to qualify to write my thesis in my senior year, which is almost mandatory as far as I know in order to get into grad school. I've been too nervous to check my other grades.

Every time I think about doing work, I procrastinate, a lot. I get super anxious, and feel uncomfortable in my chest. I know I need to study, and do my assignments, but I just can't. I have to force myself so much just to do any ounce of work, and I'm mentally exhausted after just 15 or so minutes of work. I've always been a bad procrastinator, in highschool I always did my assignments the night before they were due, studied for my tests the night before, but I always was able to kick into maximum overdrive because stress would take over. It wasn't healthy, but it worked. Stress doesn't take over anymore. Now, when I leave something to the night before, sometimes it just doesn't get done. I would rather get enough sleep then study for my exams, for example.

Now here's the kicker, and where it gets difficult. I know what the problem is: I have ADHD. I've known about it since I was 6, and I've been on adderall since I was 8. We tried a bunch of other meds, adderall was the best, so we stuck with that, slowly increasing the dosage over the years. My current dose is 40 mg. The thing is, I stopped taking adderall the summer before my second year, so about 2 years ago. I would consider it a good choice, because I didn't realize how much it sedated me. I'm so much happier when I'm not on adderall, I can make friends, I finally have my first girlfriend, I can actually speak to people and hold meaningful conversations. I hate being on adderall. For the last year and a half I have been only taking it on the day of important tests or if I really need to crack down and get work done, but more recently I have stopped even doing that because I hate it so much. I was on it for about 2 weeks during the last final exams, and my relationship and social life almost took a nose dive. I lose all interest in any of my hobbies, and I just become a robot. Sure I can do work, but at what cost?

Here is my problem. I don't know if it is worth it or not. Obviously I need a degree, I need a career. But I will do anything to not go back on adderall. All my highschool life I had almost no friends and got bullied because of the way I was on adderall, I can't go back to that. I can't manage my ADHD, I've been trying, but I'm not strong enough or disciplined enough. I have no idea what to do and I need help.

She freaked out when I made an appointment while she was working and didn’t make sure she was off, and cried when I told her she didn’t need to be at every appointment.
She constantly tells me I have to come over everyday, and constantly calls my baby “our baby”. I get she’s excited but she’s been very smothering my entire life, and needs to be involved in every little aspect of my life. Today she cried when I told her I went to my aunts house to make baby shower favors and forgot to tell her.
Anyways, she wants to stay with us and I’m not sure how I feel about it, my s/o says no, and I just don’t know how I feel about her coming into our room at night while we’re sleeping to get the baby up for us, and basically being with us every second of the day and not giving us any personal space. We’ll both be off of work for 10 weeks, and it’s not like I’ll be all alone. 
Idk if I’m being an asshole or if I have a right to feel like this
I don’t know if I should just suck it up for a couple of weeks, or risk her bugging out on me over this 

TDLR: my mom wants to stay with me and my s/o for 1-2 weeks but I don’t know if I’m comfortable with it and not really sure if I should just deal with it or straight up tell her no and risk hurting her feelings",29Jan2020,1

 I have been playing soccer for years now. Ever since first grade and I’m now in 9th. I have informed my coach and all of my teammates know at this point. I gave many reasons of why. However all the reasons were blown off by my mom. Some reasons were I just didn’t like it anymore, didn’t want to get hurt, my grades, etc. I didn’t say one reason though. Which I probably should have. My mom. 

My mom forced me to play for our school. Forced me to play winter soccer. I obviously didn’t like that and told her so. I only kept playing because she wanted me to. She always says that “I don’t look like I’m not having fun on the field.”. Well that’s just because I want to make her proud. When I told her I wanted to quit she blamed my girlfriend. I was on the kitchen floor balling my eyes out.

I understand that sports are good for you and are good for bonding. I just don’t want to be forced to do this anymore. 

If I can get any advice that would be great

Edit: I want to add something else. Some girls on the team are mad at me. I had a teacher who is the mom of one of the girls ask me not to quit. I’m not going to say they don’t care about my happiness as they probably don’t know. However if someone wants to quit support them. Don’t tell them to keep going. They are probably quitting for a reason.",29Jan2020,1

But for the past 12 years....I been rejected each and every time for a date.  Online and in real life.  I am not the attractive enough..... everytime.  It hurts. 

I also have a ""different"" personality which doesn't help at all.  I am a 39 year old ""INFJ"" male.  

I always make sure to smile and wave hello to anyone I can because I don't want others to feel the lonliness I experienced in most of my life.  

I tried dating coaches and therapy and nothing has worked.  Have spent $5,000 in total.  

Growing up, I was always the ""unattractive one."" I was the book nerd.  My family ridiculed me so bad that I have zero contact with them and have not seen them in over a decade.  

I was constantly the butt of all jokes with my friends for unable to find a date.  I couldn't smile around them just because I was in full panic of someone calling me out for my lonliness.  One time at a friend's wedding, a prank was pulled on me in front of 100+ people highlighting to everyone of being ""last single guy."" 

I left all my friends cold turkey after that....

Made new ones thinking it would be different but it eventually creeped into conversations and had to leave them as well. 

I'm pretty much a loner now.  

At work, I am constantly harassed for being single.  Rumors of me being a closeted gay,a secret pedophile or a serial killer hurts bad.  It breaks me into tears sometimes when I get home.

The thing is I've never known what parent love was ? Or even seen my dad kiss my mum ? All he did was beat her up and my siblings and I witnessed it didn't do anything because I was like 7 years old and was scared also my parents divorced and dad married another women behind my mum's back so yeah fun heyy. This has deeply affected my relationship, pretty much look for dominant women in my life just women who are independent and would look after me ? Like a mum would I think that really hindered my relationships with women. 

The whole point is men do suffer the mental effects of not having a mother that acknowledges your existence 
And I would love if she just hugged me or even said I love you that would make my day

162,"So about a a month and a half ago, my boyfriend and I moved out of one apartment and into another in central coast California. We got our security deposit back from the old apartment, however they spelled our names wrong. This would normally be okay with us, the bank was okay with depositing the check, but we decided to get the spellings corrected. Our reasoning behind this was that the property management company seems slightly shady, and that they'd try to claim that since we aren't the correct spelling of the name we were worried that they'd try to claim fraudulent deposit to get their money back from us, leaving us shit out of luck. Worst case scenario but this company doesn't have the best reviews. They also kept pushing us to ""just deposit it anyways, it doesn't matter if the name is wrong."" 

Fast forward two weeks after I turned over the check to be corrected and we finally get the notice on Saturday (1/25) the check is ready, however only one name is spelled wrong so they take it back, knowing I'm adamant about the names being spelled right. They tell me on Monday(1/27) the check will be ready so I called and was told ""Our accountant has been in meetings all day, he's had no time to issue a check"". Today I repeatedly call/text asking about the status of the check and I was told that ""The accountant went home sick after his meetings, and didn't come in today"". I really stressed that I didn't have time to wait two more weeks for  the check to be written. 

What can I do? They gave me the deposit within the legal amount of time, twenty-one days, but I'm wondering if there is anything I can use to pressure them into getting me my deposit back sooner rather than later.",29Jan2020,1

After a loud workout tn (don't attribute that to anything, no headphones, just loud speakers) I walked out and couldn't hear much from my left ear.

Need some advice.  The other day, the doctor told me that this 11 month old kitten was afraid of the owners boyfriend. ONLY afraid of the owners boyfriend. Kitten was fine with all people, even the owners roommates. I felt the boyfriend was most likely abusing the kitten.

The Boyfriend claims the kitten must have gotten into the cabinet and covered himself in bleach.  This guy also didn’t bring the kitten to the clinic right away when he first called.

170,"I'm a girl, 16F. Here is a little back story before I get into what I want to talk about. I'm an only child, my parents are my best friends. They support me through everything in life &amp; always try their best to make sure I am happy. Ever since I was 13 I moved to a new school away from my friends. It was my choice. I got bullied at this school, and this was when I discovered I had extremley bad anxiety. I would miss at least 2-3 days of school every week &amp; it was literal torture for me. I would come home crying everyday &amp; my parents realised that I wasn't doing well. I gained 40 kgs since being there &amp; my whole 'bubbly' personality changed &amp; I lost my personality. I moved schools after 6 months of being in the old school, it was alright but I spent most of the days in the counsellors office due to my anxiety attacks. The next year, I moved to the school where all my friends were, but it wasn't the same. We hardly spoke because I completley lost my personality. They ended up bullying me, leaking private information, making fake accounts of me, beating me up inside and outside of school etc. My parents were not aware as I didn't want to stress them out about moving schools again. So I just didn't tell them, everyday I would get to school &amp; immediatley take a bus back and just chill by myself in a park. If i stepped into school, I would just break down. My parents ended up finding out so they let me do home school. When exams came up, I had to go to my old school to take them. I had my own private room with no other kids &amp; everyone did everything to make sure I wouldn't freak out. I passed out as soon as I got to the school grounds so my mum pulled me out of doing exams. Since I was hardly in college to learn, catching up was really hard. I'm happy doing online school but it completely took away every aspect of my life. I don't go out, I have no motivation to do anything, I have no friends. All i do is sit home, do about an hour or two of school work and sleep until the next day. 

I know this all makes me sound like an idiot, like I have no plan in life but I truly do. Ever since I was young I have always wanted to be a travel editor. Start a youtube channel, travel the world, film my experiences &amp; get an income from that. It sounds almost impossible, I know. But my passion for this is so strong, and my parents are so accepting of this. I want to drop out of school. School is not for me &amp; never has been and even the thought of it makes me sick. It just stresses me out &amp; makes me push away my dreams &amp; goals by making me learn and do things I would forget in a few years. All i am doing in school is learning about a bunch of crap that I'll never remember just so theres a peice of paper saying I'm capable enough to get a job. I can't stand a 9-5 job, a normal job. I don't know how to tell my parents about this as I just want to make them happy. They don't believe in dropping out &amp; want me to go to university. But I see it all as a waste of my time, especially if I want to do something that dosn't involve graduating or going to university. 

When I started online school, I found a boyfriend. I know what most people think about being 16 and have a boyfriend. 'You're too young.' I completley agree, but it felt nice having someones company especially when you're alone every second of the day. My boyfriend is 19 &amp; he takes me out of the house, takes me to the beach, drives along the country and supports my dreams. He bought me a camera so I could start my career. I made some new friends after meeting him. My parents and friends felt like I wasn't spending enough time with them so I broke up with him after a year of being together. Shortly after, my friends randomly dissapeared &amp; I was alone again. I loved spending time with my parents, but sometimes I just want a friend. I ended up getting back with my boyfriend secretley &amp; I told my mum about it but they're not too happy about it. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel alone, I have no motivation, I dont even have enough emotions in my system to cry or laugh anymore. I just feel like a zombie &amp; I could go on way more about this story in detail but honestly I feel way too drained. Any advice?",29Jan2020,1

This is my story it starts 4 years ago

One year prior to meeting my finace...

His story:
My partner lived in Australia, he had been there for 8 years (born and bred in New Zealand) he spent the majority of his 20s there, mostly alone just touring the country and picking up his chefing qualifications along the way, he worked hard and partied hard. Then sad news came that his pop passed away and he travelled back to new Zealand for the funeral. While he was back he began to get sick, seeing and hearing things, and eventually ended up having a full blown breakdown, to the point he was sectioned after being found in a church crying, begging God to get rid of the demons. Once he was sectioned the paranoia became so overwhelmingly scary that he was convinced that the nurses where poisoning his food and that he was going to die a long painful death. His sister came to visit, and found him hanging by his belt in his room. She cut him down. He survived and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, returning to his normal self after being prescribed medication. He moved in with his dad, for 6 months until he was on his feet again working full time. He then moved in with his cousin and thus moved in next door to me.

My story: 
In the year prior to meeting my partner, I had been up to that point a single mum for 6 years, I worked full time and had studied social work. One Saturday my son and I had a nice day, we went to a book fair, went to see the mini trains and went for a swim, when we got home I made dinner and then snuggled him into bed early as he was very tired. About 20 minutes after this just as he fell asleep i got a phone call from my brother ""dont freak out....dad has been in an accident, I dont know how bad it is, make your way to A and E drive carefully"" so I rang a friend and packed a little bag for my son woke him up and took him to her house (probably a good time to say my dad is my sons idol he has been super involved in helping me raise my son and was even my birthing partner, I grew up in a very nuclear family mum,dad,my big brother and me and are all pretty close to one another, so I didnt want my son at the hospital given we didnt know yet how bad it would be). I went to the hospital just as the ambulance arrived, my dad was weird grey colour, concious, I ran to him and tried to be comforting....and that's when I saw it, his leg. His leg was no longer a leg, it was a twisted  smashed, bleeding and dangling large peice of flesh. I could tell he had massive blood loss. We got the news that he was losing his right leg above the knee, he had broken his spine. His survival was not guaranteed. His blood pressure was 60 over 40. He survived and not only survived but thrived, it hit hard seeing my dads life fading and seeing my big strong dad become so broken and vulnerable. My mum didnt cope to this day she struggles immensely but they love each other and take every day as it comes. My dad went back to work 3 months later and we go the gym together every morning. The emotional trauma still hurts from time to time. I was struggling with single parenthood, working full time and helping out my parents where possible. I left my job immediately after my dads accident to help take care of him as my mum was emotionally not coping and couldn't deal with gory side of things. So going back to work has a little rough as I was very fragile still and trying hard to be strong.

Us:
My frantic stressed self was coming home from work around 5.30pm each day with my little one in tow. I noticed the new guy next door had been fairly regularly hanging out in his hammock each night when I got home, naturally he would wave, smile and say hello, over time this progressed to chatter and eventually friendship. He was very kind and would mow my lawns, brought me over food when I was sick and was generally just a kind and helpful person....naturally I ended up letting my defenses down and we fell in love 😍 he is a wonderful step father and a very kind, very caring partner. We both work full time and I ended up flipping my career on its head, I went from taking care of people before they die (advocating for the patient between health care professionals and the families and making sure my patients where as happy, relaxed and comfortable as possible before passing) to emergency care I now teach first aid and work on the ambulance frontline, I have built up my career quickly and very much enjoy my job. I take my partner once a month to get his slow release Injection to keep his schizophrenia under control and he is doing brilliant, it never put me off or worried me, as my background in social work was heavily associated with men and mental health, something I feel very passionate about and breaking down the stigma. 

Our future:
My finace proposed a year ago, we want to get married at the end of the year and look into treatment for our secondary infertility. We both have debt, his from taking time off to take care of his mental health during and after his break down. Mine from quiting my job to look after my dad, we also have a combined debt from borrowing money to buy a car (not super flash) when both our cars broke down (we both had old tin can cars on their was legs haha) past separate student loans and we also at separate times needed emergency dental care.The debt sinks us, it holds back every part of out future plans and is a mental struggle for us both. We both work over time, sometimes upto 7 days a week to pay off this debt as fast as we can, when interest builds it feels like we are just chasing our tails. I dont know how to push forward, we have been working on this for over two years and feels like we dont get very far. He could go back chefing (he is currently farming) but this wouldnt be wise as such a fast pace high pressure environment for a sustained period was part of the reason he broke down and I want him to stay stable, and feel like he isnt biting off more than he can chew mentally. I could put more hours in but any more than I already do and I would pretty much never see my son and I also need to make time for my own mental health when working with some pretty intense traumas on the frontline. 

How can we move forward and start looking forward to our future? I am 29 and he is 33. His brothers and sisters (6) all own homes and his parents pressure us to buy as well but we simply cant right now as much as we desperately want to. We view ourselves as in the 'young' part of our relationship as they have all been married since early 20s and we did not meet each other until much later in our lives so are still building our life together. 

If you made it thus far thanks so much for reading! Any advice on quicker more effective ways to clear our debt? We would love to start our married life on a fresh new page, debt free. (Apart from asking family to help as we are not willing to compromise family relationships by involving money)

Total debt: $70,000

Total after two years of hard graft paying as much as humanly possible: $54,000

Help we have shopped around at lower interest rates, consolidated and made it as manageable as possible via the bank and other financial institutions. Our only hope now is to keep hacking away for another 10 years.",29Jan2020,2

180,"I think my perception on people and their intentions is skewed. I am an attractive girl (not saying I’m the hottest person alive or anything like that, I’m just basing this off my personal experience.) 

One example that constantly sticks with me is a job interview I had, and the female interviewer goes, “Next time you interview, you shouldn’t seem so focused on your appearance. You aren’t here to be looked at, you’re here to work.” I wasn’t even wearing anything revealing. I looked quite professional and had makeup on, but nothing crazy. I realized I feel like I can’t be friends with females because either

a) they become too competitive with me
b) get insecure or
c) they get paranoid about their bf liking me (One time my friend’s bf suggested including me in a threesome with them and it happened again with a different female friend of mine)

I also feel like I can’t be friends with males because 95% of them eventually develop feelings for me. In a group of mostly guy friends, I felt like they were always flirting with me or treating me like I’m just there to look pretty and have zero personality. I also had an experience where two of my male cousins tried to rape me, so my faith in humanity is pretty nonexistent at this point.

183,"I’ve felt attraction for girls for as long as I can remember and came out to friends 4 years ago and to my parents a year ago. I’ve never really liked guys but found some cute, the same way a straight girl would find certain girls cute- therefore, I thought this was normal. However, I met this boy in my biology class in August when school started, and I thought he was really charming and cute. I didn’t think I was into him until recently. We both do theatre and are currently leads in a play. I’ve gotten to spend more time with him outside of class and realized I might like him as more than friends. But I am terrified at the possibility that I am actually bisexual because everyone knows me as a lesbian. I definitely still like girls a lot more than guys, so if I am not gay I would be bi- straight is just out of the picture. But I think my friends would be shocked and I hate coming out and the idea of essentially having to come out all over again is exhausting. Plus, my parents had their doubts that I was gay, so I tried really hard to get them to believe it wasn’t some phase. Four years of my life being a phase feels terrible. Another thing- I feel like this boy might like me back, but if he doesn’t, is it even worth “coming out”?

184,"Hey everyone!

I (23F) and my boyfriend (25M) are looking to live together! We have been together for over 7 years now, and we are ready to finally live together (finances are in line sort of).

We are planning a pretty large move though, from PA to FL. I have a chronic pain disorder and every single time I’ve been to FL, my pain decreases significantly. This is a large part of the move, but also job availability and beaches! 

I have no idea how to start this process.

We are planning to move May 1. We are searching for an apartment currently. We are going to start looking for jobs in March. 

We also have a 2 year old cat that will be joining us! 


So my questions.....

1. How does one make such a large move? We don’t have furniture together, but he has a full woodworking shop in my parent’s basement, so how do we move all of these tools? 

2. How much money do you think we would need? I’m assuming $1500 for a pod (to ship items), $200 for gas (to drive), $2500 for the apartment (first &amp; last month rent + security deposit), $650 for cars (title &amp; registration), $500 for vehicle insurance, and $300 for utilities, and about $2,000 for furniture overall. Am I missing anything? Am I over/under estimating these prices? 

3. Traveling with cat. My baby is up to date on shots and fixed. He is TERRIBLE with traveling though. His vet is currently 10 minutes from home, and he CRIES the whole drive there, unless my hand is in his carrier. I’m not sure if flying would work, he’s a pretty large cat (25 pounds) and he would have to be under the seat the whole time. Driving 20+ hours isn’t feasible either I don’t think (litter, food, water). Would a vet prescribe medication to help him relax so we can fly? It’s only a 2.5 hour flight. 

4. Jobs. I am a Doordash driver so I can start that immediately, but I want to get a full time job. I do not have a degree currently (financial aid screwed me). I used to work in an emergency room as a secretary/registration, so I plan to go to that. Is there something better paying though? My boyfriend is currently in school but plans to transfer for the Fall semester, so he would be working part time. 

Am I missing anything? Am I overthinking this? I really want to do this move, we tried to do it two years ago and it wasn’t right. 

Any advice is appreciated greatly! Please no negative comments about FL or us moving. 

Thank you so much!!!!",29Jan2020,3

193,"I'm a 13 year old guy from Australia and over the past 2 years or so I've been starting to feel really crap. I went to a new school 2 years ago it took me a while to find friends (about 1 and a half years) who weren't utter assholes yet I'm still struggling with lots of school work and having to do 1 and a 1/2 hours homework each day (not in the holidays though) and that's probably going to get worse as I go into year 9. Our days are around 7 hours and I've got about 3 hours in transit so I don't really get much time to myself over school and I really hate school even though I don't do to bad in it. 

Yet most of last year my two older brothers treated me well enough and obviously we sometimes argued and stuff but now I'm basically being bullied by both of them together and my parents don't care. I actually get in a ton of trouble with my parents whenever I react or fight back to my parents. My dad gets in a fight basically every night over stupid things like eating food to fast etc... and I really hate spending time at home (it's also bloody hot outside) so I spend most of my time in my room watching youtube or on reddit or something. I've got a few hobbies like creative writing and reading but I barely do either anymore. I also told my mum about feeling depressed three times and it's not like she's a cold hearted person yet first time she called me a drama queen, second she said ""You're always depressed,"" in an annoyed way and third she kinda ignored it. Worse is she always seemed worried that my other two brothers being depressed when they aren't but she doesn't care when I'm reaching out.

Before I cam to my current school I had a group of friends which I kept in touch with for about half a year afterwards yet whenever I reached out for support I got jackshit and my friendship basically shattered after that so I really don't want that to occur with my current friends.

194,"I sit with this other person in another one of my classes while avoiding the study group in the other class, and this other person has really gotten adamant about me sitting with them.

The study group is pretty toxic. One time I called them my ""friends"" and they gave each other looks and it was weird and made me question whether I have friends. Thing is, it is a study group I can take advantage of for help on homework/quizzes, and by not sitting with them I guess I'm passive-aggressively splitting ties with them. Although I do want to cut them out completely, my intention currently is just sit near the front alone so I don't get distracted, while this group is pretty rowdy.

I tried explaining this to this other person (I hesitate calling them my friend), but I think they take it personally. Last semester when I didn't sit with the study group a couple of times they took it real personally and wouldn't accept any excuse, making fun of me for sitting alone, even though I do do better closer to the front.

The way I see it, I have a couple courses of action:

1) Sit with them tomorrow once to make an appearance then don't sit with them.

2) Don't sit with them ever and explain to the other person not to take it personally.

#1 seems most diplomatic, but these people are hella toxic and I'd love to just cut them out entirely.",29Jan2020,1
195,"Trying to keep this discreet and not use a lot of details but basically today I was with my friends and a few girls that I know in their car and while me and my friends went out of the car for a few minutes to buy something from a store, I’m pretty sure that one of the girls that doesn’t like me very much because I didn’t want to date her (haha I know) decided to steal money from my wallet which was in my backpack that I left in the car. It happened when I needed to go back to the car to get more money and she watched me get my backpack, take the money out, and put the rest of the money back into it. I then handed her my backpack while she was in the car and went back inside the store. I didn’t check my wallet until I got dropped off but when I did it was completely empty except for some change. I know for a fact that when I took the money out there was still a good amount left in my wallet. She’s the only one who would’ve taken it because my other friends were in the store with me. This is a big deal to me as it was a lot of money and it would make sense to me if she stole it because of her dislike for me.

201,"Hey, I'll try and keep this straight to the point...

My current job has become toxic, let's start with the supervisor...

SUPERVISOR...

...is currently on probation (not at work, on the outside, as in he has a PO), was/is in treatment, is an alcoholic who drinks while he's/was in treatment, constantly talks about his current divorce and who he and his soon-to-be ex wife are banging, randomly hits up staff on the weekends to go to the strip club and/or out drinking (no one takes him up on this), lies to upper management about the staff to save himself...

Then there is upper management, the manager, and then his boss.

UPPER MANAGEMENT...

&amp;#x200B;

...manager never talks to staff but regularly complains directly to his boss about staff not meeting expectations, manager talks to staff through emails (which his boss is always attached to) in a highly disrespectful tone while using condescending language...

his boss...

backs up everything the manager says without speaking to staff directly or actually knowing what's going on, recently called a meeting to rip on the staff for not meeting expectations, only to later get on the supervisor for not doing his job, which is, making sure expectations are met. This would make his meeting with staff pointless, as the supervisor never made sure expectations were met, and as a result, the staff were clueless to the fact that they were not meeting expectations. 

I've lost all respect for this place, it's a skeleton crew of guys, which makes it a bucket of crabs environment. We have a guy who calls off for at least a week and a half every month, and we all have to carry his slack, hell, some staff even half ass it to leave him work for when he's back cause everyone knows he's just working the system. Even though we cover for others on a constant basis, management always criticizes our work, it's always negative, we never hear anything about what we're  actually doing right. It's killed any and all motivation to do quality work. I called in one time, as I was just burnt out from the bs of the job, and I had to call the manager's boss. This guy tries to guilt trip me by saying, as a result of me calling in, they're now three short...I'm not the hiring manager (we have one position that hasn't been filled), the guy who always calls in, then me. He almost seemed upset at me because it created more work for him.

I'm dead set on leaving that place and those people behind as the job is also a dead end one. I was looking for advice on how to get through it until I'm able to move on? As, at this point, I'm pretty fed up with how disorganized, irresponsible, and reckless this place is, yet management has the nerve to talk to and handle people in the way they have....",29Jan2020,1
202,"Hi all! First of all, yes I just want to disclaim that I know dorm life isn’t supposed to be ideal and completely quiet. My roommate and I aren’t super uptight people and are generally pretty relaxed . However, this situation has gotten out of hand. Our dorm hallway starts with boys and then goes to girls, with a study nook in the middle which has a table and whiteboard. My roommate and I live in the very first girls room, which just happens to be right across from the study nook. Every night, this group of kids from our hall sits out there and chats loudly for hours, usually starting at 2 pm, on and off, until 12/1am. Quiet hours start at 9 pm here. Now, there have been other groups who actually use the nook to study, and are quiet and respectful. On the rare occasion that my roommate or I have had the balls to say anything to them about the noise, we’ve been extremely kind and forgiving. However, the group hanging out there without fail always gives us dirty looks when we walk by, as if we’re horrible people for wanting sleep or to study in peace. This is not just an issue with us. People farther down the hall have complained to the RA to the point where she threatened to write them all up last semester if it continued. Yet, they don’t seem to be discouraged and continue to hangout there, often singing music loudly or laughing and running up and down the halls. They often wake me up. One time they got sent to the lobby and a girl from the other side of the dorm complained about how loud they were. There are 6 floors in our dorm and when our friends from other floors come to visit, they are shocked by the noise level and amount of people outside our room, especially if it’s past 9 pm. I would also like to add that there are other places in the dorm they could hangout. Each floor has its own lobby and the first floor has a recreation room with a couch, tv, and games. I really don’t understand why they hangout there, as it’s the smallest and least comfy space in the whole dorm. My roommate and I are exhausted over this issue as our RA usually isn’t there to reprimand them and doesn’t seem to scare them.

Anytime I leave the house they accuse me of being out smoking pot even when I’m only out for like an hour. I plead with them to just drug test me but they refuse for some reason. They say they don’t want to have to stoop to that level and that they want to trust me. I’m not sure what to do but it’s driving me crazy.

My brain keeps telling me that I made a bad decision and that he won't stop harassing me ever. That he'll make it worse. I don't know why I feel this way. I know I'm in the right but I'm scared.

Unlike some people who have fictional crushes, I don’t look at porn of her nor do I jerk off to her as I find it disrespectful. I often find myself looking at pictures and videos of her for hours.

224,"Hi everyone, I have been having intense mood swings for quite a while and I'm getting worn out by them lately. For the sake of this request let's just say a therapist/psych is not an option atm. I am torn between a lot of stresses, goals, dreams, interests, responsibilities, etc. My issue is that my mood can go from super negative and hopeless to extremely motivated and excited in less than a minute. These swings happen to me multiple times a day where I snap from one end of the spectrum to the other without any notice. It's making it very difficult to be productive and it's very exhausting. I love the good mood swings but these are often overly hopeful and ambitious and last very short. The negative ones tend to go so deep that I have definitely had some breakdowns as a result. I just want to find a consistent place where I can be hopeful and excited but reasonable and level headed. I need to get my productivity back and I want to keep my life moving in the direction I want it to but right now I'm just really stuck as my mind jumps around to every thing it can latch onto momentarily.

All my life through school looking back I thought I was a dick to be blunt. I have changed a lot from those times about 5 to 8 years ago yet I always at school and by a lot of people get called an ass.

And this might reflect in me having a small circle of friends and not really getting into any of the ""Cool kids"" which I do not wish to be a part of yet I have reasons to try and somewhat connect with a few yet more often then not. I have people who my first year into this no school hate me for my views my sense of humor and there fore my guts.

Now I am not willing to suck up to anyone, but my sense of humor can be dark and sometimes offensive I haw been getting better at censoring what I say, I am in middle school by the way if this matters and a lot of the time I barge into other peoples conversations that are close to me in a distance sense not social sense however even when I was young and today I am very sociable. And when an opportunity comes when someone says something I can insult them mildly on in a conversation near me I do it this might be the main reason though, this only happens to a select few and rarely.

(At least I think so.) And sometimes I become not me and suck up on humor for shock value to try and make new friends sometimes this will get a laugh but it never takes of from there and I just get weird looks. So guys am I an asshole and if I am what could I do to try and improve?",29Jan2020,1

I've been feeling nauseous a lot lately and have been vomiting or at least spending a lot of time gagging or feeling like I'm going to vomit (no I'm not pregnant).

Why do this? Well, they’ve paid for my education and given me a place to live. This way, I can pay them back. I figure what I owe them should be paid off in around 5 years, but I’d honestly like to keep living like this past that if I could. What do you think, could it work?",29Jan2020,1

I don't want to hear even another second of this stupid shit that comes out of his mouth, but my god, it means rejecting a man who has been a true friend to me at a time in life when there are just less people around to call ""friend.""

239,"Im 16 years old. I've always had a rocky relationship with my mom. It's just me and her since my dad died when I was 2. I miss him so much sometimes even though I have no memories of him to miss. Ever since he passed my mom has had drinking and smoking problems. I've been watching her slowly kill herself for 14 years.
 
 I've been to countless mental health professionals trying so hard to get better but she never has once tried to help herself. I've confronted her about this but she only makes me feel like the bad guy since I'm ""calling her/making her feel like a bad mom"".

  She screams at me over little things, so from a young age I've lied about stupid little stuff. Its like an instinct and I'm ashamed of it. I do it to try to protect myself. A lot is about food. I'm lectured if I say I don't like a food that I'm ungrateful, and if I don't eat it I'm wasting food. So I say I do just to try to avoid conflict. And if she catches me lying about it she screams that she can't trust anything I say. I know what I'm doing is wrong but I'm not doing it because I'm trying to be deceitful, I'm just trying to avoid getting hurt. 

  To clarify she's never hit me or hurt me physically. But she's restricted my contact with my friends, isolated me, belittled my accomplishments, called me a bitch, etc etc. Its all starting to add up. I never raise my voice back, I don't argue, I don't cry or get angry in front of her. I've just tried to accept that she can be irrational. But I can't take it anymore. When she talks to me its almost always in the car so I can't get away. She yells so loud in such a small space I just wanna open the car door and run. But I love her, and it sucks. I know if anything ever happened to me she wouldn't wanna live anymore. I'm the only reason she keeps going. 

 I don't want to talk about what she has done to me to a teacher or guidance counselor because they are required to report to CPS if I say anything. I don't wanna talk to my other family because they have always held it against her for moving across the country away from them after my father died and admitting that to them means they win. If I got myself emancipated I'd ruin any ounce of good relationship we have left. Plus she'd lose the only source of income she has (social security benefits) since I'd be a legal adult.

  My mom went through a period of not talking to her mom (my grandma) for multiple years. I'm scared I'll end up just like that. But what terrifies me even more is that cutting myself off from her doesn't sound so bad sometimes. Please help. I don't know what to do. I'm at my breaking point.

243,"A few weeks ago me (16F) and a boy (15M) I was dating (not in a relationship) got into an argument that spoiled our friendship/bond. The basic run down is that I took a chance on him when he confessed (friends for abt a year prior), and I was confused about my feelings towards him. Our relationship was progressing towards becoming serious and I was still not sure if I wanted to take things to the next level. A relationship in my culture and lifestyle is very important and significant to me and going serious when I couldn't even see them in my everyday life was discouraging. I decided it was best to confront and communicate so I reached out to him and we argued, but eventually decided to take a break to see where we stood.

After said break I came to the conclusion that I wasn't ready for a relationship yet (for several varying reasons) and he took it well at first... but then I told him I tried my best, which seemed to piss him off. I was aware he said things he didn't mean when he was angry so I took it, giving him the benefit of doubt until he accused me of never trying or caring. This stung, a lot. I told him this and he said it hurts because its probably true - he's kinda right. It's true I didn't give it my all, I started slipping away when I realized it wouldn't work out which was wrong of me... however I don't think that gives him the right to accuse me of *never* trying. He said I didn't try enough and I didn't *care* enough. He also told me he was disappointed in me for not trying hard enough which still pisses me off, but you know people say things when they're mad so w/e. Anyways he ended the conversation by telling me if I never make investments then to ""Have fun wishing what could have been"" which honestly, is a shitty thing to say, but obviously he was right if I'm here wishing all the things about our friendship he said were genuine.

So, what do I want? Well our friendship was very precious to me, regardless of everything that happened between us. I want to re-connect and try to leave things on a better note (don't even have to be friends again, just leave on a better, non-hostile note) ... but at the same time I don't know if it's the right thing to do. He unfriended me and we don't share classes so there's a clear boundary I would have to break to reach out to him. Should I just leave things as is, wait a while or just do it? His last words to me (I  was the one who stopped responding) were bitter and passive aggressive so it makes me wonder if I should be doing anything at all. My friends told me to stand my ground, that even if he *was* right he shouldn't have been accusing and attacking me, which I agree to an extent but I don't know.

I think I've already forgiven him and if he wanted to become friends again I would be there for him in an heartbeat, but I guess *the real issue is I don't want to overstep*. On top of that I'm still a bit bitter about what he has said (obviously) and I'm still sad about how easy it was for him to leave it. He was the one who always said he thought our bond was unbreakable, and I believed and trusted him enough to be honest with him and he threw it all away. I wasn't expecting things to go dandy or be the same afterwards, but I didn't think he would abandon me either.

**TL;DR:** Argument with guy about our relationship and it ended on a pretty nasty note. Want to re-connect to end things better but don't want to over-step, don't know where he stands. Still feeling a bit bitter however I want things to be right.",29Jan2020,1

245,"I (21M) have crazy low self esteem and confidence, I have depression and anxiety and I have a generally dismal outlook on life. 

Now, while this may not be starting off very good, all of that changes when I'm in a relationship. When I have someone to care for and to love, I am a completely different person, in general. I have only been in one serious relationship, which lasted for about two years before we broke up because I thought it was what was best for us, because the newly found physical distance between us was giving her crazy amounts of anxiety. All my other relationships have lasted less than two months at most, and none were fulfilling in any way. 

I abhor being alone, because I genuinely hate myself and I don't enjoy being stuck with me. However, any time I try and talk to someone new, someone I might like to be in a relationship with, I get shut down, and I can't help but to blame it on myself. Did I not pass one of your tests, did I say something wrong, etc etc. One of the most recent ones was with my sister's best friend, and she seemed genuinely interested in me for two months of us talking. Now that I'm visiting home (I'm in the army and stationed 10 hours away, so I can only visit home every 6 months or so), she told me that she isn't interested in a relationship yet, that she needs to work on herself.

252," 

In NH.

Background: I have PTSD and high general anxiety issues due to a bad ex, problem started 2001. I have ADD and have also been recently diagnosed with Asperger's (known about the possibility for \~5 years but only lately went in for testing and got results). I've also been receiving SSI disability for a little over a year now (it took ages to go through), had child support prior to that which expired when my son graduated last summer (2019). I haven't been able to work since I was fired from my last job 10 years ago so things have been tight and state aid is in effect. Basically, this set of ills boils down to 1) depression; 2) panic attacks; 3) I have to have a safe, reliable, stable environment. If I can't keep things on an even keel I go into shut-down mode, so #3 is **especially** important for me.

I've been in my current apartment for 7+ years now. It's an old building that pretty much has 'slumlord' written all over it but it's roomy and I could have my pets. All the systems are badly outdated, plaster crumbling here and there, and the floors haven't been attended to for decades (standard policy with hardwood floors is to re-do them at least every 20 years so they last). What maintenance that \*has been done is always with the cheapest possible materials and half-baked ""handy men"" instead of actual professionals. Oh yes, and this building has had bug issues since before I got here. Roaches at first, and as soon as they were dealt with the bedbugs came in (2017). I'd never seen either of those monsters 'til I moved here. The building was sold 2016 and I of course ***informed the new owner of my issues***. I also gave my unvarnished opinion that the best thing that could happen to the building was for it to be gutted back to the studs and rebuilt to last the next 100 years. Starting Fall 2018 the new landlord started yelling at me and saying my pets were causing damage when for the most part the badly maintained building was just doing its thing and falling apart. I mean, while I've never been the world's best housekeeper, I always like to keep place decent enough so I can get everything straightened up in an hour or three if I hear company's coming. I like to decorate a bit and give a nice, homey impression. I'm also active on FB and Instagram and have had the habit over the years of taking nice pics of my place several times a year to share. I've been scrupulous with cleaning up any pet accidents (dogs are small and have puppy pads) because I never want to be ""that tenant"" who doesn't take care of things or give a bad impression, and the cats always hit their boxes.

Well, once he (LL) started yelling at me I of course start in with panic attacks. Angry male yelling, threatening, etc. The very reason I have PTSD and high anxiety in the first place. I'd pretty much given up on him doing anything nice for the units by this time so had started doing some small repairs and upgrades on my already thin dime - like, I bought real G-danged ceramic tile and had the kitchen floor redone because the cheap-o asbestos tile (or whatever it was) kept crumbling to the point where the underlayment was going bad. I've also had plans to re-do the wood floors one at a time because hey, a Home Depot sander rental is only $44 for a half-day - everything else is just my own time, right? It doesn't take much to stain or poly, just keep things clean while in process and the pets in another room. You can do a room a month that way. Well, this guy is waffling. He swings back and forth between acceptance and yelling at me for stuff that can't be helped. I, of course, not feeling safe go into shut down mode. Interestingly enough, he holds back on calling/emailing me for a while after late January. I begin to recover and re-start my projects. Then comes July and the threats come back. See, when he gets in the bug company, he only does half the job. If any reasonable person says 'do treatments for 6-12 months to be sure they're gone' he does only 3-4 treatments, just enough for no one to see them for a few weeks until the next generation is grown enough to be wandering around and breeding again. Then he blames YOU for it. So starting back in July and more threats, it's basically ""put everything in the middle of the room so the guys can get around for the treatments"". He gives barely THREE days to have it done and threatens me with eviction if I ""don't comply"". Note: both the other units in the building have at least 5-6 adults and near-adults in them so they have plenty of man-power. With us, it's just me and my son, and I'd just dropped him off at the train station for a 5 week summer program out of state. Plus he was going off to college in August. Now, I may be under 50 but I'm definitely creaky. Back back, bad knees, no physical stamina, etc. My best possible speed can best be described as 'pottering'. Plus an entire household's laundry to do including everything that's usually packed away. New washer, but older dryer so maybe 6 loads a day max? It ends up being 40+ loads, not counting re-dries. I ask for a week to do the job right per written directions. ""NO!"" More yelling, threats, etc. 1st treatment not done because apparently no one passed the pre-treatment inspection. Interestingly, I was later told that my place had come closest to passing. Anyway, we all passed the following week and the first treatment was done, pretty much when I'd first told him I could be done by. Now, I actually had to keep everything where it was in the meantime because I simply **can't** do work equivalent to a move-in/move-out that often (every 2-4 weeks). And we had a litter of puppies in addition to everything else. Well, having your entire home ripped up and not really being able to use it takes away from ""stable and reliable"". It also means I couldn't move around to get any of my regular stuff done because of tight corners, small walk areas, etc. Not very habitable, couldn't do any of my normal activities in the house re: living room (can't even sit on the couch or watch TV), pretty much no access to our front room (normally a library/music room) because of all the extra stuff jammed in there, my own room isn't very livable either. Predictable result: I decompensated. So he comes in over the next few months while I can't do anything, takes photos, and refuses to renew my lease, even threatening eviction on top of that because of ""the poor condition and messes"".

My question is, is deliberately going through and triggering someone's disabilities to force them out actionable? If you know (because you've been told) that someone has anxiety, depression and possibly Asperger's and you go out there to make things even worse, either because you don't want to deal with them or you just don't care, isn't that some kind of assault or discrimination? I don't believe I want to stay here so this \*isn't about ""how do I get to stay"" but I do want justice, if such a thing is possible. I don't even know the right type of lawyer to talk to about this.",29Jan2020,1

I tried doing one of their action bit by bit, and it didn't turn out so good.

He literally did it because that was a routinly customer that gave him a hard time. I wan't aware and give all the residents a hard time because I was following this specific rule persay.

Later the customer start mockingly making fun of me of how strict I was and my coworker joined him. My coworker joined her.

I am 26 year old male recent college graduate from New York City who still lives with his Parents. I am only one in the house with a bachelor degree. I am a personal trainer for New York Sports Club. It has been difficult while working or q getting a good night sleep since my room is between my brother and sister room who also still live with my parents. They stay up very late with the tv up very loud, speaking loud to their partner, or at times having loud sex. They don’t care that I have to work very early the next morning.They also like blasting music from their loud speakers. Whenever I tell them especially my brother that if he could please lower down his tv or the music because I have to be up early he gets very frustrated and tells me that I don’t pay rent. In college I would put all my classes at night to get be well rested for class but in most jobs I can’t pick a certain schedule. Yesterday I wish I would of recorded my brother last night who came home drunk arguing loud with his girlfriend and punching walls at 4 am in morning to show you guys proof of what I deal with in the daily basis. Last summer, I had a job where I had to be up at 6am. At the time my brother would be smoking a lot of weed in his apartment especially when I was asleep and the smel of weed would travel to my to my room and it would have be up all night.

Hello Everyone,

I’m at the point this year with a parent where the situation has turned from comical to annoying to now infuriating. I think I am going to call this parent in to a PTC with all the other child’s teachers and an admin (I teach middle school).

This child lies about completing their homework and assignments and blames it on me. This is a common occurrence in teaching when a child doesn’t want to get in trouble with their parents. The thing is that it doesn’t stop there with this parent.

I have students fill out an “I did not do my homework” form when they don’t turn in assignments. THIS parent says that all the ones I have for their child were not written by them. 

They say that the online programs we use magically change assignment completion dates. So, of course their child turned in the assignment on the 10th NOT the 31st (two weeks after the quarter ended) like the program says. 

That I lose their child’s work. Though the child TOLD ME TO MY FACE THAT THEY LOST BEFORE EVEN ARRIVING TO MY CLASS!

That I give the child zeros for work they completed. When the child has turned in a blank page to me with just their name written on it.

This parent has told me that I am singlehandedly making it my mission to fail this child. WHEN THEY ARE FAILING ALL THEIR CLASSES.

The cherry on top is that the parent then asks if these assignments can be turned in late! HOW CAN YOU TURN IN AN ASSIGNMENT LATE THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY DONE ALREADY?!

I need advice. I’ve tried being the bigger person and working with them and their child. At this point, it is too much and I am battling the urge to tell the parent to go take a long walk off a short pier.

If you made it this far, thanks for listening at least.",29Jan2020,1
269,"My friend (Let’s call her H) has been acting weird lately, and I feel uncomfortable around her now?

I don’t really have anyone else but her, she is my only friend. And I know we are growing up but lately I just haven’t seen her as someone as my friend. It’s seriously sucks cause I don’t have any other friends. I’m not in school either so it’s hard for me to meet new people at my age without going to bars or drinking (which I don’t like). We were always different, like in fashion styles, music taste, ect. But now I feel upset because I have a connection anymore. 

She made new friends at the beginning of fall and ever since she has been hanging out with them lot more than me. Totally okay, it’s her friends. But I think her attitude has changed ever since she has met them. She keeps telling me she can’t wait to move out, and get her own place and constantly talks about wanting to live with her friends. She talks almost preppy (not the tone of voice but the way she uses certain words). Example, a girl we used to be friend with who we had a huge fall out with had got a haircut. H laughed and said “yikes that’s bad” at the ex-friends picture on Instagram. I felt bad, even though I don’t like my ex-friend, seeing my friend put someone down like that isn’t right. Especially when H posts quotes her Instagram stories like “girls supporting girls” 

There’s many other things that just get to me. In summer she asked why I was visible on her snap maps and I said cause I hardly use Snapchat plus it’s pointless, but I added her for her to see. Then recently she added me off her snaps. I know it’s not a big deal but it just makes me wonder why. Another thing is that she talks about her anxiety meds a bit too much, and almost glamorizes it. 

Like I said, little things are starting to annoy me and hanging out with her isn’t enjoyable. It’s all about her or her friends and it never feels genuine.",29Jan2020,1
270,"So pretty much, for a while I have wanted to go completely platinum, however the furthest I went when it came to dying my hair was a balayage, leaving my roots to my regular brown color and the rest blonde. 

I went to a new stylist today because my other stylist began to charge too much.

She ended up bleaching my roots which was supposed to match the rest of my hair.

Obviously this did not work out. My roots are a yellowish blonde and the rest of my hair is lighter. 

It is very obvious in most lighting fixtures and now I won't leave my room without a beanie on.

Thinking about it now, I don't remember the last time the words ""I love you"" were said to anyone in my family. My sisters moved out the second they could and they started their own lives. However, I don't want to lose whatever resemblance of a family I have, so I stay at my mother's house on breaks. I think dealing with my crazy mom and saving money is better for me. Because of this, my sisters have cut contact with me. They don't see how I can even consider living with my mom because of the stuff we've been through and me trying to explain how I see my situation  makes them angry.

My friend (F) let's call her A, was touched inappropriately by a board member's son. She went to the PE coach about it, coach said that she would tell principal, nothing happened for a bit. A made a tiktok explaing what happened to her, and it got some clout, people were saying that they were going to do a walkout in protest. A told another friend (M) let's call him S. S told the math teacher in order to gain some teacher support. The math teacher agreed that this was terrible. She told the guidance counselor, the guidance counselor told the principal.
     The principal COMES STORMING IN, sits A down and tells her how she better delete the tiktok immediately. He proceeds to scream at her about how the school's reputation will be tarinished, the kid who assaulted her's reputation will be tarinished, her reputation will be tarinished, and it's all her fault. 
     After school, she tells us about what he said, and how she feels so bad. We assure her that she did nothing wrong and that the principal is an ass. (He has proven this on many occasions).

However, we began to spend less and less time together due to her her extremely busy schedule and as a result I became really close with a mutual friend of ours (let’s call her Pam).

She’d always “jokingly” make me feel guilty for hanging out with Pam, but how is it my fault when she’s the one with a job, extracurriculars, and boyfriend so she never has the time to hang out with me but then she gets annoyed when I hang out with Pam instead like I’m suppose to wait weeks for her to be free to go to places. 

As I’ve spent less time with her, I’ve started to realize parts of her personality (condescending tone of voice, constantly and adamantly butting into conversations that don’t concern her, humiliating me and passing it as a joke) that I absolutely cannot stand that I used to ignore or just brush off because she was my best friend.

293,"I am currently a senior in college , that is soon a bout to graduate to go into dental school , so grades mean a lot to me, especially since dental school is so competitive. To begin this story I went to a two year college first, then transferred into a bigger university, which I was declared a sophomore then. Before I transferred schools he last classes I took I took were a physics lecture with a lab. I received an A in both and was able to complete my 2 year degree to get into the big university. For the university the transfer process is to seek an advisor before being able to add classes , so that’s exactly what I did. I met with an advisor who I thought was very knowledgeable... helped me construct a road map for each semester that way I can graduate in time. What was odd to me at first is that she mentioned everything for the most part would transfer though except the physics classes that I previously taken. When I asked her why I needed to retake a class that I had an A in she proceeded to tell me that I the class didn’t meet university standards and that I needed to take it at a university level..... though I was very unsure about the situation I agreed and added the class, but instead of taking multiple I just decided to take the lecture for my first semester to get a feel of the college. The advisor wrote everything for me and stapled her card with her name on it and I went home to add my one class for the semester year..... now let’s fast forward to 2.5 month into the semester, the time where you need to meet up with an advisor to discuss your following semester. This time around i spoke with a new person, she was extremely knowledgeable and I felt like she was truly wanting to help me succeed. When she asked me what my planes were for the following semester I told her I wanted to to take 5 classes with the physics lab being apart of that list. She then gave me a strange looks and said ,”why would you take a lab when you’ve already received credit for it on your transcript?” I then told her exactly what the first advisor told me with the class not being university level. She said that , that didn’t make any sense and that I was currently taking a class that I’ve already had an A in and almost did the same thing the following semester. She said that stuff like this happens all the time and I just have to get in contact with the head advising staff so they can issue me a full refund for the class due to false advising. So that’s exactly what I did.... I reached out to someone and they told me to submit my proof that I was told false j formation.... the only problem is that I could t find the paper just had the time the appointment was made. After back and forth if he said she said my case was dropped and was unable to even contribute the refund process ... NOW let’s fast forward to me being a junior almost senior ... I was moving out of the apartment I was staying in and after packing things and moving furniture around , the paper with the advisors name , the classes she told me  and even the date I was in her office, I found it !!! I quickly took several pictures and tried to submit the refund process again, this time around the head of the advising said she will sum it this to the Board of directors and see what they can do, I’m currently a senior now and have going back and forth with emails every few weeks saying the paperwork is still processing, I’m graduating soon and I have no idea what I should do anymore .... this whole situation since I found the evidence has been 5 months with no answers .... should I just continue to wait for this refund or do I need to sue the school for making this process take way longer than it should be?",29Jan2020,1
294,"I’ll be straight up I’m 16 and I smoke weed but I do it semi responsibly I guess? 

I want to tell my mom because I want to be open with her but I don’t know how without her getting mad 

To start off no I don’t just smoke to get high, all my life I’ve had fragile joints and now that I have a job that requires me to be on my feet moving around 4-8 hours 25 hours a week it’s gotten worse. Also I’m terrible at sleeping. So I smoke to ease it up but I won’t lie, yes I do enjoy getting high. But I don’t let it get in the way of my responsibilities. I keep decent grades at school and never go high, have a good reputation at work and never go high. I do my best to keep my priorities straight. 

The problem: 

When I was 14 I was a heavy weed user (nearly every day) and was into pills and other stuff. Was way too young for it and I let drugs get in the way of my life and I was just doing it for the hell of it. I nearly failed my grade and was pretty much a bum stealing and everything like that to get money. 

Then I quit for about 2 years until a couple months ago 

I just want to be able to tell her and have her know that it’s not like how it was before and that I can smoke without it getting in the way of my life. I just don’t think the conversation will go over well. 

Any advice? Please anything I’m desperate",29Jan2020,1
295,"I’m a junior in high school, and I signed up to volunteer for a YMCA science camp near me. The problem is, the only week that was available was during a week where I’ll miss an entire week of school. I have all A’s and one C in my math class. In math, I struggle on tests and quizzes. However, since I signed up with my friends to volunteer through our school counselor, we have to sign a form that releases us from school for a week. I assume this will excuse any work I get that week, but my math teacher moves extremely quickly and doesn’t slow down his lessons for any one.

297,"Hello, I am a 19 year old mexican guy living in San Jose CA in the Silicon Valley. I am currently enrolled in my second year at SJSU pursuing an Electrical Engineering Bachelor. To keep it brief, I never really had a passion but I was always good at getting good grades especially at Math in highschool. So I picked Electrical Engineering bc of the typical high salary and bc I guess I am a smart kid lol. But as many other Mexican fathers, my dad has had his own Concrete Construction masonry business for like 20 years now. And he has recently been telling me that it would be a good idea that I take over the business and expand it with the help of a college degree. However, I am not sure what other engineering degree or non engineering degree is best to apply to the business. I am kind of interested in doing this bc I have worked with him weekends and summer and enjoy the environment. Also, I have had many second thoughts about Electrical Engineering but have never done anything which lowkey has depressed me in the past year or two. I need advice. Should I take over the concrete business? What major(s) do u think is best to switch in? Stay in Electrical Eng? thanks",29Jan2020,1

My whole family was devastated, especially my cousin. My uncle (my cousin’s dad) passed away 13 months before the boy did. It was a pretty difficult time for most of us grieving, and we struggled to talk about him without getting upset. I used to play with the boy often, and took a few videos of him playing and laughing.

It’s been 2 years, and now with the wuhan virus, all family events and gatherings are suspended until it blows over (we live in asia). My cousin’s youngest son just turned 4 and we are afraid of a similar incident happening again. He’s still very young and small, so his immune system may not be as developed. 

I realised i never found the “right time” to send her the videos. I don’t know when it is appropriate either. I’ve kept copies of the videos on snapchat, instagram, and on my hard drive too. My cousin doesn’t use social media so she isnt able to see them.

303,"I went in (hoping) for my first personal counseling session today, here in Illinois. It's offered through the clinic I go to and it's totally covered by my medicaid insurance. When I walked in, they handed me a big thick packet to fill out. On top were contracts. The first page of the first contract was basically legaleze saying they could give all my personal information to my doctor, my insurance, the state, whoever/whatever/etc. I'm not talking about ""if you intend on harming yourself or others"" kind of information. It basically said they would be free to give all of my personal mental health related information to anyone within the medical and insurance groups. The contract specifically said that included information that would otherwise be protected by law.

I wanted to walk out. However, I did go in and tell the counselor that I was not OK with the contract, but that I would sleep on it so as to not make a rash decision.

My experience with personal and family counseling in the past has always been pay-for-play. Therefore, there's never been an issue about someone sharing my deeply personal information with other people, because hey, private counseling in someone's private office with a ""we don't tell unless required by law"" policy. Now that counseling is being paid for by insurance, it seems I have to give up my soul to get it.

Just give us a head count for cake.” Well, my mind got to rolling as it does when I’m trying to sleep and I remembered that my nephew has significant milk and tree nut allergies and my sister in law has celiacs. The place we were wanting to go to has zero options for either of them. There is another place that does have gluten-free things but I think my nephew will still be up a creek with his milk allergy.

315,"*note:i haven’t been diagnosed for any mental illnesses because i do not have the resources and the closest thing i got to a diagnosis was my guidance counselor last year talking to my parents about my suicidal thoughts and how she thought i was depressed. so if i mention any mental illnesses please understand i’ve been researching all these topics for the past few years out of desperation and i’m sorry if i’m misdiagnosing myself. 

i just need advice on how to keep on having hope for myself. i am 14(female) and things have just been so tough. here’s a list so it’s more “organized”

i feel extremely hideous. i absolutely fucking hate myself. there is not one thing i like about myself physically. i have a lot and i mean A LOT of acne scars that causes hyperpigmentation on my face and it is pretty severe on my cheeks. i have braces but i am missing my lateral incisors which means i am walking around talking with two huge gaps in my teeth right next to my front two teeth which makes me look extremely weird. not to mention, the tooth on the bottom of the left lateral incisor fell off which is another gap in my teeth meaning there’s one part of my teeth that is just “empty.” my face is severely fucked. my facial symmetry is bob existence. one side of my face is much more square and wider while the other side is narrower is more inclining if that even makes sense. i fucking hate it. 

i cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to break down and cry. i’ve worn glasses since 5th grade but always wanted contacts because i hated the way my glasses looked on me. well before i got the contacts i just started not wearing my glasses and only wearing them during class. i started wearing my contacts in october but i had to stop wearing them because although it seems stupid, i couldn’t handle looking at myself in “perfect” vision and seeing all the ugly acne and how fucking demented my face looks. 

whenever someone tries to take a video or photo of me i literally JUMP and hide and run away because i’m so deathly afraid of them posting it on snapchat or something like that. this is because i’m scared of looking at myself and seeing how i look to others and i just how i look and it sucks. it hurts me inside. i genuinely feel a sharp pain to my chest whenever i see myself because i don’t ever expect how hideously surprising my face is.

i am at a point where i stop talking mid sentence because i realize i have missing teeth and am ashamed. i no longer maintain eye contact with people when i talk to them and i just do the stupid qUiRky thing where people hold up their hands to their face and go like this 🤭 but over their whole face just because i’m so scared of people looking at how disgusting i look.

however i feel like i may have body dysmorphia because many people tell me i’m pretty(not bragging because if anything it makes me feel like more shirt because they’re probably just tired of my self deprecating attitude). it’s not only my face that i dislike but my body is too much to get into so i just won’t talk about it.

325,"I know I should just go back to therapy again, but I wanted to see if it would be a waste of time.

Lately, I have been feeling depressed and really anxious along with some mini panic attacks. I usually get some panic attack's when I'm driving since I suck at it.

Problem 1: I'm getting that depression and anxiety from my sugar daddy that I meet early this month on grinder. He's a really good looking and buff 39 yr old man. A 21 year age gap that I don't mind. I'm in it for the sex and money, but he's been asking me for so much money that I feel like I'm the sugar daddy since I gotten him over 500 dollars worth of gift cards. He said he's doing it so he can trust me. I've been believing him since he's an army guy, but It's made me broke and my parents want me to buy a 1999 Toyota Corolla next week with my fafsa money which I have been using to pay for my sugar daddy's cards. But that money is long gone and he want's me to buy a 300 dollar visa vanilla gift card and send it to him before he gives me my first allowance. When I first bought him a 50 dollar gift card I was like here give me my allowance, But he started asking for more I felt like he was taking advantage of me, but he said the 300 dollar visa gist card would be my last test or something. I just feel like a complete dumb-ass.

Problem 2: I'm still a virgin and the only sexual contact i have is with my right dominate hand. I usually masturbate like 2-3 times a week since i was like 13, and have tried to stop but never can. Other than my sugar daddy, I've talked to other guy's on grinder as I send them nudes and they send me some back. But lately I've been going around asking some if they would like to masturbate with me on cam. I asked this guy who I hadn't talked to in 6 months if he wanted to do that, but instead he got mad at me and said that all I want is sex sex sex and that he always wanted more than just sex but I just want him for sex . It made me feel like a whore then but now I know what I wanted from him all along.",29Jan2020,1
326,"Not sure where to put this, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. This isn’t really a major life threatening problem or anything, just looking for some help. Oh boy, where to begin?

Well first, I’m a 15 year old guy currently in HS. If there’s one thing I noticed at my school, it’s that everyone is really special or unique. Myself? I’m not so sure. Everyone always has something going for them, but not me. I’d like to change that. 

See the thing is that I get decent grades, but in my family, I can never live up to my parents expectations. I’ve had my parents say that they’re disappointed in me and other things, even though I get B’s and mostly A’s. It makes me feel like I’m not good enough. Constantly, I’m always stressing if I should work harder or not, and it’s really starting to take its toll. I mean, I’m even starting to grow white hairs. 

Another thing is that I think I’m physically unfit... or “fat” to a degree. Basically I’m not content with how I look. Now, one may say “looks don’t matter at all” or whatever, but it’s really diminishing when everyone at school (including friends) all start joking about how “fat” you are constantly. Am I even fat? I’m 130 lbs but I’m at 5’11... I don’t even know anymore. I just don’t feel happy with myself.

Adding on this, because of how I think of myself, my posture has gotten really bad. I’ve been diagnosed with pectus excavatum, which in my case, isn’t too severe but it makes me feel self conscious. Because of these things, I find it hard to find new friends. I would consider myself an extrovert, but they just never want to talk to me or something like that. Or it ends up into them just insulting me over and over again like some kind of sick “joke”. Is it because I’m “ugly” or whatever?? I don’t even know....

As for my social life, I don’t play any sports because I’m not good at any. I would really love to start playing SOMETHING but my parents can’t give me a ride or anything to actual centers to play. What can I do? And as far as friends go, I think I’ve already established why I feel uncomfortable with them.  Because of this, I rarely ever head out and don’t have a social life. I basically spend all my days in my own home doing nothing. I really want to, but I don’t know where to start....it’s just all so confusing for me. 

As for hobbies, I’m just a guy who sits on his computer and plays games. That’s it. There’s nothing more to it, and I would really like to start doing something. Fortunately for me, I’ve started practicing drawing, but I don’t feel like that’s enough. I want to be more special, and not just some dead beat person. I want to prove all those people who called me “loser” at high school wrong. 

The question is, where should I begin on all of this? What should I change about myself first? How should I do it? Should I even do it? So many questions....

Thank you for reading all the way to the end. Bless your soul.",29Jan2020,1

I know that kind of experience might be rare or different for everyone, but I'm really interested in just doing something different with my life.

My biggest problem and the one thing holding me back though is that I'm scared. I'm extremely shy. I know I can work hard doing whatever job is given to me, but if it involves a lot of social interaction then I'm not sure how far I can push myself out of my comfort zone.

Anyways, any ideas what I should do/not do? Is this a dumb idea lol. Are there tips for if I do go through with it? And are there things I should be aware of about the career?",29Jan2020,1

I am a Co-President of my schools Gender and Sexuality Alliance. We try to promote inclusivity throughout our school, and see what we can do to make our community a more safe environment for everybody. 

We tend to do many field trips, while most of them are meetings among schools in our county, we attend many. One of our big field trips is the True Colors conference in March (OurTrueColors.Org). It’s pretty pricey. (I did the calculations, about 1,200$ for 10 Students, not including chaperones) 

Our school also has a new policy which limits the selling of Baked Goods inside school, which was our clubs most efficient way of making money. 

Now we are left off in a pickle. It’s hard for us to achieve money, so I am trying to find many ways for us to fundraise. We did Singing Telegrams for Christmas, and Dress-Down days for staff. 

Recently, among the officers in our club, we’ve decided that we are writing to many businesses in our community to see if they would like to donate to us. 

I talked to my close knit council. This includes my s/o which is the other President, and the two Vice Presidents. I gave them a due-date, and expected them to write a mock-up letter to these businesses. I would edit them, and send them out. However, just today, I told them they were due Thursday, and my other president, and one of the Vice’s told me they weren’t having it due for Thursday. They weren’t aware of the due date, and they had no possible time. 

I understand that not having time, but I assured them that I did indeed tell them the due date. I showed them the evidence and they said, “Oh I didn’t look at it then.” 

Now this is when it made me upset. I put my heart and soul into staying after for my club, trying my best to help fundraise (Our Treasurer recently resigned so I  am currently the Co-President and the Treasurer), busting my butt to do this. And now they aren’t even looking at my important comments? Do they have any idea how much that hurt me? 

I just brushed it off, and told them it was alright, but it got to me, and it is getting to me. What is the point of even trying to put any work into the club if it is just being ignored by my close friends? I don’t even want to be a part of it anymore. I shouldn’t be. I can barely even get my small group to do something simple, with 2 weeks of a notice. 

Am I even important to them? They know that I am passionate about this. Should my passions just be ignored? Am I the one overreacting? I just want to resign, and not bother with this club anymore.

I’m not only upset about that. Only about 9 people show up to the club consistently. Yet, my advisor wants to bring 3 extra people who haven’t done anything for the club along to True Colors, which I think is unfair. These other members shouldn’t be able to reap the benefits that we’ve worked hard for. We managed to come to a stale-mate and have 11 people come, not including one person who never done anything. I just recently found out she changed the count and added the one who never worked with us. 

I’m hurt, I’m mad, I’m angry, I’m upset, I’m confused. I just want to end it all. I put so much time and effort into this club for nothing. 

What do I do? Please help.",29Jan2020,1
333,"my ex bf of 4 yrs had been separated for several months.  our last break up ended pretty bad due to my bipolar disorder.  

long story short, i hardly see or talk to him anymore and he seems to be doing ok without me.  

ive moved out of state and came back to visit.  my best friend texted him a photo of us girls and told him i was in town. 

he called me and i suggested we get together.  when we got together, we gave each other a long hug and kiss on the cheek.  our meeting went great and all my feelings came back.   he had plans afterward with his friends, though.. so we only hung out for about 2 hrs.  he dropped me off at my friend's house and came back later to hang out with us.   he said he had a great time.  

it was chinese new yr's so he unexpectedly gifted me $$$$... more than i ever expected!   that made me feel so special and reminded me of how much i loved him because of who he is and his generosity.  we ended up hanging out and hooking up the next day and everything felt like the good ol times in the past. 

im confused cause i feel sure he wouldnt want to get back into the toxic relationship we had.   he seems to be content with his life right now.   i realized our break up was because i wasnt ready for a serious committed relationship at the time. 

as soon as i flew back to my state i cried and felt like im at a huge loss.  ive fallin in love with him again but afraid of being rejected. 

valentine's day is coming up and i wanted to send him a thoughtful gift... but i dont want to overwhelm him with my loving emotions. 

i know he loves and care for me still but probably wont give me another chance /:  i dont want to bring up the past or talk it out with him unless he shows more signs of wanting to be with me.

338,"Hi, this is a bit darker than the other posts. I'm going to jump right in.

I am living with my parents after recently graduating college and landing a yearlong position very nearby. I moved in at the end of last summer and plan to move on next summer. My brother (27) and his newish wife have been planning to travel together for a year starting this March but found out that if they wait until June to leave, they will get better benefits from their jobs, so they are delaying their trip.

My brother and I have a complicated relationship. I admired him in that younger sibling way for a lot of my life but he can be really inconsiderate at times. Also, 3 years ago I remembered memories that I had repressed since I was very young of him molesting me and stuff. I went to counseling at my university for a spell, got up the nerve to confront him and discovered that he had repressed the memories too but remembered them when he was in college. I told my family (mom, dad, sister) and ever since it's been a journey of a lot of things but for the past year, I've been leaning more towards the thinking of, what's done is done, it's not happening anymore, and he can't change the past. I'm not entirely sure I want him in my life, but i don't think I am ready to cut him out completely....also because I am afraid it would just wreck my family.

OKAY now the problem is, at the beginning of fall my mom mentioned to me that they were pushing their plans forward but were in a slight pickle because their lease ends in March, leaving them 3 months without a place to stay. A few options were listed, them staying at my mom and dad's house was mentioned, I didn't really think much of it. On Thanksgiving, I was tidying up and then my brother, sisterinlaw, and my mom were talking about where they could rearrange furniture in the basement for when they move in in March.

I know that I am upset, I am not really sure what I would have wanted from them. Our family hasn't spoken together about what happened when we were young since the day I told them about it (although my sister talks to me and is perfect in every way) and while I don't want them to treat me all different, I feel like this is a rare and specific situation where I would have liked to be thought of.

It is my parents house and I am staying here for free so I don't want to be a brat and ask for a say in who they let live here. I could move out, but I was planning on using this year to save as much of my paychecks as possible, and they get paid a lot more than me. But they are about to be traveling for a year.

I'm upset that no one talked to me, I guess, but is that fair? Is it worth talking to them? (parents and brother)

also FYI I really like his wife so that's nice.

343,"This is a long one.

So for years now (I am 20) I have been feeling unmotivated. What used to motivate me does not make the cut anymore. I am a little depressive but thats not all, I just cant find anything that I like. Not people, not hobbies, no nothing. I have tried to pick the piano, play games, make games, talk to people. Every day life seems more gray, but I am so careless that I dont mind, but people dont understand my lack of interest. I dont give a shit about anything, yeah I love my parents, my brothers and my friends but to be totally honest I dont give a shit about them. It is difficult to explain.

The only thing that kinda makes me feel passion is volleyball, but slowly I am loosing interest and I am worried since it was something I could enjoy. My hopes and dreams have been crushed and I am not really interested anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember long ago I was so emotional and passionate, and really I could see lifes flavor, it has dissapeared over time. I am always tring to have new experiences and try to feel something, but no... it is very sad, but I dont feel that sadness because I dont give a shit about anything. I used to like meeting new people it would always be exciting but thats gone as well. I have traveled, and didnt make it neither.

&amp;#x200B;

This will sound dark, even if I dont think it is... but I dont care about death or war or hunger, I am quite selfish in a way I just care about me, because caring for other people is boring and I used to care too much. I cared so much to a point it was unhealthy and I had to start thinking for myself... I might´ve gone too far. I dont think I can explain my feelings with words accurately, but I think its close enough.

I guess, I am asking have you ever felt this? How do I get motivation back? Should I start caring a bit more? How can I make life more interesting?",29Jan2020,1
344,"Hi Reddit,

A few months ago my top employee asked me if it was ok if her boyfriend could apply to work at my restaurant. At first I thought it would be ok, because she is very good at what she does and keeps me very informed about what goes on in the restaurant. After a day of thinking I told her that I wouldn’t hire significant others or siblings since there are more downsides than upsides.

So about a month ago she asks if I’m still hiring and that her friend would like to apply. I said sure, and the guy interviewed well and I hired him. It’s been a month and so far so good; he’s been a solid employee.

But today I just figured out that he’s her boyfriend. I feel disappointed and disrespected. I already told her it wasn’t a good idea and she went against my wishes hoping I wouldn’t find out.

So now I’m not sure what I should do:

1. Should I bring it up with her and remind her why I don’t want to hire significant others? I worry this might demoralize her.
2. Say nothing
3. Do something else?

His mum has always been brilliant to me, let me stay with her whenever I have needed and been like a second parent at times. She was the first person I told when I came out as gay and who was there when my parents both passed away. 

She recently met a new man, she described him as the perfect man; tall, rugged, well educated and has decent job. 

They had apparently met online and had been chatting for months. After a while she decided to introduce him to me and my mate. 

Upon meeting him, he was short, fat and a bit scruffy but I realised that I have met him before. He and I (and some of his mates) had some quite extreme sexual encounters, involving him being my bondage master and regularly hate fucking me amongst other things. I enjoyed our meetings but we ended up moving our own ways.

Fast forward 3 weeks after seeing him again, he sent me a message on Facebook asking to meet and re-kindle our encounters. This was a Friday night, I had a few beers and wasn't quite thinking straight, I agreed to meet him and took a cab to his and within 20 minutes he and 2 mates were penetrating me.

353,"So I noticed something over the past 6 months. I’ve never had any female friends that I can just text and make plans to hang out. Until the beginning of September 2019 where I texted a classmate from a few semesters ago and we decided to hang out. It was great having a female friend because the dynamic is different. You talk about different things and it’s nice to be away from your guy friends and the recycled conversations that come with it. Ultimately, our friendship turned into somewhat of a relationship that ended horribly and up until a week ago, showed no signs of revival until she said she would like to be friends again. I agreed to it but I honestly have no interest in hanging out with her but will do so just because I have some ulterior motives. 

However, the cause of this post is because my friends and I decided to go to a strip club Saturday night. When we go to a specific strip club, I always get dances from 1 girl and 1 girl only. The reason being is because she’s really awesome. Of course she’s sexy as hell and I would react in a millisecond if she wanted to hook up but other then that, I genuinely want her as a friend. I follow her on IG and pretty much know a lot about her. Every time I get a dance from her, our conversations are about our lives, education, hobbies, etc. I’ve always tried to be the non creep client and avoided those types of proposals because I know they hear it hundred times a week: I even got her number from one of the first times I got a dance from her and she’s opened up to me about a personal thing that happened to her when she didn’t need to. 

So I guess this is my question. Is it as simple as just asking her if she’d like to hang out some time as friends or is that just not believable from her position being that I met her at a strip club and she thinks I just wanna sleep with her and hanging out as friends has a hidden ulterior motive?",29Jan2020,1

Each individual player starts with 2 different airsoft weapons of their choice, with 5 ammo clips per each weapon.

Each team also must choose one vehicle (such as a golf cart, go kart, ATV, UTV, dirt bike, snow mobile, dune buggy, lawn mower, electric razor scooter, etc.) that will have 3 balloons of their team color tied to it like in Mario Kart Battle. Each team must have at least one player in their vehicle at all times.

If all 3 balloons on your team vehicle get popped, you must park the vehicle and drop any weapons and ammo wherever you are currently situated, and leave the battlefield.

No other weapons, ammo, or vehicles are located anywhere on the battlefield. However, you can claim abandoned ones from teams that have been eliminated.

Claiming abandoned vehicles is known as ""poaching"". You do not get extra balloons for your team if you poach a vehicle, and you are still required to have at least one team member in your OG team vehicle.

357,"hi, I’m 16 (f) and even though in my stages as a teen I’m supposed to be stereotyped as “parents don’t understand me” but I feel like my mom is on a different level. 

My relationship with my mom is always been good until last year. She was going through some stuff such as getting in a car wreck and her best guy friend at the time playing with her heart. Ya da ya da. I helped her a lot with things since the car accident happened and she is a single mother so I got a job to help her out. (I’m not great at story telling so I’m just jumping around sorry)

Problems really didn’t start to occur until around September because her guy friend had to stay with us for over two weeks because he didn’t want to deal with the negativity of his household (a whole fucking reality tv show mess tbh). So my mom let him stay on our couch in our somewhat tiny duplex. He never payed for anything, such as the meals we cooked (since we had to cook extra) or help us out with paying for his transportation. sure he did pay something but he acted like he could pay us much but he had just got a new job that payed him really well and his job covered for he house and everything. 

Anyways, back to my mom. During this whole to,e, when her guy friend wasn’t there. My mom casually talks to me like I’m an adult, Telling me what’s going in her guy friends life, how they went out drinking and what happened, or how her guy friend doesn’t love her back. Then same cycle over and over again. I’ve mention for her to get a counselor because I have one and it helps with my depression and anxiety. At first she said no but now she is on a wait list. 

She is so emotionally unstable too. She cries to me all the time or if I crack a joke, she’ll get so mad that she treats me like I’m so disgusting and she’ll make comments like “you’re so ungrateful” “I can take away your paycheck instantly” “you’re dirty” , stuff like that. It does bring me down but I try to stick up for myself or just let it go because she usually says I’m just a kid and I need to stay out of grown folk business. Which is understandable to some degree. 

I try to talk to her about what we need to fix on but she says it’s my fault and I should just listen. She always thinks she’s right and no one else is wrong. Now granted I’m not the perfect child but I still appreciate my mom for trying so hard to make my life okay so I can have clean clothes and food, etc. but I’m never happy when I’m at home anymore, I’m always walking on egg shells with her.

Also, she finally got a boyfriend after my dad and he is just and old ass man that I don’t care about so he really is kinda in the background but like he comes to my hose a lot to spend the night and I can hear them y’know🤢🤢🤮 and I don’t need to be yearning that, like he has his own apartment like🙄.

Anyways, today was one of the last straws I had with her because, she was talking about how she bought crab legs and food for a seafood boil. And I was joking with her that she probably gonna ruin it cuz she always putting too much seasoning in it. Just joking around with her. Then she just flipped from being cool and chill to just being rude and me and and says “well you don’t have to eat with us then and I’ll just take them back because you’re being ungrateful” and I can see where she thought I was being rude but I just stayed quiet. Then she said something else and I then was like “ okay, but you were using my money so…” because I pay her $300 a month for her to pay bills event though she doesn’t have most of her priorities straight but whatever. But I thought she already used it because I gave it to her before she went to the store. And then she got pissed. Says “I can take your money away” “you won’t have any money left”
“You think you are so great” “ungrateful” “ imagine if you were living with your father” all the threats . She was driving me to work with her boyfriends so I got my stuff ready, hopped out the car and didn’t even say bye . They just sped off.

The it’s almost time for clock off work and she asks if I have a ride home, I say why, then she says, “because you act so grown, I’m pretty sure you can find your own rides to places” I texted my friends because I didn’t know what to say, but she needed up picking me up anyways, like does she think that was funny because it wasn’t like that means I would have token a lyft or Uber (which I wouldn’t feel safe in) and ride home ?? My friends aren’t able to drive me because they have work and strict parents. Also I barely know anyone so Idk. 

I cried in the way home. I’m not really in a good place mentally but I trying to keep my head up. I haven’t spoken to my mom since I got in the car and I don’t have a car or my license yet because my mom “don’t think I was ready” so yeah. I just wanted to share my life rn.

I love my mom and it would hurt her so much if I tried to leave but she is o toxic sometimes.

359,"So Im 19 and I've been on and off on tinder for about 2 years. I recently matched with this guy and he's in the military and he kept bringing up marriage but I didn't take it serious until I told him I'm going to college and he said when we get married he can help me pay for school bc he is in the military and I was like well by the time we would get married I would probably be finished with school and he said no, he would marry me right now If I was interested. I was like haha okay still not super serious bc I've only been talking to him for a few days and never met in person and then he was like no, seriously,I deploy in Nov and I want to be married before I go,we can go look at rings this weekend. The first time I meet him he wants to look at engagement rings,it's ALMOST like married at first sight. He lives hrs away so it's also a bit of a distance to see him and he's very into getting married as soon as possible and I always wanted a family and to be married,it's like a dream for me,a 19 yr old,to find a guy near my age who is serious about a committed relationship and I would totally marry him after a few months. Am I crazy? Ofc I'll get to know him and stuff first. I talked to my mum about it for her opinion but she actually encouraged it she said hey,if u end up liking him,he's committed and you're a very committed person plus u can always get a divorce. I don't want a divorce,her and her husband were in a similar situation and they've been married 35 YEARS. I want that and it's not likely I'll get it but I'm so committed I'm just not sure why he wants to get married fast? It just makes me suspicious bc I'm use to guys begging for one night stands. And he doesn't know me from a hole in the wall rn and he's ready to make this commitment? We have never even met and he wants to ring shop ?

For some these grades are amazing but to me I feel as if I deserve 100%. Most of the times its a stupid mistake and the odd time its actually a question I deserve to get wrong. It is like asking what is 3^2 but I make the mistake and think 3*2 (just a basic example). How can I reduce these type of errors.

363,"I'm a 26M who was born into a dysfunctional family. My father is a hot-tempered husband who couldn't control his anger and usually verbally abused my mother. I saw her suffered a lot, which grew in me a strong dislike for my father, but I don't really hate him. I still love him and wish him the best, given that the older he gets, the calmer he becomes.

What drove me crazy is my elder sister. This bitch is the most selfish, shallow and disgusting person I've ever seen. I have been living with my family for about 24 years, and in all those years, I witnessed how much my mother suffered from this bitch. She loved parties and always put friends/ boyfriends above families, above her mother. This bitch never thought twice before shouting at my mother to win any argument with her. This bitch even swore to her very own mother, which is absolutely unacceptable for a child in our society (I'm a Vietnamese). After having kids, this bitch always made my mother take care of them so that she could have time for parties, for fucking. I witnessed countless times my mother desperately screamed into the phone late at night, begging her to come home to take care of her own kids so that my mother could take some sleep. This bitch had two kids, and technically their grandmother was their mother.

These experiences made me really hate her, and I become her very unpleasant younger brother. When I heard she did something bad to my mother, I shouted at her and even hit her a couple of times. She was very angry at me being misbehaved as a brother (but was totally ok being misbehaved as a daughter. What a double standard bitch!)

Our relationship had been extremely bad. Things went this way for years until I became more mature and, more importantly, darker. Two years ago, I initiated a fight with her out of my hatred on her, saying that I saw her as my child, rather than my sister. She got angry and insulted me back, to which I did nothing because we are surrounded by my father and brother. A few days later, she and her boyfriend said things that indirectly aim at me in the kitchen, which drove me extremely mad but again I did nothing. I started thinking about killing her, searching for some undetectable methods, but to no avail. I even went into her room, observed and took pictures in attempts to fake a fatal accident, but I can't think of a way that is undetectable. Also, I'm aware that if I had killed her, my parents would have been very sad, so I stepped back, and knowing that I couldn't stand living with this bitch anymore, I moved out.

I regretted that I did nothing when she threw insults at me and teased me with her boyfriend because this makes me want to seek revenge really badly. For the past two years, the thoughts of coming back home and killing her have consumed me. I always try to forget, knowing that doing so will destroy my life and make my parents lose their two kids, but I can't. Even if I can, the thoughts started to come back when I head homes for special occasions, like my cousins' birthday parties. So I decided to reduce exposure as much as I can, even to the point that I didn't come back home on Tet holidays, an occasion in which family members unite and celebrate the lunar new year together. I'm now living a lonely life, denying myself of my family to escape those thoughts. I can't stand seeing that bitch and breathing the same atmosphere as her, and I'm always afraid that a small conflict between me and her will result in murder.

Now I feel like a loser, and she's a winner. She has everything, and I lose everything, which makes me want to brutally kill her even more. How can I get rid of these thoughts? What can I do? Please help.",29Jan2020,1

366,"TW: depression, suicide, brief mention of selfharm

I’m most likely going to cross post this so later I’ll edit in at the very bottom where I’ve cross posted it. 

Cross posted to: r/internetparents , r/advice

Back story: When I was an adolescent I was seriously depressed.  In and out of hospitals, taking eight medications a day, self harming,  I had several serious suicide attempts along with some not so serious suicide attempts and so on. It took a huge toll on our parents and I think it’s part of the reason why their marriage is shit. During this part of my life I had basically no relationship with my mother because due to my depression she became absolutely crazy and impossible to interact with. I moved from Florida to Spain in the middle of April 2019 I have since then made a whole life here. Since then my life has significantly improved and I have a better relationship with my mother. I think it’s important to mention that I am overseas from where my family lives. 

In mid October 2019 my brother called me while I was at work hysterically crying saying that he’s super frustrated with school and our parents. He’s always had a history of disliking school, in fact when he was in the fifth grade he was diagnosed with ADHD but no longer takes Adderall nor any of the other medications because he doesn’t like the way it makes him feel. Anyway, when I spoke to him in October high felt that he was kind of depressed and I kind of saw myself in him when I was his age. Since moving I’ve been the referee between my brother and our parents, mostly my mother. Whenever my brother needs to communicate something important he will call me and I will relay the information to my parents. So on that occasion I called my parents and I had them know that Yayo (brother) was becoming increasingly stressed and depressed because of school and that he needed therapy. They proceeded to find him a therapist and he dropped out of regular high school to go to a special high school where he only goes a few hours a day and they give him the bare minimum to get his credits. 

Forward to yesterday, I wake up to find a message from our father. It was a message explaining that he had had a meeting at Yayo’s school He was explaining that he had had a meeting with the academic director Regarding how many credits my brother needs. At one point my brother is called into the office and they start telling him that he only has four credits left that it’s so easy that it’s just one little push and he can be over with it. Whenever I ask a question my brother would only respond with monosyllables he had put on my dad would call an ass face (cara de culo) like he didn’t want to be there and didn’t care what anyone had to say.  My mom and sends me a message telling me that my father had a meeting at school with the academic director and my brother and that I should speak to my brother and explain to him that he only has a little bit left to go because I’m the only one he listens to. 

Yayo then calls me I could tell by his voice (his faking a phone smile voice) that he wants okay. He started crying and venting telling me that he feels like mom and dad don’t understand him. He feels like he’s a fuck up I’m not mom always compares him to me because I was a fuck up but then I wasn’t. And he just feels like shit whenever She makes those comparisons. And then dad is always telling him that he only has a little bit left to go and that makes him feel like even more of a fuck up because getting those last four credits should be just so easy but for him it feels just as impossible as jumping across the Atlantic ocean. He’s telling me that he’s always bullshitting school and that he spends half the time asleep. That mom and dad think that it’s just because he’s lazy when in reality he’s completely capable of doing shit he doesn’t like like going to work, and then he says it’s just because school isn’t for him he feels like he isn’t capable of completing it.  I asked him what exactly does he want, and he says that he doesn’t know he quite frankly isn’t even thinking about his future. He stars saying that he wished that he could just stay in bed and never have to get up, that he just wants to quit life. He can’t imagine himself in the future. I asked him if he was having suicidal ideation and he said that he had thought of offing himself but not seriously enough to plan anything. I then asked him how long he had been having these thoughts. He said less than 3 months. I told him that I was not asking for his permission but that I didn’t want his consent to tell our parents. I gave him the example of if he told me that he had stage to lung cancer I would have to tell mom and dad it’s not something I can keep to myself same with suicidal ideation. And he told me that although he completely understands that it’s something that I have to tell them he wishes that I wouldn’t because that’s only going to make him look like a fuck up even more. He told me that it’s OK that he’s not going to lose trust in me and that he gets it. 

I then spoke with my parents and the conversation that I had with them made me feel very scared. The conversation I had with him made me feel very scared because the impression that I got from them was that of annoyance. That they don’t have time to deal with this shit. I know they love him but when I told my mother that he doesn’t like it when she compares him to me she just came up with excuses like “oh I’m not comparing him I’m just giving him good examples” I told her that’s besides the point whatever term she wants to use for what she does whether it be example or comparison that she should not use my name in conversations regarding his future if she knows that hurts him. Then my dad told me that he just feels irritated at the whole situation that he definitely needs a new therapist because this therapist isn’t working out. Our dad acted like it’s just another problem another excuse for him not to get his credits out. He said “Yayo is sick in the head”.  My mom said “I just don’t understand why he can’t tell us this shit why does he tell you and not us?!?”  I feel like the conversation that I had with them was absolutely fruitless and it was more of a burden than anything else. 

I thought my parents had learned from the situation that I was in and how it was the worst time if our lives when I was sick. I don’t want to lose my brother to suicide. Our birthdays are 3 years and 364 days apart (mine on the 20th and his on the 21st) we’ve always celebrated our birthdays together and I would hate to live in a world in which I can’t share my birthday with the person I love most in this world. He’s my best friend I love him I adore him he’s my baby brother and I don’t want this to get so bad that I lose him.  I don’t know what to do Im scared and I just want to help. 

TDLR: my brother is depressed just like I was when I was an  adolescent, my parents seem absolutely clueless as to how serious it is.

367,"English is not my mother tongue, so my expression may be grotesque. I posted this in another subreddit but didn't get answer :c
I am currently studying Latin and Classical Greek in Spain and hopefully my next year will be the last. I find it interesting, but I ended up kind of hating it because I know translation is not my thing and that is almost 80% of the degree content. Despite that, I like languages, and after I finish with this I have been considering doing a master in Salamanca about teaching Spanish as a foreign language because I would like to end up working in another European country. But I am not really sure if that's what I really like, I never taught anything to anyone and I think kids are not my thing.
Recently I discovered that text correction (""corrección ortotipográfica"", like punctuation, spelling, grammar, coherence... in a Spanish text as it is my first language) is an actual job, and is something I always enjoyed doing and that I think I have skills for, so I am considering going through that path.
I'm not really sure what should I do, or if correction is a good option. And if it is, if I would be able to work on it from another country.
Any advice about if it's worth it enough? And also what other things could fit my studies that are not related to classical world, but to languages/Spanish/linguistics?",29Jan2020,1

I don’t deserve her yet she doesn’t even seem to mind that I’m seriously mentally ill.

I’m only staying at my job because of her, I suck at it and its debilitating but I can’t find another job. I can’t believe I’m getting this upset over my own stupid trust issues. I know if she leaves me I won’t be able to deal with it, I’ve never loved anyone this much and been this emotionally attached, and no one has ever treated me nearly as well as she has. If I’m a good boyfriend I should prioritize her happiness over my own selfish needs, and I’ve told her countless times that she deserves better than me and I wouldn’t blame her if she couldn’t take my bullshit anymore and had to leave.

- Met with Dean of Students to discuss options (only real help they lent was to be able to stay in my dorm an extra week)
- Met with Finacial Services to see if I could forgo any payment until next semester (in the process of RA application which would cover the remainder of my tuition)

I'm a 24 year old male and have been watching the years fly by as I do nothing to improve my life or my happiness as a person. Ever since I can remember, I've always struggled with most social interactions involving anyone. I'm very shy when it comes to meeting new people and even worst when it comes to meeting anyone of the opposite sex. Now it's not like I can't make friends or be around girls but I always feel like no matter how long I know someone, it never goes past the awkward stage even though I've known them for a while or in my head I have the idea that no matter what i do or say, I assume people don't like me from the very beginning. 

I guess you can say I'm an introvert with way to much time to overthink but I think it's finally come to the point where I'm afraid to even interact with people or seeking out any meaningful relationships with people. I find myself in a cycle of work, eat, sleep repeat. I've tried doing more things that get me out of my comfort zone like going to bars, concerts, going to the gym, and traveling but still go back to tendencies and have gotten fed up with it. 

I moved away from my home town about a year ago to a bigger collage town thinking I would come out of my shell and  finally be able to be almost a normal adult but in that year, I haven't made a single friend that wasn't already a friend of my roommates, even then they feel like they're barely acquaintance's. I would like to be able to have more friends and pursue a relationship with someone I care about but I fear years of self loathing have almost broken me. I've thought of telling one of my roommates about my issue but i don't know how to make explain it without sounding like a sad shit.

The optimistic in me is what's keeping me from giving up but as the years pile up with little to no improvement, the pessimist in me is starting to get louder and I'm afraid of what I might become.

I knew she would come because I messaged her last time that I will go and she told me she would also go to that conference. We told each other that see you on the conference event.

We bumped each other during the course of breaks in that conference, said hi to each other. But we did not really talk much in person because she was with her friends and I was also busy by that time and I'm with my friends. After the conference event last Saturday, I messaged her on how was the conference. We chatted a bit and had a good conversation but she really took a long time to reply to my last chat messages.

Well one time her best friend offered me a ride home last time. Only 2 of us in the car. Then she kept pushing me on telling her on who is my crush. She also told me that if I tell her who is my crush, she will help me to set up on that person she knows

Well, I only know one common friend of her best friend and its her who is my current crush. Sooo yeah that is what I thought. My crush also invited me to an event before I message her.

Sooo yeah, right now idk if my crush likes me because I only know one common friend that I interact with and which is her

Like after I mentioned my crush name in a car in a casual conversation, she pauses a bit then she answered. And like afterwards she kept pushing me who is my crush

The day after Christmas is when it started, I think. I woke up around 5 PM, and nobody was here. My room mate was gone, no cars were outside, nobody could be seen. The stores were open, the food was there, but nobody was inside. I've been living off of what I can scoop up from the store, but the fresh stuff is running low.

I don't have much memory of the time period immediately before this started. It's like a fuzzy blur, and I can't remember the order it happened in. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question here, and the advice I'm asking is as follows:

I don't think I'm making progress staying at home any longer. I don't think that I can stay here, and get home at the same time. I think that there is something in the woods where I camped that may be keeping me here, but I also know going up there in the current weather is dangerous. 

I know this all sounds crazy, and believe me, it is, but I need advice here. I've never been decisive. You know Chidi on the good place trying to decide on a place to eat? That's how I feel.

Any input is appreciated, and please, feel free to ask questions.",29Jan2020,1
387,My Brother used to be nuisance. He was noisy in class and used to steal stuff. He has stopped doing it yet people are treating him as if he is still bad. The teachers are super hard on him. Slightest bit of noise?Reported to our parents. Laughed? Reported to our parents. Even if his classmates are talking to him while he doesent he still gets the blame. My parents are strict and would talk him down till he cried(They also used stuff like your a devil or are you a spawn of satan just to fuck with him). Banned using the internet and playing outside for a month for every report. The teachers has a huge bias towards other students and is not that hard on themh while my brother gets fucked for every slight mistake he did. They also exaggerate his behavior by saying he is still noisy or he hasnt changed when in reality he is extremely quite. They also exaggerate his grade saying that he is not the student that he used to be (He was always on the honor list) saying that he is dumb and stupid now even tho in his card he only lost 1-2 points (system is graded from 70-100 where i live). Because of the bans he is extremely isolated from his friends is now depressed. He always coped by talking about it to me. I try my hardest to listen but I cant,29Jan2020,1

389," 

So two years ago, my friend, out of nowhere, told me she was diagnosed with depression. Because I am not a people person, I didn't know how to react. She just told me that she was fine, though, and it wasn't that severe. Since she is usually a very cheerful person, and she didnt seem worried, I just decided to ignore it, thinking that it couldn't be life-threatening. I was stupid then.

As time went on, I started being more aware of her self-belittling jokes and comments, which, at the time, didn't sound serious. She just sounded like she was joking around, and I thought she had stopped being depressed. But a few month's ago, she suddenly confided in me about her over-bearing parents, and that she felt like her entire life was being controlled. I also knew about all the ridiculous restrictions her parents put on her. Of course, I knew she had other reasons to feel the way she did, but she wouldn't tell me. That's when she told me she was still depressed. I didn't know what to think, but I decided that I should just try to be there for her, and listen to her when needed. I didn't think it was too serious yet.

But. a few days ago, my friend let out an outburst in a group chat full of our friends, saying that it was tiring to have to come to school wearing a happy mask, so that everyone would be happy. Hiding her true feelings. After hearing about this, in a separate chat, one of my friends revealed to the rest of us that our friend used to cut herself. She didn't know if our friend still did it. Apparently it was usually with a push pin or paper. Understandably, the rest of my friends and I were horrified. I didn't think it would escalate to this level....

We created a separate group chat without our friend, to try to discuss what we could do to help her. Several of them suggested telling her parents, which I was strongly against, considering what she had told me. I didn't think her parents would be able to understand, and thought maybe talking to the school counselor would be a better option. We eventually decided to try to talk to our friend the next day, and see what was going on.

When we tried to talk to her, she immediately gave responses such as ""oh, I'm fine"" and ""I was just being dramatic then"" and she kept on trying to change the subject, or cracking jokes, or directing our attention to something else. Since it was clear that she didn't want to talk about it, we decided to leave it, but we still discussed about what to do in our group chat.

A few months ago, my friend had become a fan of the k-pop band bts. She is an avid supporter of them, and loves them and their music with all her heart. As some may know, Bts makes incredibly inspiring music, with a big example being their Love Yourself album. Today, in our main group chat of friends, she was gushing over their choreography in their song Black Swan, when one of our friends said, ""seriously, is bts all you care about?! are you going to talk about nothing else? Why would you care so much about a stupid korean band..."" and my friend grew furious. She said, ""stupid band? STUPID BAND?! Bts was there for me when no one else was! Their music is my biggest inspiration, and they have given more to me than anyone else! They are the biggest reason I'm able to be happy, the reason I'm not DEAD!!!""

My other friend was shocked. Thats when my friend broke down in the group chat and told us about what happened the year before. She had filled up the sink, listening to music, and was ready to kill herself, when she heard Magic Shop, one of their songs, playing... and she decided to live. My other friend was horrified, and started asking her questions like ""Why would you do that?! Can't you see that we care for you?! This isnt even about BTS anymore!!!""

My friend backed off and said that she didnt mean it, it wasnt a big deal, and she was going to go listen to their songs. At this point, I have no idea what to do. In our separate group chat, we discussed about this, with some people wanting to tell her parents, and others just wanting to tell a counselor or help her. But I don't know how we can do it... Every time I try to talk to her, she makes it clear she wants nothing to do with the topic... she keeps saying ""I'm fine, don't worry about me""... and even if we tried to take her to therapy or a counselor, she would probably refuse, saying she didnt need one.

I don't want to tell her parents, because I feel that they wouldn't understand this sort of thing, especially because of their high expectations for her. I've been crying for the last hour because of this. I seriously don't know what to do anymore...

My coworker, we'll call her O for safety (in case I get loads of hate) told me I smell yesterday while we were having our weekly intercourse. She said and I quote ""Babe, you should put on some deodarent"" and handed me some of hers (to make me smell like an actual pussy). I gave myself a light spritz on all the usual places (armpits, dick, feet the usual) but she suggested I put on a little more.

Obviously like any reasonable man, I told her to fuck off. I may have had a significant musk about me, (I sweat a lot) but that gave her no right to speak to me like that. I don't think.

395,"Last night my GF and her mother had a tear filled blow up over the phone. I was holding her for comfort and support so I heard everything but at the insistence of my GF kept out of the convo. Since much of their conflict is due to her taking on many of my own positions (which were opposed to her mother's from the beginning.) **I need a sanity check.** I feel I am/we are right regarding the facts, but I don't want to drive them apart.

**So what's the deal?** Two weeks ago my GF has a breakdown in the middle of the night. Cried her eyes out the whole night due to stress at work. They are chronically understaffed and overworked, on top of that her job is dealing with the unemployed which can be very emotional and ugly at times. Two days ago (monday) she went back to work. At least in part to the stormy weather and my cough we both had issues sleeping that night. So yesterday at noon she called me in tears, saying how it's still too much for her. She gets to go home again and on the way home texts her mother asking advice for better sleep.

But instead, her mother launches into her usual spiel about all her problems being the fault of us not being vegetarians and her still being on psych meds (more on that in a moment). They have a back and forth about how we've been over this and she was asking for advice specifically for sleeping. It escalates and ends with her mother stating ""I don't want to talk about this anymore"".

*Intermission:* My GF has chronic depression and her mother has been and continues to pressure her to get of those meds because they are unnatural and bad for her. This has caused my GF several relapses early in our relationship because she was constantly trying to ween herself off the meds. After a long and hard battle I've convinced her that some issues need perpetual treatment. She's has eventually found a balance for the meds that's a fraction of the original dose but still keept her issue free for years now.

Getting back to the start. She's home. We're sitting on the couch, cuddling. She wants to tell her mother she's home safe. Text or Call? I'm not the most well versed in social interactions so I tell her do what you think is appropriate but only call if you're sure you can stay off the hot topic. She calls and the call goes roughly like this (I'm translating):

GF: Hi mom, I just wanted to tell you I'm home now

pause

Mom: Just today or are you on sick leave again?

GF: Sick leave, already got an appointment for therapy and they'll decide for how long I'll be off work

Mom: That's good! But you also need to get off those meds as soon as possible.

GF: OP and I have talked about this. This is not a good time. Maybe later when this stress has been sorted out we can consider this again.

Mom: This is so tough on us (mom and dad) when you always brush away our advice like this.

This is where the conversation gets a bit fuzzy for me as I was boiling with rage listening to it. The only thing that still sticks out to me which wasn't a repeat of the previous points was her mom saying ""You know your father and I always think about how we can help you. But you always ignore us. It hurts us so much when you come to us with your problems but don't let us help you."" I manage to convince her to hang up shortly after that.

So my position on this is:

* I pissed A.F. at her mother.
* For someone who less than an hour ago claimed she ""don't want to talk about this anymore"" she was *extremely* eager to bring it up again. I did not exaggerate that conversation. This was her second reply!
* I find her ""it hurts us when you come to us with your problems but reject our solutions"" scarily manipulating
* Both her mother and I only want to help my GF but have very different ideas what that entails. I don't want to her to fight a proxy war with her mother on my behalf or drive them apart. But my GF insists that ""I stay out of this""
* As said before, my GF hasn't had a depression episode in years since she comitted to a steady dose even though it is a fraction of the original prescription (she went from something like 1 pill every day to a quarter pill every other). And to my knowledge she's never experienced any side effects aside from weight gain (which we also have in check)
* To my knowledge there is no connection between ""animal proteins"" and sleep issues and bringing that up is nothing more than an expression of her mom's ""panacea-view"" on organics and vegitarianism.

They spoke to me a bit but never really brought me into what they were saying and when I did talk , it was as if they didn't get my jokes etc and I felt really isolated , my confidence in the situation went down .

Now , these guys are what I would call ""bad boy"" type of guys . The guys who get all of the girls because they say whatever they want. This made me feel as if I was inferior to them and that they were the ""alphas"" leading the social interaction .

398,"Hello everyone who reads, as of this moment I’ve come to the realization the I’m drowning in a pit of endless boredom. It’s difficult to word this correctly but I’ll try my best. Ok so ever since I was a kid I became bored of things very easily and as I’ve grown it’s become apparent that I’m beginning to feel nothing but crushing boredom. I always tried doing new things growing up to satisfy my boredom and nothing ever satisfied it for long I played every sport that’s been available to me, Due to family circumstances I’ve been working different jobs since I was 12 and even they get boring after more then a month, after a while of running around alone I decided that maybe if I spoke with other people then maybe they could satisfy my boredom however talking with people became boring very quickly and after a while I began to think of ways to satisfy my boredom in other ways with people and around that time is when I really sank into the pit of boredom. I started to mess with people and things to deal with my boredom, I did things from inconveniencing people to completely crushing their lives whether I simply made a mess at there work after they cleaned an area to ruining people’s families lives and it was helpful for a while till even that became boring so I decided to mettle with peoples heads and you can assume where that went. And that worked for a bit but it did get boring after a few months. I found someone who could satisfy my bored mind for quite a while and I thought maybe my boredom was gone because I didn’t feel it for almost a year however recently that person has left my area and I’ve come to the realization that my boredom has returned 10 fold and it’s almost mind numbing how bored I’ve been. Now I’m 18 working night shift at a gas station and my boredom is at the tipping point and I’ve come to realize that there’s nothing I can due to rid myself of boredom so I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of stuff to do to help my problem 

P.s I know I’m a bad person so there’s not really much that can be said that I don’t know already and that I think of myself. 

Thx to anyone who gives advice",29Jan2020,1
399,"Reposting from r/trueoffmychest, looking for advice. 

So my ex and I haven’t spoken in person in awhile, which I am perfectly ok with. However, recently, this person has decided to put themselves in danger physically and mentally and I am worried that they may not end up ok. They need a serious health evaluation, but they don’t have insurance, so instead have taken it upon themselves to find the drugs necessary for treatment of their physical issue online from another country. I only know this from talking with their friend. Who knows what kind of knockoff, wrong-dosage drugs they could be taking? I mean they don’t even have a legitimate diagnosis, so who is to say what drugs are even correct for treatment?

I know it’s not my issue, but I still feel like if I don’t confront them and give them links to resources like Planned Parenthood or other subsidized or low-income resources, then I have not tried my best for them. I shouldn’t care as they isolated completely from me and their friend group on purpose, but I do care. I want to reach out and ask if they’re ok or if they’ve looked into safer options for treatment. I’m worried the friends that they made after leaving me do not care enough to confront this person on their dangerous behavior because they are surface-level friends. 

Sorry I’m being so vague, but this person knows reddit inside and out. Anyway, anyone have any advice for bringing this topic up? I mean my ex and I have texted amicably in the past month, and we live in the same neighborhood, so I’m sure we could find time to meet up. Am I insane for even thinking about asking if they’re ok? It was my first relationship so I put a lot of work into it, and while I know we will not end up together, I do still care for them as a human being and believe they deserve friends who are willing to confront them about real issues.

404,"I need to preface this and it will be long, I am sorry. I just hope someone reads.

I worked, until this morning, at a small-ish design company . When I started in april it was just me, another girl - we'll call her Andy - and our boss. In the same building there is also her husband's company, also pretty small. We all shared the space, etc.  At the start it was honestly the best. I thought I had landed the job of my dreams, our boss was awesome and sweet and kind and understanding, we were all open with each other and every day I felt content, even when it was hard. I felt both her and her husband were genuinely great people. 

But, as we started getting more projects, more money, more responsibilities, she (our boss) started to change. They both did but with her it was the most noticeable. She became less understanding, she started to care less about our personal time, we stayed \*many\* days after work unpaid, and we came to work on weekends several times. No one ever mentioned paying us for that extra time. And we didn't bring it up, at first just finding excuses for them and then just giving up altogether. She had the expectation of us responding to clients on weekends and at any hour, be it new years eve or our birthday. Both me and my colleague grew resentful and bitter towards her because of this - and many other small things that felt wrong.

When we had our first very big project, I made some mistakes. Nothing unfixable, but on the basis of everyone being stressed (including myself - quite badly), it all seemed huge and bad and I felt awful for having made those mistakes. I felt awful for a long time. And they (my boss and her husband) made me feel awful about myself as well. They constantly brought up my mistakes, they made jokes and comments that made me feel bad, and they totally stopped trusting me, which made me stop trusting myself too. I should've said something, but I felt so closed in and the environment felt so hostile I just couldn't do it.  After a while they stopped and started acting decent again, but I definitely couldn't feel completely ok anymore. The worst was I wasn't the only one who made mistakes, but only I got treated shittily. I was very bitter towards my boss, she became a different person who I absolutely did not feel I could be honest with.  That was the problem, she always preached the importance of communication, etc, but she felt so dishonest in her attitude and she definitely didn't communicate openly with me.  

In the meantime of all this, we got a new colleague who easily fit right in with us girls, and a close friend of mine joined shortly after. My friend only stayed for a month, she immediately felt uncomfortable in the forced atmosphere we had going on, and she went on to do something else. 

Now, what led to the situation. My friend and ex-colleague had a situation on monday she wanted to write to our boss about (subject is irrelevant), and we talked about this on facebook. I advised her on what to say, my boss gave a mean-spirited reply and I got annoyed, said something angrily about her to my friend. I definitely wasn't nice, because I am angry and disappointed in who she turned out to be. I obviously spoke to my friends about her on other occasions as well.  

My fuck up was that I had a separate chrome session with my personal Whatsapp and messenger on my computer, as I needed to send people stuff from the pc sometimes and it just stayed on while I used it. I stupidly did not log out of those, as I somehow thought nothing like this would happen, and I'd just close the tabs and the window and leave just the work account session open. 

Yesterday morning I got a notification that someone logged into my work google session. I asked if it was them, boss said yeah, ignored it assuming she just needed something from my pc.  I came into work, everything seemed fine, then my boss' husband told everyone to leave for a bit cause he had to talk to me. He fired me on the spot, giving me some bullshit reason about ""needing to make some changes"".  My actual boss didn't even have the balls to say anything to me. She just came in at some point and stared at the floor.  I signed my resignation, gathered most of my stuff... My colleagues, especially Andy, were shocked, there was some crying.  When I left, my boss said something like ""i hope you'll be a good person and leave malice aside"". 

Now, I think it's pretty much 100% that she intentionally went on my computer to read my messages with the friend she had talked to previously, knowing we probably spoke about the situation. Andy told me after that she said I ""talked badly about her and swore at her"" and that she ""wants no gossip in her home"". It also makes sense why she didn't say why she was firing me, because that would mean she had to admit she read my private conversations. 

As for Andy, who I'd actually been speaking to about our boss' deteriorating behaviour, I can vouch for her not having spilled the beans in some way. She feels bad for a day for even killing a fly, she's not really capable of hurting someone on purpose. Not to mention me getting fired makes her life 10x harder and doubles the workload.

So yeah, in conclusion... I felt a lot of strange guilt about this whole thing. Not for complaining to my close friends about my boss, but for letting a wound fester and not speaking up when I should have. Because yes, I could've been a lot more honest and open about my feelings instead of hating her privately and being kind to her face. I was thinking of leaving this job in the near future anyway, but not like this. I don't like burning bridges. Not to mention it's yet another job on my CV with under a year of work... 

Does anyone have any advice or anything? I don't know, this was a huge hit for me and I still can't believe it's real.  There's definitely stuff I left out, but I didn't wanna make this even longer.

405,"I’m with a man who ‘has’ a child from a previous relationship, but the child is not his. He was with the woman since she was pregnant, and the father is not in his life. When the child stays with us I feel completely taken advantage of, the kid is bad. Not just regular child bad, he is not content ever with anything even if he gets exactly what he wants. My boyfriend does little to nothing to take care of the child, I do all the work. He doesn’t bathe him or feed him or make a cup for him or play with him or put him to bed, nothing. I have a horrible relationship with the child, he loves me, but frankly I don’t love him (I’m not mean to him in any way). He shows no affection and is bad 24/7 (temper tantrums biting screaming hitting kicking). He has literally never shown me or his dad affection. He’s 4 years old, he’s not potty trained. He can’t count or say his abcs. He speaks at a 2 year old level. It’s 100% his mothers and my boyfriends fault, but mostly his mothers. My boyfriend works a lot, upwards of 70 hours most weeks, &amp; until they split she didn’t work she just stayed home &amp; paid basically no attention to the child.

407,"I swear to god, since I hit 27, it's just injury after injury. Some of them are:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Threw my back out trying crossfit, three years ago. The pain went away, but came back whenever I tried to do any core exercises. In the end it was nearly constant pain. Currently in my sixth month of physiotherapy and the pain is mostly gone but I'll probably need another 6 months before it's ""better"".

\- Developed RSI in both wrists from poor typing habits. Switched to DVORAK and a split keyboard, and needed several months of physiotherapy.

\- Ankle injuries. Oh my God, the ankle injuries. Every single time I start getting back into jogging, I re-injure some part of my ankles/feet. 

\- After several months of swimming laps in a pool due to the low impact it has, I went for a swim in the ocean and threw my left shoulder out. This was 4 months ago and has not gone away or got better. Currently waiting to see a physio about this.

\- I feel like my neck and jaw muscles are weaker, too. Started getting jaw pain, saw a physio who specializes it TMD/TMJ. He gave me some exercises which helped a lot, but it still feels kinda weak &amp; sensitive.

\- And on top of the jaw thing, I've started getting fluttering in my left ear when I listen to music.

&amp;#x200B;

What is up with this? I'm 29 now and it's starting to feel like I'm firefighting rather than staying in shape. My physiotherapy routine has became so extensive that it takes around a full hour - I've actually started building body definition from the fucking physiotherapy alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try to stay in shape, and I've never been in particalarly bad shape - I've mostly always been skinny, sometimes a tiny bit chubby - it just feels like I'm falling apart.

408,"Hi guys,

I’m in my third year of a Bachelor of Social Work. It’s only a 4 year degree. I’ve just started unpaid work placement and I absolutely hate it now that I’m getting real experience. I initially picked Social Work because I’ve done a diploma in Counselling and I absolutely loved that. I thought I could use the Social Work degree to help me become better qualified and gain employment as a therapist. If I stay in social work, I’ll go on to a Masters of Psychotherapy and Counselling. Yet, I’m thinking; I really don’t want to go though a whole university degree just to end up with a job I don’t love. 

I really kind of want to go into nursing, now. The nursing degree is 3 years, so I’d only be adding an extra year. However, I’d be wasting 2 and a half. I really need to start real paid work in the side because money is tight, too.

So I was thinking, what if I finished Social Work and did nursing after? I’m sure these two degrees would make me look good to employers. But at the same time I’m worried that having two bachelor degrees might not be as prospective as having a masters. 

What should I do? I’m having a future career crisis!",29Jan2020,1
410,"Please be respectful.
(F19) I have always had a really close bond with my mom, I tell her basically everything and as a family we're all relatively close. My oldest brother has always been the sibling I'm closest too, even as a kid we were pretty close the thing is, and I don't know if he even remembers.. he at a point when I was really young (9 years old) came home really drunk and he didn't even live at home but he was so drunk that he didn't remember that he had moved out. I had gotten his room when he moved out, he was 19 at the time and he stumbled into my room and fell asleep in my bed with me. I didn't understand at the time but the way he was touching me and pulling me close, it shouldn't have happened.

I love my brother and it wasn't until I was older maybe 15 that I even remembered it but since I did start to remember it suddenly the reason of being so uncomfortable around drunk family made sense, it terrefies me when he gets drunk. My mom always had a habit of letting him stay in my room when he came to visit. He always gets blackout drunk and crawls into my bed and doesn't even remember it when I bring it up the next morning.

Not too long ago I had a friend over who knows about him and what I'm so scared for, she's met them before and is a close friend. When he then got drunk and she personally saw the way he acted when he was that drunk, pulled me onto his lap and genuinely acting weird she was also uncomfortable and freaked out.

My mom workes with abused women and I don't know if I can call it abuse but I've been told I should tell her but I don't want to mess up my family. I don't want to ruin our bond and for it to be put on me. It's only when he's drunk but of course it has me worried being alone with him in that state.
I know it sounds like a silly excuse but I know my dad and my mom wouldn't be able to forgive such a thing and I really don't want to ruin or break my family and later be blamed for it. 

I really don't know, maybe this was more of a way of getting to write about it, but I really don't know what to do.",29Jan2020,1
411,"In a nutshell, I got a friend suggestion on Facebook which showed ""14 mutual friends"" with a kinda-emo woman with colored hair. I was instantly intrigued in what way I know her.

Well, made the mistake of clicking.

I next find out we have about a 100 things in common, she works nearby, lives in my city, has the same favorite genre of music, has the same interests, same humor (regular to r/2meirl4meirl kinds of things), same preferences in TV shows and movies. My reaction was something alongside of this, while breath-screaming:

""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?! WHY DOES EVERYONE KNOW HER BUT ME?! DID SHE STUDY WITH US?! I'M GOING TO KILL MY FRIENDS...... though I did suffer from social anxiety so no wonder if that is what stopped me DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE FUCK.

I didn't know if she went to our school or how others knew about her, but if I found out she learned with us (she didn't), I'd probably tell my sister to bitch slap me.

I instantly tried adding her on Instagram, Facebook, sent a message on both platforms, but with 3000 followers, the chances to get a response are probably next to none. I'm pretty sure I saw a post with a 99+ from a woman with WAY less followers.

Now... fast forward two weeks later, I'm going to sign up for a gym soon, but here's the problem between my two options:

Low cost gym - packed during the hours I finish work - away from bus route - have to wake up at 5 if I want to train normally, I'm not a morning person.
Regular cost gym - normal conditions - closest from work - high quality - new - can arrive in the evening................................................................. - and she goes there.
My idea was choosing 2, and ignoring her as much as possible, in hopes of thinking that that is what I would've chosen if she wasn't a factor in my choice.

I'm NOT looking for a relationship. If anything was somehow to ever happen, the healthier thing would be to build a friendship. I believe in friendship building into romance, but most people would rather not even think that and get insulted when you say ""someday we might change feelings, till then, friends :3"" I guess it's somehow a sin to say that yours or theirs feelings MIGHT change?

TL:DR I have to choose between 2 gyms. If she wasn't a factor, there's a high chance I'd choose the second option anyway. So... what should I do? Am I lying to myself?",29Jan2020,1

413,"I need to preface this and it will be long, I am sorry. I just hope someone reads.

I worked, until this morning, at a small-ish design company . When I started in april it was just me, another girl - we'll call her Andy - and our boss. In the same building there is also her husband's company, also pretty small. We all shared the space, etc.  At the start it was honestly the best. I thought I had landed the job of my dreams, our boss was awesome and sweet and kind and understanding, we were all open with each other and every day I felt content, even when it was hard. I felt both her and her husband were genuinely great people. 

But, as we started getting more projects, more money, more responsibilities, she (our boss) started to change. They both did but with her it was the most noticeable. She became less understanding, she started to care less about our personal time, we stayed \*many\* days after work unpaid, and we came to work on weekends several times. No one ever mentioned paying us for that extra time. And we didn't bring it up, at first just finding excuses for them and then just giving up altogether. She had the expectation of us responding to clients on weekends and at any hour, be it new years eve or our birthday. Both me and my colleague grew resentful and bitter towards her because of this - and many other small things that felt wrong.

When we had our first very big project, I made some mistakes. Nothing unfixable, but on the basis of everyone being stressed (including myself - quite badly), it all seemed huge and bad and I felt awful for having made those mistakes. I felt awful for a long time. And they (my boss and her husband) made me feel awful about myself as well. They constantly brought up my mistakes, they made jokes and comments that made me feel bad, and they totally stopped trusting me, which made me stop trusting myself too. I should've said something, but I felt so closed in and the environment felt so hostile I just couldn't do it.  After a while they stopped and started acting decent again, but I definitely couldn't feel completely ok anymore. The worst was I wasn't the only one who made mistakes, but only I got treated shittily. I was very bitter towards my boss, she became a different person who I absolutely did not feel I could be honest with.  That was the problem, she always preached the importance of communication, etc, but she felt so dishonest in her attitude and she definitely didn't communicate openly with me.  

In the meantime of all this, we got a new colleague who easily fit right in with us girls, and a close friend of mine joined shortly after. My friend only stayed for a month, she immediately felt uncomfortable in the forced atmosphere we had going on, and she went on to do something else. 

Now, what led to the situation. My friend and ex-colleague had a situation on monday she wanted to write to our boss about (subject is irrelevant), and we talked about this on facebook. I advised her on what to say, my boss gave a mean-spirited reply and I got annoyed, said something angrily about her to my friend. I definitely wasn't nice, because I am angry and disappointed in who she turned out to be. I obviously spoke to my friends about her on other occasions as well.  

My fuck up was that I had a separate chrome session with my personal Whatsapp and messenger on my computer, as I needed to send people stuff from the pc sometimes and it just stayed on while I used it. I stupidly did not log out of those, as I somehow thought nothing like this would happen, and I'd just close the tabs and the window and leave just the work account session open. 

Yesterday morning I got a notification that someone logged into my work google session. I asked if it was them, boss said yeah, ignored it assuming she just needed something from my pc.  I came into work, everything seemed fine, then my boss' husband told everyone to leave for a bit cause he had to talk to me. He fired me on the spot, giving me some bullshit reason about ""needing to make some changes"".  My actual boss didn't even have the balls to say anything to me. She just came in at some point and stared at the floor.  I signed my resignation, gathered most of my stuff... My colleagues, especially Andy, were shocked, there was some crying.  When I left, my boss said something like ""i hope you'll be a good person and leave malice aside"". 

Now, I think it's pretty much 100% that she intentionally went on my computer to read my messages with the friend she had talked to previously, knowing we probably spoke about the situation. Andy told me after that she said I ""talked badly about her and swore at her"" and that she ""wants no gossip in her home"". It also makes sense why she didn't say why she was firing me, because that would mean she had to admit she read my private conversations.

One  of the biggest mistakes I see over and over again is that men don't use  their opportunities. You don't have to run on the streets every day and  appeal to women, but you have to be able to take the first step when an  opportunity arises. And occasions always arise whether you see them or  not.

The few men who take  advantage of their opportunities are 100 % superior to other men. If you  don't use a location, you're not even in the game. That's how the rules  are.

⁣I also know from experience  that it's not always easy to take advantage of your occasions. I used  to hold back in the right situations back then. Fear of rejection has  been omnipresent with me. However, sooner or later, there is nothing  left but letting go of his past and fears and take advantage of the  moment.

The past few days I’ve been feeling really weird mentally, today especially.

Earlier decided to watch some favorite YouTuber’s videos to put me in a better mood, and at first it worked! The videos gave me a familiar overwhelming feeling of happiness that I’m used to getting when watching these videos. 

At first it felt like surges of happiness and calmness, but then I realized that the same feeling felt like despair and sadness at the exact same time. I felt this feeling many times throughout the video. Now it’s much later, 4 am, and I am watching a calming satisfying video to hopefully get sleepy. And the same feeling is happening. 

I’m not able to differentiate between the feeling of happiness and sadness right now. On one hand I feel really calm and content and on the other hand the same feeling feels like despair. I really can’t find other words to describe this.

419,"So, as the title explains, one of my closest friends is irking me out.

We've been friends since uni, now in our late 20s. At uni we were just course mates but then discovered we lived in the same home area, so became closer after uni. But we always had our separate lives, separate groups and that worked well for a while, as we'd catch up individually.

So about 2 years ago, we both came out of toxic relationships, I was with my ex for a few years and her too. This helped us to bond more over healing, you know you have that single friend that is in the same boat as you, so naturally you hang out more, spend time when you would've been with your partner together instead, that kind of setup. This is effectively what happened for us. Difference is, I felt like I was progressing a lot more and actually focused on healing from my abusive ex because I WANTED to. Long story short, he was nearly 10 years older than me, caught me young-ish, I was so in love and tolerated a lot of emotional and physical abuse from him, ending in me losing our baby and then finally having the strength to walk away from him. It was a super tough time, had to file for a restraining order, was being harassed and stalked by him on a daily for nearly a year, he'd show up at my work/home/smashed my car windows etc. It was hell. My friends relationship was on and off with a childhood friend, who she'd always had a thing for but he was with plenty of other girls during the time they knew each other. They eventually had a relationship, kind of, after sleeping together on and off after uni, but then he left her. I also believe he was emotionally abusive to her, put her down, compared her to girls he was cheating with, made her feel crazy, gaslighted her etc. Anyways he left so there we were, both newly single.

I could recognise my ex for who he was and the codependent/enabler I was too, and took the necessary steps, got therapy, got support from the miscarriage and really took a break from everything else until I felt better, having felt depressed/suicidal after all of this. My friend was there, but in a way that was like she was just as miserable, so she would just talk about her situation and her ex. So it wasn't very progressive, not that I was expecting that, but thank God I had my therapist/wanted to help myself, because misery loves company and all and I feel I could've just stayed in that situation a lot longer with her.

Fast forward a year from the breakups, I was much better, still single, not completely over what had happened, but I could again recognise how much progress I'd made and how much more stable my life was away from that toxic situation. My friend on the other hand was still down in the dumps, obsessing over her ex, still trying to contact him (he'd blocked her on all forums), still talking about him and her as if they were together - in short, she'd kind of lost the plot over him. I was there comforting her but all my words were falling on dead ears, she'd just go and get drunk after work with other friends and then end up drunk calling him or sleeping with some random guy and wind up feeling worse and thinking of her ex. So this went on for a while longer.

About half a year after that (1.5 years since the relationships have now ended) I started seeing a long time friend. I had doubts, but had a lot of love for this guy and felt ready to try my chance at romance again. If you're considering dating a friend btw, realllllly think about it, because it can ruin the friendship. Anyway, I had my doubts about this guy too, he wasn't very trustworthy and I was aware of that from the get go, and so were my friends.... So one day we're chilling at my flat, this guy comes over and my friend is there having spent the day at mine. So we all chill together, not even for an hour. Anyways after that, this guy and my friend added each other on social media a few days later and begin messaging each other. Now, of course I want my friend and guy I'm dating to get along, but the relationship is literally a few weeks in at this point, this is my first experience since my ex who broke my trust in literally everyone, first person I've been physical with since etc. I found that situation pretty damn shady, not only from this guy, but from my friend who has actively seen me heartbroken, lose a baby and knowing I'm struggling to find trust again. I also found it weird they both added each other afterwards, not just normally when we were together. I also didn't know what they had to talk about!? By this point I'm pissed, at both of them, but moreso her, because she's closer to me and aware of the trust issues I have with this guy. Yes people may say 'well why did you go there in the first place' but sometimes you need facts to back up your intuition, which is what I was doing by trying to give things a go with him. And I was right.

So whatever we hashed this out, I had to bring it up to both of them, and they could see why it was wrong after. But by that point I'm weary. Anyways we move on, I ended things with this guy last year. So now it's around 2 years later, she's still irritating me and I feel like since that event with the guy I was dating, it was all progressively downhill. I find her needy, selfish, clingy and fake as hell. Her updates whenever I see her centre around which friend she's fallen out with this week/month or which guy she's slagged off yet slept with. It's self sabotage and draining because I don't see much change at all, just complaining about the same old shit and then going back to do it all again and running to me to vent to. I'm the type of friend that's like the agony aunt, good to talk to and give advice, but I rarely bombard my friends with all my woes, unless I really need advice because a) who actually cares about this BS b) I'm very independent c) I don't like too many opinions, if I feel a certain way I'm probably going to act on it (ironic as I'm venting to reddit but I genuinely need advice on this). d) I actually trust myself, my intuition and know I'm headstrong.

The older I get, the stronger I get. Since my breakup, my life has significantly improved. I've bought a beautiful home, I moved away from my dysfunctional family, left my toxic ex, basically stopped tolerating abuse. And it shows! Eg with the guy I dated, I probably would've still been with him had I still been living in the past/not healed properly, but I could recognize the situation for what it was and differentiate wrong from right. I'm now testing a business idea, aside from my day job, travelling in my free time, meeting new people and expanding my horizons, learning new things and feeling content and wholesome. I'm really looking at the people around me, like my friend, who just seems to be dragging me down. Latest example was for her birthday, she told me she wanted to go away for a weekend, just us two and she just wanted a lowkey dinner with some girlfriends beforehand. I think she was trying to coax at staying over at mine as she kept saying she 'didn't want to wake up at her home on her birthday' but I didn't give in because she'd stayed over for 3 nights at Christmas and honestly, I wanted space. I recognise that she uses my home as an escape, which I would offer to any friend if they needed it, but with boundaries and limits, which I feel she pushed constantly. Like she'll come to my home, order takeaway and then eat most of it. Who does that!? ANYWAYS, this birthday dinner, she rocked up with half the girls she'd been bitching about, who hadn't talked to her/reached out to her over the holidays, so she bitched about them the whole time. She came in hand in hand with all of them and then ended up staying around one of theirs. Her social media is plastered with fake pictures about all of them being her day 1s and how she loves her girls to bits. It's just so bloody childish and I feel like we're back in school. Did I mention she's older than me by 2 years also!? She also didn't have the decency to address the fact she didn't want to follow through on this weekend getaway with me, which suits me perfectly but it's like are you just going to pretend all these conversations didn't happen and we're going to play happy families with these other girls as if you weren't slating them the other day? Also she's actively told me how jealous these other girls are of me because she tells them how great of a friend I am and how she's always with me. So effectively just plays us off against each other.

Anyways, this is really long post but basically I feel she's idle minded, I genuinely can't stand the desperation, disloyalty and fakeness that comes out of her and her friends and I'm just over it all. My question is - how do I distance myself/avoid her? And secondly, I have tickets to this concert I invited her along to last year (coming up in March) with 2 of my other friends. I basically don't want her there to act fake with my friends, probably start licking their asses too and just doing the most. How can I say no to her? Lol - I feel childish but I'm just saving myself the frustration and annoyance I'll feel (my friends probably will too because they're similar to me).

Any advice?",29Jan2020,1

I had a group of friends I spent time with, but my best ones all moved country, and I seem to not enjoy being around anyone anymore. Its never fun, just excruciatingly boring. This seems to be the case with everyone I meet and know. I wondered if anyone else has experienced something similar? Does anyone have advice on how I can meet new types of people and/or form connections with them? I do all I can to work on mental health, just think the loneliness amplifies everything for me.",29Jan2020,1
422,"Last night me and one of my good friends were talking when suddenly she tells me she’s sorry. I asked her for what before seeing she unadded me on Snapchat. I went to her Instagram to message her and saw she had blocked me there and as well on Discord and Twitter. I texted her actual cell phone asking why she was doing this again (Last week she got it in her head that I would be better off if I didn’t know she existed but managed to convince her not to go through with it). I texted her that if she wanted me to really forget her then her wish was my command and I deleted her contact and everything that reminded me of her off my phone. I’m hurt and heartbroken that I had to do this and that she suddenly did this because she thought I would be better off without her. She always thought everything I did for her was being wasted on her even though I told her it wasn’t and I was doing it because I loved her. I’m struggling to accept that this happened still and I don’t know how I’m just supposed to forget who she was after being such a big part of my life for so long now, just I don’t understand.",29Jan2020,1

My uncle and aunt are nice to me and I do appreciate what they're doing, taking care of the house, cooking and feeding the dogs but I can handle that myself. My mother thinks I'm her little boy that she tells her brother to go check up in me and stay with me once in a while. I really want to be alone in my house, I just want to cook for myself since the food is basically breakfast and dinner since I eat lunch at work and I'm afraid that I need to buy more since they're here.

430,"Alright so my ex and i split about 3-4 months ago and we have been talking on and off for a while, we have also hooked up a few times inbetween. Before we started talking again during the “spring break” of Australian graduates schoolies happened i hooked up with one of her friends. I have made other mistakes here and there and acknowledged them and apologised to her about them all and she has told me she has forgiven me.

The thing is she still has feelings all this time, even when she broke up with me. Although her feelings have slightly declined due to all my fuckups she still has feelings.

Heres the troublesome part. She has told me countless times to move on from her and she will move on from me and in the future (as in months/ years from now) if the situation is right we may try and see how we go again. I listened to her and attempted to move on however she gets angry and jealous about it to me and gets upset that I’m moving on.

I tell her that I would be happy to get back together now or help her get her stuff sorted while i sort my stuff out and then stay in a kind of exclusive state but she wont even accept that.

Ive lost all idea of what to do but the biggest thing is that i still care for her and even if I’m seeing other people i still want to make sure she is okay and stay as at least a friend.

Any advice or questions are welcomed, thank you!!!

TLDR; ex has feelings for me and wont let me move on or come back to her.",29Jan2020,1

I recently told my therapist and I am getting a support worker for extra support and they know and I’m just wondering how I tell my mom I told them about it as I think she will get very angry as she gets very defensive over this person.

434,"Hi everyone,

So a year ago I was with a friend on a holiday in Australia. We hired a campervan to get around. We also got insurance for it, so if we got into an accident, we only had to pay 100$ excess. So on our trip we got into an accident. It wasn't too bad, a back light of a car was broken and some scratches, no one got hurt. I submitted the claim at my rental company thinking they would pay and everyone would be happy. Well unfortunately not.

A month or so after we returned out vehicle etc. we received a letter from the insurance of the people that we were in an accident with. We had to pay money for the accident. I  called up the insurance and said hey contact the rental company, I have insurance with them and they should pay. (It is even stated in the terms and conditions of the rental company). So just so you know I dont live in Australia. I live in Europe.

In October I received another letter about that I should pay, I was super confused and said that there must've been a misunderstanding and that they should contact the rental company. I called the rental company and said hey please resolve this matter with the insurance please as I paid insurance for you.  They said that they would escalate it and that they would solve the problem.

Now a year later, I receive a letter from a money collecting agency issued by the insurance that I have to pay for the accident within 7 days?? I am super confused by this as I thought everything was resolved since I haven't heard from neither of the parties or receive any calls, emails or letters. I contacted the rental company again and they said that they would pick it up, but I am not so sure of it. I sent emails to all 3 parties, the money collection office, the rental company and insurance company that there is a big misunderstanding and that they should'nt contact me as I was insured and it's not my problem anymore. The money collection agency sent me a threat letter that they were going to take legal action. 

Should I just pay out of own pocket to resolve this and get over with it? Or should I stick with my rights and await justice? Or should I pay the money and reclaim it (I'm scared if I do that, that I will never get my money back)

TLDR: Rented a vehicle, got into an accident but had insurance, rental company refuses to pay for the accident and now receiving threat letters from insurance and money collecting agencies.",29Jan2020,1

437,"I'm just out of a performance review with my boss and it went better than expected considering I hate my job and have been looking for a branch to cling to and escape this place for the past two years.

I have a degree in Earth Science and I work as a geologist in Northern Ireland. There's not a lot of work here in this field unless I go into consulting, which requires a lot of travel. When I was studying I was more than happy to travel for work and I did, to Northern Ireland but now I'm a bit older (though still only 26), have fallen in love and began building a house, I'm less excited about moving half way across the world to log core or write reports.

My work sent me to PDAC, a major conference in Toronto two years ago and while at it, I came to the solid conclusion that I was in the wrong career field. I've read about imposter syndrome but I was an actual full blown imposter. I struggled to connect with anyone and I felt like I had to ask questions I had no interest in hearing the answer too. 

I love geology but I don't want to work as a geologist anymore. When I try to explain it to people, they keep telling me to keep pushing, it will get better but I don't like the person this job is turning me into. I feel wholeheartedly unmotivated, stressed from feeling like I have to hide the fact I've checked out of my job and down right depressed because I feel trapped. I make good money and we need that to build our house but I'm miserable and I feel like I'm wasting my potential.

I don't know what to do or where to turn. I've tried over the past two years to find something else, I even started a course last year in Horticulture (I have another year to complete). I've considered doing a PGCE in primary education and becoming a primary school teacher but I wouldn't be able to start that course until September 2021 and that feels so long away, I honestly don't think I'll be able to stick this job out for that long.

 I have no social life, never been in a relationship and no friends only what I would consider work acquaintances but I don't really feel lonely. I don't have any motivation to do anything I used to do a lot of after school activities when I went to school, I very rarely clean my room it's hard to even find the motivation to take the dog for a walk. 

Work isn't all that great either, I work in fast food(front of house) but If I didn't work there I'd have no money and I'd imagine my mental health would be much worse without any human contact apart from family.

443,"Sorry for any bad English, it is my second language. Okay so I really need perspective on if this guy likes me/what I should do because it’s driving me crazy! 
A really attractive guy approached me a few weeks back and we really hit it off. He kept trying to talk with me, asking questions and trying to get to know me. A lot of guys approach me and it annoys me, but with this guy it didn’t because he was so kind and wasn’t creepy at all. We had a lot of chemistry, and we talked for an hour and a half and really connected. He even seemed a bit nervous to talk with me. I felt something really special with this guy. At the time he told me he was an actor among other things and I didn’t think much of it, I live in a city where there are a lot of “actors” trying to make it. Well, when I saw his social media when I got home I realized this guy is actually a low key celebrity in my country. I didn’t recognize him because I never watched the shows he is in, but people were making fan pages for him, he had over 100k Instagram followers, etc. He was a lead role in a fairly popular TV series and other significant work. He didn’t give off any arrogant vibes to me at all despite this, he seemed down to earth and super kind and humble. Then he asked a few times for me to come hang out with his friends, and even invited me to a party. I declined all of this (I didn’t want to seem too eager, also I was genuinely busy!) but offered to go with him and his friends the following weekend. So I met with them and they were all sooo nice, extremely attractive, creative and artistic, funny guys. I had an amazing time with them and I really felt welcomed in the group, despite being the only girl. When he first saw me he gave me a big hug. Then while we were hanging out he kept doing the “subtle touches” and even tickled me at one point and kept teasing me. He paid for my dinner. He was giving me little compliments here and there. He kept saying “oh I should take you to go ___!” And suggesting all of the things we should go do do/see and it seemed like he really wanted to hang out. It seemed like mild flirting but nothing super obvious, especially considering we were in a group. It seemed at some points his friends would try to leave us alone together and let us hang out, but it was mostly all together. I had an amazing time and I would be happy just having this new group of friends. However I am starting to get a lot of feelings for this guy. He is literally my exact type in every way. We have so many similarities (I am an artist too, among many other things that we share in common) and he makes me so happy. I know this sounds cheesy, but I’ve had other boyfriends and guy friends but I’ve never felt this way about someone, I can’t even describe it. However, here is where I start to doubt. First of all, he is almost 24 and I am 18 almost 19. I am super mature for my age and always seemed to date mostly guys older than me, but I’ve never dated someone 6 years or more older. Second, everything he invites me to is in a group. It’s never one on one, when I left hanging out with his friends the other night he said “I’ll tell you when we all get together next, so you can come too!”. My heart kind of dropped at this because I thought he would ask me next to spend time with just him, but he hasn’t. Please don’t read this as arrogant, im just trying to explain how I feel. But I am not used to this, I’ve always been chased by guys and been the “hot girl” so this behavior is weird to me because I am used to being the one who is pursued without having to put much work in. But I sent him a message today to try to make a move and asked if he wants to go to this place with me that he mentioned before and he just responded saying he was about to go to work and he will tell me later. Well, that was in the morning and still no reply (it’s 2 am now). I realize actors have very busy schedules but this kind of confused me because it went so well the other night. I am just worried this guy is out of my league. I mean he works with such beautiful women, he has money, fame, etc. Even though he is very sweet to me I get worried “what if I’m being stupid, what if this guys friend zoning me and I’m really not good enough for him”. I mean yes I am a beautiful girl, I know it, but I am not famous. I don’t get the attention he does. I really felt like he genuinely felt something with me but these doubts make me feel stupid about it and it’s been really upsetting me. I am normally never insecure, but I am a young girl who barely is starting her career and he is so successful and hot! How can I not be intimidated by it. Please tell me if I am being naive or if I actually have a chance. :)",29Jan2020,1

446,"About me, I'm in my early 30s. I can't work due to disability so I live off welfare and have an apartment I share with another family member. My mother owns her own house.

My mother intends to leave me her house when she passes, as the rent for my apartment is too expensive for me on my own. But she is extremely worried about whether I can maintain a home. 

She constantly breaks out into lectures, sometimes for an hour+, about the minutiae of home maintenance. Whenever a problem arises at her home, she tells me long stories about exactly how she resolved it and has me watch several YouTube videos describing the solutions. She says she wants me to be prepared for every possible situation. But she often repeats herself or strays onto side points - how to fix a leaky faucet can easily take an hour, and she might repeat the whole thing again later on.

She puts in a lot of effort doing this - she writes a ton of notes on it - but it's draining for me to keep paying attention. I often zone out and forget what she said, and that makes her very angry because she worries her house will end up ruined after I inherit it. This puts a lot of strain between us. 

The other day, the strain boiled over. She was lecturing about microwaves after noticing the one in my apartment was dirty. She was telling me that at her house, I cannot use the big microwave because if it needs to be cleaned, I would need to stand near the oven, and might bump the dials on it and cause a gas leak that would blow up the house. I suggested the microwave be moved to the counter and she got very angry saying the microwave should be left where it is and I am to only cook rice in it so it won't get dirty.

A few minutes later, when I was about to eat a snack, she yelled at me to come back. I was tired of hearing about the microwave and said no and that I was eating. When I was done eating, I asked what she wanted and she told me never to talk to her again because of how disrespectful I was. She's been giving me the silent treatment ever since and makes shooing motions every time I ask to talk about it.

So it gets like this sometimes. I don't know what to do. It's very tiring for both of us. I can't even tell how long she's going to stay angry this time.",29Jan2020,1

468,"Background info - my parents are divorced. Before my mom married my dad, apparently there was this guy who wanted to marry my mom himself but it didn't work out for some reason. Anyway, after my parents divorce, my mom and this guy started to see each other again. I had no clue about this until recently, like a year ago when I went home (I live in a different city due to university) and saw my mom had a black eye. She told me she tripped over and hit the corner of a table but I didn't believe her. I didn't make a scene out of it but looking back at it, I probably should have. Since then and even a few weeks before this incident I noticed an influx of calls my mom received which was very unusual considering that the only people she talks to are her sister, me and my two cousins. So in a way I suspected there's someone she sees but I didn't want to involve myself into her personal life.

A few weeks before this black eye incident when I also went home, I had the usual chat with my mom about my job, my life etc. After a while I overheard some noise coming from her phone and when I rushed to check it, she was in a call with someone so that person was listening to what I was talking to my mom. The signs were there and I was suspicious but I never bothered to ask because frankly I didn't care.

Now, onto it - my cousin (the daughter of my mother's sister) contacted me yesterday and she told me that my mom is seeing this fella. She told me my mom and this man go often in some sort of trips with his car and he's speeding like a maniac (so there's a higher risk of car crash or some shit), he's the one who gave my mom a black eye, and he offered to set up my cousin with a job only to talk shit about her instead. I think this man divorced his actual wife because of my mom which is absolutely terrible as I looked up my mom as a person with very high moral values. Now hearing this has made me lose tons of respect for her. For some reason my mom still stays with him even after he beat her up so I'm suspecting she's afraid of him or something, maybe he threatened my mom with something worse than a beat up if she ever decides to end it. I remember this year I went home for NYE as I had no plans and my mom told me she's leaving just a few hours before the new year which upset me as I spent the whole night alone.

I haven't asked my mom about him yet because my cousin told me that this whole situation supposed to be a secret and I shouldn't hear about it at all so if I start asking questions of course she's gonna suspect that someone told me about it.

I need a plan on how to deal with this situation. I am not sure if I should talk this up right here but I'd give anything to terrorize this little fella a little bit, to make him fear me because I'm sure as shit words will mean fuck all for him. I'd prefer to give him a good slap as revenge for that black eye he gave my mom but I probably won't go that far. Yet.",29Jan2020,1
471,"Hello all.

I am Greg and i am 25 years old Single and still living at my parents house, I live in Europe and i came across house hacking recently found it very interesting and wanted to do it myself,

The only issue is that in my Country the term duplex is very rear and they don't sell very often, So my idea is to build a duplex from scratch (I own the field i will be building in)

And the idea is to Build a duplex and house hack it for some years(Paying the mortgage with the rent of the second house.) My only issue is that i do not have any money saved yet and the down payment for a mortgage here is 20% of the total mortgage is it worth it?

I said yes because I have bills to pay and I thought getting fulltime would be almost immediate. It wasn't. I found out quickly that he had no intention of giving me fulltime and I was unable to go back to my other department. In fact, it seemed like he was doing everything to keep me from getting fulltime (even though I was working harder than his other fulltimers) and was holding it above me. Well about 6 months pass and I managed to force his hand (how is another story that involves me heavily insinuating that I deserved it to his boss's boss). My full-time recommendation went out to the higher ups along with a few other employees recommendations.

Well they just got back the results. I know this because the other employees got full-time. I was only told about it by those employees and one of them said that Bob told him I got fulltime. But Bob didn't tell me. In fact, Bob told me he didn't know if I got fulltime. Which is weird considering he makes my schedule and HAS to know if I got full-time.

So at work we split tips evenly. The managers take this extremely seriously. I work with this 17yo entitled girl who thinks she knows everything and always slacks off, but it usually doesnt bother me too much. But the other night, she spent 20min flirting with a boy who came in the store while we worked, and then spent another HOUR AND A HALF on her phone with her best friend because her best friend broke up with her boyfriend and was crying. During this time, me and another girl had to do all closing duties as well as help about 3 or 4 rushes of customers and clean up the entire store for closing, which is a 3 person job. We were still trying to finish closing way after closing hours because of this. Yet we still had to split tips with the other girl. My managers would not be ok with this at all. But if I tell on her, she will make life so hard on me. She retaliates. And if I tell, she will know it's me who said something.

And i took the advice given by many people in the comments, but my parents told me that if I lived under their roof, I wasn't aloud see any doctors alone until I was 18. And if a doctor asked them to leave, we'd find a different doctor

480,"Ok so it’s 6 am and I’m tired. I hope I can put this out in linear format. I bought my own place a few years back and invited my two best friends to live with me. I had lived alone for a few months and had an extra room. At the time, my best friend Sarah (just moved back here from out of state), just started dating my other really good friend. They lived with his mom and were sleeping on the floor because their house was full.

They moved in and everything was ok for a while. I don’t have any crazy rules. Rinse your dishes, pick up after yourself, basic stuff. I didn’t want rent since I make more money and paid everything already. I figured that when they got to working again, they could help out a little. 

Sarah worked a few part time jobs within walking distance and did so until she got pregnant. Eventually she got fired from her 2 jobs due to Hyperemesis.

Now here’s where it started getting weird. The first thing was that my other friend (the father) couldn’t hold down any kind of work without quitting/getting fired. I got him a few jobs but they just wouldn’t stick. He started shutting down. Any time anyone would try to talk to him, he just became incredibly cynical. Started hinting that she needed to get an abortion. But didn’t want to be a part of it. I don’t judge him for the suggestion. It’s up to them. 

After a grueling pregnancy, a healthy and happy baby girl is born. Everyone loves her. To this day, she’s got 3 sets of grandparents and family showering her with love. But dad still isn’t working. I was asked to be the godparent. From this point on dad just kind of melts. 

Dad and I went to school together. We were good friends, played video games together, went to conventions, etc. but he’s not the same anymore. He started being entitled? Saying we have to take turns on chores, not to spend money on him unless it’s something extra valuable, he doesn’t have to watch the baby if he’s tired, and some really weird messed up stuff along the lines of “don’t bother touching me unless you’re gonna fuck me”.  I always knew he was kinda vain and entitled, but being mad that your SO won’t sleep with you because they have your kid 24/7 is really weird. 

There’s a lot more, but character limits exist.  I just don’t know what to do. I tried talking to him on numerous occasions and Sarah is at the point of wanting to leave him. Having the baby makes it more complicated. What should I do? I don’t want to keep pandering to what seems like an abusive relationship. Sarah and the baby will always have a room here And I miss having both my friends. He’s just so different now.  But I’ve been paying for everything the baby needs and it can’t be that way forever. Sarah has her own money coming in, which I put in savings for her and the baby in case something ever happens to me and they need a nest egg.

I want to feel like I can help him come back to who he was, but idk if this is something I can do or if he truly believes the world owes him. Whatever the case, their daughter can’t grow up thinking it’s normal to spend your life on a friends couch with no goals or hobbies. 

I know this paints a bad picture of him. I know he’s not a bad person. We all have fun sometimes and I know he loves his daughter, but it’s just not normal. 

Should she focus on leaving him? Do I offer an ultimatum to provide for his family or leave? They’re all family to me. But I have to look out for Sarah and the baby first.  Now I gotta lay down and stop stressing myself out. Thanks in advance for any help.",29Jan2020,1
481,"Hey. For a little context, we are both 20 year old men. 
   The relationship started off and continued to be extremely well in terms of attraction and we both had grown exponentially in the course of the relationship as well as forming strong attachments to each other. But I always feel misunderstood by him- I had my interests in a bunch of “nerdy” media and a fixation on the gym and eating healthy, and he had his own array of nerdy interests and the refusal to eat right or improve himself. The latter has always annoyed me because I always found it hard to fathom just seeing yourself and being uncomfortable with what you see, yet still go and make it worse. I’m not saying that there’s something ugly with being overweight/obese, but I’m saying that if you really do feel bad then take action to change it through either building your own confidence through meditation/conditioning or media as an outlet OR change how you look. 
I fell out of love because not only do I feel alone, any spark and passion is now whittled away because of our pessimism and opposing perspectives on ourselves. The spark and the interest is gone, he isn’t sexually attractive to me anymore, and I’ve started making scenarios in my head to figure out how to breakup with him


I didn’t mean to ramble I’m sorry, and this may have been more to rant than to actually have advice, but what should I do in this situation honestly? I want to leave but I also feel like I shouldn’t, that maybe this is fixable, but at what and who’s cost? I just want him to show some excitement in improving himself, similar to the excitement he gets when I go to the gym or take protein. What would you all do or what have you done in this situation?

483,"I’m 18. I moved out of my moms house for about six months but my anxiety was getting so bad I couldn’t even leave my apartment. Then I started feeling unsafe around this older male which made it worse so I decided to move back in to my moms. I hate it here.

I just feel like she’s over the top with too much stuff. It’s annoying. One, ever since I was a kid I’ve never liked being touched. I dont know why, I just like my space and when someone touching me my first instinct is like no, please don’t do that. I really don’t like it and my entirely family knows this. However, I know that my mom is bothered by this so I’ve been trying to be more accepting of affection. But that doesn’t mean I want to be touched alllll the time. The other day in the car she touched me and I kindly said “I don’t want to be touched right now”. She started yelling and got upset. I’ve literally been letting her give me hugs and kisses which honestly take a lot for me. So like, are you kidding me? And the things is this is nothing new. I’ve been this way for years. 

Also, she keeps the house fucking cold. And it’s even colder for me because I’m sleeping in the basement. She keeps the house at 58 fricking degrees. I might as well be sleeping outside. So most nights I’ll just sleep in my 9 year old sisters bed which shouldn’t be a problem because 1) my sister loves it 2) she ends up sleeping with my mom most of the time anyway 3) it’s friggin warmer in her room but nooooo my mom gets mad about it. I don’t understand what she’s mad about when it doesn’t affect her AT all. It’s selfish. At least turn the damn AC up. I’ll go to sleep with sweatpants and a sweatshirt on and STILL be freezing. That makes no sense. Today she woke me up (in my sisters room) and said “you think i’m playing with you, go downstairs to your room”. To me, it’s not the serious. 

I shouldn’t have moved back home. It was a mistake. But it just felt like my anxiety was getting crippling when I was on my own and i had no one. And then at my moms house I never know what mood she’s going to be in which is annoying.

485,"Hey everyone I'm just gonna get right to it!  


(I am 31/m in Flo\~Rida. Not sure how or who that could help.)

So I've been with my partner since I was out of highschool and even a year in highschool. (10 years or so.) Got hit with severe crohns/diabetes/anxiety and depression all within a few years. Probably in that order but reversed. As I got over the diabetes and anxiety/panic attacks, Crohns hit and I pretty much went full disabled.   


I lost 100lbs in nearly 2 months and was bed-bound for almost 2 years. I got the bag and my colon removed (entirely) - all that remains is subject for removal in the future without a doubt. Currently I am on cannabis, regulated to help with the inflammation. It does, I have no need of prednisone or other steroids. I don't take enough to be 'high' but I do feel a calm. I've been on HEAVY narcotics through my illness because of the 24/7 endless pain. I mean endless- I got off of Fetanyl patches, percoset, dilaudid, ativan and antibiotics which were cycled constantly for a good period of time. Prednisone has been the most common factor of all this. It's taken it's toll on me but as I progressed to getting better, my partner decided to drop me off at my mothers, who is married to an addict that can't see beyond his nose in narcissism.   


I had surgery in may, 2019 and am finally up and moving about. No, i'm not 100% but I do feel I could work even part time. As I changed my diet (with an ileus, it's hard, as it's not large like a colostomy) from meat-heavy to plant based (Lots and LOTS of softening. Curries help a great deal + pressure cooker) I started feeling more energy.   


I have nothing to my name, not a car or anything. Just my animal companion.  I wanted to get a CDL license (and of course working on progressing to a different medication in the meantime from cannabis as needed.) but there's no one near where I'm at that does training. I've been denied disability EVERY SINGLE time I've applied. Now I'm no longer even able to, I don't believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no friends or family that will be able to help if something happens and I need to leave. And it just might, considering if the man my mother married (said addict mentioned above) touches my animal again, things will happen not in their favor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out of it for so long that I almost don't even know how to start. I'm applying for anything I believe I can physically do but min. wage isn't going to cut it. I am still applying for them regardless, make no mistake. But then there's the traveling issue and with almost no funding beyond food and medications (from another) I'm out of options that I'm aware of.

Then he decided to move closer to me! But so far he has had trouble finding his own place, he isn't ready to move in together yet considering most of our relastionship has been spent far away. 
So he has been staying with us rent free for a bit. He helps pay bills, buys groceries and helps however else. Doing half the cleaning.
Housemate says its all good no worries.
But the downside.
Since my bf has been here hm has decided not to lift a finger.
Always expect me to cook for him and complains when I don't.  Whenever I'm cooking he'll come  make sure a plates for him. Other than that he never leaves the  room, doesn't help wash the dishes, leaves plates and cups everywhere, won't clean the toilet/bathroom.
My bf and I have been doing all the work, but he got super sick recently and has been bed ridden. And now all the work is up to me.
So i asked my hm to do the dishes one night after cooking and he was like sure, then goes to his room and doesn't come back out till the next day (midday) when ive decided just to do them myself, he comes out while im doing it grabs a cup and pours a drink. Goes again.
I finish the dishes and go for a quick drive to grab some medicine for the bf. When I get back the sink is full again with dishes hm must have collected in his room. Full.
I was so annoyed but decided to wash them anyway.
He never takes out any bins, never removes spoiled food from the fridge, eats everyone elses food. I once got  bf chocolates for a gift and hm ate them all.... its so many things.

I’ve always been kind of a crutch for her to lean on, I’ve driven to her house at 1 in the morning to just sit with her and talk so she’s not alone (she lives with her dad but he’s always out partying at night.) She was physically abused by her mom growing up and it’s led to a lot of abandonment issues and emotional trauma that I can’t fix but I have tried to be a constant positive presence in her life and have tried to love her well and show her she deserves love and respect and I’ve also tried to push her to get help, which she says “she’s not ready for.” 

Recently she’s been saying things like “thank you for trying” and “I don’t want help,” which have scared me to death. I am in another country for a study abroad program and so I can’t be there for her, she also self sabotages a lot so most other friendships she had she has lost, so I’m pretty much the only one who is there for her at all. What complicates things further is that she is very much in love with me and tells me all the time. I met someone else recently and just told S about it and it crushed her because she was still holding out hope that she could be with me (even though I told her very explicitly I was not interested in having that kind of relationship with her). I am not sure if this is the kind of thing that could push her over the edge but I’m scared.

I am a huge fan of an artist and lurked for two years until about a month ago when I decided to make fan friends/be active in the community.

I balance media posts with text posts and share novel content in addition to retweeting. I gradually followed 221 accounts and have only gotten 18 followers back. A half-dozen tweets that I have made that have been found and retweeted by bigger fan accounts get 20-50 likes and sometimes other retweets. None of those people ever follow me though.

498,"First of all I don't even know which subreddit this should be posted, so I tried here.

I'm 22 y/o and I have OCD &amp; depression, and I sometimes ejaculate while I'm sleeping. Waking myself in sperm grosses me a lot and I can spend the next 2 or 3 days taking 3 showers a day trying to clean myself 100% and so tired and not wanting to do absolutely nothing.

I really want to travel, but the chance of that happening scares me a lot. The chance of it happening highly increases when I think about porn or think about past experiencies, but the more I try no not think of that, my head remembers me about that, so that's why I don't want to masturbate or think about lewd things or anything, I think this is because my OCD.

Because of this I have to use my pillows in a way the blanket isn't in contact with that zone so I don't stain it, also always sleeping without pants. Stained clothes makes me wanna instantly throw them, which I've done that with some underwear.

Obviously this can also happens when I don't think of anything related at all, that's what I'm most scared of.

What do you think I could do? Did someone have a similar experience?",29Jan2020,1

I work in an IT team of 4, one of the guys is kinda upsetting me. He never asks how I am in the mornings, he hardly ever speaks to me but when he does it's very direct, ""Such and such just phoned, it's not right get it sorted"" it's like passive aggressive almost. There was something wrong with a user the other day, he didn't tell me he sent it too me in an email, he sits opposite me too. I'm not sure if I'm being to soft or he's being passive aggressive?

We were supposed to hang out about a week after we met, but she had to go on vacation up north, so she had to cancel. Ik red flag, but she did actually go she was sending me live pictures and videos of where she was (about 6 hours away from where we live). 

The day she came back was the morning of her returning to her dorm because school started the next day, so we couldn’t hang out that day.

Anyways, i’ve caught strong feelings for her. I ended up confessing my feelings for her like twice, both times she said some variation of “I don’t allow myself to get attached because i end up getting hurt and i don’t like relying on people.” Anyways so i already know she’s either letting me down nicely, or isn’t ready for a relationship. She’s also never reciprocated the flirting, or acknowledged my flirting. 

She’s basically my dream girl. Everything from looks, to her interests, to her major/career path being the same as mine. I know she’s not perfect but she’s the closest thing to it in my eyes, and that’s why i don’t want to/can’t move on.

She also supports me a lot, from convincing me to not drop out, even though i’m doing super poor in a major that i can’t fall behind in, to trying to help me with my insomnia problems.

Warehouses aren’t hiring right bow because peak just ended so i’m screwed on that front as they’re the only ones with hours and pay.

I am employed stocking shelves at a local grocery store but they just cut allll my hours this week and last, and here’s the real problem:

so i took the first opportunity i could get and moved in with this guy

for the last 4 months he has taken 90% of the money i’ve earned and made me pay 80% of the expenses for this house so he can live large on my dime

now i just found out he ended the lease and i have 2 days to get out! i can get a storage unit for my stuff but i have 2 cats that i am very attached to and it’s so cold if i put them on a farm they’ll die. 

nobody i know needs a roommate and i can’t afford to have my own place

i need a new job but my phone is shut off because of my leach roommate 

i guess i’m going to stay in my car but it’s uninspected and uninsured because i’ve had no money since i came back to PA thanks to roommate 

I can’t even get my tax return because i have no family i could have it sent to

Him and the other IT (my new supervisor) were talking and they  suggested I apply for the position.

523,"I'm currently sitting at my desk seething because of something my coworker just did and I'm at a total loss as to how to approach this in a professional, friendly way.

I just started at a new company 2 months ago.  It's a young, small company that has no real SOP's in place, pretty much all of the administrative team is brand new and it's not totally clear where responsibility lies.  Despite this, I think things have started to come together and we all work well together.  My coworker that I'm writing this post about, has been here a little longer than the rest of us - she started in September.  She was trained by her predecessor and by far has the most knowledge of the business out of all of us, but she was inundated with work so myself and another administrative person were hired back in November.  Our manager made it clear to us that we would all share the responsibility equally once we had a handle on what we were doing.  That time has come and gone, and I still feel like I'm going through this coworker for everything, despite efforts to assert myself in certain projects.  For example, I was given this one project to work on, clean up, make my own.  Recently the owner of the company changed his expectations of this project and it's going to require a lot more hours and creativity to figure it out.  Despite this very clearly being my project, my coworker keeps butting in and trying to fix it on her own.  Now, I do not mind working with her on this, but I'm counting on a big win with this to make a good first impression at this company, and it feels like she's undermining my efforts by working on this solo without my input.  This is just one of the many examples - she's constantly listening in on my phone or in person conversations.  Just now, the reason I decided to make this post - we are all assigned to sales reps, and mine came in this morning asking a question.  As usual, she was listening in, which to be honest I don't mind most of the time because I don't have an answer to every question, having only worked in this field for 2 months, but today she didn't even give me a chance to try and answer the question for my rep, she just pulled him over to her desk.  Didn't include me in it, so if it was something I couldn't answer that I would learn.  It's like pulling teeth to get her to give up any responsibilities - it's like she has to be the one to do everything.  

She works really hard, and I respect the hell out of her, which makes this so tough for me.  I consider her a friend at this point - we get along really well, and I have kept my feelings and emotions regarding this stuff very well hidden.  She's good at her job, but she's a little scatterbrained and I think that part of the reason myself and the other person were hired was to clean things up a bit, as we are both very left brained.  It's getting there - but I keep feeling pushed to the side, and I can feel the frustration starting to bubble.  This woman has had my back on a number of occasions as well and the last thing I want to do is alienate her from me or make her feel like I don't appreciate the things she does for me.

525,"
About eight months ago I met a 30 yo woman online, through reading a (bdsm) themed story she wrote. We hit off and became great friends, soon we figured out our kinks matched rather well.

Thing is, I was a virgin with no sexual experience whatsoever, who at first was intent on keeping my submissive self hidden. I was going to travel to her (she lives on the other side of the world) and it was supposed to be platonic. However, after a month or 2 she told me that ""if it depended on her she would not let me bury my sub self."" Because ""I want you"".

She promised me she would take good care of me. She has had multiple submissive before and was active in the scene in her country, showing pictures of her at bdsm parties. She has a husband (open relationship) so I trusted her to have valid experience. 

Once I was there things didn't go as I had hoped. Before we had sex for the first time, she did not discuss *anything* regarding the scene with me. Mentioned only some general stuff which she did reluctantly because ""I need your consent"". But other than that not discussing the scene.

It was a rather intense play. Especially considering I was still a virgin before all this. It involved me being blind almost the entire day, being covered in candle wax, flogged, choked and spanked. Aside from the being blind thing (which was my idea, but it was not meant to be used during sex), she had not mentioned the other activities at all.

Anyway, that in itself went good. I loved it. She kept checking in with me to ask for my safeword so I thought she must be the most responsible person ever. But afterwards, I was left alone, blind, on the couch for an hour. And as everything started to settle down I felt absolutely miserable. 

She did not mention anything we had done, she acted like it had never happened and gave me no aftercare. I felt horribly insecure, just normal things.

Eventually I did ask her some questions, attempting to communicate with her about what happened. (""Did I look okay?"" ""Did i do okay?"") But she was really, really dismissive and I gave up.

When I flew back to my own country, knowing I would never see her again, I thought I would just have to live with it. Never mention it. But I couldnt, as this experience had shaped the way I viewed sex to such a degree that it made me feel like a bad person. Somehow, in all of this, I felt as if me needing reassurance, made me a bad person? 

So nearly a week ago I wrote her a letter, as we still talked daily, it was a rather long one. Explaining how I had felt. That I wasn't angry, or hated her or felt like she had crossed any boundaries. But that the lack of communication and aftercare had hurt me. That she didn't really need to respond to this, but that I really wanted her to listen, so I could let it go hopefully.

She responded instead with saying that she really couldn't do this right now and needed time.

That hurt. It was my second time trying to reach out to her, but she rejected me completely. But it also made me feel even more guilty. If someone says that they need time, that means that you did a bad thing, right? I did a bad thing, I never should have expressed how I felt about this. 


On one hand I feel like this is all to blame on me, I should have done better, and I shouldn't have made her feel bad by telling her how I feel! On the other hand my mind is clouded with doubt, I posted it on another subreddit (where it got removed) and a lot of people said she is doing the wrong here. Since she is 30 and has experience and shouldnt have done this without discussing the scene beforehand. And to some degree I agree with that, I tried talking to her and it didn't work, where she should take responsibility. 

My mind is just going all over the place. Is it bad to express your feelings about this? I cant really talk about this with anyone so I am just kind of... stuck.. not knowing what to do.

Just to be clear: she is not my dominant. When we met she *wanted* to be, but I said no as I didn't think I have enough experience with normal relationships to get into a d/s relationship straight away. She is however my friend, no romantic feelings involved.

I need advice on how to deal with this situation and what you guys think of this. I am just so confused. In my past I have been gaslighted and this makes it extremely difficult for me to trust my own judgement. since it has now been nearly 2 weeks without a word from her I am not even sure if I want to continue to be friends..

So I’ve always been brought up to be Christian but I don’t think I am I know I’m still kinda young but I don’t believe someone made us. I don’t exactly know how we came onto the planet but we did somehow. Their is just some stuff in the Bible I can’t believe it’s hard for me to.

528,"I have apeirophobia. Fear of infinity. This is a weird fear, but this thing has constantly bothered my life and would be triggered any moment. Just looking at the sky would trigger me.

Even knowing that there are infinite numbers trigger me. Because of this, I've had panic attacks and would run to the bathroom to cry. I don't run to my own room since I share with it with my siblings. I know I could've just talked to them about it, but I'm an atheist and their Christians and they wouldn't understand what I'm trying to tell them.

Even if they did, I don't want them to have a revelation that life has no meaning and no matter how many sun's or stars or burn out, the universe would continue on infinitely. Nothing matters.

It's also an existential crisis. I'd find the world blank. Nothing. It's a sad reality. I would try walking but even so, would trigger both. I tried socializing but sometimes, I would just think that, in the blink of an eye, we'd be dead anyways so what's the point?

I read books, but even so, would still be triggered at some parts. I want to aks my parents for help, but then I'd just be burdening them more when they're already having financial problems. Because of this, I'm always exhausted and have a hard time helping with my mom's business.

If I could, I'd ask them to take me to a psychologist but we don't have the financial stability to do so. I'm always psychologically exhausted. And then that earns me yelling from my mom how I'm an ungrateful child.

I would look at meme, and other funny videos. But like I said, I can be triggered any moment. I feel like I've lost touch with reality. And would cry sometimes.

I can't afford to see a psychology, neither would I want to burden my family about it anyways. So, I'm just asking you guys on ways to keep myself distracted of this fear. Because if I don't, I might end up just doing self harm.

To be honest, I already harm myself, but not the slicing my wrist or any part of my body type. I know that would alert my parents that something's  wrong with me.

I would just slap myself really hard, or pinch myself. If anyone saw, I'd laugh it off, telling them I'm trying to keep myself from ""dozing off"".

TL;DR of it is that, I just want ways to distract myself from overthinking. My fear has been problematic for quite some time now.",29Jan2020,1
529,"Basically my mother tries to trigger it and then attack me for it saying it’s unrational and does it in front of me to trigger it.   

Like one time she was baking cake.  The frosting was a bit hard and is head of melting it a bit in the fridge or other stuff she grabbed a handful of frosting without gloves and began to smear the frosting on the cake.  She then had licked her fingers and without re washing her hands, she began to smear her spit laden  hand all over the cake.  I didn’t eat cake that day.  I told her that was gross and she should have washed her hands after.  I refuse to eat anything unless I know people followed sanitary standards correctly.   

A second incident she just used my hairbrush to brush her hair.  She’s a woman, there are plenty of brushes and she could have used my older sister’s brush.  I had walked in around the same time I wake up as if she was doing it on purpose.  I asked her to not use my brush because since elementary school you’re taught not to share brushes or lip balms etc.  

Often times when I’m waiting for the food to be done she put her mouth on the spoon and then put the spoon back in the food.  It’s gross.  Trying the food is okay but use a small spoon and try it and then put away.  It doesn’t take 5 seconds to rinse it off with at least soap.  

Whenever I call her off for doing this on purpose she attacks me for being irrational. 

This disorder doesn’t affect me at restaurants or outside the house.  I just don’t want to eat food people have touched when I don’t know if they washed their hands or if they bit off the food and hand it to me.",29Jan2020,1

532,"TW: abuse, rape. 

I’m sorry I don’t know if this is the right place to put this and as you’ll read I’m sure you’ll understand I’m not in the best mental place so if you could keep things neutral or positive I’d appreciate it. 

So over this last week I have been mentally drained and unhinged. I have had night terrors about my rapist and intrusive thoughts about it and him, I keep having almost like memories that just pop up and I don’t know how to explain it maybe the best way but it all started when a close friend of mine grabbed my arm in a very angry way. 

I know that sounds awfully dumb but you know how when someone is behind you and they grab your arm to turn you around or get your attention? My abuser did that but instead of getting my attention it was to squeeze my arm or pinch and scratch me to keep me quiet around people. So when my friend did it, the memory of my attacker doing it to me popped up in my head and ever since it has just been kind of lingering in the back of my mind. 

I don’t talk about it because from past experience people either don’t listen, don’t care or think I’m lying. It took years to find someone that I can even talk about what happened and even then I feel like I can’t talk because no one cares about what happened to me 9 years ago. They probably think I should get over it by now.. It’s embarrassing that it still bothers me. That someone grabbing my arm put me in such a panic its still bothering me. 

How am I supposed to tell them that I don’t like it or that it triggers me? Is it even a trigger ? I don’t know. How do I bring that up even. I don’t like talking about it. 

For background or understanding :  I was sexually assaulted. Raped, molested etc. from 7 to about 13 maybe 14. I never said a word until I was 17. My mom said it wasn’t my abusers fault as he had been molested as a baby, and her and the therapist said it was also my fault for not speaking up especially if he had hurt someone else since what’s all happened to me. It ended up dividing my family and no one really talks to me anymore.    Also I’ll check for grammar later but I apologize for mistakes. I’m tired.",29Jan2020,1

I have only a few units left before I am considered as a graduating student, but I feel like its not even worth it even if I graduated, since I mostly half-assed almost all of my courses maybe except for some, but somehow reached this far and the most shocking thing the school I am studying is quartersem, so time is shorter and it is also considered a hard school in my country and I also suck on some basic skills needed as an IT students which is programming since I can't even do a very basic program that is not ""Hello World"" without a guide.

536,"I know this sounds cliché and maybe it has to do with the fact I’m still in high school. But I used to have almost no friends, until I got some really good friends in summer 2018. They were all poor and many of them were thugs, I got into a bunch of fights and all that stuff (never started anything though) but most of the time it was very fun. I was also  proud of the fact that I had friends like this, and not some sheltered “weaklings” with boring lives (I don’t think of people like this anymore, but back then I did)

Then about a year later I suddenly felt like I don’t really fit into this circle at all, they were fun and all but I’m more of a smart, somewhat nerdy kid, I go to a good school while most of those people were dealing drugs. They were nice to me and I was thankful for the good times with them but I felt like if I keep hanging out with these people they’re just holding me back and getting me into trouble, plus it kinda sucks when you can’t talk with your friends about the topics you’re interested in because they’re too uneducated to understand them

Thing is, since then I haven’t gotten any new friends. I have some things in common with the other kids at my school but at the time I still feel like they’re from another world. It’s just so boring, nobody does anything risky, a few of them are boasting about how they’re dealing drugs now and have “thugs” behind them which annoys the fuck out of me because it’s probably not true and even if it was, it’s not anything special to boast about. Sometimes when they disrespect me I feel like calling my old friends and telling them to kick those people’s teeth in but then again I want to be a civilized person and not respond to violence over petty stuff like that
Their humor is garbage too, my old friends were way funnier and more entertaining. But at the same time I’m like 90% sure I shouldn’t go back to them

I mean, I could become friends with the people at my school pretty quickly if I wanted to. And I could become friends with my old friends too. But I feel like both worlds are trash in a way. I wish I had a group of friends that was smart AND had this “hood” type of attitude and humor",29Jan2020,1
537,"Hey all, 

I'm a little uncertain about how to approach one of my colleagues who seems to be struggling quite a bit. We work in the tech industry and part of my role is to review the reports written by my colleagues before they're sent out. 

There's a steep learning curve in what we do, so messing up early on is not unexpected. I had to fully redo a couple of his first reports and I didn't really think twice. But, he's now been here several months and he's still missing a lot. He uses our default wording for a lot of things in the reports, and while this is acceptable, the context in which it is used indicates to me that he doesn't really understand what it means. I'm starting to get a bit concerned, as writing these reports is the central part of his job.

What should I do? I've provided him with feedback after each report. I've also mentioned my concerns to a line manager. He wasn't terribly interested and I didn't push. I could elevate our boss, but I'm a little concerned about the possible fallout. The guy is still on probation. I don't want to be responsible for him getting laid off.",29Jan2020,1

542,"I’ve had this best friend since 3rd grade (G) and I thought we could last forever. We were always so connected somehow until this girl (J) transferred to my school when we were in 5th grade, they became best friends in an instant, inseparable, that made me feel very much left out. Whenever I would talk to G when she was with J, it’s like one-sided. I decided I would just hold on whenever J isn’t there. They both moved after 6th grade to the same school and they did more than whatever I and J had done, it made me jealous. From grade 7th onwards, I kept in touch with G online, we would do things online together, playing games and chatting, all that. But, when we hang out in real life, she was constantly on her phone with J, it hurt a bit because I thought I could finally be her best friend. I ended my friendship with her 3 times over the course of this one month because she was constantly being rude, being toxic to me with this guy whatever. I have anger issues and I get overwhelmed easily so I believe my emotions got me and caused me to unexpectedly end the friendship forever. That day was near to our 7 year friendship anniversary. I literally cut off contact with her in means of barely talking to her at all except on her birthday. I thought I would be fine without her but then until now, I’m struggling if I could relive our moments/friendship. She was always like my other half but I’m just bummed out about how she treated me during those years. She told our other friend who told me that she was willing to become my friend again but that is if I wanted to. I don’t know what to do, I miss her sometimes but I get so angry because of how unfair she treated me, it’s like she’s so stuck up to J(I don’t have anything against J). She said she’s nothing without J, who helped her through thick and thin. I’m sorry, I’m just pissed at her so much, I wonder if she has ever thought of what I’ve been through and how much I’ve also helped her when she struggled but when I’m in some hole, she just doesn’t do the same.

543,"I'm in the final year of British Highschool, so I'm a few months everyone is leaving to universities and colleges.
The way the school works, you don't need to stay in school after Year 4 of highschool, when you're 16, but most people stay until Year 5 and 6.
In Year 5 you have the option of buying the yearbook for the Year 6's since as some people leave, both Year 5 and 6 are featured in it.
So a year ago, a friend of mine bought a yearbook. She sits with her friendgroup and I have my own friendgroup, but I'm that guy who's welcome in both. 

So as it happens, as a joke she and her friends wrote mock-captions under everyone's names. Some were offensive, some were funny. 
But she fell out with someone and yesterday they leaked it to the rest of the year, and now the 'ned' kids who think they year revolves around them (you know the ones, the ones who are failing every subject, who go around the back to smoke pot etc), are offended.
Well, they guys think it's funny and want to know what ass written about everyone else, the girls are fuming. And to be fair, they have every right to be upset.
But they don't have a right to witch-hunt my friend. They went around sharing her address and making jokes that they should jump her house, or throw eggs at it. That hasn't happened yet, but it's not uncommon for them. Apart from that, they've been calling her a goth, telling her no one likes her, and printing pictures of her and her friends to stick around the school (which everyone else tears down because it isn't funny).
She accepts what she did a year ago was wrong, but her and her group are the quiet kids group. They cave under confrontation, who are prone to panic-attacks or stress, who've never really been in a fight and who dislike most of the school. So when at lunch today the group came over and starting yelling abuse at her neither her not her friends could get a word in.
They've also been tossing stuff at them.

So my friend in question, she's spoken to a teacher but doesn't want to show she's ""retaliating"" against the other mean girls-esque group. I told her it's alright, but I can understand her reasoning. I'm not opposed to taking it to the campus police, or to the student care teachers, and she said she'd appreciate not being the one to do it but doesn't know.",29Jan2020,1

I started working recently in a start-up as a team leader where I manage 10 high-skilled engineers, before new year, chairman approached me offering me and my team a salary raise (180000 a year for my case).  

It wasn't a contract, but a sort of communique with my name , my salary for 2020 and his signature.  

Then he asked me to wait for the contract. Today, my superior approached me, telling me that CEO and other higher management people didn't agree with the chairman's offer, apologized for the mistake and asked me if they can lower my salary , and switch to a yearly contract me and my team.   
 

This is weird, I'm kind of disappointed in all this process, having to announce it to my team.  

I am expecting a lot of questions from my team, and later at night, another coworker from another department approached me, he was worries because he had to choose between 2 percent raise or bigger raise, expect that the big raise come with a yearly contract.  

How does it work in big companies, who should be aware of salary ?  I feel like high management people lack confidence in the future of the company and they want to protect themselves like this ...

559,"I  (F20) met my girlfriend (F24)  1,5 years ago while I was on vacation in her country close to her city. We got along very well and decided to stay in contact as friends, but after a while we fell for each other and decided to try a relationship despite living in different countries (4 hour plane ride). I thought that it could work, it's not really that long of a distance and I do consider myself very patient. We have now been in a relationship for about 14 months. 

However, we have a problem called ""her parents"". She still lives with her them and it will probably  take at least 1-2 years until she's able to move out. Neither her or mine parents are aware that we are more than friends, but they're very controlling and sometimes even mentally abusive towards her. I'd say they treat her like she's 12. They're not completely terrible people, but they do things that definitely aren't okay and can leave deep emotional scars. 

I'll give just a few examples so that you can understand her situation. Even though they can't really force her to follow every rule, breaking them will always result in even more controlling behavior, abusive comments and punishments. So, let's begin with the examples. 

* She's not allowed to stay out longer than to 11 pm and not allowed to sleep in other people's houses.
* She's constantly told weight-related things like ""you're too fat"", ""you need to lose more weight"","" I can't even look at you"", ""they're gonna laugh at your body"" etc from her mom. She told me that her mom cried once when she saw my girlfriend's body on the beach because she looked ""disgusting"", and another time she started crying just because my girlfriend initially said no to exercising with her.  Sometimes during dinner when my girlfriend is hungry and wants more food, her mom will literally take away the food from her plate. My GF has an eating disorder that's obviously constantly fueled by her mom's comments, so recovering seems impossible even though she's in therapy. 
* She's told that she's not working hard enough (studies), that they can't see anything good in her and that it's her fault of they treat her. As a result of this (and a lot of bullying from growing up I guess) she has no confidence and a terribly low self esteem. She thinks she's worthless and that everything is always her fault. 
* She is finished with her main studies but has been taking a single course since last year that involves a pretty big written assignment. Her parents told her that she's not allowed to travel anywhere unless she's finished with both courses the big project. When she failed once (she had a chance to present it but didn't make it the first time, which most people don't), her parents punished her by taking away her phone for one month except for 2 hours during the evening and then controlling her A LOT for like 2 months. She was literally not allowed to do anything else than working on this assignment for almost the whole summer, and when she wasn't working her mom forced her to exercise a lot. 

That's a few of the things her parents do. This is obviously causing both her and our relationship a lot of problems. First of all, it's literally making her very depressed and worsening her eating disorder. She wants to move out but can't afford it yet. I'm doing my best to support her, but it's hard. I see her suffer and can't do anything about it. I've offered to pay for even more therapy if she can't always afford it, but the problem is that therapy won't change everything as she still lives with her problems every day. 

Now I'll explain the nr 1 reason this causes problems for us as a couple: We can't meet because of them. We don't live that far away from each other and we both have flexible working schedules, so potentially we could meet pretty often. But we always have to sneak around and plan our visits around her parents vacation plans (which they often keep a secret until THE DAY THEY'RE TRAVELING!). Last time I visited her, I took a pretty big risk and went on the flight even though we weren't 100% sure if her if her parents were going away or not. I had a hotel room booked just in case. This also means that we've never been able to see each other for more than like 5 days in a row. And because of her studies, she's not allowed to travel to go visiting me until she's finished (which will not be earlier than June this year, maybe even later!). 

It's getting so tiresome. Living in a different country than your significant other is hard enough even without controlling parents. I mean... We usually don't know until the same day if they're gonna go away for the week or not. We can only see each other very rarely and for short amounts of time because of them. Even if I stayed at a hotel and they knew I came to visit, they would decide when she's allowed to leave the house, she would have to be home for lunch and she'd have to be home at 11 pm. And of course, she wouldn't be allowed to sleep at my hotel and I wouldn't be allowed to sleep in their house. She says that they're being extra controlling because of her studies and that things will calm down when she's done, but I'm honestly afraid that they will find another excuse once her assignment is finished and that it will always be like this for us.

I know that If we want to have a future and live together, we will have to spend more time together than just 5-7 days. Moving abroad to be together without knowing if you really work together during longer periods of time and in the same household is such a terrible idea. I don't know how we're supposed to make progress in our relationship when her parents are like this. I mean, we could have spent weeks together this summer, but instead we didn't even meet once. 

I really really love her, but the behavior of her parents are getting on MY NERVES. It feels like we're 14 years old in a secret relationship or something. I absolutely don't want to leave her and I know it's not her fault that her parents are like this.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Maybe not, I get that this is a complicated situation. But any comment is appreciated.",29Jan2020,1
560,"i have a boyfriend and honestly i like him a lot, i have been waiting to be with him fo rover 2 years, the thing is recently i had a friend of mine say he likes me. Weve been friends since 7th grade. Me and my boyfriend broke up and the guy that likes me lets call him max, he didn't know about my boyfriend lets call him jim. Max and I would talk everyday over facetime him not knownig i was going through a break up. I decide what if me and max hing out? We end up hanging out and watched netflix. I think you know were this is going. We kissed, and i loved it. idk why i felt like that, we made out and all that he made me feel safe. I wasn't using him because i missed Jim. Jim didn't know what happened even up until know. Max and Jim kind of know each other expect me and max are in 8th and Jim is a freshman. After a few weeks go by me and max hungout again at the ovies we made out we hugged all that cheesy shit. When i got home i decided its best if i don't talk to max because i still felt bad about not telling him about Jim. Next thing you know we stopped talking out of knowere, sucked since we barley talked at school. I wasn't that hut but i felt like i was losing my best friend. Me and Jim kept talking , months go by and me max end up getting back together. We then took a break because we fought about something idk. When that happened I was like listen it's not gonna work out between the two of us, i was so lost in my feelings i called max, him still not knowning about me and Jim.I confessed i liked him but i wasn't ready to date but i wanted him to know that i hoped he could forgive me for it. He said he would call me back he wanted to think about it. Weeks go by and we don't talk, he avoids me even more then before, in that time frame i was over it and got back together with Jim. Some weeks go by and i stopped thinking about max i was like whatever hes ignoring i don't need him, Until he texts me saying hey listen i dont want ot lose you but i feel like you desrve better and we just be friends, thats basically the gist. Cool were friends now and nothing has happeneded since then. We went back to how things were, we talk at school and im with JIm (again max dosen't know) The thing is i miss Max alot but at the same time i like Jim so much, were not perfect but i haave no idea what to do.

Yes. So the girl danced for me. Touched my private parts, got as close as possible to me but I just didnt feel anything towards her. I wasnt turned on. 
In fact, I am bisexual and I am interested in someone else. I kept thinking of my crush all the time. At some point I thought maybe if I could imagine my crush in this scenario perhaps I would be at least turned on. But it didnt work. The girl was just not pretty at all. I couldnt even dance properly with her. She would push against my private parts and I would move away.  I didnt feel comfortable at all.

578,"Hello Reddit, I need your help here.

I've just received my payslip containing my Christmas Bonus pay from some seasonal work I did last year.

The pay information on the payslip is correct for the bonus, the bonus amount is correct and the deductions for tax and NI are correct.

However, it looks like payroll have used an old payslip and just popped the bonus pay into it.

The pay was made yesterday (28th January) and the date on the payslip says it was paid on the 6th of December. 
This therefore makes the payslips issued from the 6th of December onwards incorrect as the Year To Date (YTD) data has changed.

Do I have a legal right to a correct payslip? 
I've got 6years of payslips recorded, the timeline up to this point is correct, it's really bugging me and before I write a wordy email to payroll I'd like to have my facts correct.


The real issue here is that I've moved to a new property and need three months of payslips at this address for certain applications. This final payslip dated before my others means my pay period at this address has been shortened which gives me issues further down the line.",29Jan2020,1
579,"This is sort of on a different level. I used to date this guy way older than me when I was 19. I'm not really comfortable saying how much older, but it was up there. Needless to say, I learned there was a reason for that, and he also had a findom addiction. This guy would lie like it was his job, and was really convincing at it. 3 year cycle of mind fucking me into thinking he'd stop cheating, only for it to start again, and usually once I found out, I found out it happened immediately after he said he'd stop. So basically he never really stopped, and he'd eventually leave clues around so I would find out and be hurt. Then he'd somehow convince me he'd really stop that time, even going to therapy once. (yes one whole time) It was really shitty and I should've left him quickly, but I didn't.  


Eventually though, I did! We had to move, and I figured it was a great time to be like, you know what, I'm just going to struggle and move on my own instead of being trapped in this shit anymore, peace! Within a few months he actually moved like 4 states away with some woman. This woman had a whole family of kids, and knowing what I knew about him I absolutely thought it'd be in her best interest to let her know what she was getting into so when she saw the patterns she'd see it for what it was. Well that didn't go well whatsoever, and between whatever story he spun her on his own and what I said, she essentially didn't believe me.   


Then he started messaging me. With the findom thing, he'd essentially shit talk whoever he was with to random girls on the internet, also promising to give them money, but most of the time not even following through, apparently just getting off on the process of talking about it?!? (so not even appreciated in that community either). So I showed her, like, look this is legit, he's literally trying to do this. So at that point she blocked me. You'd think this would go on for a couple months maybe and then fade into nothingness? Oh no. This guy like I said is on another level.  


In the beginning it was every couple weeks, now it's about every 5 or 6 months, but I haven't but with this guy in 7 years. It'll be a message request on FB, luckily the only thing he has any access to. I need it for work group chats and family, so I'm stuck with it. Years ago I changed my FB and he followed, so changing the account won't work either. I've tried ignoring him for year long stretches. I've tried explaining he's harassing me and to stop. I've threatened him with cops, but have no real clue on how to follow through with that, because it's not constant, it's like a hi message on a new profile every few months. I've tried making him feel guilty by saying to think of your girlfriend and be faithful to her?? I've literally tried everything. When I used to not answer he'd message unaware people I knew to tell me that he was looking for me? Like and after years of this toxic person I wanted cut out of my life years ago continuing to do this, it's really exhausting. I don't want my FB to be a total lockdown where nobody can ever message me, because I'm in hella FB groups and if I'm on it I want to enjoy it, but like he doesn't stop, and I thought by now he would've??

Been loving living in my new space. Feeling secure and stable in a way that words don't do justice. Sleeping in a bed, showering, bought a Chromebook laptop, I'm very appreciative of where I am.

Have my own car, drivers licence, full-time job stocking shelves. (only make $1600 a month though).

My questions:

My landlord wants cash only. Which is fine. But says she ""wants no paper trail"" of others in her house for tax purposes or something of the sort. I want to change my address on my drivers license to where I'm living now(which is a room in her house), my address info for my employer, when I file taxes, etc. Should I do that? Will I get my landlord in trouble, I don't want to do that.

Do I need to file my taxes? I've never done taxes before. What forms do I need to get? Can I do things electronically. I put 0 on any withholding's.

I was thinking of going into accounting (I’m not so great at math, but from what I’ve learned the math in accounting is more basic adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing) or business administration (although I’ve heard that’s too broad of a degree and I would need to specialize in something or it could be hard to land a job with just a business major). 

I just want to make sure I’m making the right decision and not wasting time. Any suggestions are welcome. Also, I’m going to try to do this all online while working full time.

Last night while driving for Uber I got a solid job offer working as tech support for a decent software company. The guy offered me 40 grand a year to start, 40 hour weeks Monday thru Friday 9-5, with potential to be making 70 grand within a few months to a year depending on progress. He seemed pretty cool, told me to come in, gave me the “would you rather be 40 in debt or be making 40 right away” which is obviously tempting.

I currently work full time every other day and drive for Uber at night and more time on my days off. I’m taking three classes, one of which is entirely online.

I’m annoyed because I worked pretty hard and am already invested in the education and while I know the money earned from a career for earning a degree is important, I didn’t want to slow down my education and it’s the education I want. My job is flexible right now and I’m able to work full time while going to school.

Should I continue with my ideal situation and pursue my education (knowledge and skills come first to me, then career salary but salary is important as I’m 31 and not getting younger and wanna settle down)

A year of long distance relationship later, I had transfered colleges, had a new group of friends, and was also clouded with a pretty serious depression at times. Since we were long distance, it was hard for me to open up to her about certain things; and when we visited eachother it was hard for me to discuss things since time was limited. I had this feeling that I had to grow on my own.. I basically out of nowhere (from her perspective) broke it off. Over a couple weeks I broke her heart. We were off and on until one final phone call we decided not to talk again since she still loved me but I didnt want to be together.
Fast forward 6 years, I have matured a lot and have a healthy relationship. However as happy as I try to be, I have this feeling of regret knowing that I screwed her over and really broke her heart. My growth as an individual makes me realize what an ass I was. We briefly messaged a couple years back and she seemed receptive to communication. I want to make ammends, as the further my current relationship develops, the more guilt and baggage I feel. I just don't know how, or if it is appropriate.",29Jan2020,1

Sadly  my car was in an accident. It was t-boned and didn't mess up the frame,  but the door because the driver wasn't going fast enough to damage more  than the door. But the air bags still deployed. And the steering wheel  is misaligned, the stablitrack is messed up, and the driver seat belt  doesn't work now.

I know I should  have had insurance on it. It lapsed. Also, the person driving it wasn't  me. I have been lectured by pretty much everyone about it.

So,  since I have another child now that puts me over the 5 seat limit of my  car, I want to get a van or an suv and will be getting about 10,000 for  taxes. Should I trade it in as is, or should I invest the 10,000 to fix  the car and then trade it in?

599,"I am very new to this so please forgive me if this is not the correct place to post this.

I am currently 20 years old and taking a semester off college because I am kind of lost at the moment. I spent a year at community college and was able to get almost all of my basics out of the way but I did not obtain an Associates degree. I then went on to a large state university just because it felt like the next step. I felt the need to get away from my home town and start to develop some independence so I just picked a major that sounded vaguely interesting and went with it. While I was there I developed a major depression that I just couldn't get out of, I was lonely, I hadn't made any friends, I was just miserable. I also quickly realized that the major that I had rushed to choose was one that I hated and loathed attending classes about. My parents noticed my mental state and lack of happiness and very generously offered to let me move back home. Now that I have been home for a while I have somewhat come out of my depression (although I am still working on it) and I am basically back to square one.

I guess I am just looking for advice about what I should do next, I am interested in becoming a firefighter and I thought maybe making a post could give me some direction. Should I go to my local university and suck it up and get my degree or should I try and get into EMT/Firefighter school now and try and get a job doing that? 

Any advice is appreciated!",29Jan2020,1
600,I’ve been through a lot with my home life and been able to keep an ok gpa. It’s my senior year. With one last semester left. Already applied to colleges. But I’m almost certain I’m going to do homeschooling. I know people are like why would u do that u have half a semester left but because I have such bad anxiety that it’s pretty much killing me. I have anxiety attacks about 5 times a day. It’s gotten so bad ive almost purposely drove off a cliff so I wouldn’t have to go to school (not to kill myself just injure myself) I think I truly need to do this to better help myself. But I don’t want it to destroy my chances of getting into college Bc then I think I would really start spiraling since college has always been my dream.,29Jan2020,1

602,"I got out of a long-term relationship about 2 years ago, and haven't dated since. The dating scene is so different now with all these apps floating around. I'm 31M, and dating apps are really difficult for me.

Honestly, I'm not very photogenic, probably a 6/10. I'm not overweight, but I'm also not at the gym every single day. I'm also one of those ""enjoy the moment"" kind of people and rarely take pictures or selfies / Or, I'm usually the one with camera in hand taking pictures of others.

To top it all off, I work remotely, and in my previous jobs, most of my coworkers were married or much older.

To summarize, I'm as average as it gets, I have a decent job, but work from home. I don't get too many hits on apps, and when I do, I don't get responses. 

Ideally, I want to date someone that is professionally driven, but a lot of women on these apps have no description or just links to their instagram. I set my filters to a 50 mile radius and in my age range. I definitely have not been keeping up with social media and I'm just lost in this ""new"" world. Everyone just seems like travel junkies, or gym rats. Rarely do I see ""normal"" women. I also start to question how everyone seems to have such an adventurous lifestyle. Does anyone work anymore?

611,"A camp was organized for academic achievers of India by the PM. He and I were invited to that camp and truly we were destined to meet. 
Our first group photograph was with him standing beside me which I realised much later. The next day was a city tour where the camp was 1st organised, we were in the same group but I didn't realize. I am usually a girl who is quite particular about her things but only the night before I forgot to put my phone to charge. We were in the bus, he was sitting just behind my seat. Fortunately there was no charging port under my seat and I asked him to check if a charging port was around his seat, it was! And that's how we sat together. That city has terrible traffic so we got to talk for long. 
Then we had to move to the capital for the second part of camp where we were trained under mentors, we were still in the same group so got to talk a lot. Later did I realise it was just the second day we met and we got so comfortable... We ended up clicking our 1st selfie that day. 2-3 days we were chatting till late night and waking up early morning to have a walk together, fed grains to the birds and sat on swings and talked endlessly. 
On our way to our workplace we were sitting together in bus, lecture Hall. We were together almost 18 hrs a day, never left each other's company. One night we were discussing some deep emotional stuff and he ended up texting that ""I'd date you rather "" (Later did I come to know from a mutual friend that he was quite shy about asking me out so all his friends helped him text me). 
I was not expecting this at all do I ended up texting ""what?!"". He quickly changed the topic then. Next day he had to go for a exam and we had a city tour again. Full day I missed his company so much. I truly couldn't stop thinking about him for a second also. Next day I decided that he just asked me for a date right? I should go out with him. So we went for a coffee date at 6am, he totally wasn't expecting this and got so nervous and kinda happily awkward that he ended up dropping his biscuit in his coffee while sitting in that huge dinning Hall alone with me. 
We were still getting to know each other. He was just so caring and pampered me to the fullest. Such a great listener, always respected my opinions and wishes and got me his share of chocolate in the morning when I shared my love for chocolates for him the last evening. We continued having innocent romance for rest of the days. The second last day I dressed up in Indian clothes (got a lot of compliments), idk if he willingly did that but our clothes got colour coordinated that day. Once 2 guys slept at the end of the rows and I wished to go to the washroom he offered his hands for me to step on and climb up the seats. 
Then he took me to the terrace of that auditorium, after a lot of thought he let his arms over my shoulders. I was just so close to him. 
The last day we had the final function, I was dressed in lehnga and he wore a suit for the function, got a picture clicked from a friend carrying dslr. I really wish I could hug him that day but we just couldn't spend even a single min alone. 
After that both of us confessed our feelings for each other. But the problem was we both lived in far away cities, had career making/breaking exams ahead (a few months for him and a year for me) and certainly he didn't trust a long distance relationship. So we decided to pull off the idea of a relationship and focus on our goals. Did we do right?

614,"My 12 year old daughter and 7 year old son have belonged to a co-ed swim club for the past few years. We have been dealing with an ongoing issue with another member of the club who is currently a senior boy (17 years old) inappropriately touching the younger members.  He pokes, splashes, and touches the other kids constantly. My kids both find him creepy and have asked him to stop touching them. After speaking with some of the other parents, several other kids feel uncomfortable with him too.  Unfortunately, it seems the general consensus is that this is just part of his personality and we just need to deal with it. 

To complicate the situation, the boy’s mom is the president of the club and an assistant coach this year. In the past, I’ve asked him to stop touching my kids, my husband has asked him to stop, my kids ask him not to touch them, and I’ve asked the former head coach to keep them separated from him. This year, we have a new, young head coach. Another mom and I spoke with her last week; she said she would come up with a solution for handling it and try to address the situation. She had a general conversation with the entire team about keeping their hands to themselves but so far nothing has improved.

I’m looking for advice on my next steps. At this point I feel like the next step is contacting his mom and possibly asking to have him moved exclusively to practices that she coaches, which are much smaller than the regular practices, but that doesn’t completely address the issue because we’ll still have to deal with him at weekend meets.

My mum cleans the floor, washes the dishes, does laundry and cooks (with me sometimes). My brother just takes out the trash and sometimes washes the dishes.

I don't specifically know what or why this is but I could try by giving my background.

Ever since I was little I would always dream big (but always changes like from an Astronaut to Inventor or whatever) then due to certain circumstances became a narcissistically high opinion of myself thanks to the grading system being busted putting me high in the honor roll despite me sleeping my ass off during exams. 

Later on in life though, I grew wiser than I ever had before, even disliking who I used to be. Yet I'm still the same old undeciding guy who still takes minutes before coming up with a KFC order only to change it last minute. 

In other words, I spent half my life so far having fantasies of a narcissistic spoiled brat and started fresh not too long ago with a new outlook. Only issue now is that I still don't know what I truly want now. I have no particular desires whether it be fame, wealth, a beautiful wife or anything. I do have a yearning for the creative industry yet I couldn't even get a plan of the ground, make it lack of time, talent or anything of the like. I'd love to take some time off and practice up on my skills or learn new ones but ever loading amount of work school  leaves me no time and when I do I just sleep or unwind with a movie or videogame due to stress.

I'm trying to understand this because I personally would think ""ok that's totally fine, I shouldn't judge someone for not doing something for me"".

The way I operate is I don't expect anyone to do anything for me, and I don't want anyone to expect me to do anything for them.

Basically in this University, you're only an aspiring student, hoping to get into first semester. They make you wait 4 months while you compete with other aspiring students, and only the best grades make it into first semester. in theory, this sounds good, however, during these last two weeks I've been there, I noticed some inconsistencies and suspicious activity. For one, I overheard a conversation between two guys the other day, one of them was asking the other, ""Did you get the answers for the exam  you're gonna present today?"" It was direct, straight to the point and it honestly shocked me because, you hear stories about corruption, but you never think you're going to actually get to experience it. The reason why I chose to leave, was on my last exam, I got a 40. However I felt like I had gotten a better grade, because I studied a lot and actually understood the exam quite well..at first I accepted it, but then something made me go check the published correct answers..and it turns out, I bad many answers right, but they marked them as wrong.

The email: Okay, and I just want to confirm this won't follow me on my record or anything like that.

If I am going to be honest. I am very frustrated by this situation. I feel I have been punished for something I shouldn't have. I can assume who reported me from where I was working this summer and some of the situations. I do admit on a professional level I did act inappropriately, but I feel like I wasn't the only one. I wish I had a chance to defend myself. I feel like I am being punished because someone regrets an experience with me. This whole thing has affected me in many ways that are hard to explain. I have always struggled with depression and suicidal tendencies and since the day my employer told me of the report those feelings have been put to the extreme. Because of all of this I have been put on medication, I was almost hospitalized for suicidal actions,  and my suicidal tendencies turned into not just thoughts, but into real things; I began hurting myself and planning my death. 

In the training one of the main things I got out of it was that sexual harassment is at it's worst when it affects an employee or student from doing what they need to do in a comfortable way so they can perform at their best. This is my situation now. I can't go to places I know she might be because I am terrified of her. I am scared to do the things I love and meet the people I enjoy because she might be there. I stay at home on the weekend because I am scared my friends that are her friend will hate me. I don't know this all feels so unfair. I know all I had to do was a training, but the emotional trauma this has all caused has really messed me up. 

I'm not trying to retaliate, but I feel like my words should be heard. I complied to her, and now she just gets to move on with a clear conscience while I sit and suffer. Maybe making things fair isn't the priority here, but I feel I was wronged in this situation. I hoped the training would be the end of this whole thing, but last night was horrible. I couldn't sleep so I turned to drinking. I woke up and couldn't wake up. I have a huge exam today that I didn't study for because I was trying my hardest not to have a anxiety attack.

626,"I’ll cut right to it.

Me (17M) was volunteering at an elementary school last week. I used my vape in my car before i left because I’m an addicted idiot. The principal saw me and talked to me, I lied to him and told him i was 18 and i was grandfathered into using a vape legally. In hopes he wouldn’t be angry. He asked for my name and kicked me out. I lied and gave him a phony name.
Today, i was called into the assistant principals office and caught. I then again, lied to her and my parents and claimed the pen was “essential oils, and didn’t contain nicotine”. After that, i was given two after school detentions, which is fine. But my parents now know about all of this, and when i get home at 8:00pm after my first detention, i don’t know what to tell them. I was caught vaping back last year, and i can not afford to confess that it really was a nicotine vape. I called my father and mother right after the meeting with the assistant principal and explained the situation. They both seem fairly upset but i’m not too sure what to say whenever I get home. The only issue with my fake alibi is that, if it really was an essential oils vape pen, why didn’t i tell the principal who caught me vaping it was one to begin with? 

To reiterate: what should i tell my parents when i get home about the last issue in my alibi. ? Again, there’s no way I can afford telling my family it was a vape because it would be over for me.

631,"I am struggling to figure out what to do about my current living situation. I need to make a decision by Saturday the latest and it is causing severe anxiety. By Feb 1st I have to decide  if I'm leaving my apartment. I'd like to give my roommates 30 days notice but am worried about how they will react.

For the past 6 months I have been subleasing a room in an apartment with 4 other people (two couples). We don't have any sort of agreement in place, and I wasn't asked to provide a deposit. The understanding is it would be more long-term (as in at least 6-12 months), which I have honored. I overheard the woman who's on the lease talking to her friends the other day saying she would not be renewing in August, and her and her partner would be moving away. The other couple is 50/50 on staying in our current city (from what I gather).

I really like these people, and don't want to put them in an annoying position to find someone else to take over for only 6 more months, but I am having a couple issues that I am not sure I can deal with anymore. Not only is moving in August more difficult because it's highly competitive, but I can't handle the noise / lifestyle differences. There are no rules about quiet hours and almost zero common decencies when it comes to making noise. I am the only one who works a full-time, 9-5 job, so I feel weird about asking them to be quiet when they essentially don't have a schedule they need to stick to. My room is also the only one practically in the living room so I am completely at the mercy of when they decide to go to bed and stop talking or partying or watching TV. I have talked to them before but nothing changes. Every time they have guests over (frequently) they don't manage the guest noise level either and often I am kept awake or woken up in the middle of the night.

That being said, they have been really kind to me otherwise and have gone out of their way to make me feel like a part of the group. I do like them a lot as people. I also like our neighborhood and rent is affordable. However, knowing I'll have to move eventually this summer, and the increasingly difficult noise situation is really pushing me to just leave in 30 days.  I would offer to make the posting about the room to help find someone, and I feel 30 days notice is enough considering we have no formal agreement in place. I'm just really bad at confrontation, and one of the roommates is a bit volatile with her emotions. I've talked to my boyfriend about this and he seems split on the pros and cons as well.

Any objective advice is really appreciated because I don't have much time to make a decision. By Friday I will have seen 6 apartments and have two more lined up for next week. It does make me a bit nervous not having something confirmed 100% if I tell them I am moving but I'd be able to stay with family if necessary. Thanks in advance x",29Jan2020,1
632,"Hey everyone,

So I met up today with my bestfriend for a coffee and he said that something was really bothering him. He just had a mental breakdown and started crying.
I knew that thats something out of my league to help him with and that he needs help asap, so I grabbed him and took him to our university campus straight away to go the university psychologist.
Within 1 hour I set up an appointment for him with a student psychologist and he talked with her for 30 minutes, and made another appointment with the psychologist next tuesday.
He smiled a little bit when he came back from the psychologist and I took him out for lunch and later this evening we are going to an arcade he loves in order to distract himself a little bit.
The thing is he told his gf about it, who is out of town atm, and she is worried sick and mad at him that he dindt told her anything about his problems, because they promised each other that they‘ll talk about anything if somethings up.
Like I can understand his gf‘s point of view, but then again not exactly(?) because she should be there for him instead of being mad she should be happy that he gets the help he needs?

Like im happy that he took this step to go see a psychologist and stick with it, but is there more that I can do for him?
Im sorry if this post is a but disorganized, I was in shock when he told me about his problems and everything, so im still a bit anxious and shaken up about it.
The thing is, he told me back in april about these problems and I advised him to go seek help with a therapist about it. He said he did back then, but today he told me he did not go see a therapist, thats why I took him immediately to the psychologist.
He is feeling better now, im just still shaken up by it.
But like, I cant be there for him 24/7 because I need to focus on exams at the moment, like I dont want to sound like an asshole or anything, but there is only soo much I can do to help him.
Im there for him and everything, I just need advice on what else I can do in this situation please!

Thank you for reading and for your help in advance.",29Jan2020,1
633,"I'm really hoping to get some insight into this. I've read articles before but I tend to just sit there with all the information and freeze up. So I hope to find some real, personal accounts on how to stop apologizing so much... 

I truly do apologize too much. For everything and anything. If someone tells me something like ""my cat was being crazy this morning"" I will reply with an apology. If I bump into something like a chair, I will apologize. If someone tells a joke and I don't get it, yup- I apologize. I hate it and I try to be mindful but it's so brutally ingrained that I miss it a lot. The only other semi-helpful thing I've managed is to try to flip it into a 'thank you' of sorts. (Like instead of ""sorry I'm late"" I try to say ""thanks for being patient."")

Any and all advice would be appreciated. It's such a bad habit and I want to get past it. Thank you in advance and even just for reading this.",29Jan2020,1
634,"Hi all,

I feel like I'm moving forward in my life but at the same time I feel like my progress is moving at a ""snails pace"". 

Recently, I went to a networking event in London to try to enter my specific industry I'm interested including a particular one in London as it's a city I've always wanted to move to for a period of time. I managed to gain a few contacts and one of the contacts even said he might set me up for an internship for Summer or Fall of 2020. This was back in November. Fast forward, it's now January. Things are moving slow and the person who was supposed to start setting me up with the internship isn't responding to my 2nd follow up email. He responded to my first asking me about the details for the internship and I responded by telling him X Y and Z. Still no response on his end. 

I also managed to connect with another person in my future industry via LinkedIn in my local area. I asked him if he would like to talk about how he progressed in his career and he gave me his phone number out the bat. I then asked him what a good time would be to call him and he didn't respond. I waited for a few days before I called him and left him a voicemail. It's now been 2 days and I still have yet to receive a response. 

The things I am doing are reading up constantly everyday on industry news mostly in my local area and at times, nationally and Internationally.  I even post on my LinkedIn group constantly, at least twice a day.

I'm trying to get back into school through paying off my debt and currently working a menial job that is not a means to an end for me at the moment.

Is there something I'm doing wrong or am I just wasting my time with this? Because I am starting to get that feeling with things moving so slowly so far, I might start to get back into that downward spiral (ie, depression and doubt) again. I don't want to get back into that downward spiral of not moving forward with anything like in the past. 

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks!",29Jan2020,1

638,"They have to think I’m retarded. Here is one example of what I’m talking about. One time my boyfriend asked me if I minded reheating some nachos we didn’t finish earlier. I was about to put them in the oven when his dad practically jumps to block me and points at the microwave. He said the microwave is better. Everyone knows the oven is way better than the microwave. But I don’t usually eat nachos so I thought maybe this is one thing that is better in the microwave. I had a slight feeling I was lied to so I told my boyfriend how the scenario played out and he said his dad lied because he was probably about to use the oven.
Okay what’s wrong with just saying that? 

Just today I was about to saute some mushrooms on one side of the stove and use the other to heat up some soup. My boyfriends dad points at the pan and says it’s not good for what I’m about to use it for. Said something about it turning the food blue. Yeah okay. I take his word for it and as I’m washing off another pan that I know is meant for sautéing he starts using the stove. I sent my bf a picture of the pot I was gonna use and he said it would have been fine for sautéing. What bothers me most besides the lying is that I was literally here first ready to throw everything I chopped up onto the stove! 

I know a bunch of people are gonna comment saying that the dad is in the right because it’s his house and I’m just the girlfriend so it’s perfectly fine. But can you imagine the lack of respect you’d have to have for someone to be okay with telling them nothing but utter bullshit just because they’re doing something you don’t want them to do?

My boyfriend always lets me know when they lie to me. What if I just started calling them out on it? I already know they would make me out to be the bad guy. I know because I called them out a few years ago and it didn’t turn out well. They seem like me the most when I play dumb and buy all of their bullshit and it pisses me off.",29Jan2020,1
639,"Hello, I will try and go in detail here, you don't have to read this but answering my question would be awesome!

I am a 16 year old guy who goes to highschool in England (included for culture stuff). My parents earn minimum wage and I live in a flat. I can't afford anything nice so I feel behind compared to my friends. Me and my friends have very little in common and they usually close that gap with humour, but sometimes it really gets to me, for example when they call me a Jew, make gas jokes (I am Polish) and  make fun of my inability to get a girl to like me or even talk to me for a longer amount of time. I can't really find a different friend group as others are even more different and my school is pretty small.

I have episodes(?) of anger, depression and misery. During those times I feel so powerless and extremely violent to the point where I want to cry and usually do at night so I don't let my parents know (I opened up to my mum about my depression \[never diagnosed\] and she started crying and turned the talk into me consoling her and her blaming herself for being a terrible mother, which made me feel even more terrible). I already go to a muay thai class a few times a week so I try to get my anger and violence out then, but it comes back so fast during those times. I also meditate. These episodes can last between a few days and a few weeks.

I think of killing myself a lot (if I'm not being distracted by something like teachers or sleeping) during these times and I just want this shit to end. I am at the point where I don't think I ever have had or will have anything nice happen to me.

Please, I just want relief from this complete fucking misery.",29Jan2020,1

My close friend, let's call her Sam. She has a friend; lets call her Jo. Jo is getting married in about a month. She has been messaging guys, sending indecent photographs of herself and she has a severe drinking problem and a 2 year old. Jo's fiance knows about the drinking but not of her actions with guys. Jo just recently went on a  short trip a few cities away lying to everyone around her except for sam, she had got drunk at another's guys house and slept in the same bed with him. Jo says they didn't do anything but she has been unfaithful emotionally to her fiance for a while now and Sam isn't sure if what she says is true. Here's where she is morally stuck. It seems simple right. Tell the fiance. But when Jo is confronted by sam, she tells her that she should stop, blah blah blah, because Jo's fiance pays for everything for her. 

So now Sam os torn. Does she break them up ending her longest friendship with Jo. Or does she say nothing and ruin a mans life?

I’ve only been in the office about 10 times since being hired (5 months ago) I’m in the stage where I have to make a certain amount of sales ($2000) and bring in meetings with different clients where my manager sits in and shadows/helps lead the conversation. I haven’t been very successful in bringing in meetings and I’ve been receiving a lot of rejection for different reasons (I can’t afford it right now, I’m busy, I already have life insurance, etc). I only have 2 clients atm. I’m worried my manager is going to fire me for poor performance. 

I don’t have my own office, my own email, a company account, my own business cards, nothing. I am not provided any support besides “find the people to bring in, and we will help you do the talking”. I’m not trained on how to prospect, how to start a conversation, how to reach out, I’m not invited to shadow other meetings, or be shown anything. I am only allowed to go to head office “training” (where they finally set up my company account/email) once I pass the $2000 in sales mark. 

I am thinking about quitting before they let me go. I am thinking about going into the brokers side of insurance instead. Where I can deal with more variety such as auto, life, health, commercial, business, etc.

650,"I’m a twenty-eight year old, self-identifying gay male who has been in a relationship with another male for approximately five years.  I’ve been out for almost ten years now and my coming out story is rather uneventful. I’ve had four or five serious relationships with other guys in that time frame and am currently in a relationship that has been ongoing for about five years now. We have had our ups and our downs, like any relationship but the last year and a half has been tumultuous to say the least.  I was diagnosed with HIV in late 2018 (currently am undetectable and healthy).  

I think I contracted it from a threesome that me and current boyfriend entered into (although he is not HIV+); I’m the bottom and he’s more of a top, so that could it explain it.  Anyways, he insisted on having a threesome and he has done so several times throughout our relationship. I was never big into them, but I went along with them for his sake. Relationships are a give and take after all, right? Fast forward to October of 2019, I find out that my boyfriend has cheated on me three times, with three different partners. It really has broken me. We have started therapy and counseling to try and make it work, as we live together, have two cats together and our lives are pretty much infused at this point.  

It’s been a very hard few months after discovering this information and I’m honestly still shaken by it. Part of me wants to make it work because I feel invested in our relationship, but another part of me can’t get over it, and worries that he is continuing to cheat on me, or will cheat on me again in the future. Now, I have a best friend...we went to law school together, we love the same things, we generally say that we are the same person (except I’m a male and she’s a female, other than that we consider each other one and the same).  We have known each other for about five years now but it has honestly felt like a lifetime. 

I’ve always loved her as a friend and generally love spending any time I can with her, when we can make time for one another. But I think that my feelings for her are growing from that of being a friend to wanting something more. I don’t know if it is because I’m in such a bad mental headspace about my current relationship, or if it is actual feelings.  We both are in committed relationships, but we joke about “running off together and living with one another in a different state” and starting a “new life.” We’ve never discussed anything more though; we have never done anything sexual with one another. I have no idea if she has the same feelings and I’m terrified that if I even breach the subject I will ruin our friendship.

I’m starting to question my own sexuality now, I think I’m fluid and probably bisexual or pansexual, but I’ve always identified as gay and I’m worried that if I do pursue anything other than a relationship with a guy people are going to think I’m “flip-flopping” or something.

663,"

To give some background, I have severe anxiety. I think it may be hard to grasp for other people and I am terrible at explaining it. In this case, I guess we can focus down on social anxiety.

I've never really had any trouble making friends until around 6th grade. I'm not sure what changed that would have caused that. During that time I slowly lost all my friends with literally no one by the end of 8th grade. My anxiety and depression has only gotten worse and I'm still trying to 'fix' myself. I cannot tell if I'm getting better but I hope I am.

Talking to more people now I realise how I cannot be myself in front of people. I try to have a serious demeanor while being courteous. Be the 'goody goody' while struggling to talk. I cannot be free, I'm always so tense, and trying my best to not offend anyone. I struggle to think of something to say and when I do, I stutter. I know this is an anxiety and/or pressure issue since I have no problem talking fluently with someone like my brother whom I'm closer with. 

Not being myself really makes making friends difficult. I seem distant and boring. 


To give you guys an example, I met a group of people through Xbox a couple years ago. We play pretty much weekly if not daily for the past years. Because of my anxiety I did not use my mic for a period of time. Nevertheless, we stuck together and I am now using my mic but still face the problems I have mentioned. I talk to them more than to my parents. Even though we've never met I still treat them as friends. One of them recently asked if I was facing any troubles and that I could always talk to them about it, yet all I said was 'okay.'

Me: “ hey you go to ( insert school name)
 
Him: “ yeah”

Me:” same , I’m ( my name)”

And he didn’t say anything and I didn’t know how to continue and got too nervous and just walked away to the equipment. I haven’t been going to the gym cause it was pretty awkward . I was just trying to make an effort to make a friend.
How do I get over it and should I try to say hi again?

It does not match the rest of my hair color so now I am going back today to get it fixed.

672,"Hello! So I’m gonna do a quick run down. My whole life I’ve been an artist, from the moment I’ve been able to pick up a crayon or chalk to draw. For years my major and goal was to be an artist, it went from Anime animator to Tattoo artist by about middle school. I’ve done tons of research for being a tattoo artist but kind of dropped the idea sophomore year when I was approached with worries of me not being able to make a living. I know many tattoo artists who are good friends of mine so I know all about that life lol. So sophomore year of Highschool I dropped it and ran out of time for art running into lots of mental health issues due to family tragedies. I decided I’d switch to bio for my major to go into herpetology (study of reptiles and amphibians). Now I grew up with reptiles and being a family that rescues, as well as a mom who was a vet tech for a bit. I have a Pastel Ball Python, A leopard gecko, a patternless leopard gecko, a crested gecko, and a Colombian boa rescue. I love animals with a passion, and I’m okay with going into herpetology but I love art as well. I’m stuck now and stressed. I figured I’d major in bio and minor in art. I’m a junior right now in Highschool and I get pretty good grades (nothing below a B in a class). I take honors classes and AP classes (AP Bio and ive taken AP art freshman year). Now my whole life I’ve always been told that I’m gifted with art, I’ve won so many art shows and prizes with metals and trophies. I’ve been interviewed and told I’d be the states next big artist by middle school and had a mural put in at a local market here. I’m just tied and not sure what to do, also choosing a college is stressing me out. I’m in WV so I do not want instate college here since it isn’t exactly the best lol.

Later at night though it switches to club music and often the workplace becomes innapropriate with people dancing, slacking off, guys getting frisky etc. 

We tried using YouTube music with the explicit flag turned on and it sort of worked but eventually it would get back into that genre and any song that YouTube hadn't flagged would get right through and create the same negative effect. 

Same thing with Amazon music.

687,"I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else to post this. I (20m) recently got into a relationship with an amazing girl. She’s very understanding of me and my quirks and struggles, both of which are numerous. However I’m having a not so pleasant time in the bedroom. 

Little background: I’m diagnosed with Aspergers and anxiety. One of the main aspects of autism I’m struggling with in this situation is Alexithymia, essentially being unaware of and unable to explain emotions. I’ve only had one sexual partner before, and even though we did it many times I don’t think I really enjoyed any of it. 

So now I have a new girlfriend. We’ve had sex only once, and without getting into too much detail, it didn’t go well. I’ve googled many things trying to find an explanation for why this happened and coping strategies.  I’ve done this countless times in the past couple weeks and I found absolutely nothing to help me. Pretty much all I get are results for women who have been sexually traumatized. But I’m a male, and I don’t regard my sexual history as anything close to traumatic. Shameful, yes. Furthermore, the coping strategies are way too vague. For example, “communicate your needs and desires.” I have no clue what I need or desire, all I know is when clothes come off, I’m mentally gone. 

Every google search leaves me with a frustrating number of questions and zero answers. I still consider myself very inexperienced. I practically know nothing about sex, or my own sexuality. It’s seriously upsetting me that I can’t even try to find out what I want without leaving feeling like a undeserving piece of shit. Someone help?",29Jan2020,1
688,"**TW: religion**

My mum and I have changed a lot since she split with my dad and moved with her new husband many years ago. She found God again, devoted her life to living and keeping the faith, sharing the same God-centered values as her new man and using every opportunity when I visit her to preach to the ~~converted~~ uninterested. They are brainwashing influencing their child to follow suit. It's surprising whey they didn't choose to clock their 9-5 in the mosque instead.

I have since gone on the other end of the spectrum. I was just Muslim by name, but have dropped all the practices I was taught. I became a freethinker, deciding that the concept of God, God itself, living a Godly life etc is irrelevant and a real hindrance to living life independently on my own terms.

Being true to myself, instead of having religion forced down on me daily, being brainwashed with ""one true faith"" crap and not being allowed to study other world religions for fear of ""losing my faith"". I wanted to learn religion at my own will and pace to keep an open mind. Furthermore, I became exposed to the LGBTQ+ community and empathized with their plight - since then this straight ally volunteers for Pride annually. The last time I met my mum, her husband warned me of the *""dangers of the LGBT""*: to ""beware"" and ""not get brainwashed"" as though they are dangerous.

It's been a year since my last visit but I've decided to go NC for both our sake, missing birthdays, anniversaries and possibly the upcoming Eid holiday (Muslim version of Thanksgiving/Christmas gathering). I reevaluated the big picture of my relationship with my mum. Although her beliefs doesn't square with mine at all, it is something I can and will respect as a decent person. However she crosses a personal line when she and her husband constantly preaches when we visit her. *^(How many God lectures do I need to hear from you?!)* Forcing me to pick up my cross and follow her is ironically turning me away. I have kept silent as I expect she will get defensive when I tell her to keep her beliefs to herself. If we keep in contact our relationship will be destroyed long-term as I see no compromise and she's very particular when religion comes into the picture.

Am I selfish or is this the right thing to do? How do I move on from here?",29Jan2020,1

I have five more modules to study for this semester, with exams in May. I have to do a dissertation over the Summer, along with repeating the two exams.

698,"Hey guys sorry that this is kind of a long one, but it needs the back story for context. 

My old best friend (we'll call him Bill) and I were absolutely inseparable while growing up.  We were friends since we were 12 and were more or less attached at the hip until the end of high school.  We hung out every day after school, on the weekends, we'd give eachother places to stay if our home lives were shit at the moment. We had no secrets and would seamlessly lie for the other. When I say he was my best friend, I really mean it. 

In highschool we both kept great grades, with Bill being the smarter of us two, I was a bit of a stoner, while Bill wouldn't touch the stuff. Finally right before I left for college, he told me he wanted to try some weed and I, the generous stoner, obliged him.

I went out of state for college while he stayed in-state. We stayed friends but honestly didn't talk too much after the first few weeks. I stopped smoking weed, drinking as much, and really focused up on school. At the end of school year, I returned home with the intent of staying in state for college next year. Bill and I were instantly as close as we'd ever been, but I could sense something was off about him. He seemed angrier, less focused, etc.

I asked a mutual friend what was going on with Bill, and he told me that while I was gone, Bill had developed a drinking problem along with a serious weed dependency and had failed out of college.

I felt awful (I was the one who had introduced him to both weed and alcohol in the first place) and I immediately began to do everything in my power to get him back on track. It would seem like it worked for awhile, and then he'd fall back into the same bad patterns, but still I kept trying, over and over...

Fast forward a few years to about 8 months ago from present time. I'm almost done with University while Bill has degraded. Takes a couple classes at community college every semester with no real drive to do anything. At this point I haven't had a sober conversation with Bill for for literal years. We grown apart and rarely see eachother anymore, maybe once every couple months. He refuses to get help. I've made a new group of friends who can't stand Bill (rightfully so because hes constantly fucked up and says fucked up things). Abunch of us go drinking at the bars one night and Bill asks if he can tag along, and I tell him sure.

The night goes well and we all go back to a friend's apartment. Bill and I start arguing (don't even remember what it was about- something minor) and suddenly he gets set off by the discussion and flies into a rage before attacking me. We fight for a bit until friends break us up. He screams that he wants to kill me, saying he's gonna shoot me, cut me, etc. 

I tell Bill I don't want to see him again, and our friends force him out of the apartment. For me, this is the last straw. Despite his numerous attempts to make contact with me and apologize, I haven't spoken a word to him since this all happened. I know he was messed up and he genuinely feels bad but it felt like this was a long time coming and i just feel like I can't be friends with someone who's wellbeing I care more about than they do. I don't wish him I'll, I just don't want to be involved anymore- It just became exhausting. 

Despite this, Id be lying if I said I didn't miss our friendship sometimes. Bill was there for me at times when no one else was and I feel partially responsible for his weed and alcohol problems (I should note I have no issue with people doing either, but in moderation.) Anyways, a picture just popped up in my snapchat memories of us from several years ago, and it made me wonder if I should try to forgive him. Any advice would be appreciated- do I maintain my resolve or should I try to make Amends?",29Jan2020,1
699,"Look at my previous posts for a bit more context if necessary. But my girlfriend of almost two years cheated on me a few months ago. She showed me text messages of her friends constantly telling her to leave me because I was supposedly bad to her (I wasn’t, they just didn’t like me). They would always manipulate her and make her believe these things about me that just weren’t true. She told me that so much anger eventually built up inside that she just had to cheat on me. For about a week after that happened she was extremely cold towards me and acted as if I was the bad one. 

So we met up the following week and she tried to act like she hated me, but then she just broke down and explained the situation to me. She told me about how much they influenced her actions, and I do believe her. She eventually got rid of them and we have been seeing each other since, but we are not fully together. Can her actions be justified? She spends every day since then trying to make it up to me. I just want to know if our relationship can be repaired from this supposedly ‘genuine’ mistake?

I'd be okay with not hating my job though. I'm also hung up that now you meet your significant other in the workplace a lot more and so that makes your career so much more important. I like educating a lot and most of my passions lie there but I'm keeping that option open because I have to pursue things now that I can't later. I'm lucky I can always fall back on education I guess. But I kind of really hate that I have to go through the motions for another 4 years. I feel like life really is a treadmill I can't get off of.

703,"It's sad that I have to post this. But I can't control what I'm feeling. I don't have anyone to talk to except 1 person so he advised that I let it out to other people that aren't biased.

I'm a senior in highschool who has a crush on another senior girl. To me, she's flawless. Beautiful, intelligent, funny, goofy, sweet. I think about her everyday and always want to be around her and enjoy seeing her. I realized all this over this year, however I had known of her since I was 13 and we were in middle school and I had always been extremely fucking attracted to her physically, I never thought of how her personality would be and it's just everything I'd ever want in a girl. 

When I found out we had calculus together on the first day of school after never having a class, I was like, cool, and then overtime I began realizing how in love I am with her. I tried to get myself to talk to her a lot, but it was so difficult and I was so akward. She had a good friend in that class so I tried to talk to both of them and ended up being so akward, but atleast making an impression on them that I'm a nice guy who really looks up to both of them - when I told them I thought I was just a loser and shouldn't talk to them they told me I wasn't and it was all so sweet I guess, lol. 

Months later and now it's second semester, I got switched out of that class, but I have her in my study hall. Recently I had the chance to talk to her and I told her ""since i'm out of that class, i just wanted to say goodbye forever."" I also said thank you for indirectly motivating me to be a better person by telling me I wasn't a loser, and then she said we can still talk and gave me her snapchat. I recently sent her a snap on there (nothing serious, just about making coffee at work) and she replied with a really cute snap of her laughing in bed with no makeup - was amazing. 

Ok, now that all that background info is out of the way, let's get into the real shit. She has a 100 different guys who want her. Everytime I see her, she's talking with some tall, good looking guy, and laughing or giggling with them. In that study hall class I talked about, 3 guys occasionally come up to her and sit with her and they laugh the entire time. Some of these guys she *has* dated in the past (in middle school) and I'm 100% sure would love to get the chance again. Others have crushes on her and create her playlists on spotify of music that they think she would like. Others take her out to starbucks and when I asked if this one certain person is dating her, he said ""it's complicated."" Others walk her to class even if they're going to be late, and others leave their class to come sit with her and talk to her. It's a neverending cycle of what other guys do with her and I watch it all from the sidelines with a blank expression on my face.

This makes me realize that I probably won't ever get close to her. If she already has a million guys who are super close with her and would do almost anything for her and have a mutual physical attraction, what can I do? Even if I were to gain some insane confidence, those other guys already have an incredible amount to do some of the things they do, *and they're really good looking.* When we talk, I'm the one who always initiates everything, she rarely says hi to me first. Thus, this is where all the pain comes from this crush. I feel so inferior to all these different guys and I just don't know what to do. Should I still try to talk to her, or should I just give up. The thing is, giving up on her is just so freaking hard, because to me, no other girl compares, and I don't fucking know why. If I could control it, I'd turn that shit off immediately.

To make things worse, we're also probably going to the same college in a couple months. So I can't use that as an excuse to get rid of this shit. If anyone can help, thank you so much. Even just some comments like ""i feel you man"" would be appreciated because I literally only have 1 person I can actually talk to and I only say half of what I mentioned on here.",29Jan2020,1
704,"I'm sorry but I already know this will be long. Basically, about five months ago I started working at my local takeaway. I'm 17 and it's my first job ever. So far I'm really enjoying it and really like my coworkers. But a customer has started coming often and making me really uncomfortable. 

It started when I was on the cashier one night with another female coworker. A man came in who I have never seen before. I greeted him and asked if he would like to order. What felt like five minutes he just stared me down. I'm 5'4, blonde and 110 pounds if that matters. He eventually ordered some food and payed. While we waited for his food to me made, I could literally feel his eyes all over me. I'm not good at reading people but this man gave off a really bad vibe. When his order was finished I handed it to him and thanked him. He just smirked and said see you later. When he left, my coworker said ""Wow, that guy was really creepy towards you."" I just shrugged it off. Usually you get customers that stare or try to flirt with you.

Fast forward to last Monday. I'm now working by myself as it was a day the takeaway wasn't that busy. The man comes in again and his eyes bright up as soon as he sees me. I'm immediately put on edge. This time round he is now much more confident. He puts his arms on the work bench and he leaning over it. A lot more closer to me than last time. I greet him and he orders his food. I send it into chiefs in the back. His total came to around £18.  He placed two £20s on the bench. I pushed back one of the £20s to him and said sorry it just the one £20 I need. He laughed and pushed it back towards me. ""That's for you."" Now at my work I get paid pretty well and tips aren't really a thing. I explained to him that it's too much and I'm not allowed to accept tips. He kept saying just take it every single time I said no. Eventually he rolled his eyes and put it back in his pocket. 

After a few minutes of him just staring at me in silence he asked me how old I was. It's not an  uncommon thing to ask this.  I told him I was 17 hoping that will make him step off. He just raised his eyebrow and said ""Nearly 18 then."" I'm cringing writing this. I hate the way he said it. He then asked me to guess his age. I said 21 and he laughed and said he was 26. He asked me if I thought he looked 21. Thank god at the moment the takeaway phone rang. Rushing, I ignored his question and answered the phone, him staring at me the whole time. When I finished with the phone his order was ready. I went into the kitchen and came out gave it to him. I thanked him for ordering. I was about to turn away from him when he suddenly held my arm and stuffed the £20 in my chest pocket of my coat. He winked and said goodnight to me and left.  I felt really guilty about the £20, it made me feel like I did something dirty. 

This Monday I was again working by myself.  No one was in the takeaway when I looked out the window and saw him walking towards the door. I could feel myself breaking into a cold sweat and I just walked into the back into the kitchen and stood there for a moment. My boss who is also the chief asked me why I came back here. I just lied to her and said I thought she called my name. The front door chimed meaning someone opened the door. I had to go back out there as my boss doesn't like to keep customers waiting.

I stepped out into the front room and of course he is leaning on the work bench staring right at me. 
""You're not avoiding me are you?"" He asked smiling. I laughed nervously and shook my head. He order his food and yet again it was another five minute stare off with him. 

""Do you always work Monday?"" He asked. This was when alarm bells were beginning to ring in my head. I usually do work Mondays alone but there is no way I'm letting him know. I lied and told him no and that my shifts are different every week. Thankfully he didn't dig anymore into it. He then asked me about school. I told him it was going good and didn't say anything more. ""Is it a boy and girl's school?"" He said. Where I live there is alot of Catholic schools that are all girls/all boy schools. Mine is co-ed. I nodded and said it was. He laughed and leaned over the bench causing me to step back a bit. ""I bet all the boys have a crush on you"". I didn't say anything, I didn't know what to say. Silence again of him just staring at me. 

""So what time do you finish work here?"" He asked. I froze and contemplated what to say. I was going to lie and say the wrong time when the delivery man came in. I honestly never been more thankful in my life. The delivery man is visibly a lot more stronger than the man which made me feel more a ease. He also a softie and really kind to me. The creepy man immediately stepped away from the work bench and didn't speak again. 

I keep chatting to the delivery man while getting the food orders for him. Luckily the other man's order was ready and I handed him it and quickly thanked him and said good-bye. Thankfully he left without saying anything. 

That was two days ago and I'm working again on Friday. I'm worried incase he comes back or if he will wait for me to finish closing. He is not a regular and now he is coming three times in the space of two weeks. I don't want to tell my boss as she is too nice but she wouldn't turn away a paying customer. I don't want to tell my coworkers incase they make a big deal about it. And I'm worried if I tell my parents they will make me quit. I told my friends but they just thought I was overreacting and said how cool it was that I got a £20 tip. 

I would love to hear any advice you have. I'm talking to my coworker about swapping shifts for next week. Sorry about the length. Thank you so much for reading!",29Jan2020,1

714,"Obligatory first post and on mobile warning. 

I had gone through some horrendous abuse for 18 years until I ran away two years ago. I hadn’t really come to terms with how bad it really was and didn’t really speak much of its details until then. 
It affected me a lot growing up and altered my perception on things. I was always angry and bitter since I just didn’t want to accept what had been happening to me and always was on guard. 

I moved overseas and am doing much better out of that environment. I have my husband and met a ton of really cool people here. I’ve gotten close to 5+ people and have been seeing friends often. It’s weird, I feel like I finally have a normal life where I feel safe, calm, and loved. 
My uncle told me on the phone last night I am not the same person he recalls me being (in a good way) when I was still being abused. While I agree, there’s just one thing. 

These people are so kind to me. There’s no second meaning behind their words or actions. They genuinely love and care for me. They make me feel safe. 

But I hate it. 

There’s no fighting, no anger, nothing I have to look out for. Nope, just a loving husband and some genuine people I see as the family I never had. 

They always have my back and always want to do stuff with me. I don’t have to text them first or beg to see them. But when they’re all being nice to me, I have a wave of melancholy come over me and I have to withdraw from them. 
I’ll not answer my phone for a while and leave people on read; scared of having conversations with them even though I know i love them and would love to interact. 

I just feel exhausted when people are nice to me. 
I don’t know why there’s no fighting and no one is trying to hurt me. 
My whole life I’ve always been on guard because of the dickheads who hurt me for 18 years. 
Now I don’t need to be.

723,"Now I say ""ex"" but to be clear we were not official, we were just exclusive and did things normal relationships do. But to provide a short back story I was with her for 3 months. Met her mom and her friends and all that, I was not hidden, they knew me and her were together. But she was just cheated on in her previous relationship which ended about a month before I started to see her. 

So to simply put it, the first few months me and her were together she was in the right mindset but one day she broke down and realized she was not ready yet for anything serious. So we talked about it and we both agreed she is in the right completely, she is going to take her time by herself to find her happiness and get her feet back on the ground. She still wants to be friends,  but I do not know if this will be healthy for me. I really like her a lot and saw myself with her for a while I thought. She expressed that this decision was not about me, she thinks i am great like I think she is, she just needs space but does not want me to leave her completely. 

Should I stay friends with her? Is this a good idea to help her rebuild herself and be there for her, in the hopes that she will want me on the other side? Of course I will not stay friends with her just to hope she ends up with me, I care about her on a human level so I want to help her through this, but is there the chance she rekindles things with me after she gets through her heartbreak?

I have some really big problems with the way I am feeling about my job. I want to discuss this stuff with my boss in an open manner. I’m a contractor. I want to be hired full time. I’m only 23 and this is my first “real,” 40hr/wk job out of college. Some of the issues I have are:

- Feeling torn between two teams. I am a part of one team, but I work more with another one. This makes me feel stuck in between two teams and like I’m not important to either of them.

- I don’t have a clear vision or fit into the other work on the team. This ends up making me feel like I am left behind.

- I feel like I’m often left out of important information

Here is what I want to know:

-What steps can I take to improve or change? I want to contribute and feel like I’m making an impact but I often feel like I don’t.

- a lot of my work feels like busy work, or an afterthought. I feel like I’m in a silo with my specific line of work. How can we have conversations about how to proceed with my work in mind to integrate it better along the team (I work on web analytics)

Are these fair questions? Is it a good idea just to be transparent with him and talk this over? Do I even matter because I’m a contractor? Contractors are treated very differently on my team, but we are still contractors. And that really sucks a lot of the time.",29Jan2020,1

731,"a little background: my parents were divored when i was 9, and my mom had primary care. this summer she switched my schools without me knowing, i switched back to home school and now live with my dad. my brother still lives with her. i'm 17 right now.

when i was moving out a lot of things came out about my mom. she hadn't taken me or my brother to the doctor for 3 years, we both had glasses that were outdated/broken, and my living conditions were less than savory. while living with her she pretty much treated me like an ""other"" and wouldn't listen to my problems. i lived in the basement with only 3 walls (one has a hole, and i have sheets to make up for the 4th one not existing). it gets so cold downstairs it's hard to sleep. she hasn't done anything in almost a year to fix any of this.

as i told her i was moving i described how i felt incredibly unimportant and borderline suicidal, and she told me that maybe i needed to go to the mental hospital instead (in an aggressive tone, not caring). a couple days later she gave me her ""offer"" to move out of her boyfriend's house we'd moved into months prior, but she said if she moved out she'd kill herself. i told her i believed i had anxiety, she played it off. i've been to a doctor now and she is sure i do. this was even before moving into her boyfriend's house.

moving in with her boyfriend was where our relationship started to decline. i am not comfortable with him at all, but she still forced me into his home. i cried and told her my feelings, but she wouldn't listen. he grows weed (it's legal) and my brother and i would smell like it constantly. my brother still does smell everytime we pick him up. it is disgusting.

despite everything, i want to avoid hostility. but deep down i just want to leave her behind. she has hurt my brother and i, she avoids responsibility, and she doesn't listen. i don't want to leave her, but i can't take it knowing what she's doing. i always joke with my girlfriend that i want to take her to court, but i honestly do. both my dad and i don't feel she takes good enough care of my brother. i know she'd hold it against me forever, but it's difficult being thrown back into a home that feels the farthest from the word every other weekend.

732,"I know this post will sound a little bit dumb and paranoid, but believe me, I'm sure something is wrong.

Ever since I was young, I didn't really have to do much for school. I always was lazy and did the minimum to get good grades. But since I was really quiet (because of social anxiety) and paid attention in class, my teachers thought I studied a lot.

At the end of last year, I was asked by one of my teachers how much I did for school, in percent. I said 40%.
He then asked if I just did my homework and haven't done any additional exercises. I thought by that, he meant exercises besides homework, like you know, exercising for math everyday. I said no. I did study, but as I said, I did the minimum. I studied at the last second, not really giving much effort. Also, I didn't always do my homework, which the teachers didn't notice.
Apparently he also meant studying.

I won't go into detail, but I saw my teachers doing and saying things that indicate that they think I lied, or am imagining that I'm so good I don't have to do anything. Doesn't help that lately I have relaxed a little bit and started doing less for school, since I gave my best these last few months. And I also kind of didn't do what my teachers told me to because I was too lazy lol
I know it sounds pretty paranoid, but even my friends noticed something is wrong.

Should I speak to my teachers about it? If so, how should I go on about it? I thought about asking them if something is wrong, and mentioning that we maybe misunderstood each other.

735,"Pretty much like the title says. I logged into my dads Navient account instead of mine on accident, and saw that he paid off my sisters loans in full last month. They did this without telling me or asking if I needed help with my own.

A little background, I only have about $15,000 in loans because I was on academic scholarship for 4 years and worked two jobs to support myself. I have two sisters who go to the state school close to home, they never earned any scholarships and neither of them have jobs. I found out that my dad paid $100,000 in full towards their student loans, so basically they have nothing to worry about when they graduate. 

Now that I’m graduated, I’ve got a decent job and the means to pay a monthly sum towards my loans. The problem here isn’t that I don’t want to work towards making those payments myself, my feelings are just hurt that my parents apparently did not think of me when they helped out my sisters. How can I go about bringing this up with them?",29Jan2020,1
736,"I started working at McDonalds a month ago and I think the job is okay enough to tolerate (I previously worked at Wendy’s for 6 months, I know how fast food works).

737,"So quite often when I get home from work there are these two alcoholic dudes who drink outside my apartment building. They are often right in your way when you are trying to get into the building and you have to death stare them to get them to move (they don't live here by way). Its very annoying especially when I'm tired after work as they are often their for hours and I can hear them from my window (they are very loud and often very drunk). They always leave a big mess afterwards and never clean up their garbage.

Its also very intimidating for my girlfriend if she comes to visit and they are their.

What is a way I get them to not want to hang out their anymore and go somewhere else? I don't mind unethical suggestions as I hate these fuckers.

738,"This past Sunday I decided to drop acid with some friends of mine, I've been seeing my girl for a little over a few months, and it's getting serious. Her a pre-med school and I am pre-law I asked her if she had any objections to me doing this, and she told me it was ok. So I proceeded to take it while I was around the peak of my trip. I texted her asking if I could stay at her on-campus apartment, she was very reluctant; still, I pressed telling her I couldn't stay at my boy's house because there was no room ( this wasn't true) I told her I just wanted to see her for an hour then I would sleep in my car till I could drive again in the morning. This went back and forth for a few minutes she offered to drive me home because she had a long day the next day with classes and her sorority (it is rush week here, and she's so busy going out every night at my old university I was in a frat I know how it is even though it is tough not being able to see her a lot after being apart for a few weeks), Still, i pushed to come over, and when I walked over, she let me in and took care of me, but I could tell even in my state that something was wrong. I tried to leave, and she got angry when I did, so I just stayed. During the night, every time I tried to cuddle with her or brushed up against her, she jumped, eventually we attempted to have sex, but I couldn't get it up because I felt awful about ruining her day and not letting her get some rest. The next day in the morning I promised I wouldn't do that stuff again and flushed the rest of what I had in front of her we parted ways, and I decided to give her space. On Tuesday, we texted she said she couldn't make our dinner plans for today because of sorority stuff and I asked to get my clothes from her apartment, and I wanted to talk to her. When I arrive, I asked her if we still had a future together and if she always wanted me. She said she was scared and confused I pressed for answers she told me that an ex of hers used to trip and beat her its something shes never told anyone besides me I kept telling her I would never imagine hurting her and she said she knows but is scared I she cried I cried because I don't want to lose her. We talked, and we left it at that we are still together; she needs a few days to gather herself because of what I did bring up old trauma. when I put my clothes in my bag I told her im leaving her favorite hoodie of mine so I set it on her bed it got a smile out of her. I then asked to see her later in the week, and she said either Thursday or Saturday. Lather last night, she texted me, telling me she appreciates me for listening and understanding bc shes never told anyone, I thanked her for confiding in me, and she just sent me a bunch of hearts. We talked briefly this morning shes getting sick, and I feel so bad still, I keep obsessing over what happened constantly checking Snapchat maps even though I told her I would talk to her after class.  
I guess what I'm asking is what do I do now that I've been given this second chance and this new information. I wish she would have told me because I wouldn't have done it. I don't know how to go about talking to her about it; I think she needs to see someone, I see a therapist for my anxiety, and I want her to be happy. Should I text her tm asking if we are seeing each other? I just want to be around her.",29Jan2020,1
739,"Throwaway because I don't want this case on my actual account where it can be linked to my other socials. 

So basically, my paternal grandfather died on Sunday-Monday night, cardiac arrest. He and his partner, a woman with advanced dementia (we'll call her T), lived in an old barrack after my grandmother died. They shared their pension, taxes, even families. Shortly after T moved in, my grandfather stopped having any contact with his family. He stopped visiting grandma's grave, which he did everyday, sometimes even twice a day, since the moment she died. He didn't allow us to visit as she wasn't very fond of us, so basically, the last time I saw my dear grandfather had to be around 5-7 years ago (excluding today, when I saw him in a coffin). 

But he made sure to call my dad every month to ""borrow"" money he never returned. Small amounts, 50-200 dollars (we're not from the US but I tried to calculate it). It wasn't a problem for us as my father makes good money. We just didn't know what it was for. Their pension together would've been around 2000 dollars. In our country, it's above average. 

My grandpa died and everything ""walked out of the trashcan"". We learned he got a loan for T's grandchild's birthday. He got the child a $3000 computer. He didn't pay it all back, so now my dad has a $1000 loan to pay for a child's gift he never even met. Well, the thing is, I never got anything from him. My siblings never did. My cousins never did. Not a single stupid bar of chocolate. Yet he bought another child, completely not related to him in any way or not even respecting him (as we heard from the neighbours), a freaking $3000 computer. Let me get deeper into it.

Turns out, he paid for T's bills, too. He paid for her groceries. He paid for her toiler paper. He paid for her hairdresser. Where did that money come from? From my father, who was happy to lend it to his dad. 

Today was the funeral. T didn't come. We were told from the neighbours, that the day my grandpa died, T just got up, realized he's dead, and went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Meanwhile she asked the neighbour to call the ambulance and all that. The neighbour was shocked how much she didn't care to do it, or even about the fact that her SO of 15 years was just lying in the same bed, cold and dead. Allegedly, T then called her daughter to come over and help her pack things.

Why do I think it's weird? My grandpa had amazing health and he felt just fine before. Now, I know that cardiac arrest can just happen and there's sometimes nothing you can do about it, but it's suspicious regardless. The barracks they lived in were built before WWI, so they were going to be demolished this year and my grandpa got a plain new flat nearby, for free from the government. He was actually supposed to be moving tomorrow, but he died suddenly. When T and her children found out that she never legally co-owned anything, she was so shocked you should've seen it with your own eyes. That's it: I think she, or her family, or whatever killed my grandfather.

They always visited the same time of the month, the day the pension came. No one in the barracks liked them. They obviously only just wanted money from my grandpa. Everyone wanted to warn him, to kick that woman (T) out, but he didn't listen. He didn't want to see us (or she didn't). He stopped calling us for Christmas (or picking up from us). He was their money machine, and even without those murder allegations, it was obvious to everyone.

But these are just it, allegations. I don't have any solid proof. He's deep down in the soil so there's no way a toxicology test could've been run. But I'm sure he didn't die naturally. Such a perfect time to get a free flat, their mutual savings and get rid of an old man you never even respected. Well, I can't call the police as I don't have really any proof. There's much more to the story (feel free to ask), but really no proof it could've been staged. I'm not sure what to do. I feel sick thinking these people are just walking freely while my grandpa is already rotting.",29Jan2020,1

742,"Hi!! 

I’m a fairly popular artist on instagram, and I’ve been using my platform for a long time to help me pay for my bills, college, and buy groceries. I’ve always gained heavy traction on my posts, and even after several minutes I already have at least a thousand likes.

Recently I think I was shadowbanned, and it wasn’t so bad. No one was able to discover my account, and I didn’t get any new followers, but likes didnt dwindle, and people still saw my stories. 

Today however, I posted and there has only been about 30 likes in the past 30 minutes, and I don’t have any viewers on my recent story. 

I know it sounds so stupid and probably shallow, but this account is truly what is paying for most of my life right now. I work a job that typically has me working 10 hours shifts, but one check from that job isn’t even enough for my rent.

744,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. I have had many people try and help me create a Beer Olympics schedule for this Saturday and none of us can do it without there being at least one repeat matchup (which I am trying to avoid). 

Here is the scenario: 8 teams, 5 games = 5 rounds. 2 teams play head to head each round. All teams should play every game, but not play a game more than once and not play the same opponent twice. 

For example:   

Round 1

Beer Pong          1 v 8

Flip Cup              2 v 7

Corn Hole          3 v 6

Quarters            4 v 5

Beer Ball            Not played this round (must be played in the remaining 4 rounds)

I hope the example makes sense. There are 28 possible matchups with only 20 slots (4 matchup for 5 rounds), so I feel this has to be possible.

748," Here’s some backstory. I’ve been babysitting this 18 month old for about 4 months. His father has been a friend of mine for awhile. He’s not the nicest person but he’s never been mean to me. He has a reputation for fighting a lot and flying off the handle. I don’t want to be rude but they are not the smartest people around. The father thinks he knows it all and nothing is able to change his mind when he’s upset. He’s very unstable. The baby has recently started having what’s described as night terrors at home. His mother came and asked me if my children were fighting him for toys. I told her my kids are much older and don’t really pay him any mind. They like to go to the park after school and my daughter is always reading in her reading nook. 

 I explained it could be a number of things and I’d do some research and see what we could do to make this better! Then she added that the father suggested that it was my boyfriend. He said he used to “beat him up” a lot in high school and wondered if he was taking it out on the baby. This instantly upset me. My boyfriend is caring and compassionate and has helped me raise twins. He even sometimes tells me I’m being too hard on my own children. So I told her there was no way that was possible because he loved kids and he was at work most of the day and come straight home to shower, eat and play a little Xbox before going to bed. 

 I did a little research and sure enough being overtired is a cause of “night terrors” and the mother has instructed me before to keep the baby awake all day and keep him awake until she comes at 11 pm to pick him up so she can sleep at night. She had problems when I was letting him nap for an hour at 3 pm and putting him to sleep at 8 with him “being up all night”

 Now onto my question. Should I opt out of babysitting this child anymore? I worry about the father of the child seeing my boyfriend out somewhere and attacking him or me.  I also worry that instead of taking him to a pediatrician or doing any research on how to help with this that they find a reason to blame my kids or how I’m taking care of this baby. I truly do fear the father because he is so unstable and always thinks he’s right. He is the type of person who yelled at me for standing at the bus stop with the baby in the rain under an umbrella. I don’t want this to fizz into an uncontrollable situation. I truly need advice on the next steps to take. I love having this baby around he makes my days better I would hate to have to stop watching him but I do fear for the safety of my boyfriend and me.",29Jan2020,1

754,"Hi everyone. I posted on r/relationship_advice and didn’t get more than one comment. Posting here in hopes I can get some more advice to think about. I don’t have anyone in my life I currently feel comfortable talking about these things with, so I appreciate any feedback. 

I am struggling with my long term relationship and am seeking out some opinions on this. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 

Me (F26) and my boyfriend (M30) have been together for over six years. The past year of our relationship has been very hard. About 2 years ago, I was feeling unsatisfied with being in a relationship and wanted to break up. My aunt also came to visit from out of town around that time and I told her how I was feeling about my relationship. I eventually expressed my feelings to him, but I decided we could stay together and we didn’t break up. 

Few months later,  we moved to a new city. I ended up meeting and hanging out with a new group of people. I would occasionally go out with these people, but my boyfriend couldn’t join most of the time as he would often have to work early in the morning and couldn’t go out that night. He trusted me to go out at night with people he didn’t know very well. However, I ended up emotionally cheating on him with a guy from this friend group. I would talk to this guy all day everyday, and my boyfriend knew something was up because he could tell I was distancing myself from him. This led to me waking up in the middle of the night several times to him looking through my phone and the conversations I have been having with this guy. Obviously, my boyfriend was very upset by this. I went out of town to visit my aunt, and my aunt and I stayed up late having the same conversation about my relationship. I was also talking to this other guy A LOT while I was gone, and even told him about my issues with my relationship and how I wanted to end things. By the time I got back from this trip, I was 100% sure it was time to end things. 

I came back and broke up with my boyfriend on grounds that I no longer want to be in a relationship. He’s not a bad guy, I just don’t feel like he’s the one for me and I’ve been in back to back LTR, so I have this really strong desire to explore life on my own as an independent adult. We were broken up for a month and it was hell. I cut off contact with the guy I was speaking with because I didn’t care to have a relationship with him and I had too much going on in my life to talk to other people like that. My boyfriend became depressed. Drinking a lot, not eating enough. I was very concerned about his health. We still lived together and he was begging for me back all the time. One night, he threatened to commit suicide and I was VERY close to calling the cops. He also punched a hole in our bathroom door during a heated argument. Anyways, we eventually ended up getting back together. We moved away from that city and the horrible memories of this chapter of our relationship as soon as the apartment lease was up. I hoped things would get better. 

However, since then our relationship (understandably) hasn’t been the same. I feel like there is a lot of resentment between both of us. Me towards him for keeping me in this relationship and him towards me for not being a dependable truth worthy partner. 

But I can’t get this fantasy of living on my own and being completely independent out of my head. I feel like the reasons I want to break up aren’t valid, especially knowing how much pain it causes him. However, I have been unhappy for at least two years now. I want to break up with him again, and I don’t think these feelings are going to go away. 

He is very self conscious about our relationship. He constantly needs me to tell him how much I love him, how I’m his forever, and how we will eventually get married. I tell him what he wants to hear, because I can’t bring myself to tell him otherwise. I don’t want to hurt him, but I didn’t feel like I’m growing as a person in this relationship. It’s really hard on me when I feel like I’m constantly lying to him about our future. 

In a few days I’ll be going on a solo trip, and I am planning on using that alone time to really think about this and reflect on my life. I am scared I’m going to come back and break up with him again and go through the same hell we did before.


TLDR - been with boyfriend for six years. I’ve been having thoughts about breaking up for the past two years. We broke up once last year and it was very painful and stressful for the both of us and we got back together, but I can’t get the thought of breaking up with him out of my head even though I’m scared to go through it again because I’m very worried about his well being if we break up again.",29Jan2020,1
755,"Hey everyone :)

So I know that sexuality is something which is very personal to everybody, and that i'm the only one who can really figure this out for myself, but i was hoping for some advice :)

So, for a long while I've always kind of thought that i'm bisexual. I definitely like girls (i'm female BTW :) ) and for most of my life i suppose I've just never really questioned whether i'd be into guys- it was something i always just... Never considered? 

But recently I've kind of been considering how i really feel. I thought i'd had a couple of crushes on guys, but now i'm really thinking about it i don't? See them like that? Those crushes have either been fictional characters I've just really loved or friends I've eventually realised were never really proper crushes- and, IDK? i'm a little confused because it seems as though a lot of what I've taken as fact for a long time is changing so quickly.

I think I'm beginning to feel a lot more comfortable identifying as a lesbian than bisexual, but a) I'm scared I'll realise I was wrong if I ever meet a guy, and b) I don't know how weird it would be if i came out as a lesbian when I've mentioned 'crushes' on guys to people I know.

But- basically the thing i really wanted to ask is- I find guys good-looking. Like, there are guys I'll see and think 'yes, they're good-looking, and yes, they have a nice personality'- but can I see them with me? Not really. And i suppose I was just wondering whether this would make me a lesbian or not? I don't think I could ever see myself with a boy, but I- yeah I don't know, to be honest :)

759,"Ok so quick backstory, me and this girl (both 15) have known each other for a while now, I think like just over a year, and a couple months ago, I started to get feelings for her and asked her out, but she had told me a lil bit before hand that she never felt like she loved someone before. But I told her because one of my friends told someone to tell her that I had a crush on her (we both go to different schools, both same sex). So when I told her, I said I didn’t want it to ruin our relationship that we had, so we just stayed as friends. I think the main reason I had a crush on her though was that she was pretty much the only person in my life who genuinely complemented me and was nice to me. Like, pretty much all of my friends are boys the same age as me so we just dick around and insult each other. It used to bother me but I’ve just gotten used to it now and it never really bothers me. But back to the girl, I felt like, and still do, she was the only one I could really open up to and properly talk to about anything like my problems and shit cause she did the same.

Ok but  now it’s a lot more recent, and about a week ago I found out she had a crush, so as a sort of bit, I kept on asking her who it was. And on Monday at around 1am, she told me that it was me. I thought she was lying at first cause she was doing a bit where she was just being retarded, but then I asked her like genuinely, if it was me, cause I still kinda felt like I had feelings for her. But the problem is, I’ve had that feeling for a while now, but I’ve just been pushing it down and telling myself that she doesn’t feel the same way about me. But so when she told me it was genuine, I was just kinda confused. I told her that I felt the same way and had done for a while but she didn’t want it to ruin the relationship we already had, and neither did I. 

We had a long talk about it after we both got home which lasted around like 30 mins, and we decided that we should just stay friends. But she before that she just kept on saying that she wanted me to forget about what she said and just move on, but I really wanted time just to think about it and so after a lil bit, she said she would give me time and we could talk about it tomorrow (which was the same day cause bear in mind it was 1am)

But so yeah after we talked, it didn’t really affect me. Like I didn’t want to miss this opportunity cause it was important to me, but I also didn’t want to ruin our friendship. 

And yesterday (Tuesday) she sent me a meme that said something like “ok so I have a crush on you but let’s just forget about it and move on ☺️” and I was thinking that maybe it’s just how she is and doesn’t wanna talk about it cause that’s just normal. Nobody really wants to fully open up all the time.

She was in a relationship with someone for about 2 months but they broke up the day before New Year’s Eve and I’ve got a feeling in the back of my mind that this is sorta just a rebound thing cause a lil bit ago she said that she feels like she isn’t loved anymore after the breakup. We pretty much talk everyday and they always last a while, so we do have a really good relationship together. But I’m just wondering whether this is something I should chase up and actually pursue, or if I should just leave it like she said.

Any help is appreciated, thanks",29Jan2020,1
760,"Ok, so, this is a bit long, but bear with me. This is also, partially my fault, but it’s gone a bit too far and I’m getting nervous. Here’s what’s happening.


I have known this kid (we’ll call him C) since the beginning of the school year. I’m not a particularly social person, but I try to be friendly with most people unless they give me a reason to be mean, so I was relatively friendly with this kid.

But immediately he got kind of overly-friendly, he called me his “good friend” even though we didn’t really talk other than simple polite hello’s at the beginning of class (and even that was only because we sat at the same table). He tried to give me his snapchat and would put his hand on my shoulder and tell me that I “always made his day” and that he always looked forward to seeing me. At first I assumed C had some sort of crush on me, or he was just weird.

But the first semester ended, and I started taking animation, where, wouldn’t you know it, there he was!

Once again, polite hello’s, simple small talk. A classroom icebreaker question C answered made me assume he was just a friendly person, and led me into a very very false sense of security. Very soon after the semester started, C asked, “Do you have an instagram??”.

This is where I made a big mistake, and stupidly gave C my instagram.

This is where things got really uncomfortable and weird.

He messaged me CONSTANTLY. At first it was just small talk like hobbies and favorite movies, but then it got really weird. He went on this rant about being a communist and how he though 9/11 had left a positive impact on America. And for some reason I continued talking to him.

The next day C introduced me to a friend of his, neither of us cared, or wanted to be introduced to each other, and he got weirdly concerned about making me uncomfortable and apologized, but said that “I couldn’t hide away in my little corner forever” and that he hoped I knew that I was loved and that he was always there for me, which was a really uncomfortable thing to hear from someone you barely know. 

Now, my parents divorce left me with a lot of trust issues and whatnot, so at first I thought that “Oh, maybe to most people this is a normal thing and I’m just weird and antisocial”, but I spoke with my family and therapist, and everyone seemed a little concerned about this.

Me and my dad think “maybe he wants me to open up”, and so I open up a tiny bit about my feelings and thoughts surrounding the movie  A Marriage Story (a very painful movie to watch, even if your parents didn’t go through a super messy divorce) and he responds with a simple “Oh” and completely changes the subject to good will and vintage games?? So I guess that isn’t the answer.

C continues to message me, I begin messaging him simple “haha” “oh interesting/cool/good/fun”, very low effort responses to everything he’s saying, hoping maybe he’ll take the hint and lay off. C continues to say weird things, calling me cute and saying I’m like “a girl version” of himself and asking weird questions, I have this weird feeling it isn’t some sort of harmless crush.

Weird comments are sprinkled throughout.
“I love manipulating people’s opinions and feelings with propaganda”
“A communist instagram followed me, you think it’s my call to action?”
“I’m an authoritarian, if force is necessary, so be it”

Last night C messaged me saying how he wishes public executions were still a thing, because it would show people to shut up and prove a point, (I looked at the messages and he actually deleted these specific ones, I took a screenshot when he sent them though, if proof is needed).

C has continued to message me, asking where I was during lunch (hiding in the bathroom), asking how my day’s going. I have not responded.

I want to unfollow him or block him, but I’m scared to do anything now, I’ll unfollow and block him after school, but I’m scared that I’ll still be seeing him everyday during eighth period (I also would rather not sit in a gross warm bathroom for twenty minutes during lunch, but I will if necessary). We also have a mutual friend who is a bit odd in a nerdy sense, but friendly and has done nothing to freak me out, so I don’t want to ruin that friendship in the process, but in all honesty? I’m willing to if it means getting C to leave me alone.


At this point I’m having three issues/questions.

1. Is this normal? Am I just overreacting?
2. Is this dangerous? Should I be more concerned than I already am?
3. What do I do to stop this without putting myself in an unsafe situation? (Even if it is normal, it’s making me incredibly uncomfortable)

765,"  I have severe social anxiety. Until recently I was almost a complete shut-in. I only went outside for school and depended on other people to buy me clothes groceries and it went on for 5-6 years. I am 18 years old now. Anyway people around me are bullying me. Almost everyone my family is very difficult. My classmates have spat on me and insulted me and even threatened to harm me. After a while I complained to teacher but they said that I was delusional that it was only in my head and that they weren't talking about me and they were only spitting on the floor.Now just to make this clear they were walking right behind me and were spitting countless times while insulting me and kicking the floor. Everybody thinks I am insane and completely incapable of doing anything on my own. Recently I managed to go to the store and even that was a giant step for me. I overheard one of my classmates saying that the girl who worked there almost didn't serve me but the boss was standing right there so she had to. And they said that i should kill myself like my mother did. People on the streets, people who I don't even know look at me strangely. My teachers aren't even trying to even pretend to be nice to me. And i have 0 friends and have a difficult time even going outside. I am very afraid because it almost seems that if I am ever in serious trouble that anybody could harm me and nobody would even care. I am very passive and almost forget all the times they insulted me. But also on the other hand it makes me want to do more and to be tougher, more assertive, to try harder because they already hate me and want me dead so at least I could put some resistance.

772,"Hi, I am in my last semester of college, and had room to put one class in from place of passion, so I enrolled in both Spanish and Metalsmithing and I have ZERO IDEA which one to drop, or keep both?

For Spanish, I am enrolled in the basic 101, even though I took 3 years in high school, but that was three years ago, and Ive worked in kitchens and jobs where I used it sparingly, the reason I took it was to hopefully use it as a base before I graduate and try to work towards fluency after college for the sake of my job and being accessible to Latin American communities in the US, also, I think it's just good to know a second language.

For metalsmithing, I took a year in high school and really enjoy it, the class is fun and way different than anything I've done before, it's enlightening taking a class that is a process where you build things, the professor is a good guy and I enjoy way more than the Spanish professor. And it's less work so I can focus more on my other core curriculum.

If I wanted to, I could keep both, but that would mean I would have to take two required courses this summer instead of one. Which would be hefty in workload, and hard for me to look for jobs and career stuff being enrolled in two summer courses, but also would allow me to take both and enjoy the last time I can really do something like this.

My main thing is, if I drop one, I'd like to be able to pursue the other after college, and if Spanish or Metals is easier to pursue after college, I'll drop one of them and enroll in a course after college to do that.",29Jan2020,1

774,"Hello r/Advice community. I am writing today to express my despair regarding my home situation. 

To give you a background - I am a 21 year old Indian guy, have been suffering from OCD/Depressive disorder for the last 9 years, since I was 12 years old. Parents found out at 15 when I drowned an entire bottle of toilet cleaner and got diagnosed with pneumonia (that's when they saw the cuts). 3 years later, I wanted to move away from home because my home environment was very very hostile and negative. Mom would call me a Retard for taking Anti depressants and call me hideous/ugly(which was very impactful because I had Body Dysmorphia/OCD). 

So after finishing high school, I wanted to go someplace else because of too many bad memories, so applied to schools in Toronto and got in. My father is very kind and took an education loan for me to go study their. 

Note - I have a twin sister who has a grudge against me. Why, comes later in the story. 

Now as I landed in university in Toronto. First few months went by okayish. But as I reached December I relapsed and was suicidal again and admitted myself into the hospital. Got discharged a few days later and ended up failing my finals. 

So my family was pretty scared naturally. Then the same thing happened again in the winter sem, and kept happening until I got academic probation. 

Summary as of now - Dad spent a shit ton of money on me and I failed in almost all my courses and got academic probation. So now all that money that wasted which could've been used for my sister's education is now gone. 

So I come home after the probation to an even more hostile environment where my mom and sister are periodically reminding me about how big of a failure I am, and how I wasted a shit ton of money. 

Although, my dad put me in therapy (CBT) which had helped alot. But the environment is still driving me crazy. 


The issue that arises now is that - I can't fully heal until either my mom and sister stop mocking me and shitting on me OR I leave home. 

Also, before you say it - I have tried talking to my mom and sister a million times but they always end up getting back to me saying that all they are saying is justified because I am nothing/failure. 

I know they mean well but if I run away from home, my dad will be super sad(his work is already super stressful), I don't want to do this to him, but I will be torn apart if I stay at home. 

I have no friends here in Delhi, and the only person I used to share with was my therapist.

779,"Long story short: I(25)M meet Her(25F) over the summer from the dating app hinge. First date went great stayed to bar past closing and made out like lost lovers. We began going on more dates and I stated to like her. However, I noticed reg flags like flaky behavior and she took her time to get back texting. Very spoiled and entitled parents pay for her lifestyle and apartment(still in school). But I began to ignore them because I had some feelings.  Thought she was attracted to me because every time we hung out we had fun and hooked up. About a month and a half in she became very busy out of all the sudden but still texting me leading me on. After not like seeing each other for three weeks we finally planed to hang. On the day We were supposed to hang out she texting before that something bad happened. I texted her what happened and if everything was OK and she told me “not now”. The next day she texted me I should MoveOn. I was upset but I said OK I moved on. 

Fast forward to November. I get a text from her at a nowhere saying that she’s been meaning to reach out for a while and made a huge mistake and that she was very sorry about what happened. I knew that in there I should’ve blocked her number and deleted the text. But me being the fool I was sad that she did nothing wrong and there’s nothing to be sorry about. We began texting more and we hung out but this time we was just looking for apartments for her but we kissed at end. And other time we got food at a diner and she showed up high as a kite and wouldn’t tell me where she was before and said she would tell me one day. 

After that she began to go dark on me again and I saw where this was going. Not to sound weird I did not have her on any social media she never added me back on Snapchat when I tried. However for some reason I had her Venmo I guess it Syncs your contacts. I saw that she was getting stuff from my guy for her birthday in August. That is in between the time when I saw her in the summer( told me to move on In July) and after she reached out to me in November. I did some NSA investigative work on social media and I found out it was her boyfriend. I texted her calling her out but realized it was not worth it. She was already beginning to Ghost. 

After having some time and think about this and reflect. I realize that you should never chase are going for people who don’t value you. You have to go with your gut feeling when it doesn’t feel good as much as you were physically and emotionally attracted to them. Unfortunately our brains are hardwired do you attracted to people who aren’t good for us and our self esteem. This girl for me was like a black widow. In nature the female black widow spider Kills the male after they mate usually and she eats him. I’m not in any need to jump into a relationship with anyone right now. But I know in the future what I want and how to be treated I hope you all would want the same. You should never be anyone second option or back up choice. If they didn’t want you at first he shouldn’t have you after coming out of another failed relationship. You should always value Someone who sees you as number one.",29Jan2020,1
780,"Greetings! I'm a sushi apprentice under a traditional Japanese master. It's the most peaceful and centering part of my life. My sensai is like a father to me. The job involves making sushi in an open bar, and then calling the orders to servers. This happens in dozens of micro-exchanges per hour.

I believe one of our servers has textbook Munchausen Syndrome. This person only feels seen while suffering, therefore takes every opportunity to be negative about something. Complaints about the customers, about fellow coworkers, about their other job, about therapists and their family issues. It is truly exhausting. I cannot ask this person to leave the space, or not to communicate with me because those are both parts of the job.

787,"So here is the backstory:

  So did anyone have those weird ""relationships"" when they were young? Like when you were like seven and for an example you used to play house and then there was a mom and a dad and for about a week those people were ""girlfriend and boyfriend"" and you would have pretend weddings and all that? Well I was no different. So me and this guy (let's just call him E) had that weird relationship and then it was over after like a week and we played something else and life went on. (This section happened when we were 7-8 years old)

  After some years me and E were no longer friends and he was always mean to me. For an example I was youngest in the class so he would get all my classmates to play with him and when I asked to play he said something along the lines of ""Sorry we are nine we don't play with eight year olds!"" And then when I turned nine it was ""We only play with 9,5 year olds!"" And so on. And when I got second place in this sports thing he made his friend pass a note to me which said ""You probably cheated!"" And then he thought it would be fun to chase me around the school with his friends every day for a week. (was not fun) (This section happened when we were 9 years old)

  Then for a few years E finally leaves me alone and I forget most of the previous things I listed and I become really happy. (This section happened when we were 10 - 12 years old)

  But then for some unknown reason when we went to secondary school he started to tell his new friends I was his ex-girlfriend! WHAT THE DUCK. He had those weird kid relationships with other girls that were in our class yet he never calls them his ex-girlfriend! He (and his sister) also started to tell really mean rumors about me being a horrible person which also spread to a part of my new class. He also spread it to some other people who give me weird stares. Because of all this I have gone home a lot of times crying. I'm not going to go into too much detail about that now but I probably will another time. But yeah, I have been in secondary school for almost the whole time I have to be there now and I can't wait to get out. I already know where I want to go and I really love that school!

   I went to this camp thing last summer and had a lot of fun and wanted to become an instructor there but then when I went to the first training thing there E was! (and also a girl who I trusted and really liked but then I heard her talk crap about me with E)

  Should I tell all this to an adult? Should I just stay quiet until the last day of school (because E doesn't know I know he talks crap about me) and tell him then how much I hate him? What do you all think I should do because I have gotten a lot of anxiety from this?

799,"We’ve been together for 4 1/2 years and we’ve had many ups and downs. Things were PERFECT for the first few months of our relationship. I’ve never experienced happiness the way I did back then. All of our friends would tell us how jealous they were of our relationship, how we were perfect for each other, that they wished they could have a relationship like ours, etc. We both ended up getting addicted to opiates and it changed us a lot and it caused massive massive problems and serious fights everyday. But after we got clean it’s like everything became perfect again. We still had the occasional fight like every couple, but it went from being everyday to MAYBE once every month or two, and instead of screaming, cussing, calling every name in the book, it was more so disagreements instead of arguments, no yelling, no name calling, no cussing etc. well that lasted for a while but now in the last few weeks for some reason he’s been starting a lot of arguments and it seems like he gets mad at me for EVERYTHING I say and do. Sometimes even things that I did innocently and didn’t see how it could be a problem in any way shape or form but he would still somehow make it to be one. And now he’s starting the yelling, the cussing and the name calling again. It really hurts me. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him all the time again. And then the worst part is EVERYTIME he turns it around and says I’m the one that’s starting it and I did this and that, when I would be in a perfectly fine mood and have no reason to start an argument. I live with him and his family and everytime, he tells me I have to leave and that he doesn’t want to be with me he doesn’t want me around and nobody in his house wants me here. But the thing is I have sooo much stuff here including a giant hamster cage, it would take hours to get all my stuff together and I know how this little game goes and in a day or two tops he’ll be wanting to get back together and I’m not hauling all my stuff back and forth from my dads house to his every other day. Also, before when he would do this, it hurt a lot and it sucked, but at least if I would have to go to my parents house I would have my dog and my mom with me, she was my best friend. So I would be heart broken over our “breakup” and my mom would be there to talk to me and give me advice and company. But my mom died in May of 2019 and my dog was given away because nobody was there to care for her anymore, so I’d literally be so alone, with absolutely no one, in the house that my mom died in, heart broken like all the other times only this time itd be 10x worse because I’d have nobody to talk to or be there for me, while also constantly being reminded of the memory of my moms death (also, I was the one that had to find her and I will never forget her face when I did. It was dark purple. So that’s already traumatizing as it is) and then my dog isn’t there either which is just one more thing to add to the list of heart break. The house feels cold and empty as it is, I haven’t stayed there in almost a year besides the occasional visit for a few hours to see my dad but he’s gone almost all the time, working and then doing other things when he’s off. Then after he’s not mad anymore he expects me to get over it and act like nothing happened, without even talking about it or getting an apology. And most the time I do it just because I know if I don’t it will lead to more arguments, but after this happening over and over I build a resentment and then I explode after he picks at me constantly and has a problem with everything I say and do. I literally cannot do anything right in his eyes. I mean I could breathe the wrong way and it would start an argument. I’m so tired of living like this. I have nobody, no friends, no where else to go besides my dads house which is lonely and miserable. And I get treated like dirt everyday. I don’t know what to do anymore. I literally do my best to AVOID making him mad, most the time now I sit there quietly on my phone or watching tv or something but I still manage to piss him off all the time. I can’t take this anymore but I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. If I stay, I’m miserable depressed and insecure because I can’t do anything right, if I go, I’m even more miserable and depressed, alone all the time, and reminded of my moms death everyday.

816,"A  year ago today I was in my car outside a Bunnings bleeding from my wrists. It was around 1 am and I had just got off the phone with my ex who yelled at me for trying to take my own life. Hours before she had come over to my apartment to break up with me and left in a hurry. How did I get myself into this predicament?

Back in 2018, I had met her through a mutual friend. She was visiting to my home country, Singapore and I decided the best thing to do was to take her all over and show her what Singapore had to offer. We had a great time together as I took her from one attraction to the other and we clicked instantly. A few days in and I could tell she fancied me, we started to hold hands and it felt surreal because I never had anyone take an interest in me. 

Eventually, she had to leave for home, Perth WA and we were both really sad but I agreed that I'd come to visit when I had the chance. We exchanged numbers and texted almost daily and after close to a month I finally had enough in savings to visit her, so I bought a ticket and flew over to Perth to see her. When I landed we couldn't stop hugging each other at the airport, this was only the start of 4 weeks together. She introduced me to her family, her dog, her cousins and we even went on a 7-day road trip together down south. It was everything that a guy could dream of in a relationship and we were official and inseparable, couldn't stop being apart from each other.

The trip came to an end, we had an amazing time together but I had to leave for home because I had a job back in Singapore. When I was about to leave she was a mess, in tears and wouldn't let me go. She told me to text her whenever I could and I agreed. When I got back everything was as per normal until a few weeks later, my gut feeling told me something just didn't seem right because she was starting to act distant and was slow to reply. I brushed it off because she would often give me reasons like she's just tired of texting and not me. 

A few months later she gave me an ultimatum, move or the relationship isn't going to work like this. I should've walked away then and there but this being my first relationship and the fact that I truly loved her, I wanted to be closer to her. I quit my job, sold my assets including my then dream car and applied for a visa to move to Australia so I could be closer to her and hope that this would allow the relationship to flourish. 

The moment I arrived at the airport she sort of gave me half a hug and that very night we slept in separate beds. My heart was in pieces that very night. When I confronted her about it all she told me was that she wanted space and wanted to build the relationship back up. Again my gut told me something was up but I just brushed it off and thought maybe she was having a bad day etc. She seemed to grow more and more distant to the point where she didn't even want to give me a hug, in fact, she made it seem like she hated me being around her. 

Moving to Australia alone wasn't easy, I stayed at her house whilst I had to look for an apartment a car and a job. When I found a place she didn't like it at all as it wasn't in the best of areas but what I could find at the time that was within my budget and when I bought a cheap Toyota corolla she asked me why I would buy a deathtrap like that? When I took her out for dinner dates or for anything else she would seem very uninterested. I felt worthless and lost, it felt like anything I did wasn't good enough anymore and I didn't understand what I did wrong or why. 

I took the initiative to sit down with her when I could meet her and ask her what was wrong and what I could do to help our relationship. She said everything was fine and that the relationship needed time and she wanted us to be together. After every sit-down session that we had, she would resort back to her old behavior and I finally got fed up and confronted her about how I felt. That's when she yelled at me in her parents' house and hit me. I cried that night without her knowledge, the person I loved had just put their hands on me and i was alone far away from my own family. I kept my mouth shut from thereon because at the time I couldn't leave, she/her family were all I had. 

Christmas of 2018 came rolling by and I was really excited as I came from a family that didn't celebrate Christmas so it was very first. I had a lot of love for her family so I got really great gifts for all of them including my ex-girlfriend who never showed any appreciation for any of the gifts I got her. New years day came round and I really wanted to watch the fireworks with her but she seemed uninterested and we ended up not going. Instead, a few days later we agreed to a movie with her sister, I don't often get the opportunity to spend time with anyone in her family so I wanted to treat her sister to the movie. When we arrived at the cinema and I wanted to pay for the tickets she turned and yelled at me, saying that I shouldn't pay in public, the person behind the counter and a few others heard her and I was so embarrassed. 

I went home and felt terrible, I spent the next few days away from my phone. She texted me a few days later and agreed to meet me at my apartment, she was being really sweet and asked what I wanted to eat so she could buy it for me. She came over, we watched a movie together and ate and then she broke up with me and left in a hurry. That was the last time I saw her and it felt like the ground had opened up and swallowed me. I was devastated lost, alone and I got on my knees and pleaded her to stay but she just drove away. I was thousands of miles away from home, alone in my empty apartment. 

I wasn't thinking clearly, I grabbed a blade got into my car and drove aimlessly for hours sobbing uncontrollably. I stopped outside of a bunnings and that's where I told myself that I wasn't worth anything and that was going to be it. I grew up being abused and now the person I thought would never do that to me did and just left. What does that say about me, about my life? She called me and asked me where I was and I told her what I had done, she yelled at me saying, 'WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?! and then hung up. I was blacking out from the blood loss, a few passerbys found me and drove me to the nearest hospital where I spent the next 24 hours being treated for my injuries. My ex-girlfriends' parents informed my parents and they found out and immediately told me to return home so I could be treated back home. I was discharged, I left most of my personal items and told my landlord that she could keep them and my car was sold at a heavy loss but none of that mattered at the time.

I booked the earliest flight back to Singapore and spent the next months in a psych ward in a battle with my mental health. Here I am though, a year later the whole experience still fresh in my mind, I still see a psychologist regularly and have to take pills for depression. I never heard from her ever since. I guess what I learned from it all is to trust your gut feeling, don't take abuse from anyone and to love yourself first before anyone else which is something that's really difficult for me on that basis that my ex treated me less than a human being. 

I still can't love myself because when the people you love yell, belittle and hit you, how else are you supposed to look at yourself as anything but a burden to others?",29Jan2020,1

822,"So, some background: I am a guy in my twenties in a longterm relationship. I am also befriended with a woman S., who is just a very good \*platonic\* friend, like a buddy. 

 I am about to marry the woman of my life later this year and I had a male friend telling me:

""Does your fiancé know, that you had an affair with S. some years ago?"" Of course, I did not have an affair with my buddy S. and was confused why he would say that and asked him what made him think so. He came with some vague answers that S. and I sometimes would dissapear at parties for 20-30 minutes, and that I made a sexual reference with her at some point and in the presence of my girlfriend, and tried to put it off as a joke. Point here is, that yes, sometimes I would disappear with S. to go talk to each other about random stuff, or simply changing the people around us at the parties - as I think is quite normal with buddies. And of course we do sexual jokes sometimes. But at the instance he described, my girlfriend was not even present, so his explenation makes little sense to me.

Well, I told him that it is none of his business anyways what happened or did not happen and if something would have happened, that we would have talked it through at this point. He thought I was being unreasonably angry at him as he only wanted to help. 

I wanted to be fair and explain to him why I was angry about it. I did not like that he straight out accused me of being infidel, disrespecting both me, S. (like she would just be infidel to her boyfriend and at the same time be my fiancé's close friend) and that I didn't like him meddling with our personal business, which does not concern him at all. Confronted with that, he got really defensive and denied the validity of my points.

I can't really make sense of his intentions and it seemed to me like he would want to force a wedge between us. Am I really overreacting, or is it OK if I want to cut him out of my life for at least the near future?",29Jan2020,1
823,Hey i just found out that my friend Ronald is in a abusive relationship where there ex/current boyfriend is abusing her. she does not want me to tell anyone so not real names but what he has done is complete asinine.  From what i know is he has physically abused her causing scares and marking and made her have sex with him just to make him no longer mad at her. She loves this guy with all her heart and tell me she is willing to die for him but he does not do the same. what i have figures out is that there is enough evidence to get this guy arrested or even get felonies but i don't want to ruin the trust between us. i have told here not to go through with what he wants to do but she says that she is going to handle it her way and that is giving him what he wants.

824,"My (25) sister(29) had two major brain surgeries (totaling at around 20 hrs) to remove a noncancerous tumor (about the size of a plum) almost two years ago. It’s occurred a few times where she will say the wrong name when talking about friends or relatives, nothing major but she’ll say something like “so [younger cousin still in high school] has this cool college class” when she’s talking about our cousins college age sibling, or “[friend in New Zealand] sent back the book I forgot last year” when she’s talking about her friend in La we visited last year. It’s not that she’s getting the actual people and places mixed up, just saying the wrong name, and then being 100% convinced afterward when I ask her if she meant X that she said the correct one. 

I wouldn’t be worried, but every time I correct or ask for clarification, she gets VERY frustrated and keeps insisting I’m gaslighting her (“I said that, you just don’t listen when I talk!!”)  Granted I have adhd and do tend to have tinnitus/auditory processing issues, and the first time I just waved it away as me hearing her wrong? but I’ve clearly heard her mention one person, then describe a completely different, but adjacent, person instead multiple times.

My sister is so convinced that she’s texted my best friend to try to figure out “why [I’m] acting like this, [im] legitimately gaslighting [her]”
It’s happened around someone else once before, and even when it was the two of us telling her she said X instead of Y she still insisted we where wrong. I’ve even talked to our mother about this, and she’s said the same thing has happened with her too. 

The topic of her mentality post tumor/operations is very sensitive, and anytime I try to gently bring it up I’m met with anger. Usually I’d just ignore this to avoid contention, but she seems genuinely convinced (and pissed off) that I’m actually gaslighting her, and I honestly don’t know what to do. This has been a reoccurring issue for about a year, and I don’t know how to broach the topic without just flat out upsetting her.
Does anyone have any idea how to better talk to her about this? I’m guess it could be a very minor form of aphasia? I don’t want to upset her any more than she already is on the topic, but it’s fucking me up that my sister thinks I’m genuinely using a mental abuse tactic on her just to??? Fuck with her???",29Jan2020,1

Before they got the dog, he had been raised in a small cage all his life and wasn't walked very much.

I've been to visit them today and noticed he's been sitting very odd on his back legs and has sort of worn down the skin towards his knee. 

He's basically sitting like a rabbit and he really doesn't like people going near his back legs.

829,"My wife and I live in Michigan, we had a Colorado based photographer come and do our wedding photos as she also does work here regularly. 

Our contract states we should have gotten the photos 8-12 weeks after the wedding. As that deadline past (wedding was in early July) my wife began to question her what was the holdup. We got an update we were next in line. Time continued to pass without a single photo sent our way.

Evidently the photographer dropped the hard drive with ours and thousands of other photos on it.

She had a company restore the hard drive and when she got it back she went on a vacation.

We still haven't received any proof there are even any photos even though we've asked.

830,"right,

I live in Ontario Canada
My family has lived in their home for 10+ years now. 
Our neighbors are constantly calling the municipal to give our car tickets. This has been going on for years! We leave our car in front of our home and the next day we have a ticket OR it's towed. This neighbor has also killed our tree in the backyard. They have a tiny backyard and they have their fence that distinguish  what's theirs and what's ours. And our backyard is pretty big you could fit at least 50- 70 people in it and we could have installed an underground backyard but my grandparents love to garden and have BBQ out the in the warmer months. 
Any how they put some chemicals on our trees that are on our side of the property and killed it. My Grandpa was super sad about because it was a beautiful tree and he really loved it. 
This neighbor also has told our other neighbors who our on left side of us to not let us park our car in front of their house. Of course this neighbor has better things to do and told my dad what this neighbor told him to do and they both had a laugh about how idiotic this neighbor was for even telling him something so stupid. This has been going on for years. 
My family is from Mexico. I was born here in Canadian. My family are not ones to go and have confrontation with people they just do what they have to to not get in trouble. 
This has happened so many times that even the tow truck man tells us,'you must have some neighbors who really don't like you because we got multiple calls yesterday and today'. 
Like do these people have nothing else to do?
I'm just tired of these neighbor thinking they can be so rude to my family. We are Canadian, we pay taxes too 'Karen'. I know we can't have the car stationary for more then a few days or we get tickets, I also know the car must be in the middle of the parking spot to also not get a ticket. 
Are their any suggestions on what we can do, or say to these racists so they will leave my family alone? Any advice would be appreciated.

What if i cant get a job? I tried volunteering but quit because there was a lot of immature people and the person in charge was never there, so i ended up leaving the place. I worked last summer for 2 months and i quit because of school. Now that i am not taking a lot of classes i have time for a job but im not having any luck? :(",29Jan2020,1
835,"I’m a black female in my twenties who grew up with one sister younger than me . For this story’s sake let’s call her Mary . I was the darker one and she was the lighter one and my mother would constantly mention that by calling her ‘Mary lightie’ in our language . I didn’t think much of it as it was just an accurate adjective but my thoughts on it changed later as I will explain. Additionally my hair is much curlier than my sisters and my mum would regularly call it ‘rasta’ hair or ‘dreadlocks’ . There’s nothing wrong with that hairstyle but my mom had a dislike towards ‘dreadlocks’ and thought they were ‘messy’ and ‘unkept’ thus implying that my hair in its natural state was the same. She would straighten my hair into oblivion and would always coo positively at my sisters hair. She’s mentioned my nose is too wide several times.  After these additional comments I realized that the ‘lightie’ comment was due to my mums fondness of my sisters light skin and euro centric features. Further more, my mum always criticizes what I wear, Mary is more into makeup and skirts and dresses than I am and I’m more into skin care , health and my style is mostly jeans or loose pants .She states I’m not ‘womanly’ enough and often says ‘make yourself a woman and do such and such,,, ‘.  Also the country I’m from hold lighter skin in high regard so they are what’s comparing my and my sister. Growing up my mum would always tell my sister to come downstairs if there was a guest to show her off and rarely call me down and when she did she would complain why I didn’t fix myself up when me and my sister were dressed almost exactly the same. .  I’ve gone off to university where discovered how to take care of my natural hair, appreciate my skin and just accept myself . Also my experiences in uni have built up my confidence and self esteem. But now that I’m back living in the same city as my mom , I feel like I’m back at square one and feel like a worthless girl again with so many flaws . I’m really tired of being constantly criticized and want to know what can I do in addition to addressing the situation with my mom. How can I build up my confidence in my looks.",29Jan2020,1

837,"My [M18] gf [F18] says she does not trust me. Her loss of trust for me relates to one moment we had recently (this is confirmed). 

It was about 2 weeks ago and I believe we were bickering the previous 2 days about something, I do not remember what it was. Anyway, she tells me she wants a break for the weekend with no contact. She wanted to process everything and I guess recover from everything. I said let’s try a week then and talk 7 days from that day with no contact. 

Even though I don’t like it, I’ll admit, I was somewhat offended by her proposal so my proposal was pretty petty. I was didn’t need a break at all. She gets mad at this and we go back and forth and she eventually suggested that we forget the idea and I agree. I say that’s a fair solution, I don’t get what I want and you don’t get what you want. 

My guess is she got mad that I agreed to the idea that we called the break off entirely, easily and quickly. Another guess is that she felt like I may have thrown it in her face that we always do what she wants and that me not getting a week break was just another one of those times where I didn’t get what I wanted. Those are my guesses, I’m honestly still clueless as to why she got upset and then changed her mind and insisted that we take the week break after I just complied with the solution she brought up. It was indeed a fair solution, so I agreed to stop any further arguing. 

Then, we go back and forth again, which mainly was her insisting we take the week since I wanted it and me saying that we should call it off since it was fair. I didn’t really care about the break. Now writing this, I realize by me admitting this and saying I didn’t care about the break anyway and I just pretty much was just being petty, could’ve calmed down the back and forth but I digress. Then I comply with her again and say “okay we can do a week”. Then she complains again and says “I’m not doing a week it’s too long”? She then suggest 3 days, and I say I’m not doing 4 days. I suggest either 5 days or a week and tell her to choose. She doesn’t make up her mind, so I just choose Friday. She then gets riled up and says, “ Idc you can take a week, 2 weeks, a month, a year, idc!” And I say okay then let’s do 3 months I’ll talk to you in April. She says okay, I say “alright see you then”. And we hang up. 

I get off the phone and see and opportunity to really grow and develop during this time in all aspects: being a better man to her, my endeavors, self-awareness, physical health, etc. I reason I’d have a lot of time to work on these things with no distractions whatsoever which would allow me to grow faster. I then message her about my decision because I think she may possibly believe I was joking. This gets her super upset and she gets really cut to the heart about it. She said she was extremely offended that I would just ask for a break for three months considering all I am to her. She was crying nonstop, her parents were worried we had broken up or something too, like she took it very personally. 

I apologize and she “forgives me”, I tell her why and she has a better understanding of why I wanted to do it but she’s still deeply hurt and whatnot. 

Fast forward to now, we’ve had better days within the weeks following since but we’ve still had bad arguments too. She says this relationship is falling apart and one of her reasons are that she can no longer trust me. When I say how can’t you trust me, she responds that I asked for a three month break and she forgave me but can’t trust me. She says she can’t not think about how at any given moment I could try and do the same thing again. And actually follow through. 

Keep in mind I’ve never done anything to disrespect in any way any trust she has for me. I never cheated, I don’t lie, I’m transparent with her, I don’t conceal information. Literally no reasons to not trust me legitimately. So any thoughts, advice for this? I honestly can’t even believe she said she can’t trust me. It’s shocking, idk if she used the wrong word or what but she’s even agreed that I’ve done nothing besides this to lose her trust. Sorry this is pretty long.",29Jan2020,1
838,"Hello, 

I am here because I need advice on the situation that I am in.  I have been with my bf for about 3 yrs. In the last yr his addiction has become more of an issue.  He was sober for about 3 months and it was difficult but he felt way better (healthy wise, energy, mind), everything was a lot better. It was hard on the weekends for sure but he was able to do it. But one day he decided he was over it and began drinking again. Since then about 2 months ago, it has gotten a lot worse. 

We have had many talks about the addiction and he was even seeing someone about it. But since nothing seems to work he has pretty much given up. When we talk about it all he wants to do is change and to watch how much he drinks, but then he slips (probably a weekly thing) and for me to cope with it I need space. I can't watch it so for me I need to be on my own (my boundary). Recently, he took this as me not understand and not supporting him, and that I need to just shrug it off when he does drink and not go quiet. I do not get mad at him for drink, I just cant be around it. He made me into being the bad guy because I cant give him a ""free pass"" in a sense. This happens so often, it is really starting to affect me mentally. 

Where I am going with this is that he pretty much said if i can support and understand that he slips up then our relationship is over... To me it sounds like he has done working on the relationship and he just want to drink and smoke and fall into his addiction. Where all i am doing is trying to keep his mind on the conversations we have had over and over again, and for me to be comfortable if he does drink. I'm unsure on what to do, if this is all worth it or if I am wasting my time. I know it is 100% my decision, I was just looking for some guidance and some advice...",29Jan2020,1
839,"I came to realize that I am not as liked as my brother and/or sister by either of my parents. I am the middle born and usually my parents go out with my older sister and younger brother to Restaurants or the cinemas when they ask which is okay but when I try and ask, they always refuse saying they're busy and such excuses. On Christmas, I got a 2 pairs of socks( and I'm not even joking) while my little brother got a new iPhone 8, upgrading from his previous iPhone 7 whereas I still use a weak iPhone 6s while my sister got a car...There are many more examples of how my parents favour my siblings over me that I can't list here though.

I don't know how to accept this fact right now because I honestly don't know what I did to them, is it just because I'm the middle born or maybe because I have social anxiety, I don't know, but I don't like the way I get treated by parents.

841,"At the very start I want to apologise for my language. I'm just learning it. Anyway backing to the topic. Currently I'm M19 and I have doubts in myself. When I was young I was keen on video games but mother was trying to be strict with it. We have come to smartphone era so getting games on your phone isn't that hard. I've always been learning language through the games, films, manga or even some stupid youtube videos. Practically I will be moving from my parents house in next 6 months. It's not like I hate them but most of the time I was unhappy in the house even though we don't have money problems. From the very young I thought that it would be nice if I work with a computer. So it must be programming. But I'm also lazy person so I just shoved up the idea and just went through the life as it was. Looking now I think that I wasted my life somehow. For the programming I only learned the very basics of 
C++. In the meantime I got an idea of another job that would be nice for me. Many of my frinds or even some sttangers often says to me that I have nice voice. So be a voice actor I thought. But I don't even know how would I start with that. This year I will probably start my uni or will have a break for year going to work to earn for living and uni or courses. And now another idea brighten up in my mind. Maybe be an ethical hacker? But there are too many unknows. For now I don't even know what to do or how to start anything. Basing on my grades my chances getting to the uni I would like to get to are very slim. Same goes for uni specialised in actors. What could/should I do. Any tips for how would I start.

846,"Hello everyone, this will be my first ever post on reddit, I hope it will get noticed because I am truly lost atm... I also hope that the large amount of details is not a problem, but I do think they are necessary to fully understand the situation.

So first, some background info: My girlfriend (F/20) and I (M/20) have been together for almost a year now. During the first month or so in which we started dating, which was almost a month after we met (I know, things escalated pretty quickly) one of my best friends (who I will hereon refer to as 'A') thought it would be a good idea to DM her as a sort of experiment, to see how she would react to a guy texting her after we had started dating. I went along with it at first, but then quickly realized that it was a bad idea and told him not to... but he jokingly disregarded this. So I mentioned to her a bit later that my friend may message her as a joke. When he eventually did, she didn't take it too seriously, and told A that she already knew he was one of my friends. But, as time went by, he would DM her again every once in a while, replying to her funny Instagram stories, and she would reply pretty normally while letting me know that he had messaged her. I never thought to bring it up with him, because I didn't really mind them having a friendly conversation every once in a while, and it wasn't really important at the time... until one day, he replied to a story of hers- a picture of her wearing short shorts, asking if it was 'really hot where she was'- needless to say, she found the comment on her choice of clothing to be super disrespectful, and everything went sideways from there. Not to mention she is a feminist.. and more of the ""Men are all pigs and I hate them"" kind. Anyway, A had also been pointing out to me some things about her from time to time that he expected me to find unacceptable, kind of like little red flags, it seemed like he was trying to tell me that this girl was bad news. When I confronted A about the comment he made, he explained that he was only trying to look out for me and saying that I needed to keep her in check. He also seemed pretty baffled by the fact that I was okay with her choice of clothing... and in all honesty her pictures were at times quite revealing and I wasn't always comfortable with it, but it's her body after all and I have no right to tell her what she can and can't wear- Especially given that we had only been dating for around a month at the time.

note: I do realize that A made certain mistakes, I think he did want to 'protect' me from getting into a relationship with the wrong girl, and seemed to believe it was some sort of obligation of his as a best friend. I understand that he went the wrong way about it and took it too far, but I do believe he had good intentions.

Now all of this was really not a big deal to me back then, keep in mind that we had only been together for around a month and she and I weren't that close. But OH MY was it a big deal to her! Her reaction to the situation was and still is VERY EXTREME. Until this day, she hates A with a passion- I seriously cannot emphasize enough the hatred she has for him. She's never even met the guy, yet all my efforts to convince her that he's not such a bad guy are futile. And trust me... I've tried. She has this idea that he's an asshole that does nothing but disrespect women, and while he does have his flaws, I've known him for years and I know that he has a good heart and does not hurt people intentionally. But naturally, nothing I say will sway her. She then told me never to say his name in front of her again, and she asked me (although indirectly at the time) to stop being friends with him. But of course, having known him for years and been through countless trauma with him by my side, I wasn't about to trash him over such a small mistake... so I spent the next few months growing closer to her while also letting her believe that I was slowly distancing myself from A, but I soon realized that I was heading for a dead end. So, after a few months had passed, I tried to casually mention him every once in a while, to see if maybe she was over the whole situation... big mistake. She ignored it the first few times, and then finally (about 2 weeks ago) she snapped and gave me the ultimatum: I was to choose either him or her, and I'd have to cut one of them out of my life completely. I argued on the phone with her for hours, trying to get her to see that she was being irrational and controlling, blowing it way out of proportion, that putting me in this position was in no way fair and that she couldn't expect me to give up on my best friend just because of how she felt about him. I told her that her feelings are in fact very important to me, yet they do not justify her reaction. I also tried to explain to her that A being a part of my life couldn't possibly affect her, since he was never around her (she had also blocked him on social media). Nothing I said made much of a difference, and we ended up reaching the 'compromise' that I could continue talking to him (over text) but never bring him up and never see him again! And that somewhere down the line I had to stop being friends with him because she didn't want him to be a part of our future, and she made it clear that she'd never be okay with it.

Which brings us to present day. I know I should not have agreed to never seeing A again, because as you can probably guess, it was a load of BS, and all I've been doing is postponing the inevitable. A is not in the country atm, but he will be visiting in the summer, about 6 months from now. He knows that she hates him, but he currently has no idea about the magnitude of the situation- I haven't talked to him about it yet. I'm planning on sitting her down before he arrives for one final discussion, and seeing if I can get through to her. I want to make it clear that we do love each other very much and that I have grown to value her in my life. I really don't want to lose her... But giving up on my best friend is not and has never been an option. So if she can't accept that (although it truly breaks my heart), our relationship will have to come to an end.

The purpose of this post is not to ask which one of them I should choose- it's to get advice on how I could talk to her or what I could possibly say that could help to save our relationship. And maybe even an honest opinion on the whole situation to give some clarity as to why she may be reacting in such a way and what I could do to calm her down. I think all this hatred may be fuelled by some sort of past trauma, but I still don't think that justifies her putting me in this position.

whew lol, if you made it all the way here I salute you! Thank you so much for reading, any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm honestly dreading having this conversation with her, I don't know where else to go for help, and resisting the urge to bring it up with her at any point is giving me major anxiety. I hope someone will take the time to read this and give me some honest advice!

thank you and much love",29Jan2020,1
847,"So I’ve been broken up with my ex for almost a month now and I’ve just recently started missing the ever loving shit outta her, idk if this is normal in break ups but I truly fucking miss her. 

The reason I left her is that she was lying to me about a guy that I was worried about, idk if the worrying was justified but she lied to me basically about everything they had talked about and messaged him saying he was cute the day after we break up and accidentally said she wanted to suck his dick as a joke answer supposedly but still talked to him after he confronted her about it, which she said was trying to defuse the situation but again why continue to talk to him and he asked for nudes which she declined and she lied to me about who initiated the conversations and apparently all
This went down while we were broken up as she was mad at me but i genuinely can’t remember, but i got all this information after I messaged the guy because I was getting fed up. All talking and stuff took place on Snapchat so I have no idea if any of this is true but this is just from what my ex and this guy told me.

This isn’t the second time she lied about a guy but that wasn’t really anything. 

My ex has been really devastated and has been crying a lot and her mom texted me because I’ve been trying to make things work but idk if I trust her at this point. Because she has quite a few guys on her Snapchat and after the last two incidents idk if I believe what she says. 

It’s just been difficult for the last couple days outta know where and  she tells me she lied because I do blow up when I get mad but I’ve never hit it anything. 

I’m just looking for advice on what to do and how I can at least move on better, because she’s always gonna be in my life now because of the baby.

851," As I was backing out of my driveway, I checked my sides and back twice. As I pulled out into the street (more than half of my car), a huge Houston City Garbage crane hit my vehicle on the side of my car, on the right side, above the back right tire. The worker's supervisor and the police told me that I was the one who was hit. This city garbage crane was driving while bearing a load of junk and there was absolutely no dump truck ins site, so there's no telling where he was going or what exactly he was doing. I asked the man where he picked up the load and he said from far back. So, I don't know whether he was supposed to be away from his dump truck, or if he was speeding because I did not see him at all as I backed out. The man claimed he saw me and his supervisors were saying he did not but I don't know how the man could have stopped if he didn't know I was there since he only hit me with his crane, not the rest of his vehicle.

What the strangest thing was that there was no dump truck at all, just the sole crane, carrying junk.

852,"My daughter recently ran away from home. I would like to know how I can legally get her to return home as she is a minor.

Some background: I have 15 kids, 13 of which are under 18, and 5 of which are not old enough for school yet. I love my kids, but they can be a hassle and annoying to have so many kids. That’s where my daughter, Hailey (12), comes in. Hailey doesn’t go to public school, she's homeschooled so she can watch the younger ones and take care of the house work. It’s just too much for me to do. Especially with the twins Aiden (10) and Jayden (10) as they both have special needs and its too much for me to handle. Her older sister, Alyssa (16f) used to help too, but she had twins 2 years ago and is too busy with her own family to help ours now. 

Hailey wanted to go to premiere party on Sunday for her favorite anime show (Black Clover). However, she let her brother, Noah (13) stay up too late which was irresponsible of her, so we told her she couldn’t go. She ended up throwing a fit, so we removed all of her things related to Black Clover. So later that night, we went out on a date, then came back to her being gone. She apparently ran away to a friends house, no note or nothing. 

We were freaking out because we had no one to watch the kids, so we had to call all my different relatives to watch the kids. Thankfully, one of my nieces will be staying with us to watch the kids while we try to get my daughter back. A few things I have questions about.

1. How can we get her to come back legally? Since she’s underage, could the police force her to come back?

2. Can i get her back without getting a lawyer? My husband has been laid off from his job and I'm a SAHM so money is tight.

3. Can the parents of Hailey’s friends house she staying at be charged with kidnapping?",29Jan2020,1
853,"So I had recently moved out of my old room last semester and detripled into a double. The person I was supposed to be with couldn’t attend my school anymore due to various reasons which really sucked. Instead a mutual friend of ours would room with me so I wouldn’t have a random person. Although I wasn’t as close with her we got along pretty well before hand. It’s literally only been six days since she started living here and I want her out. 
First off, her ex boyfriend “friends with benefits” thing came in to sleep over one night. He loud, obnoxious and farts in the room as a joke as if it’s his own room. That night while I was AWAKE, lights on and everything I  heard them having sex not once but twice. I immediately told her off about it the next morning and it hasn’t happened since but his presence still pisses me off as their pda makes me wanna gag. 

Moving on to the next problem, I started noticing that a couple of my lipsticks were missing which was weird haven’t used them recently. I realized that she stole them and put them in her drawer. When I confronted her about this she lied and made it seem like she found them on the ground when in reality she was opening her drawer and handed me one of the two. I also noticed that she took cash out of my wallet as well. 

I have already talked to my RA about it and he suggested I could file a silent witness police report and report her to the people at our school who deal with our strict honor code. Thing is I know it will be hard to really prove that she has actually been doing this and I really don’t wanna move out as I literally just moved into this room.

I have a friend. She is my best friend. Let's call her N. Every day where I don't see N get's automatically worse. Today, for example, I was pretty down (as usual) because school sucks. And, I didn't get to talk to her. We didn't really talk until a bit later in the day. She was patting my head.

&amp;#x200B;

We hug each other. It's very common. But, I see myself drawn to her in more emotional/ romantic ways (getting the feeling of wanting to hold her hand, kiss her etc.) - She has a BF. And I am happy for her. You may think ""Well, you just have a crush on her."" No, probably not. I had one on her \~1 Year ago. Today feels different from then. It's probably just my loneliness and depression (I have not been to a psychiatrist, only to my doctor, so it may not be depression, but it sure feels like it) clinging to the only source of love, compassion and warmth in my life. I feel like a dumb lonely fuck who can't get anything done in his life. God, sometimes I hate fucking everything. If I don't start to understand that these feelings are wrong, I'll do something dumb and regret it for the rest of my life. I told my friends about my problems (N was the first one to hear them and support me), but they do nothing to help me. I don't want to ask for more help. They have already done a lot.

N is very nice and supportive. I think that my emotional attachment will hurt our relationship. Any advice?",29Jan2020,1

859,"a little backstory to me and the situation: My wife, and I got together about 7 and half years ago, I was cigarette smoker back then, and smoked about a back and half a day. I switched over to vaping for her  right after we got together, because I knew the smoke aggravated her asthma. about 3 years into the relationship she wanted me to come to find an end date for all nicotine use, no matter what form it came in. I ""quit"" for about a year, had traumatic event happen and slipped. told her about it, and made another attempt. Made it 10 months. I then proceeded to fuck up, and slip again, only this time I didn't tell her. I thought I could handle it on my own. Turns out I suck at doing things by myself, because it lasted 4 years. I'm 11 days in back on the wagon which brings me to something she asked me yesterday.

**This is the part I need advice for:**

 My wife asked me Why I wanted to quit, and what motivation I have to keep it up. The issue is I didn't really want to stop. I only did because she wanted me to, I love to make her happy, and the money being saved. I dunno if this is just the cravings acting up and I just want nicotine, and validation to do it, or if it's actually how I feel. 

What I told her in response is ""I'm quitting because you want me to, and I know we need to save money."" (we're really broke right now and where we live isn't the cheapest place) I wanted to be as honest as possible. Because lying  is clearly not the right way to go. 

She doesn't like anything that could be addictive in any way, shape, or form. She does drink a little, but not very often. Her religious orientation could be a part of it as well. I know she cares about my health, and well being, but I just don't see it as an issue. I'm a pro vapor guy, I do think that all the BS in the news is mostly just user error and or poor handling of their equipment. I think it's an awesome alternative to Tobacco products, and leaps and bounds better for you while still getting the nicotine.

I don't exactly know how to feel, or what I'm gonna do when we become more financially stable. I wanna be a good husband, but I also want nicotine. I also can't really talk to her about addiction because she doesn't understand it at all. I also Dunno how to have a conversation about this because I  don't know how to articulate how I feel in terms she can understand and are as powerful as they feel for me.",29Jan2020,1

865,"I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression (and PTSD) half of my young adult life. 23F 
Every year there’s an anniversary of something happening from my childhood and around that time, I get more depressed. I am constantly working with the depression and anxiety. 
But in the past 3 years, I’ve found it harder to cope with the thoughts as the stress of real life hits. It’s harder to pick myself up when I fall down. 
I have a boyfriend. He tries, to say the least. He doesn’t understand mental illness very much. We’ve had many arguments that have turned into me panicking and feeling like I’m not good enough for my boyfriend because of this illness and it’s taken him years to just be able to reach out and say “can I give you a hug”. Sometimes that’s all I need in that moment. There have been times where I’ve completely flipped out and started hitting myself. Once he got so mad that he couldn’t help out of panic, and I was hitting myself, he told me hitting myself was what I deserved. Then later came back, and said he was sooo sorry.  
But 2 years ago, I attempted suicide. 
I woke up in complete panic. Decided that was the day. Called out sick of work (mine you - my boyfriend’s dad is also my boss) and was admitted to a hospital for 24 hours. 
The next day I went to work, and my boss (bf’s dad) called me into talk. 
Told me about his rough childhood and then told me “think about how YOU WOULD FEEL if boyfriend told you he never wanted to see you again, or that he was going to kill himself. You would be devastated. That’s what you’re doing to boyfriend.” 
I think about this ALOT. Anytime I have a suicidal thought - I don’t tell anyone. I don’t want to be a burden and the girl who cried needing help. It’s gotten to a point where everyday now I’m contemplating suicide, because I am probably not worth much at this point and I’m tired of being a burden to people. 

Thank you for listening.",29Jan2020,1

868,"This is the long version of an AITA post, thus the title:

TL;DR: Friend came to visit, was rude, presumptuous and difficult. Friend brought a gift for our baby from their own childhood nursery. We are no longer comfortable keeping such a sentimental gift. Are we dicks for sending the gift back?

long version:

Players: Ana (me) (27F), Adam (fiancé) (30M), Christine (friend) (27F), The Baby (baby belonging to fiancé and I) (4mF) 

Important note: our baby has been very sick and was recently hospitalized for fifteen days. 

My fiancé Adam and his friend Christine speak every day through Facebook messenger, and have done so since they dated in college (about 7 years ago.) This past weekend she came to visit us (she lives out of state, and I have never met her or interacted with her in any way. I was nervous because the few data points that I have about her don't make me feel very good, but was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt - plus I always get a bit jittery when hosting and our house feels out of control since our daughter was born) and Adam assured me that it would be a nice, low-key weekend and that Christine really wanted to meet the baby and I. 

(Pre this weekend, this is what I knew about her- skip this part for shorter read)

\-----------------

1. She asked Adam if she and her mom could talk to me / help him by talking me into having an abortion when Adam told her about the pregnancy. To be fair, our baby was very much a surprise and we were not yet engaged. 

2. When we decided to keep the baby, she told Adam that she knew a lot about babies and would come to visit 2 weeks after the due date to help. I said no, he said why not, I threw a pregnant tantrum about not wanting to have an unknown houseguest immediately after having a baby, they decided she would come in January instead. 

3. Over Christmas the baby got very sick and ended up in hospital for 15 days. While we are in hospital, Christine is texting Adam while we both sit in the hospital bed with the baby, and I see a text from Christine to Adam that she can't watch a certain movie without crying because it reminds her of him. I felt this was out of line both from a friendship perspective and also because it's a dick move to text someone about how they make you cry when they're in such a stressful situation. 

4. Adam had a surgery recently and she texted him afterwards to complain about a physical she had. He spoke to her about how he felt that was insensitive, and she freaked out and basically said ""oh you hate me now."" This was about a week before her visit.

\-------------------

&amp;#x200B;

I really love our small town, so Adam and I put together a few options for activities / restaurants to visit with Christine (she has dietary restrictions so this required a bit of research.) On Friday night she got in on the train and Adam went to pick her up. I asked her to wash her hands before coming over to meet the baby; she resisted but acquiesed once Adam asked her. I told her that we were really trying to limit germs / kissing at the behest of our pediatrician, but I was happy for her to play with her on her play mat. She ignores this completely and keeps trying to pick up our daughter, mess with her hands, and stroke her face. This continues through the whole weekend.

 We socialized for a bit, I made the usual offerings (water / wine / whiskey / snacks) but was still caring for the baby. Christine kept making a point to only speak directly to Adam, and kept bringing the conversation back to things they did when they dated. Annoying, but maybe she's just nervous.

I brought up that we had some options for things to do the next day, and Adam and I shared them with Christine. She said ""well, I'm really just here to hang out with my friend."" So, okay, we'll just stay home. The next day, Christine continues to not really interact with me. I take the baby for a walk and try to give her and Adam some space to catch up. At this point I'm feeling really unwelcome in my own home- her whole vibe is very prickly towards me. Also, she keeps putting her hand on Adam when I can't see (I didn't find this out until after she left and he spoke to me about it.)  Now, they have been friends a long time, so if she were just touchy feely, that's one thing- it's the ""while I'm not looking"" aspect that bothers me.

I get back, put baby in the crib, and go to shower - with her video monitor up on my phone, as usual. I see his dad go to get her from the crib (he was waking up) and settle him down. The next time I check the monitor, she's in the nursery, holding the baby to her face and dancing- apparently she came and took her out of her crib, or took her from Adam- it's not entirely clear. Admittedly, I panicked a bit, got out of the shower and go collect my child - I told Christine it was time for me to feed the baby, so I don't think it looked too off.  

Adam and I invite a bunch of our local friends out in order to make dinner a bit more bearable, and she sulks about not sitting. with him. She is sitting next to me, though, and keeps stroking the baby's face while I'm breastfeeding, which is .... weird. We get home, go to play a game, she tries to lean her head on his arm during the game- just all these little wtf moments. The whole weekend was weird.

 I told Adam I was tapped out and wasn't comfortable going to brunch Sunday, but that I was happy for him to take her before their hour drive to the airport. 

When he got back, he told me that she had brought our baby baby books from her own childhood. (I knew on Friday that she had brought them, but she gave them to Adam while I wasn't in the room, so I hadn't seen what they are.) Throughout the weekend we had many conversations about her behavior (again, postpartum here so I was absolutely relying on him to tell me if I was being insane) and we decided that her behavior this weekend was nuts and he isn't really comfortable maintaining the friendship. I know this is reddit and so I will look like the girl that's ending all the female friendships, but a) I never asked him to stop being friends with her, just to not go alone to air bnbs with her like he did when he visited her last year and b) I really feel like I tried to give her every benefit of the doubt. 

I feel terrible that his 7 year friendship is gone. I also feel terrible because I feel a bit like maybe there was more going on there than simple friendship, but I want to (and need to) trust my fiancé. 

&amp;#x200B;

All this brings me to the books:

I don't think it's right to accept a sentimental gift from someone, then tell them you're not friends anymore and keep the gift, but we also think it could be a slap in the face, especially if we (as we have discussed) simply send a letter along with the books explaining why they're being returned.

887,"Hey. 

This will be probably buried below the thousands of posts here... But why not?

I'm just a random college-aged (sophomore) male living in the United States who feels like they have wasted their entire life. I know that might sound dramatic: but here is why.

I grew up in a suburban middle-class evangelical Christian family, to oversimplify things. We were — and still are, the present time — neither that particularly rich or poor. You get the general picture. I guess pretty sheltered from the world as well. But I was too socially incompetent to have done anything, regardless.

My time in (public) middle and high school can be generally characterized as a total waste. Teachers would always remark about how ""bright"" and ""lucid"" I was, but I could never grasp the nuances of social interaction — I have Aspergers— and thus spent the majority of my time alone and away from others. Video games, books, and other forms of mindless entertainment consumed my time. I ended up with mediocre grades and transferred into community college.

I always knew that my social isolation from others was atypical. But the full extent of my problems didn't hit until I realized awhile ago that the overwhelming majority of my peers are no longer virgins, partied, have developed stable social networks, and are much more mentally advanced socially than I am. I feel like a 13-year-old trapped in the body of someone far older. 

It's left me all so insecure about myself. I cringe at the realization that I've spent my entire life nearly friendless, never in a relationship, totally alienated from my generation. And it feels like no one will never understand my problems.

I'm also deeply insecure about my own physical appearance; or, to put it more accurately, how people react to it. I get a strong sense of disgust every time I gaze upon my own reflection in the mirror. 
It's a topic that has caused me a great amount of self-hatred. I hate my appearance. A casual glance at a site like Snapchat or Instagram shows how attractive men and women get adoration, reverence, and praise from just merely existing. And me?  I've never been complimented on my appearance by a woman in my entire life.

It causes me to feel disgusting about myself. Like I'll never be viewed as attractive. It makes me feel ontologically inferior to them in some way. Or, that reality is just playing a sick joke upon us all. I can't help but feel a disgusted mix of sadness, envy, and repressed anger towards the world. It all feels so random, so meaningless, I've dwelt on it to the point of being cynical about whether love truly exists. They'll say that ""no one"" deserves love... which only makes me hate myself anymore.

My social skills are non-existent. I never learned how to communicate with others, impress women, etc. And the suggested ""help"" I've seen online from armchair commentators is even worse. Alone? Having trouble with the girls? Friends in general? They'll urge you to go after the hollowest, meaningless, and hedonistic things in existence. I see it now: someone in the comments is ready to recommend visiting a strip club, hiring a prostitute, or watching pornography on your computer. 

It's absolutely ridiculous. They just want you to shut up, keep repeating crap about how the world will ultimately work out for you, and wait for you to disappear from the face of it. 

And I find that a total freakin' joke. 

I still don't know how people easily obtain friendships, etc. The notion of someone other than family particularly caring about me honestly seems totally surreal. Like a dream you'd come up to relieve yourself of sadness, then, cry as you realize that it is nothing more than such. I just want someone to cuddle up next me. I want to be loved. I want friends. And all of this seems forever out of my reach.

I'm also a kissless virgin who has never been in a relationship. But I'm not necessarily depressed about it for the reasons that might be typical among my peers. It's less about the sex than the idea of a women finding me desirable/important to her. And I feel like the world is implicitly telling me that I'm too ugly, insecure, and meaningless to be loved.

I'm not unintelligent from an academic/""book-knowledge"" mperspective. I turned my grades around once I got motivated in college. I'm currently riding with a 3.9 GPA as a sophomore. But it feels like elite schools like Harvard, Yale, etc. are now impossible for me to reach regardless of my efforts. Any chance of that perished with my miserable years in high school. My CC allows me to transfer to a top public university in our state... but the whole notion still kind of stings me. (Yeah, cry me a river and all of that.)

I always wanted to make music as a dream career. I can create epic songs in my head, etc. (I want to good at syntheizers... think synthwave) But I don't know if I'll have the time now to ever become close to perficient. I'vd barely picked up an instrument before now. So I don't even really know where to begin.

I'm uncertain what my career path in life will be after college. (I'm still taking prereqs now) I felt forced to go to college by my parents. Still don't have a job. Still don't have a driver's license. I don't even know if there is a good place for me to start off at.

I feel undesired, unwanted, and abandoned in a world that is either vindictive or uncaring about my entire existence. Being white, male, autistic, socially awkward, and a virgin all together at once carries a lot of negative connotations in modern day society. So I'm afraid of what people would wrongly presume about me if I told anyone this in real life. (that I'm sexist, dangerous, etc.)

I feel like the gap will make me inevitably disconnected from my peers. I have no idea what a 20 year old is supposed to have done by now. Do most people have friends? Do they go to parties? I'm utterly disconnected from experiences that all of my peers have already done. A lot of things that you are supposed to do as a teenager I utterly missed. I just sat, cried, and got bored in my room every day.

How the freakin' heck are you supposed to fix this in a relatively short period of time? I'll graduate in 2.5 years. It feels like 
I've missed the boat entirely.  I've never really had any close relations with my peers ever. Can you even fix your past?

I'm constantly overcome with the feeling of being unwanted and alone, that my chance of accel at my goals is now past, and that I should just lay over, rot, and die. Maybe I'll survive. Maybe I'll get a decent job. But I'd just be a wageslaving for the next 50 years all alone.

I just want to do something substantive in my life. To experience the world, to accomplish things, to be the most moral and outstanding person I can be, but I just fear that all of this has already passed.

Am I wrong? Any tips? Any recommendations? I feel like the days are going by.... and I'm doing nothing with them. Feel free to ask me anything about this. I'll respond relatively quickly.

I'm afraid of dying a cynical, bitter man who wasted their entire life. Thanks.",29Jan2020,1

They disinvite me to family events, the won’t talk to me or look me in the eye when I’m around, and they talk behind my back as well as talk negatively to other members in my girlfriends family to try and get them to turn on me.

893,"Throwaway because I don't want to take the risk of people around me finding how actually my life is shitty.

Let me start by saying that I'm turning 21 in July. Let me start by saying I started smoking tobacco and weed at 13. That fucked up my entire adolescence due to problems with my parents and school mainly.

I'm 20 rn and I haven't finished high-school, not only this but I keep dragging this huge lie to my parents. 
2 years ago it was my last year at school, I stopped going because my friend stopped going too so I felt so off in that class with people with 35 yo+. 
I lied to my parents and told it was almost done when I had done nothing. Last year I was gonna finish it but I was working rotating shifts at my new job so sometimes I wasn't able to attend school and others I was just too tired from 4h in transportation + 9h at work. Since I told my parents it was almost done in the first year, I had to use the same lie but with the excuse that I couldn't attend or was tired.
So this year they think I only had to do 100 hours which I supposedly have finished already. Needless to say I'm way too far from finishing that bs.,(They will want to see my HS certificate next month) 

Not only this but I want to join college so hard next year although I won't be able to due to not finishing high-school. Even if I finished high-school I'd have to pass in maths exam although I haven't had any math classes in the past 4-5 years.

This frustrates me because I know all this shit happened because I spent my last fucking 4 years smoking weed everyday since I woke up until I went to sleep. I tried to stop so many times. Finally this year I managed to be sober for my longest period of time since 2016, it was 3 days. 3 FUCKING DAYS, how can this be my best? I feel that I can stop smoking this year and put my life in a straight line but I just don't know how I should address the school/college issue.

Not only this... But I haven't had any girl in my life in the past 3 years mainly because I find their conversations boring and fake. It's hard to connect through social media and it would probably be creepy to ask the girls out in the first conversation. (even if they are super interested I just eventually ghost them).

I feel that I have so many potential and that I could run a big company or have an important position but I'm just wasting my time now. I don't wish to die but I truly think I should have never been born.

The reason I told her was because I wanted to be honest with her. The weeks before that we texted a lot but in the past two days we barely message each other, and I'm worried that I made thing awkward.

898,"I really don’t know if I am posting this in the correct place, if not maybe someone can tell me a better place. I’m sorry if I ramble and it is a very long post. Thank you in advance if you actually read it all. Yesterday I took my daughter to her pediatricians office to talk to her Dr about things I was greatly concerned about, she says my daughter has many red flags that could be potentially from autism, she referred me to a neurologist and I found out today her appointment is 3 months from now. I don’t want to wait that long to get help so I called a bunch of programs, such as “baby can’t wait” and Children first. Everywhere I read said that I should not wait for an official diagnosis and that I should immediately get help regardless so that is what I am going to do. I want to be as proactive as possible to help my girl get what she needs. My baby has recently within the last few months been having extremely bad melt downs. She randomly smacks her self in the face, rips her hair out, flings her arms and legs, throws her self straight back to the point I have to catch her or she will slam her head on the ground. She also slaps me, scratches me and kicks me when I try to change her clothes, take her out of the bath, change her diaper, or direct her from doing something she isn’t suppose to. Me and her father do not believe in spanking so it was very shocking when she started doing these things to herself and me. She was saying her words well, such as momma, dad, puppy, yes, no, hey, bye and a few others and was thriving with her speech. Now the only thing she says is “baba” over and over all day and babbles like she did when she was much younger. She  sometimes seems like she is in her own world and it takes me sometime to get her attention when I am calling her name and when I do it upsets her a lot of times, not every time. She used to smile often and laugh about everything and now it’s very hard for me to get her to smile or for her to think something is funny. Their is so much more but the whole point of my post is I want to be as proactive as possible in learning everything I can do to help her and maybe here others experience. When I first noticed around her first birthday that something seemed different and her behavior was changing, We changed our whole mind set as parents. We implemented a strict schedule to give her as much structure as possible. This is how her schedule is everyday. If someone has some better idea that we could do I am open to all ideas! Please keep in mind that it takes us a VERY long time to feed her, she is a very slow eater and we don’t rush her, we just let her take her time. 7AM wake up, change diaper, sit her in her high chair and she watches her favorite cartoons or Disney plus while we make her breakfast, she only likes oatmeal,yogurt, fruit pouches or occasionally eggs for breakfast. She eats from 7:30-8:30. 8:30-10 we go in her room and actively play with her. At 10 she lays down and takes her first nap from 10-12, we wake her up at 12 and set her up in her chair for lunch, lunch time is usually faster bc I don’t want her watching tv at that time(sometimes her dad plays her a movie) if she’s upset or having a rough day, 12-12:45 she eats lunch, usually she has left overs from dinner but if not she loves meat, cheese and veggie plates. 12:45 to 330 is play time, I try to spend as much time as possible playing and doing activities with her such as finger painting, water markers, reading, playing with her stuffed animals, she also has a ball pit and pop up tent with pillows where she can play independently or relax. I also have a swing and slide in her room that she isn’t currently interested in anymore, she used to like it but no longer wants to swing when before she did. She gets very upset when I try to get her to try and climb it or get in the swing. Lately it’s a struggle to get her interested in anything and she often gets very upset when I try to get her to play or do a certain activity. 330-5 she takes her second nap of the day. After she wakes up we eat dinner, bath time right after, we let her relax on her couch and we watch something on the Disney + and then bed time is 7:30. Before we had this schedule she hardly ever napped and stayed up all hours of the night. She didn’t sleep through the night until she was 13 months old. I’m really not sure if any of that is relevant but just in case I wanted to explain. I also try to take her to the park as often as the weather allows but never during a nap time. Anytime I try to take her somewhere with other children, she at first seems curious and then a few minutes later she gets very upset and we leave to avoid upsetting her more. Any family events such as thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas we arrived late and left very early. As soon as I notice that she is uncomfortable I leave with her. Idc where we are or what we are doing. Idk if I am doing the right thing and it makes both of our families angry with me but I feel like it is the right thing to do. They don’t have to deal with what happens if I don’t remove her from a certain situation. All of this has been very sudden and she is my only child. I just want to do right by her and make sure me and her father are doing everything we need to do to ensure she has the tools to thrive. But I don’t know what to do besides calling and trying to get therapy set up as soon as possible. Any and all advice is wanted and desperately needed bc I feel clueless.

Asking for my girlfriend who is having a meltdown right now.

She is in nursing school and i guess a TB shot is required every semester. Her TB shot expired yesterday and she got her shot yesterday. (I know she should’ve gotten sooner) she went to clinical today but i guess the rules are you cant go to clinicals with an expired TB and it’s a serious violation if one does. The nursing director contacted her today and told her to meet at her office tomorrow.

901,"I'll start this off by giving some information I think is critical. I'm 22 and this is not the first time I have this issue with a sport, the last time I had to quit a sport I played for 15 years because it was taking a toll on my mental health in a way I couldn't bear anymore but this time is different.
Two years ago I joined an amateur football (American) team here in my country(I live in europe and football is not that big in my country so we only have a really small amateur league). My brother is one of the coaches and they needed guys so he talked to me and I tried it out and I really liked it. That year I won rookie of the year award and started almost every game. Now my issue is that although we only have practice twice a week it's at night from 9pm until 11:30pm and I started helping a really close friend of mine that has a recording studio on weeknights and weekends and I'm starting to make some money off of it, it's not much but it's something. Another issue is that I got into a band and we have rehearsals on weekends and it is really a passion of mine but football games are also on weekends and I don't want to have to choose between stuff and I really lost the passion I had for the game. I'm not sure what to do, I really want to quit but I'm afraid of what my parents and my brother might say and think. What should I do? And if I quit how do I approach my coach?

903,"My username may be a bit extreme but it sure feels like she was stolen.

Background (TLDR at the bottom): About 2 years ago, my husband(then fiance) was living with his sister and her bf. I'll call her Ashley (not her name but I looked up psycho girl names for this) and her bf Dickhead. Ashley got a dog one day on a whim. My husband was hesitant but we all fell in love with her. Her name is Harlow. Shes a golden retriever, great pyrenees, and german shepherd mix. But we could tell she had previously been abused. She was terrified and had separation anxiety. After we learned that Dickhead is a liar, psycho, alcoholic asshole, my husband didnt renew his lease with them. 

They got a new apartment, got evicted, and didnt have anywhere to take Harlow. This was almost a year ago. We offered to take her. We got her and took her to my other SIL's house, I'll call her Beth. Beth has 2 other dogs and is fantastic with animals. We planned to get harlow back after we got an apartment and a better paying job, but neither panned out. Harlow also developed food aggression from not being fed consistently when with Ashley and Dickhead and had more anxiety and accidents in the house. And we suspect that she had to witness abuse from Dickhead to Ashley and may have recieved abuse too. Luckily Harlow was happy with Beth and loved her 2 dogs and 3 kids. And she was making progress with her anxiety. I got her spayed, got her shots for the first time, at 2 years old. More than Ashley ever did for her.

Background TLDR; Got Harlow (dog) from Ashley (SIL1),who couldn't take good care of her, and took her to Beth's (SIL2) where she is happy and well taken care of.

Current Issue: Last Sunday my husband woke me up to tell me Beth's son was bit by her oldest dog (not Harlow) in the face and was taken to the hospital. Beth plans to rehome all the dogs and if we wanted Harlow we had to go get her then and there. So we go get her and I call shelters to see about working with them to find her a home. (I didnt want to dump her at a shelter and have her scared out of her mind. She has severe anxiety with cages.) Nobody was answering, despite being open and I wasn't sure what to do. I was worried that Harlow would stress out and destroy stuff in our apartment when she was alone for 2 hours. 

Then Ashley tells us that she can stay where she works for now. Even Beth suggested it. We all assumed it was until we could find Harlow a home. I was very hesitant but tried to trust them. We find out that actually, Ashley plans on taking Harlow when her and dickhead find a home. (Who would rent to them? When?? What??) I go to my car and cry. I'm unsure of what to do. I decide to come back the next day and try and get her.

Me and my husband go to the kennel the next day and ask for Harlow. They call Ashley. She says no. And now she's coming up there. Fuck. Husband calls his parents and goes over the situation. They are under the impression that Beth agreed with Ashley to have Harlow. Nope. Beth told me she absolutely did not. She only agreed to have her boarded temporarily. 

Ashley arrives with Dickhead. She is cussing at us and tells us she'd rather die than give Harlow to us. She storms into the kennel. Dickhead is trying to get involved and ask a bunch of questions. We try to tell him this doesn't concern him. He gets mad. I try calling non-emergency police but the phone menu is useless and hard to listen to when Dickhead is trying to interject every five fucking seconds. I get irritated and tell him to fuck off. Now he's pissed and is cussing at me and asks my husband if he'd like to come down there. My husband asks if its threat and he says it is. I call 911 instead. Dickhead goes inside, but not before spitting at us.

Another TLDR; We get Harlow from Beth and try to take Harlow to where Ashley works until we can sort out a permanent home. Find out Ashley is planning on keeping her. Try to get Harlow back to no avail. Call cops after Dickhead gets pissed and unhinged.


The dilemma:
The cops come and I explain what happened. Unfortunately we cant get Harlow back unless we go to court about it. I'm heartbroken. Harlow will not get taken care of if shes with Ashley. She has a history of getting dogs and not being able to afford him and now she has a baby on the way she cant afford. I keep blaming myself and I wish I never handed her to Ashley. I fucking hate Dickhead McCumstain more than anyone I've ever hated before. I dont know if I can afford court. But I dont want Ashley or Dickhead to get away with this shit. Every day that goes by I feel more and more stressed and feel so upset for what Harlow must be going through. Shes probably terrified and I'm lost.

We're going to talk to my husband's parents tonight but I have a feeling they'll take a neutral approach which will fucking piss me off. 

I know the concern should be on my nephew who was bit, and I do ask about him often, but at least with him I know he'll be ok. There was no surgery, just some stitches which will heal. Everything with Harlow is uncertain. I cant even focus in work. I'm fucking desperate. I dont even have the heart to return the dog food I bought for her. 

What should i do? Is going to court even worth it? If I decide to go that route I'll post on r/legaladvice but I need general advice right now. Please help.",29Jan2020,1

906,"So it’s kind of a complicated situation but i’ll try to explain it as best as I can. I had a best friend for like 5 years, we were very close and spent almost every day together. She got me through tough times and I helped her get through some tough stuff too. This summer she kinda nonchalantly came out to me and I was fine with that because, I myself had came out to her like 2 years before that. Somehow we came to the conclusion that , we wanted to try this friends with benefits thing, as long as no one caught feelings or any of that shit. And yeah, I was completely fine, no feelings, she said she’s fine too. It went on for a while, maybe a month. Then I got a girlfriend so that had to end. All fine, from both sides. Friendship continues. Then at a party she met one of my uni friends and kind of started vibing, which was a bit weird to me because they are very different people. I thought my best friend would never want to do anything with my uni friend. So literally 3 days pass and they are together and move in together. That was VERY unlikely of my best friend. Basically I started to notice that my best friend wasn’t acting like herself because she started dating my uni friend. She did things she said she would never do, because she thinks they’re stupid and lame. I don’t know how to explain this but basically she just completely changed in my eyes. Of course I confronted her about that. She didn’t like it. She said I don’t feel happy for her, that she thinks she hasn’t changed. Tbh, yes maybe I don’t feel as happy for her as her other friends, because I’m just so confused by her decisions and actions. Idk. So we ended up not talking for a while. Then my uni friend/her girlfriend kept pressuring me and making me feel guilty about fucking things up and making her feel sad. 
Later my best friend showed up to my house with a letter. It wasn’t an apology letter or anything , it was a letter about how sad she feels that I’m not in her life anymore and all of that. I kind of felt better after reading that letter because it reassured that she still needs me in her life but it didn’t change that fact that she’s a different person now. I later on wrote her a response letter explaining my side of things. We talked stuff over. And it felt like we came to an understanding. For a little while it was fine. We started texting a bit again. But then, one day I was feeling really down, crying in my apartment, I texted her asking if she could come over and just like chill a bit with me. She said that she would but since we were friends with benefits (at that point it had happened like 4 months ago), she can’t be alone with me in a non-public setting because that would feel unfair to her girlfriend. When she said that I was shocked. Like what the actual fuck?! We both are in committed relationships, we were really good friends and you think being together in a room that has a bed would suddenly make us do something bad?? In that letter she gave me earlier she said she’s gonna be here for me no matter what. And when I actually need her, she comes up with that. The next day I ask her, how the hell are we going to be friends if I can’t meet you one on one in non-public spaces? She didn’t really answer that. And we got in an argument over it and I said, well I guess you really have changed and I don’t need this kind of a person in my life. To which she answered that I too have changed and she doesn’t need me either.

Anyways, like a few months have passed since that. After that argument I bawled my eyes out and had like a breakdown. To this day I still think about her every damn day and I miss her. I miss the good old days. She was my only close friend, so now I feel lonely. I try to forget about her but she posts a lot (which also isn’t in her character) on her social media about how happy she is, posts pics with her gf and new friends. And tbh I am kinda jealous because I really miss her, and I am the one that sits at home and cries about losing my best friend. I muted her on social media, so I don’t have to see her. I thought that would take my mind off of her but no. Now I have dreams about her. Like very realistic dreams that are about our situation. Mostly those dreams are about how she says she misses me too and wants to be friends again. 
I guess my question would be, should I try to talk to her to get closure? How do I even do that? Maybe I am entirely in the wrong?",29Jan2020,1
907,"So I got a random message on Instagram and it was someone offering to buy my feet pics. After a good laugh I told them I was flattered but I wasn't interested in selling them.

908,"So the reason I'm making this post is because I have a friend who seems to dislike me strongly. Matter of fact I know he doesn't like me, So I'll stop referring to him as my friend and call him A, short for a word that has hole in it.
My friends and I all have a group chat and A is a part of it. We're all basically family (in the literal sense, except for my best friend who is a really good friend of everyone else in the group as well.) 
A decided he would get absolutely get upset over a joke I made out of the blue (because I personally like making weird jokes at random moments at times.) And the joke I made was ""is it gay if you have sex with a man but say no homo first?"" He followed up a few minutes later saying ""shut the fuck up"" to which I responded with ""I knew you were gay"" which we all joke about all the time with each other and nobody ever takes it literally. He then follows up with ""you're gay af n**** shut your big ass up"", now I'm on the bigger side which is why he said the last bit. Anyways he seems to take this statement as an attack. After that he followed up with ""disrespect me like that I'll slap TF out you n****"" like woahhh partner why are you so mad? I wanted to start firing back but I absolutely hate arguing and getting into fights. I then said with three laughing emojis before it ""n****"" and please don't take offense to the fact we use that word, we use it in a similar tone to bro or dude, to which he then responded with ""f*** wrong with this n**** always saying gay shit tryna tell a n**** he gay"" I respond with ""why you mad about gay jokes?"" Trying to understand why he got mad, because these jokes are never in the literal sense, and he himself makes similar jokes from time to time. He also knows I am in a long term relationship and live with my girlfriend so again his attack just doesn't make sense considering he has known me for years. Afterwards he responds with ""Because you a gay ass n**** and I don't play that sh** with gay ass n****s. I responded and ended the whole mess with ""LMFAO okay."" 

I'm currently super angry and want to kill him, that:s just how mad he makes me, this isn't our first little argument. Not long ago I made a joke that was about cthulu and he for whatever reason got butt hurt over that too. He just got his girlfriend of one year pregnant and has been living with her, the guy has no reason to be mad about these things. He has anger issues as well and constantly resorts to violence. He isn't a smart guy either, I have always questioned why I socialize with him but I also never really privately hang out with him one to one. We don't get along at all and probably only talk or hang out with one another because of our mutual friends. So my question is what do I do? I'm sick of this guy and am probably just gonna cut him out of my life. He's super childish and I honestly think he is just an insecure man child. 
But I'm trying to be nice and diffuse the situation while holding back my retorts to him because I just hate drama and don't wanna deal with legal repercussions of him making dumb choices.

TL;DR: My friend gets mad at jokes I make and always threatens violence if mad.",29Jan2020,1
909,"I feel awful for saying it but I can't help how I feel. I myself suffer with hormonal acne but I keep it pretty under control. I wash my face twice a day and use the right products so I have pretty good skin despite a couple of pimples here or there which are out of my control.

Unlike my skin issues, his skin problems are simply caused by him not looking after it. The skin on the tops of his cheeks and nose is all congested, the pores are blocked and filled with grease, and I can see flakes of dead skin from the lack of exfoliation. It really bothers me.

Every couple of weeks or so, he'll get a huge infected boil. It upsets me to see, because that's a nasty infection under the skin and not only it looks bad, it's painful. 

He's a very handsome man and I am very attracted to him, but sometimes when he speaks to me I can't help but stare at his pores, itching to get in there with steam and a clay mask, give it the pampering it so desperately needs. 

I've spoken to him about it a few times, I told him he simply needs to cleanse his face twice daily and **always** moisturise. He kinda took on my advice, but that only made it worse. He split the difference and began cleansing his skin every other day but not following up with moisturiser... His skin type is oily so drying it out with cleanser only makes his skin react by producing more oil than usual making it more congested than ever.

Today yet another boil came up on the surface and it really isn't pretty. I said to him that he really needs to look after his skin better and he snapped ""i'm a lot better than I used to be!"" but it's actually worse than ever.

The bottom line is, it makes me less attracted to him. It makes him look unkempt and it's massively distracting. And because his skin is so greasy and there isn't any efforts done to control it, i'm a bit put off by letting his cheeks touch mine in case it causes a breakout for me. I know it'll be upsetting for him to hear, but I feel that maybe it's what he needs to hear?",29Jan2020,1
910,"I’m not sure if anyone here will be able to offer advice for this but it’s worth a try. 
I start university in 8 months, I always struggled at school so thought it would be time to get my ADD treated with meds etc so that I would be more stable for the new environment. 

During my doctors appointment, I was diagnosed as high functioning autistic instead of ADD, this was a surprise as I have been fairly ignorant about it up until now. 
The problem is that to be tested, I have to see an Educational Psychologist and the waiting list is 3+ years, by which time I will be almost done with my course. I checked into going private however that would cost upwards of £700 which I don’t have. Also, my college is not able/willing to refer me. 

I have waited my whole life to go to University and I’m struggling at the thought of having to go through it with no help in regards to my illness, any advice on how to get the referral or even tips that you know have helped Autistic people through schooling. 

Really appreciate any help!",29Jan2020,1

Me too, but for some reason, it's REALLY bothering me. Like, I can't get it out of my head, and I've been thinking in existential terms a lot more lately. 

For me this is particularly unusual because of the context, I'm in my 30s and unfortunately I've known a lot of people to die; friends, family, fellow servicemen/vets, other famous celebrities, and all kinds of accidents and tragedies in the news that people my age were all here for. 

Another thing is, I'm not even that a big fan of basketball (like the game and Kobe well enough, but I'm def not a superfan or even particularly a Lakers fan). What's going on in my head and my heart, and how can I deal with these feelings? Does anyone else feel the same way?",29Jan2020,1

My dad understood that he worked very hard but people make mistakes, however my mom keeps bringing up the fact that he can never make them happy (which is incorrect beleive me). To make things worse she keeps praising me about how I can accomplish whatever I want and always make them proud, which is also not true. We immigrated here and we didn't have lots of money so my brother couldn't get access to all the facilities or privileges he needed until high school (computer, phone etc).

She went to an appointment to have a test done and was told that she could have Ectopic Pregnancy, and they need to reschedule an appointment to have it looked into further. She refused, saying that she needs to be back with her boyfriend this weekend. When me and my family try to talk to her, she lashes out.

916,"This is a long one so I’ll have a TL;DR at the end. So I’m in a really weird and honestly awful predicament. Three months ago, I would have never thought my gf and I would be at this point but here we are. We’ve been together for what will be a year in two days and our relationship has been skinned alive over the past two weeks. I was addicted to porn for around 10 years and quit it when I entered a relationship with her. I was doing great with it but slipped up once around the 6 month mark and then again around the 9 month mark. I watched porn for about a month at work in the bathroom. I didn’t masturbate to said porn at work. I just watched it. Now at this point we weren’t having as much sex as normal and we also had been fighting more. I admit fault for doing this and realize how disgusting it is to consume porn at work. I also lied about using porn during this period and slightly after. I finally told her I did this two weeks ago and was met with quite the backlash. We had fought non stop for several days and she did quite a number of hurtful things to me in the process. She called her ex that night and spent the next several nights doing so planning a trip to Japan to go see him. She said she did this because she felt insecure. She then proceeded to hang out with this guy she had a slight thing with in the past several times. I hung out with both of them twice feeling uncomfortable but I wasn’t going to stop her from hanging out with him. I came home from work and they were together. Rather than fighting I left home abruptly. She followed me out and we talked about a lot of things and I cried my eyes out in my car. I drove to a friend’s house and smoked weed at around 11. I ended up talking to her throughout the night and eventually decided to come home at around 7 when I sobered up. We both have life 360 on our phones to make sure the other is okay, not really to spy, since we both have bad cars. She apparently got the notification and ran down to my car saying she didn’t feel good and needed ginger ale. She then told me that she was kissing him and would have had sex with him had I not came home. Our 1 year trip is in two days and I’m just lost. I realize I started this whole mess with my porn consumption but I feel confused and hurt as does she. I’m just wondering what you guys think and what your advice is in this situation.

I have a few options I’m considering for classes, but it all boils down to whether or not a disappoint a professor. I’m in a class with just one other person and a professor which has the potential to be really great. More than that, the professor is excited about having such a curated class selection and would be helping me advance my thesis writing. However, I just found out that I won’t be continuing with my thesis so it’d be a bit of a grim reminder of what could’ve been. It’ll also be harder to find a satisfactory fourth class. 

On the other hand, there’s an interesting course at the same time which would be completely new and exciting and also easier in terms of workload. I don’t want to disappoint the aforementioned professor, so I might switch into his other course, but I still think he’ll be disappointed. This option solves my issue in that I can have a fourth course with the same professor I fear disappointing, just at a different time.

Most my friends are LGBT and would not have a problem with me wearing make up around them, and I want to. But, I can’t because to do that I’d have to put it on and leave the house with male up and then my parents would see.

I don’t want this to be a secret. I don’t want to have to wash it off so my parents don’t see it. I want to be able to go out in it. So basically, I need to let my parents know that I wear make up, but how lol.

They’re accepting but they’d also think it was very weird and tease me about it or they’d find it really embarrassing and make everything awkward.

The more I care about a person, The more I think about them.

My ex that I loved very much from 2013 is stuck in my head even though I havent spoken to him since 2016. 

I never got closure at the end of the relationship because he broke up then ghosted me. 

I think I may still love him, because back then I would have done anything for him.

I never got to see his bad qualities, ghosting is a bad quality but I believe I deserved it for the mildly stupid thing I did.

I tried dating other people, but even though I care about the new person I still love my ex.

I'm a fool for loving someone who has forgot my existence.

I think I may never get over him, so I started living my life around my feelings for him.

I've been in relationship since November 2018 the new guy is the best boyfriend you could imagine but I still havent gotten over my ex en though I care for my new boyfriend.

My relationship with my new boyfriend is special but I still think about my ex.

My new bf accepts me I can be myself, whereas my ex judged me.

Everything about the new guy is better but I'm still missing my ex that I havent spoken to since 2016.

I want to contact my ex so badly but I havent because I know it's wrong.

I've spoken to a psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor's, and others about this and they havent helped me get over my ex. But they told me I'm not crazy either.

I'm scared that I love my stupid ex forever and never experience a whole love for someone new.

How do I get over this idiot?

Is there a possibility I'll never get over my ex?

If I can get over my ex how long could it take?

Note I have one other ex that I feel this way towards as well but have refrained from contacting him since 2017. 

So theres two exs I care about.

925,"Recently, my mom came home from work and pointed out a pair of male footprints going to the front door of our house that weren't there this morning, and aren't my dads. I (19F) had been home all day, working at my desk only a couple feet from the door, with no walls in between. Basically, if anyone rang the doorbell, knocked or used the mail box I definitely would've heard. It's usually very easy to hear+see someone on the doorstep because of the way my house is set up.  This spooked me because I've been home alone for most of this week, which is very noticeable because people in my area usually see me walking to and from uni.

I've also been hearing weird knocking noises around the front of the house while home alone that don't sound at all like generic 'house shifting noises'. Plus, I've been hearing odd noises such as thumping and creaking outside my bedroom window during the night, and the window is easily accessible from the road. 

To add to this, since this summer our home phone has received a couple of roughly two minute long messages consisting of silence, shuffling noises, muffled humming or speaking and heavy breathing, all from unknown numbers. My parents have just passed them off as booty calls, but they really bothered me. 

I haven't brought this up to anyone yet because I may just be paranoid, and I'm also prone to worrying. Except, all of these instances together just strike me as a bit off, and I'd rather my family and I be safe than sorry.

Most of the family doesn't get along but barely with each other. Makes my head hurt thinking about it. 

It'll probably take me several months to save up enough to move out but if I had some help from my friends I could scrape up enough to cover first/last months rent and/or deposit.

My husband instantly scolded me in front of my son and said it was a bad joke and thing to say and giving him a bad example. After we got home, they went off to talk privately in my husbands home office.

The result is that they’re both mad at me. My son now refuses to speak to me and the past three nights has sat down for dinner and not said a word and then went back upstairs to bed.

I finally called out my husband to find out what’s going on and he said that my son is mad at me for what I said and he feels self conscious apparently about his own size and because he is GPO BF through puberty it makes things even more for him.

My husband also ripped into me for body shaming and saying I am a misandrist and all this stuff (which I am def not). He legit made me cry over a joke that I didn’t even mean?

I tried talking to my son when he got home from school today about what happened and he said “just forget it mom!” And stormed off to his room and slammed the door.

Husband has also been very brief with me and giving me the silent treatment. I feel like yeah I definitely made a mistake but they’re taking their anger out on me too much? Maybe be mad at the asshole in the truck that sprayed toxic coal fumes in the air destroying the planet. 

But I get it they’re men and a very large part of their ego is built upon their penis size. Which is totally ridiculous but who am I to tell a man that his feelings are irrational. If their feel they’re valid then they’re valid.

I guess my question is how should I proceed? I want to apologize but I don’t know how. It is also hard to apologize when I never meant to cause any harm or insult to the two men I love but my drunk ass did it anyway.

951,"I started college last month and on one of the first days, this girl started talking to me. I’m quite social sometimes (despite having social anxiety lol), and I appear friendly. She’s added me on social media and wants to sit together in class, hang out on our break, do assignments. I’m an introvert and really enjoy time alone. I dread being in class with people that talk a lot or loudly because I’m easily distracted. It’s causing me so much anxiety and I dread going to the classes I have with her. I don’t know how to handle this situation. Last week I ignored her messages and she didn’t notice me sitting in class because it’s large. This week that didn’t happen. Do you know of any nice ways I can handle this situation, what to say etc?",29Jan2020,1
953,"There are these weird phases I go through every once in a while where I just lose my ability to be funny - or at least I feel that way. In general I don’t feel funny anymore, and slowly but surely I lose confidence in my delivery, as well as my jokes, until they’re practically gone. Sometimes I think of a joke that I know would be funny if “I could just deliver it right” or I was “in the right mindset”, but I feel like if I said it then it wouldn’t be funny. At times I do go for it but during a phase it normally doesn’t land well.

Part of me feels like I’m focusing too much on getting people to laugh, and that I ought to focus more on myself rn. Thing is being funny and making jokes is a fundamental part of my personality, and without it it’s like I’m incomplete or trapped outside myself. What’s frustrating too is I know at some point I’m gonna “get my humor back”, but I have to deal with this for now and pray I’ll get it back soon. I almost feel caged, like I’m being held back from being myself. I love to make people laugh and riff with friends, so it feels awful when I can’t be a part of that.

If someone knows how to help me get out this or at least knows what might be causing it please help me. I could live the rest of my life without this.",29Jan2020,1

956,"Throwaway account because I can’t bear anybody I know seeing me post this. Long post explaining a lifetime of struggling with being a human. The subject matter can get gruesome with abuse, death, and drugs so if you’re bothered by that, please consider if it’s in your best interest to continue reading.


Being emotionally intelligent is a goddamn nightmare. I should, for all intensive purposes, hate humanity. I have been abused in every mental and physical way imaginable. I was a victim of domestic abuse my entire childhood, and victim to a group of pedophiles for nine years of my childhood and into my early adulthood. I was rejected throughout my lifetime by classmates and neighbor kids. In my adulthood I was rejected by the working world, too. 

It would make sense for me to hate this world, and yet I never have. I love everyone and to this day I can’t help but frame the lowest of the low and the most maliciously prosperous among us alike as victims of a broken society and an unsmiling god. 

My keen ability to empathize is intense and overwhelming. I can sense the slightest change in mood in any person, a stranger or someone I’ve known for decades, and no minute shift of the jaw or flare of the nostrils escapes me. Disrupted patterns of behavior in familiar people triggers my fight or flight instinct. Day to day life becomes absolute hell when dealing with people face to face. I am constantly bombarded by unwanted reactions to others’ feelings, making my heart pound at its most tame all the way to extreme gastrointestinal effects. Signs of incoming conflict have made me sprint out of a building without thinking. I absorb other’s feelings like a lightning rod with nowhere for the energy to go except inside me, blowing holes in my guts and surging through my brain like electroshock therapy. It leaves me in a state of exhaustion all the way to the bone and a half hour appointment or day out shopping requires more than a week of recovery time.

I’m known by all my relatives and my mother’s friends as a “bleeding heart.” I experience intense, mind shattering grief over the suffering of strangers far away. I’ll break down weeping on the floor after seeing news of another shooting or deadly disaster. I feel like the whole world lives in my heart and I can’t honor or help them all. I feel fierce love for every single person who I have never known and who will never love me back. I cry helplessly for people who don’t know I exist, and I can’t stop caring.

My heart says, “These people are suffering! I have to save them!”

My brain says, “Any attempt to nurse the world back to health is a bandage on a gaping wound. No amount of volunteering or door-knocking or sit-ins will help a system that is powered by human suffering. Everyone fed today will still be hungry tomorrow. Die a martyr and nothing will change.“

I inevitably had a massive nervous breakdown in December of 2016 after a workplace incident of a very raw emotional nature, and I left my job in March of 2017. I have been out of work since. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression from a lifetime of rejection (or praise only under precarious conditions), but my nervous breakdown was like nothing I’d ever experienced. It was like going to Hell. It made me distant and reclusive. It also made me unwilling to take any further shit. 

My anger has swollen fat like an engorged tick to match my level of despair. I have moved beyond sadness and have grown into the shape of fury—the very opposite energy of young fruits in plastic molds growing to look like a grinning Buddha or Valentine’s hearts. I am chomping at the bit for revenge. I want world domination. I can feel my staunchly held belief in justice melting into a fever dream of barbarism. I can feel myself becoming capable of cruelty and I am afraid of what will become of my heart. I won’t hurt anyone—I never could, I once cried cutting up a blanket for a crafts project—but I am afraid that I will devolve into something mean and bitter.

I’ve been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. The therapist believes that my problem is the childhood abuse. When I brought up an instance where I’d been forced to see a beheaded child who had been murdered, she insisted that my issue with this was that I’m projecting my feelings about my childhood molestation onto this dead girl, s because seeing a dead kid is not a normal cause for trauma. /s

My experiences and feelings on the world, including the PTSD and a number of other mental illnesses caused by abuse and bad luck, have driven me to the point where I cannot function with other people. I either burst into a rage or shriek and sob with total despair and I can’t control it. My psychiatrist instructed me to seek out disability benefits, and after two years of being rejected by the state, she concluded that I am still not fit for customer-facing work and that my best employment prospects lie in self-directed craftwork.

“Like beading necklaces and selling them on the internet or something,” she had said. Her other advice was to stop using my cellphone or computers to access the internet; being informed on world news and friends’ problems is apparently extremely damaging for someone like me. This was crushing, since all I’ve ever wanted is to integrate into society and feel comfortable there. All my friends and family lie past the screen of a device and now I’m told that my only chance at a comfortable survival in this world is to completely isolate myself from it.

My girlfriend sent me a clip today of an episode of House M.D., which I’ve never seen before this. The patient in the episode was a highly intelligent man who abused cough syrup and alcohol as a means of blunting his brain’s response to stimulus, allowing him to tolerate the world more comfortably. The main character, the doctor, gives a piece of exposition where he explains that this combination of substances causes a slow decline in function due to brain damage. I was immediately fascinated.

I started thinking about how easily I could do the same to myself. I constantly fantasize about suffering some terrible accident, damaging whatever brain center makes me so sensitive and despairing, and spend the rest of my life blissfully numb, even if it meant dealing with side effects such as blindness or being dead from the neck down. That may sound dramatic to you, but I would rather spend a month mounted on the wall with rusty nails than spend the rest of my life being so sensitive.

Therapy hasn’t helped. Cognitive behavioral therapy hasn’t helped. Meditating hasn’t helped. Journaling hasn’t helped, marijuana hasn’t helped, gratitude hasn’t helped, nor exercise, nor losing weight, nor any other method that I’ve explored. I am doomed to despair and unrequited love of the universe. I need to do something to make my mind less reactive, and I’ve been on a bunch of different pharmaceutical stimulants and sedatives (at different times) to try to accomplish that, to no effect.

I’m not suicidal. I once was but my brother killed himself a few years back and I couldn’t make my mother suffer like that twice. My sister is also extremely sensitive to the horror of the world and has attempted suicide unsuccessfully three times. I failed twice.

I want the terminal suffering of the world to feel distant and far away. I cannot enjoy anything in life while others suffer but I‘m too afraid to become an ascetic to cure it. Does anyone have any advice on overcoming oversensitivity? Are there any drugs, legal or illegal, that will help me achieve this effect with minimal damage to my body? Has anyone experienced this and cured themselves of it? I’m willing to do anything.",29Jan2020,1
957,"The flu is going around right now, and there’s the whole threat of the Corona virus in the back of everyone’s head. On my campus right now, there’s a flu epidemic and the stomach bug is being passed around. Half of the student body has gone to the wellness center this week, so much so that they have a little booth outside for quick pickup of over the counter medicines. 

My roommate and i have Lysol, Clorox wipes, and a humidifier and have been taking the necessary steps to keep ourselves from getting sick. 

However, a lot of the girls on my floor don’t wash their hands after they’ve been in the bathroom. 

I’ll be in the bathroom myself, brushing my teeth or showering or in a stall, and the toilet will flush and the person will just walk out without a problem. It’s disgusting. I’ve started using my own toilet paper and paper towels and hand soap, but even so, other girls that wash their hands shouldn’t have to suffer. Not to mention it’s costly and I’m a college student. 

The RAs are doing nothing about this and our RD just left the school. Would I be wrong if I took it upon myself to put signs on everyone’s door telling them, verbatim, to wash their fucking hands?",29Jan2020,1

960,"I had a hard upbringing, and an impossible to deal with father. As a result I have a hard time developing any type of relationships, and have had the same group of friends for YEARS.

I tried moving away as an attempt to break this box I was putting myself in, but I noticed I don’t feel ‘safe’ with new people. I feel anxious, and I don’t even know where to begin. But around my friends I’m very outgoing and I’m over using them as a crutch. 

The same goes for romantic relationships, I’m ironically more comfortable around guys as I know my looks automatically make them like me (it’s shallow but it helps my anxiety aha), but actually opening myself up and nurturing a relationship is my downfall... looks can only go so far.

963,"So my brother and i know one of the sisters briefly, because we met her at an event and chatted. We both still text with her and she and I had the idea to make a twin meet-up with her sister, her, my brother and me. We're both identical.
Bonus question: what special things should we do?",29Jan2020,1
964,"I’m a current high school senior and I’m about to be 18 in three weeks. The birthday present that I want is to become a United States Marine (or at least start the recruiting process) so I’m planning that on my birthday or the couple of days after my birthday, I want to sign my enlistment papers with my recruiter. 

The thing is, when is the best time to tell her that I’m enlisting? She is **NOT** a fan of me joining the military and she’s told me multiple times that she refuses to let me join no matter what. I’ve even resorted to telling her about the benefits of joining (even though the benefits are the very last reasons for me joining) and she’s said stuff like “when you leave the military, you’re not going to be successful” (because the GI Bill doesn’t exist apparently /s). I was also in JROTC (ha ha throw the jokes and memes in) but recently, she yanked me out of the program since she doesn’t want me doing anything military-related and I’m pretty bummed out about it. If there’s any silver-lining, I guess me being forced to leave JROTC can at least keep my mom happy for a couple of weeks before I break the news. 

Anyway, my original plan was to not tell her a thing about me joining the Marines until the day they literally pick me up to go to the airport to ship out to boot camp but some people have said that it’s a...flawed idea (and it’ll break my mom’s heart). My new plan now is to give her a heads up like a couple of days or a week before I officially turn 18 and sign my papers. 

But like the title said, I’m now debating if I should inform her of my decision BEFORE or AFTER I sign my papers. **Which way would be better and yield “better” results? Which would be less likely to build bridges? Obviously me telling her that I’m joining the Marines is already bad enough but which way would help with some level of damage control?** 

Also, because I know people are going to say this, no matter what, I’m still enlisting. College can wait, I can go to college whenever I want. I only have until I’m 27 to enlist and I rather set myself up right now than wait until then to finally enlist. Not to mention that I don’t want to be just another typical college student fresh out of high school. Why be Random Person Who Goes To College Straight Out Of High School #1.022,272 when I can instead go out and serve my country while also gaining life experience and some money to help set my life up?  

Just so we’re clear and are all on the same page, I got nothing against college. I’m in fact going to college later after I get out of the Marines (I’ve even been snooping and scouring online for colleges just to see my options) but I want to become a Marine above all else right now.  That is my goal and mission right now (aside from graduating high school and passing my classes of course). You might also ask “why not do the Reserves?”; but why? Nothing against Reservists and I can understand why someone would join the Reserves and I still respect them since they’re doing the same jobs as active duty guys but my thinking is, I’m joining the Marine Corps; why not just go active duty and get the entire experience first hand? Why be a Marine two weekends a month and two weeks in the summer when I can be more consistent on active duty? If I’m joining the Marine Corps, then I might as well go all the way through. 

And no, I don’t want to be an officer. First off, an NROTC scholarship is already very competitive and I’m probably not going to get one (don’t even talk about getting into the Academies). Not to mention that I’m joining the Marine Corps to serve my country since I’m a very proud and very patriotic American who deeply loves his country, not to mention that I feel a strong sense of duty to serve my country (yes, you can serve your country in multiple, non-military ways but this is how I feel I can best physically contribute). I don’t want to join just for the benefits or pay either; yeah that’s nice and I appreciate all of the benefits of being in the military but I’m not joining just for those. Plus, I don’t care if officers get paid more or get saluted first, I just don’t see myself leading a platoon or company or battalion of Marines. I like working in the dirt, not being a manager. I’m of better use if you give me orders to follow and I try to follow them as best I can. 

Lastly, yes, I know that the Marine Corps isn’t perfect. It’s not all sunshines and rainbows. Just as there are awesome times and very cool experiences, there is also a lot of bullshit and stupidity. I’ve read enough first-hand experiences to know that there’s gonna be a lot of stupid bullshit going on in the Marine Corps. And I accept that. I’m going to get my ass chewed out and I’ll have to go through tough things. But what job doesn’t have any of those on some levels?",29Jan2020,1

966,"I (36f) was raised by a strong black single mum. My father is white and has never had anything to do with me. Mixed relationships were NOT okay when I came along and Mum has told me that they were both single and just sneaking around when she got pregnant (practice safe sex people lol). Mum admits to being scared he would try to take me from her (huge race imbalance in my country, and his family could’ve taken me from her easily), so she did the wrong thing and didn’t tell him when she got pregnant. She was young, and so was he, people make mistakes. I had an amazing childhood, I love mum and we are super close. Mum has never said anything bad about my father. I should say we know for a fact my aunt told him that I’d been born when I was a week old. People knew whose kid I was just by looking at me and being in a very small town, I’ve had people do double takes at me my whole life, strangers stopping to ask who my dad is, cos apparently I look so much like him. 

When I was 14 I had a strange man offer my father’s contact info to me. I was confused and not sure. At 17 I sent him a letter (with Mum’s blessing) saying I would like to get to know him. He never replied and I considered the matter resolved. But it always bothered me that he has other kids. He moved away, got married and had 3-4 kids. A few years ago I stumbled across one of their Facebook profiles. From there I found 2 more. It’s small town life, so I can’t say how but I know for a fact that they’re my half-siblings, take it as a given. I’ve thought about messaging them, but what if they have no idea I exist? I would hate to hurt them just because I’m curious. I have two sisters and I’m not looking for that. At the same time... they’re family. How do you even start that conversation?

967,"Can urgent take take an x-ray of my hip?

Long story short, I’ve been having hip pain since about the 30th week of my pregnancy with my daughter. She’s 18 months old now and it’s only getting worse. The past couple of days it’s been a lot more painful. 

I’ve tried stretches but I’m already extremely flexible so they don’t help much, and over the counter meds just don’t touch it. 

I’m really starting to worry that there’s more going on, and would like to get it looked at.  Degenerative disc disease runs in my family. My sister was diagnosed at 18, and I’m now 22. The problem is that I don’t have a primary care doctor (working on finding one, and getting some time off to go). 

I don’t want to go to the ER because the wait is awful, and I don’t want to seem like I’m looking for pain meds, because I’m not. I wouldn’t take them even if they gave them to me. 

I’m at a loss as to what to do. It’s getting to the point where it hurts to stand for periods of time, and I work as a medical assistant so that a big deal to me. 

I’m kind of hoping that an urgent care could do an x-ray for me, just to rule out anything serious, and maybe give me some advice on how to Alleviate or lessen the pain.

Overall a good little meetup.

We shook hands and agreed that we’ll chat later. So I sent him a message saying something along the lines of “I really enjoyed our walk and we can chat whenever you like”. Did I handle this right?

979,"A bit of context for the situation, I used to be really good friends with this girl (We'll call her Bexley for privacy). We used to be in a relationship and stuff, but after that didn't really work out, we decided to stay as close friends. Until recently, things were going good between us, but when I expressed my feelings of jealousy and other things towards her, she didn't like it, and it overall wasn't looking too good for our relationship. So, after I found out she was basically just trying to avoid me instead of addressing the issue, and things went downhill from there. 

Long story short, I said some horrible things I didn't truly mean because I was hurt, and she tried to overdose and die. Now, she's done this before, and she has several issues, like Bi-Polar and Depression (diagnosed by doctors, she also has a therapist). But after it happened this time, the school found out, and they were waiting until she came back. Well, after her Mom checked her phone to see what happened, she saw the horrible things I said (that I again didn't truly mean), and she blamed Bexley's suicide attempt solely on me; not taking into consideration all of the other factors. So Bexley's mom and her therapist basically told her to not talk to me. She's been back at school for about 2 weeks now, but we haven't talked much at all.

I just feel stuck. I feel like I've lost one of my closest friends, and everyone just thinks that because of a dumb mistake I made, I'm a horrible person. So I really just need help with coping with the loss of a best friend. I've learned a lot, but I can't help but think about Bexley. Because I care a lot about her. Overall, I just feel regretful. Maybe in time we can be friends again, but I even doubt that, since she can't talk to me. So, any advice or questions are welcome.",29Jan2020,1
