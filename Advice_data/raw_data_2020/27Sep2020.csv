1,"I (19F) am struggling with diagnosed depression since I was 12( family abuse). Last December I had my last suicide attempt by taking 20 sleep pills, but I was rushed into hospital by my family who discovered it in time. Since then I tried to about the suicidal thoughts and be glad that it was a failed attempt. Everytime I want to do something or have a bad thought I tend to talk to my sister (25F) who assures me that it‚Äôs not worth it and I‚Äôm loved, but with every occasion she brings up how useless I am, how much of a bitch I am and how everything I do annoys her. Sometimes I have mood swings from which derives talking on a rough tone or having a little bit of attitude, one time being today. We had a fight in which he was sure to make me feel like the most useless and worse person ever because I‚Äôm not treating her how I should because she‚Äôs paying for my stuffs pretty often (she didn‚Äôt really mentioned it, but it was obvious from the discussion). She always gossips about me with her boyfriend when I do the smallest thing, even when I‚Äôm around them.
Now they are talking about me and I can hear them.
She made me feel like the last time I tried to kill myself. I feel like shit and I don‚Äôt know what I should do about all this sister business. 

Thank you

2,I just bought a new vehicle and I love it so much that the thought of it being vandalized haunts me.

4,"So, I've been talking to this girl for a while. And recently things have become a lot more flirtatious between us. By this I mean, complimenting each other and her telling me that she needs hugs off me to make her happy and that she'll move closer to where I live, just to have an excuse to see me. Of course this is unrealistic, but it's cute nevertheless.

Today we were saying nice things back and forth, and she came out with a comment.

She said, ""Whoever your girlfriend is going to be, in the future, is going to be the luckiest woman alive"".

I wasn't sure how to take this.
Does this mean she's not planning on being anything more with me, or is this just a blatant compliment, and I'm overreacting?",27Sep2020,1
5,"...however I‚Äôm unsure it‚Äôll be worth the time, money, and effort, most of the cars I‚Äôd like to have are from the late 80‚Äôs through the early 2000‚Äôs, thing is I really wanted to modify a car from that time, specifically a cheaper coupe, something the likes of a civic but RWD, it‚Äôs just so much work and I feel like it won‚Äôt be worth it, the car scene also sucks around here, I live in Southern IN, so most people that are into cars only care about trucks, I mean these are the kind of people that call Civics ‚Äúgirl cars‚Äù any thoughts on what I should do, and does anyone on this subreddit have any experience with this stuff?

6,like the movie I don't get why it's hated so much people act so toxic I've it. I get you don't like the movie but to give it this burning hatred is stupid. I mean I see people act like this movie is worse than the holocausts or something. Like whenever anyone says they like the movie there always one person who acts like they belong to burn hell for liking a fucking movie. Well guess what I like the movie. The hatred bothered me a little but you're aloud to hate it but why do people overresct to it please explain why I can't like this movie. Am it retarded for liking the movie now?,27Sep2020,1

My step mom doesn't care and lets this shit happen, whenever I hear loud noises I become jumpy and afraid that someone is gonna knock on my door, I also have anxiety attacks from this and my parents just dont care.

9,"Some background. I‚Äôve been at my job for a year now, I have several coworkers I really like and have become friends with over the time I‚Äôve been here. 

One of them, who I will call V, is a bit of a dumb guy but he‚Äôs very nice and easy to talk to, and a bit of a player. He has a girlfriend who I‚Äôve never met, but they‚Äôve been together for a while, and she has a kid that he‚Äôs helping raise. 

The other day my other coworker T (a good mutual friend of mine and V) came up to me and told me that while he, V, and ANOTHER coworker of mine (we‚Äôll call her G), were hanging out doing normal shit, and at some point in the night V and G hooked up. 

To make matters even worse T has had a crush on G for months now, AND G has FAMILY that work with me!! I have no clue how to handle this situation, if I should tell anyone, or keep it to myself. 

Any advice is welcome, but I should say that I am approaching this from a viewpoint of trying to cause the least amount of damage to any given friendship/work relationship.",27Sep2020,1
10,"Hello, for preface my friend and I are 17, so upperclassmen in high school. 

My friend was in a relationship that most of our friend group and I didn't really have an opinion on until towards the end of it when we were told more about it. It seemed like their ex was being unappreciative of my friend and seemed to be very flakey towards them, also a bit toxic--however I cannot accurately comment on that. After they broke up, the ex harassed other of friends of mine, trying to gaslight them and manipulate their words. They never got an apology from the ex and my friend excused it for them saying that the ex believed we hated them for it (which is a sorry excuse for not apologizing for something that serious). This was a while back.

Recently, however, its been noted that the ex and my friend have been communicating frequently and its raised suspicion among several friends as to why that happened. Upon further questioning, my friend is still in love with them and doesn't see themselves with anyone else and is clinging on to the hope that they will get back together and doesn't want to move on.  This seems to be an unhealthy friendship between the both of them now. My friend needs to move on from their ex and become independent from them because it seems like they never have in a way. I'm not saying they can't be friends, but I think that my friend is using their friendship to feed into the idea that they'll get back together again--and if the ex finds another partner--it'll crusher to a really depressive state and it seems obsessive at this point. I personally believe they should move on first before jumping the gun to friend their ex again--because my friend was still in love with them after they reconnected.  My friend has been trying to insert their ex into friend groups--possibly to get us to bond with them but honestly it just had the opposite effect.

What do I do? Do I just not worry about this? Am I overreacting? There's more details but I'm afraid to get too deep into them. I am very vague here because of it.",27Sep2020,1
11,"I have a lot of regrets. When I look back at my memories and compare myself to others, there‚Äôs a lot I know I missed out on. I‚Äôm not talking academically, like I could‚Äôve used that time to learn this and get better at that‚Äî no, I‚Äôm talking socially. There were clubs I should‚Äôve joined, friends I should‚Äôve held close to heart... which I didn‚Äôt because I was scared.

I‚Äôm not as scared anymore and I‚Äôm more willing to put myself out there. Every once in a while though, I think back and this shame washes over me, and I wonder if I‚Äôll ever move past it. I tell myself that I just have to live with it‚Äî even now, writing this feels silly because it‚Äôs not like I can turn back time. But this shame keeps pulling me back and it‚Äôs hard sometimes to be myself around people.

How do I move on from these regrets and keep them separate from the new relationships I‚Äôm trying to build?",27Sep2020,1
12,"I‚Äôm honestly at the point I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs my malfunction. Maybe it‚Äôs a maturity issue, maybe it‚Äôs something wrong with the way I‚Äôm wired. Me and my parents are both frustrated at things going in a loop and feeling like they need someone to snap me back to reality when I tend to go into daydreams or become highly imaginative of my dreams as a game developer that I often forget to do things in front of me. It‚Äôs genuinely starting to worry both me and my parents, not just because of the fact my short-term focus is shot, but because I get motivated from a talk, do something for a few days then instantly forget it the next day.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm running on auto-pilot and that I‚Äôm so reliant on people telling me what to do and what I can do that I almost don‚Äôt see it; it‚Äôs getting to be a cycle and it‚Äôs frustrating my parents because they know I can do better. It‚Äôs just... I dunno. I tried motivating myself to do something, but it often ends with me being brought into a vicious loop of screwing something up, being motivated to do better, and go back to playing games and working on media. It‚Äôs really starting to upset me, especially given I‚Äôve missed a job recommendation because I forgot about it.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong. The advice most recommended to do little things at the time feels like it‚Äôs not working, and I feel so useless but I don‚Äôt know how to invest into something long term ‚Äî it‚Äôs really upsetting me, and I don‚Äôt know what it is, if it isn‚Äôt wiring, behavior, or something else entirely. All I know is that I‚Äôm also partly afraid to give up having some degree of escapism in my life in the form of the Internet, because it‚Äôs honestly what‚Äôs keeping me sane.

What should I do? Could it be that I have a chemical imbalance/malfunction? Or could it be I just have some behavior issues? How can I resolve this if the one thing that helped me through this from high school was having an aide with me to keep me focused? Is there anyone else who‚Äôs having this problem as well? Is there any advice those people can offer? The sooner I get help on how to move my days-to-days with one step forward at a time, the better. Because at this point? I have no idea what‚Äôs going on and why I feel like I don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù the importance of basic self-management. But I‚Äôm not giving up.",27Sep2020,1

14,"We adopted our dog Moose from the shelter about 3 years ago. At first, he loved other dogs and we frequently took him to dog parks and such. 

About a year after getting Moose, we adopted our other dog, Beans. Moose loved Beans so much he would pick him up by his scruff and carry him around as a puppy. They got along so well until one day Moose snapped. 

Moose all of a sudden would attack Beans and didn't just want to hurt him, but wanted to kill him. No matter what, once Moose gets a hold of Beans he will not let go. 

We've spent thousands on training for Moose and we have tried anxiety meds but nothing has made the situation better. For the past 6 months, we have been trying to rehome Moose in an environment where he'd be the only dog but, unfortunately, we haven't had any luck. 

At this point, we have to constantly keep them separated and Moose is basically living his life in a crate (Moose will attack Beans even if he is out and Beans is in his crate). 

Is putting him down the responsible thing to do in this situation or would you advise taking him to a shelter?",27Sep2020,1
15,"I was on a walk earlier this evening and saw a backyard party going on at one of the frat houses near campus. Seemed like there were plenty of people and I had never been to one, so I walked in. I mingled a little and was getting on well with everyone. Someone had asked who I knew and I mentioned that I didn‚Äôt know anyone there outside of a guy I had gone to high school with fucking years ago, and it seemed alright. 

People started filing out but no one asked me to leave and there were still some people coming and going so I stayed around. I tagged along when they were giving tours of the two frat houses and occasionally chimed in with comments. Eventually the lead frat guy who showed up midway through me being there asked if everyone wanted to smoke before they went to do something and not thinking I went inside to hang out with the girl he brought. 

He asked the girl outside and a few seconds later another dude came in and said that since I didn‚Äôt really know anyone in the frat they didn‚Äôt want me to stay. I totally understood, said sorry if I was at all imposing and left. 

Now I‚Äôm back in my room and I feel super embarrassed. I thought everything was all good and obviously they had a good reason to ask me to leave but now I‚Äôm super concerned that I‚Äôve marked myself as some weirdo who tried to force herself into this group. I wasn‚Äôt trying to, I was trying to hang out and get to know them since I don‚Äôt know many people yet.

Then, she took her bag back and so did I, because I felt bad that I wasn't carrying my light bag, and my friend was still carrying her heavy one.

I am currently in training under a mentor to become a teacher [I am 21F working through college] Last week while I was about to leave the middle school I was training at, my mentor [30-ish? M] made a comment to one of the male students about the way I was dressed (I was wearing a kahki skirt with a uniform shirt) he said something about how I was dressed just to arouse him and how I wanted to be violated...usually I would ignore remarks like this but he has been acting creepily lately. The other day he insisted he give me a ride home while I was waiting for my dad (I commute) but he wanted to stop by his home first. When I stated my dad was on his way he just glared and sat there starting at me...it was dark and not a lot of people around so I was scared and very happy when my dad finally pulled in.

22,"This is the first time I am posting here, and I am not entirely sure if my title is able to quite address my question, so I will provide a little context.

Around 6 months ago I met a girl close to my age who I started chatting with. We grew closer and gradually when she had difficult periods in her life, I helped her overcome them. Situations that were rather difficult to manoeuvre, I helped her through them and she came out of it well. We confided in each other and it made us grow closer. She said she wanted to be there for me the same way I was there for her.

We cut to about a month ago. Me and my friends were together when we suddenly got the news that one of our other friends had suddenly died. It frankly broke me somewhat. I felt the pressure from my work for college but I tried to reach out to the people that I knew were close to him. I wanted to make sure that they heard as soon as possible (personal/cultural reasons that I could explain if asked). I checked up on them during that week and made sure they were doing okay, that they didn't need to shoulder the grief alone.

I felt it crashing down on me over the next few days since I heard the news. The reality of it had begun setting in. I wanted to confide in the girl who had said that she would be there for me. The ""outsider"" that could help alleviate the burden of feeling all the pain. I was dismissed due to her being occupied with her work for school.

Life goes on and my friends and I got through it, we miss him still but acceptance has set in and the intensity of it all died down somewhat. However, whenever I talk to her, or think about her, I see her as someone who failed me. I should stress, there is no animosity in the thought. I don't feel unfairly treated because the things I did for her were no reciprocated in kind. Genuine acts of kindness are not investments. I did what I did for her because I thought of her to be a good and genuine person, and I'd still do it again. Yet the thought that she failed me upon the first chance to be there for me in my hour of need still bothers me.

I don't seek to end our friendship necessarily because of that solely, I don't think that addresses the problem. I want to be able to move on from that, forgiveness can be earned, but a chance needs to be given. For that to happen I need to see past the failure. How do I do that?

I am willing to explain any parts that may have been unclear or address any relevant questions to my post. This was somewhat of a stream of consciousness, so lapses in clarity are not unexpected.

Thank you for reading.",27Sep2020,1
23,"So we're moving in to our home and a neighbor introduces herself. She seems very nice, and is apparently very wealthy. She has a ton of good quality stuff she wants to get rid of, she seems to constantly replace perfectly fine things with brand new things - and we just happen to need some of the things she's giving away. So we gratefully accept some clothing and small furnishings for our place. How nice!

Well, other than being generous with her things, it turns out she's not very nice at all. She continually invites herself over. I put her off as much as I can but eventually give in. Then she talks and talks and talks, I can barely get a word in. And when I do, she tops whatever I say. If I've climbed a hill, she's climbed a mountain, that kind of thing. Fine, let her talk down at me. But then she insults how I decorate - in a really passive way. A ""zapper"" you don't see coming and can't believe just happened. If she ever asks a question, which is rare, it's only to redirect the conversation to herself. She talks badly about another neighbor even though this neighbor has been helping her out.

I've grown to absolutely hate spending a second of time with her, but I feel obligated because of the gifts she gave us, and I don't want there to be bad blood with someone I'll probably live close to for a long long time. I feel like a schmuck now, like I should have known ""nothing in life is free"", but I genuinely thought she was just being generous. Now I feel manipulated and trapped.

27,"I (17m) am a senior year in highschool now and as any other highschooler my age I am presented with a choice of continuing studying or finishing highschool and getting a job. Now, I do want to continue studying and finish a faculty but I don't know which one. In my country and city there are over 200 faculties for almost any field of work and study imaginable.

 So a little bit about myself: I am a mix of an introvert-extrovert which means if presented with the opportunity to talk and be talkative I will gladly do it as I am very good with dealing with people due to my high charisma. But I will mostly avoid social interactions if they do not benefit me. For that reason I like to stay home and be by myself usually. I like to study all the things for a little bit without committing to a particular subject. I like to think of myself as a creative and generaly smart person since I am full of smart and creative ideas which could work but I just don't have the means to make them. I am also very optimistic and some say oveconfident, I might be lazy but if I set myself a goal I will aim to finish it no matter how hard might it be. Since I am lazy I tend to look at things more optimistically and not really as they are because I have a hard time dealing with this harsh reality in which we live in. I am also not that great at math even though I like it kinda. My inner self is an adveturer which waits to be released as soon as it finishes faculty.

Some options I have been presented with by myself and my parents are:
-Faculty of Organizational sciences( I would like to study Management on this faculty)
-Faculty of transport (this one was presented to me by my parents and out of all the majors I went with logistics which I know nothing about)
Now there are tons of faculties in my city which are probably great but I am to lazy to look through them.
Other ones I have interest in are Philosophy and Psycholgy but this ones require some general knowledge which is mostly outdated.

Thats mostly it. Sorry its to long. Also sorry for bad spelling.

TLTR; Highschool student presented with a dillema of continuing education or getting a job which he is not ready for and does not want a full time job at all any time soon. An introvert and an extrovert had a baby and they made me which is a mix of both. Rather lazy but will do it for the couse. Interested in everything but not to much.",27Sep2020,1

she‚Äôs asexual so i know its 100% innocent for her but it often come across as romantic/almost sexual.

31,"\[20M\], this is probably just gonna end up with me venting.

For the past few months, I've been feeling extremely down and sad for reasons I can't pinpoint. I'm currently doing online schooling because of stupid covid, and the workload has taken a giant stress on me, so much so that I had to drop one of my major classes, and I went from being a full time student to part time student. I just feel so worthless right now. The friends that I've made in college I feel like are just slipping away. I have one friend that listens to me vent and tries to give me advice but I feel like he just doesn't want to hear it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had these feelings of emptiness and worthlessness, but they really only came once in awhile when I was a few years younger. Now they're almost always a part of me, and im losing so much motivation for everything. I'm not taking showers everyday anymore, and honestly, thoughts of suicide cross my mind and I don't even get worried about them anymore. I would never commit the act, but they just cross my mind and I feel so numb that they don't even faze me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so behind in everything in life. Everyone I know is in relationships, being social, having some sort of sex life, happy, and just living life to the fullest, and I'm here with nothing to be proud about. I haven't really told anyone about how I feel, and this post is basically my first time talking about these issues I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the worst thing about it is I grew up in the most stable household you could think of. Two loving parents and an older brother, middle class, basically the American dream. My dad and mom were both very independent when they were my age, and my brother had a way better time than me when he was my age. My social skills are very lacking as well, especially since quarantine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do right now. Im sitting in my bed just numb, and I just want to be happy for a change. I can't even cry anymore, I'm literally incapable of crying out my feelings. I just think sometimes the world would be better without me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could list thousands of negative things about myself that I'll spare everyone the details about, and sometimes not even one positive thing. Another thing is I feel like my moods rapidly shift. I could be in a great mood for a few hours, then down in the dumps for several days, but 70-80% of the time i'm in a really shitty mood with endless thoughts of self hatred.

I think a big thing thats on my plate right now and is a source of my self hatred is not having a girlfriend. I've never had any sort of experience before, and I know it's because I don't put myself out there at all. I never really went to any parties or anything like that, and I definitely lack the social skills to talk to girls.

Like I said before, I just need some advice on what to do, but one thing I don't want to do is to tell my parents about my issues. I can't bare to see them this hurt over how much of a failure I am, and I'd rather just deal with it on my own.",27Sep2020,1
32,"So my Dad and I don't have a great relationship. This mostly stems from him being an arrogant, narcissistic, belligerent, pedantic, overly critical asshole who'd always undermine your feelings if he didn't agree with them. He's also got an anger issues and was verbally abusive towards my Mom and I, and tried to scare me out of doing anything I wanted to do that he didn't want me to do.

We still hung out once or twice but I made sure to keep my distance and restrict the information I gave him, for my own mental health's sake. I've been in therapy for almost a decade for anxiety issues stemming from his behaviour, and it took me a long time to let it go and stop letting him get to me.

Well now he has some sudden health issues with his kidneys and now he's freaking out. He'll call me talking about how he's anxious, and how he's crying and he just needs someone to talk to. How he is wants a ""child that loves him"", how he wants to be closer to me etc. 

I tell him, he needs a therapist, he needs to talk to his doctor about the anxiety. But he's sick of having to go to the doctor so much recently, keep in mind I've been to doctor multiple times over the last month for health issues and he never empathizes, he always tries to give me *his* diagnosis. 

But suddenly he wants empathy from me. The person who doesn't show empathy to me at any time, would deny any of the issues I had and claim I was lying because I just didn't want to do it, despite me explaining it multiple times. The person who puts down my mother and grandmother who went through a lot of shit in their life and still managed to come out in a good position. The person who didn't take me to the doctor when I had a legit medical issue because he thought I was making it up, even though it persisted for weeks. The person who is the reason that I have a hard time just being myself. That person wants me to sit there and be his therapist. 

He didn't start with an apology, he doesn't want to know what he did wrong. If I told him he'd just get mad because he denies everything. He wants to ambush me with a conversation and then ask if I love him. 

It's actually triggering my anxiety, because if I make a hard stand I know he'll act out, that's what he does, that's why I am careful with what I say around him. 
But I'm getting close to the breaking point. There isn't an honest answer that will satisfy him. 

But what am I supposed to say ""I don't love you. I tolerate you. And I do that because I realize you're an ill person who threw all their chances at happiness away for arrogance and anger, and the thing I learned the most from you is that I should do everything in my power to not end up like you"". That's not very nice, and no doubt will start some shit that I don't need to be involved with right now. 

I don't know how to respond to this situation.",27Sep2020,1
34,"I graduated college in January and secured a full time job however, 3 days before I was supposed to start, covid came and my job was cut. A few weeks after that, my boyfriend of 2 years suddenly had a falling out with his roomate and moved back home 2000 miles away. Since then, I have moved back home away from a big city into a very isolated suburb with my parents. Most of my friends moved away from college for the same reasons and I have never felt so lonely. 

My boyfriend told me he really wants to be with me (and I want to be with him) and said he would love for us to try living together in his home state. I agreed this would be a good idea to try but he hasn‚Äôt been putting in the effort on his end to make it happen (yet I tell him how hard long distance is and he seems to forget about it the next day). I told him that I need some sort of security going there (aka like even a part  time job for both of us). But he‚Äôs very much settled into his own new routine and established a whole new group of friends. I just feel insecure and lonely :( On the other hand, I mentioned this idea to my parents and their values are highly against me moving in with a boyfriend (let alone in another city with very little job opportunity). 

My family is a little snooty and has extremely high expectations for me. I feel like my life is out of my own hands right now. I feel like my heart is in my boyfriend‚Äôs hands and my career is in my parents. 

Tl;dr, I want to live a life of adventure and have a career and I just feel very stuck in all areas of life from my relationship, to being stuck on an isolated farm, to my parents expectations, to my grandparents and their expectations, I feel like my life is out of control and I‚Äôve been feeling very anxious and big sad.....

I hate physically abled people. I hate people with supportive biological families. I hate so many groups.

38,"My foster parent came in my room and said she's going to have to put a 3 drawer tote in my closet because she took in a baby and there isn't any room anywhere else she can put the baby's clothes. The tote was here when I arrived but she took it out because I wasn't using it.

Basically, she's going to use a teenagers room/closet to store baby clothes (or maybe more things? I don't know yet). Meaning her or her girlfriend can come into my room at anytime and waltz through my cramped closet space and put in a drawer for baby clothes. I already use the closet to put MY clothes in there. And a duffel bag of miscellaneous items from when I arrived here, along with a leather furniture foot rest thing that was already there, and my weights. Does a baby really have that many clothes they have to use my room/closet to put them? And if there isn't enough room to keep a babys clothes, shouldn't they NOT have the baby in the first place?

Oh, and also, I don't have a locking mechanism on my bedroom door. Well I do, but it's on the outside of my door, meaning anyone who can reach the doorknob can lock me inside my own room, with no way to get out. Which I have been locked in my room a few times before, by the three year old (now four years old) that they adopted. Shouldn't a teenage 17 year old have enough respect to have a lock on the inside of his door, allowed that one sliver of privacy? 

The lock on the outside of the door is a fire code and I believe is against building codes because it is a fire hazard if I were to be trapped in my room during a fire. (Am I correct?)

The lock was like this before I came here. They don't knock either. Just walk in when they need to say something or if need my help with something. 

And I just brought it up to one of them when they came home, asked her if there is anywhere else at all where they can put the tote/clothes, and she pretty much said no, I don't use all of my closet, and my closet is really the only space where she can put it. She even said there were three kids living in the room before I came here, and her daughter in the basement has a fold up closet. I've been the only kid in my room for 8 months now, but the three kids she was talking about was I think 10 months ago.

I told her that it feels invasive to me, like it reminds me when I lived with my biological mother, who used my bedroom for storage before I came into care. She said its really only the closet, it's not like the baby is going to sleep in my room. I asked her if we can set up times so she can get clothes instead of walking in unannounced, and she said ""so if the baby poops all over himself he's not supposed to have clothes?"" And then she said that they can come in whenever they feel like it. I just feel with no lock for privacy on my door, them not knocking and opening the door without notice, and using my room/closet to put the babys clothes in, I don't have a sense of security or trust. It's making me feel triggered from things before I came into care, I feel very uncomfortable, not to mention I am a Male in a house of 4 females. (The baby is a boy, but he isn't really active or mobile). I don't feel like I'm understood from my point of view, how I'm trying to communicate I don't feel trusted or secure with this happening. 

Recap:

My foster parents don't have ""anymore space"" to put a baby's clothes so their using my room/closet that means they can just come in whether I'm home or not. And I already have private and boundary issues with my personal space and belongings. Please please help me out, point me in some direction of how I can bring it up to them without sounding rebellious or aggressive.",27Sep2020,1

40,"Flash back to 2 almost 3 weeks ago my daughter gets very sick at the daycare i work at, she was having accidents for 2 days straight i took her out of daycare the first day went to the doctors and didn't get my daughters results back till just this Friday early morning and found out she had or still has e coli . I had also been sick the week before but with severe stabbing pains near my liver and went in to the hospital because I could not hold anything down. The doctors didn't mention e coli when I had gotten several tests at the hospital done but I suspect it was what my 4 yr old had. I called my daycare that Friday morning and informed them (FYI my daughter was running a tempture that day as well) they told me they would look up the arizona guidelines for health and safety and no parents have been notified after my 24 hours of reporting. I should also add that I had gotten covid while working at the daycare back in June and just got over being ill for 3 months straight. I cant handle getting sick at this job anymore.

We had a mild scare yesterday and my wife ended up in the hospital believing she may be leaking amniotic fluid. Everything came back normal thank God and the doctor even said we've created ""The perfect Specimen."" Of course i made a sarcasti joking ""Haha look what I made."" comment to which we both laughed as we're just thrilled she's known as perfect to the docs and not us. Hours later my wife made a Facebook post for a laugh and stated how proud I was for people describing the situation. To which a family friend stated ""Girl you're housing the baby all he did was put it there."" Is it wrong to be upset by this?

44,"know the title sounds weird, but this is a wierd situation. 

We have our recycling bin and trash can on the side of our house. We rented the house for a few years and bought it from landlord. It's strange but this issue started after we bought the house.

Our recycling is picked up on Saturday and a few time we we come home from a mini trip and find our bin out on the street. Basically letting people know that no one was home. Our neighborhood is ok but bordered by some not so great areas. We were upset but let it go a few times when our bin was empty it was still put out. Ok we were home so we dont know why that done. We finally got fed up and bought a 6ft length of chain and a lock from Home Depot and locked our trash and recycling together. Solved the issue for over a year.

NOW here is where it gets creepy!

Well we had to do some repairs in the back yard and the child safety pool fence had to come down. So we borrowed the lock from the cans but left the chain on and used it to lock the gate. Well the next day our recycling bin is out on the street. This was after covid and when our city stopped recycling so all our cleaned recycling we were holding until it started again got trashed. We were MAD, not to mention creeped out they are still checking our locked bins. WTG

Now its gets even creepier!

I had ordered something and it came in a heavier card board box. So I was going to use it to line my trunk when I bought garden supplies. I set it on top of our recycling bin. The next day it was in the bin. I took it back out again, and again it was in. This happened two more times the last time my boyfriend put a heavy rock on top of it. Next day both the rock and box were just gone. Next we made a hand made you are on camera and no trespassing sign  and taped them on the side of the house. A few days later they were ripped down. Then the bin was out on the street again.

My boyfriend ordered an easy to install security camera to cover that area but it's back ordered until Mid October. 

I am upset becuase one of the neighbors wont just leave our property alone and think they have a right to decide where things go. We have a suspicion of who it is, our thought was to write a letter and leave it on the bin telling them how much this upsets us and asking them just to leave it alone and if they dont we will pursue other actions. When we first bought the house someone cut open a utility box on the side of our house and took our lavender plants. So this coming o to our property when are home and messing with things really bothers us.

Part of us worries they wont listen or get the hint becuase they clearly didnt when we locked the cans up amd we kept putting our cardboard back. Also the nerve to take our no trespassing sign. They still were apparently checking them after a year. Why are they so obsessed with our recycling??

We wont stand for someone else messing with our property. But we are fixing this house up to be a seasonal rental. So we do not want to cause issues that may cause problems for us or our future tenants. What do we do??",27Sep2020,1

48,"Hey üëã
I'm Finley, I'm 15 years old, and my Ndad sucks. 
I've posted here before but this is a fresh account so I'm gonna drop my story here, and hope someone reads it üíô

These are the things my dad's done to me since I was like 4 years old:

constant criticism

threatened to send me away or threatening to leave me,

shouted at me and called me names and used sarcasm to hurt me

Cutting me off mid conversation and telling me my opinion was worthless

blamed me and scapegoated me

tried to control my life

Telling me I'll amount to nothing, that I'm a disappointment ect.

Criticizing my achievements

Constantly making me choose sides between my parents

Unpredictable aggresion, and in these times hed like break alot of stuff

pushed me too hard and didn't recognise my limitations

Not reacting to my sickness/pain (cutting my fingers, feeling sick, headaches ect.) and not bringing me to the doctor

Didn't allow me to have friends

ignored me as a punishment when he saw fit

Gaslighting

Comparing everything I do to him (e.g intelligence, strength, abilities...)

Made me feel guilty for going to see friends or on holidays, or try to stop me going by various means including drinking when I went and making me think it is my fault he's an alcoholic

Indirectly and directly telling me of ways he would be better off it he hadn't had me

Convincing me my mother doesn't love me, and was a bad person and a crook

Invalidating my emotions and calling me self-pitying

manipulated me into feeling worse for him than for me when he was shouting at me

Guilt-tripping and calling me ungrateful

And he also threw stuff at me, not to hit me, but to me. Hit me with the stuff he threw maybe a couple of times but very very rarely. 

And he has done some pretty hard punishments. Like when I got a bad report card, the last time I got one, he made me go out and run 3k in hail-stone in shorts and a t shirt. If he gave out to me my mother would then also give out and sometimes lock me outside. In the rain a couple of times when I was really young. Dad did the same thing but didn't lock me outside, he just shouted at me until I went outside to escape him and he would leave me there the whole night if I didn't come back in when he was asleep. If I went in and he wasn't asleep he'd give me hell. 

Then very occasionally he would not give me food after one of these shout-fests, which isn't a problem now because I can cook for myself but was when I was younger it was.

My father was an alcoholic, often going out for days on end drinking, staying with different people, only to return at all hours of the night to take me away from my mother and sisters to take care of him/keep him company. When I was very young, I'd say from around four years old, he would just take me away in a taxi to his house and spend ages telling me about what a disappointment his life was and how better it would have been if he hadn't had kids and just left our town.. He'd often tell me about the parties he'd been at and I was about eleven when I discovered he did drugs. He also once told me around the same age about this wild party he had been at where their was some kind of underage stripper/prostitute. After these stories he'd usually show me a film and he'd fall to sleep, I'd help him down to bed and either go to my room without blankets or anything, or into his bed. When I got a bit older, maybe from seven years old, he'd ask me to come with him and my mother would ask me to stay, when he'd come in the middle of the night. I almost always went with him as I knew he'd be mad if I didn't, and when I'd say I was tired and didn't want to go he'd start telling me how ungrateful I was and how he'd never thought I'd let him down that much, which meant I'd go with him, crying in the taxi.

I don't know weither he ever hit me. He probably didn't, although that's surprising. My only reason I think he might have hit me is because he was a very violent man and killed alot of our pets growing up. He also would hit the family dog when I was really small. 

And even up until 13 or 14 years old dad would be shouting/scapegoating/name-calling at me he would often stop me from running to my room by pulling me back, blocking me with his arms or body, or grabbing me to keep me in the room with him. I remember feeling scared of how much power he had over me, and how small I was. He would also would stand right right up next to me and look down at me telling me how he could talk to me like that but I could NEVER talk to him like that. 

It surprises me I don't remember him hitting me me, which he probably didn't. But I have a vague memory of him hitting me once while drunk, but it's too hazy to say weither or not it happened, so I'm just gonna say it didn't. 

 My mother and I have our own problems. She always uses my relationship with my father as a way of getting me to do stuff and against me when she feels like it. She'll always threaten to bring me over to his house and make me stay their full time, I'm currently there all hours of the day except nights but also nights on weekends. Even though alot of nights I stay awake at my mom's worried she's going to come in and kill me, I've thought this from young cause because of my dad's abuse she was pretty unstable when I was a kid, and sometimes now. I still prefer to spend nights with her. She used to hit my sister alot , and some verbal abuse too, and hit me too, though not as much. All this hitting never was hard enough to leave bruises tho, sometimes with hairbrushes and stuff. She kinda emotionally abused me too when I was younger, and is still toxic now, but nothing compared to my dad.
I kinda think my mom passively tried to kill me as a kid. I mean, this doesn't really upset me that much cause she was having a really tough time with my dad's abuse, we all were, but I'd obviously never do this to anyone never mind my kids.  She used to leave me outside in he rain, she enabled my dad's abuse (even though she thought/knew he was hitting me), and I'm pretty sure (I even thought it then) that she used to put stuff in my food and drinks to poison me, that memory is hazy but I'm pretty sure, even if it wasn't too poison me she was into a lot of herbal stuff too so idk. 
I also used to stay awake ever night because I thought she was going to kill me in my sleep. I mean, I did this with my dad too though. She didn't give us any attention besides that really as kids. A few times when I was a fucked up little kid I held a kitchen knife to my throat and said that I ""wasn't afraid to die"" and would stab myself. She just told me to stop being stupid and grow up. 
I even tried to drown myself at 9 and she just told me to grow up, not sure if she thought I was being serious with this one tho. 

I'm just looking for some support and mainly advice on what y'all think I should do if you read this. 
I'm still in this situation except for the fact that my mom doesn't hit us anymore (though it never was very hard), he allows me to have friends now to am extent but he doesn't like me hanging out with them, I'm not locked outside anymore, my father hasn't drank in almost a year (mainly because of covid I think) but his abuse hasn't stopped if anything it's gotten worse, and I don't think mom's trying to kill me now. Even though I do think she will sometimes as she's kind of unstable when upset.

All this makes me very suicidal, it makes me aggressive, it makes me self harm, it has given me a borderline ED, made me depressed, socially anxious (with anxiety attacks) and my total ACE score is 5. It's tearing me apart. 

Thank youüíô",27Sep2020,1

I want something that would actually be very different from Umass, as Isenberg is not that bad of a business school and I do not want to waste money going to a school that would be practically the same. I am currently looking at BC, Cornell, and the University of Texas at Austin. I am kind of in a panic because spring transfer deadlines are very soon, but I would really love to get out of Umass for a better opportunity.",27Sep2020,1

60,"Hey guys. I was in a toxic, trauma bonded, co dependent, emeshed relationship for seven years. That relationship ended in march of this year. I then jumped into another relationship right after, that ended recently after five months. I realized I've been codependent my whole life. 

Especially with my codependent mother. I hopped from an unhealthy, co dependent relationship with my mom who has narcissistic tendencies, to my ex of seven years, to my most recent ex. I also struggle with an anxious attachment style, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, C-PTSD, and depression. I didn't realize I was codependent till four years ago, was in denial up until a few months ago. I was diagnosed as BPD in 2018, but didn't truly accept or see how my issues affected my relationship until July of this year. I'm in therapy and working on self care. I want to be a better person who is self reliant.

I obviously can't informally chat with them while class is going on. At work, I'm pretty much acquaintances with everybody. There are some of my co-workers who I tend to joke a lot with and talk a lot with, and there are others who I'm just simply friendly with. But there are no tensions or conflicts or negative interactions going on. However, I feel this sense of loneliness in me, because no one at work or school actually give a shit about me.

I've been feeling this way ever since quarantine started 6 months ago, and I don't know why. I spent a shit load of time ruminating on my past and holding grudges.

I have had a best friend for 4 years and we have been through a lot together. He has started getting better looks and joined football and just started talking to the person who relentlessly bullied him and the rest of my friends when we were friends. He really hurt me when I was extremely depressed and now he is talking to him and planning on hanging out. I feel so betrayed and he didn‚Äôt tell me for a month. He told me he wouldn‚Äôt play with him on PlayStation and just hang out outside of school and online because ‚Äúhe dosent want to spend Highschool on PlayStation‚Äù even though I invite him to things he just always has something going on and never invites me to anything. Now a week has passed and I forgot about it and Then today i found out that he friended him on PlayStation. I am willing to forgive him so i say can I join your party and talk to you guys later and he said no. He has been referencing that he dosent think my friends are cool enough or something to hang out with him. I don‚Äôt know what is going on and i really don‚Äôt want to lose another close friend but it seems like my best friend is becoming friends with the person who bullied me and is not bringing me with him.

67,"Just to kind of bring anyone who cares up to speed, COVID hit me hard. I had just moved back into my parents house temporarily in the hopes that my self-employment would earn me a sufficient wage to move out, and as I had hoped it did and I no longer feared long hours of a job I completely resent. I was very happy with this at this point I'm a year and a half sober in AA which I no longer associate with but it is significant because my family and my friends at that time who are no longer my friends much preferred me to be predictable and as boring and resentful of life as they are. Over that period going to the gym and lifting was my sanity and the only means I have of maintaining stability, meds help but nothing compares to it, so I'm getting high for 2 months now during covid and it's still fun, 3 months okay this is no longer fun and my mind and body went to complete shit my plan of getting high to cope with living with my parents was not lasting over that seemingly endless span of time until the gyms open up. So I eventually manage to make enough money despite every other aspect of my life sucking, and about 8-10 weeks ago moved out of state into the city and hit the ground running at the gym and getting high no longer is my priority, I get high now once a week sometimes not at all but that's no longer a concern for me because I'm thoroughly preoccupied however I haven't picked up working and my plan was to take it easy and just go to the gym, start eating properly again and build up some motivation, so far so good I get to the gym religiously. 

 I could financial handle another 2 months of rent comfortable without monitoring my spending or even having to stress to get back on track and slowly introduce working, I don't know if I am doing the right thing and the guilt of not being productive and it not appealing to me is eating me up because that just is not what I believe in, I believe if a person is my age they have no excuse to not be working, and it is conflicting now that my perspective on mental health has changed and I previously got out of what was a life long depression for the first time in my life (it was a long fucking process) because I stuck it out even though it was bullshit but at the same time I paced myself and I know that made a big difference, I have no friends left after this ordeal it wasn't a result of me hurting anyone I was only hurting myself though it isn't fun for anyone to watch and I understand this well, and even though I didn't go back to being the scumbag I used to be; stealing, but it hurt my parents deeply to have to watch me through that time but the second my friends found out they ghosted me which I have no respect for this and after that it became much easier to cut the rest of the dead weight out of my life and now I live alone and have little social contact so I'm with my thoughts all day long, now I deal with it but it is depressing as shit a lot of times. 

I would really like to know if anyone relates or has advice because I don't have anyone to ask or talk to anymore there came a time where I just won't unload this shit onto people and speak truthfully about where this left me because some of the friends that did stick around for a little while ended up using it against me and rather forcefully wanted to make me aware that I am a bad person and a junkie whether or not there were good intentions behind it doesn't concern me because it was just outright disrespectful the manner it was done and highly unnecessary like this shit was just out of left field , s now I don't bother and at least life now is consistent and I don't waste compassion on people who don't appreciate it, I tried to hook my boy up with a job and he asks me to advance him a couple hundred bucks I tell him I'm not dealing with his bullshit than the next day I gave it to him because I had money and didn't care and still don't but I am baffled at how disrespectfully my friends cut me off like these are childhood friends, Im  still looking strung out somehow because I'm a mess and am getting accused of being high and I'm thinking I look at least decent now and shit and the other day a cop pulls me over and has me step out of the car immediately because my car was a mess, he's pointing at the single track mark I have left that hasn't gone away yet telling me not to insult his intelligence I know what you're doing when I'm trying to hit squats and deadlifts and not think about how much of a fuck up I have been trying to get back to being strong, and I don't know what might be in that car or what I might not have remembered to remove , but the point is I'm tired, tired of being reminded of this shit tired of being called a junkie because there is just a negative connotation with that like I wasn't doing everything in my power to keep my problems from affecting other peoples lives and doing what I could to not hurt people around me. I don't know how this comes across but to be completely clear I am aware I'm not a victim of circumstance this is another firm belief of mine because I see what playing that role does and I want better than to act as if I have no control over my outcome.

My entire life i‚Äôve been accustomed doing things hands on or seeing it right in front of me, but the whole online thing makes it impossible for me to learn- especially with the classes that have nothing to do with my major (Theatre Performance). Not to mention, as things are kind of moving forward I‚Äôve had auditions, rehearsals, and/or filming that I need to focus on but classes are just this giant obstacle in the road. I just do not care at all.

70,"[Obligatory ‚ÄúThis is my first post; please direct me to a more appropriate sub for this question if there is one.‚Äù]
 
The question pretty much speaks for itself, but I‚Äôll give some background info for context and a few details to clarify my particular situation.

My husband and I have been talking for a while about how soon we‚Äôd like to start having children. Due to my medical history, my doctor has told me that I‚Äôll need to give her at least 3 months notice before we start trying to conceive, as they‚Äôll need to adjust my medications and run a number of tests. So to clarify- I am not pregnant now, but I‚Äôm asking for advice as this whole process will require lots of foresight and planning on my part.

Now for some details... I work for a company that is very much male-dominated (less than 10% female workforce). Furthermore, of the few people who have quit this year, most have been relatively new mothers who cited an inability to balance work life/motherhood as their reason for leaving. I‚Äôd rather not disclose what states I work in (all my work friends are on Reddit) but I will say that we‚Äôre in the U.S. Also, our company doesn‚Äôt offer much beyond the minimum requirement for maternity leave (12 weeks unpaid leave), but we do have an option to enroll for short-term disability coverage (which I have) to receive 50% or your normal pay rate during maternity leave.

With the timeline that we are considering for starting a family, I would be reaching the end of my first trimester around the time of my annual review for work. Given the number of years that I‚Äôve worked for the company, I will also be in line to receive a significant pay raise. I don‚Äôt know whether I should plan on disclosing my pregnancy before/during/after my annual review. Most of what I‚Äôve read has been very conflicting- some people advise disclosing your pregnancy as early as 6 weeks, others say to wait til 20 or more, if you can. But I‚Äôm not sure what to do...

Could disclosing that I‚Äôm pregnant early on possibly increase my chances of getting the pay raise? (i.e. considering it will mean they can anticipate an entire 3 months of literally not having to pay me) Or would management be more likely to say ‚ÄúWell, our last 3 new moms quit on us within a year, so why would we expect any different from this one?‚Äù",27Sep2020,1

72,"This is gonna be a long one and I am on mobile and a burner since very few ppl in my family or friend group know about this.

For the past 4 years, maybe longer, my brother (25) and mother (mid 50s) have been ""drug buddies"". I don't know what else to call them but that describes it enough. I believe their drug of choice I believe is either crack or heroin but I have only ever found powdered substances before so idk (I don't know shit about drugs). 

A little info on their relationship: they constantly yell at each other calling one another names you wouldnt even say to your worst enemy let alone your mother/son. Their almost daily activities consist of either sitting around watching TV all day (both jobless for a while now but recently started unemployment) and if they aren't there they are driving around god knows where and don't come home until around 10-11pm. Thats all I see as important on that topic so onto the next subject.

Now I regret to admit that I have been a large source of their money for the past year or so. See I turned 20 may of this year and from august of 2018 until February of this year I held onto my first job, which was a data entry clerk at a banking company. For a first job it was an alright gig that definitely kept me afloat with money, which since I still live at home and don't have a car or phone (with service at least) I currently don't have to pay any bills or anything. I don't know if that comes off like bragging or anything but I promise I don't mean it to sound like that. My dad (61) is the one paying all the bills at the moment even though he doesn't work a crazy paying job or anything so I'm infinitely grateful to him but I digress. So basically I became the source of their income once I got my first credit card back in 2018. I even swore to myself and my dad that I would never let them get to it but I let myself and my father down in the end and caved to their manipulation. Since 2018 they have easily stolen over $10,000 from me directly and continue to steal my own unemployment checks to this day. Also a good portion of that 10 grand came from my uncle (moms brother) who passed of cancer when i was quite young, but he put around 2 thousand in all the kids bank accounts and they took that with little remorse. I am afraid to make any money because I don't want to fuel them any more than I have.

Even though I could honestly write a book about everything in the past 4 years involving them but this post is getting long and I know my writing is atrocious so I will end with the reason I am writing this. I am at the end of my rope here. My brother went to jail yesterday and sadly the hospital let him out so I woke up this morning to my mother screaming my name bursting into my room with my brother following after her. According to my mom he ""threw her across the room"" although since she tends to lie quite a lot I have a hard time believing that but at the same time who knows. So she wanted me to kick my brother, who is screaming threats of what he will do to her if she picks up the phone to call the police and turns to me saying ""why are you asking him for help he won't do shit"" clearly egging me on into hitting him. To cut it short I had to follow them around the house and hold my brother back from possibly getting physical with her. My dad was at work so I was also on my own. I have never been in a full on fist fight before and don't want my first one to be with my own drugged out brother. After he calmed down he asked if I really thought he would've hit me which I do think he would have had I given him a reason.

That brings us to now. My brother is high, I think on xanax cuz he's nodding off a lot and my mom is cleaning up all of his messes. My dad gets up for work in about an hour and I don't want him seeing  this shit cuz he already deals with enough. Let me also say that my mother is a pleasure to be around during the day when she's not near my brother or high but at night she's so high its like having to watch a 3 year old to make sure they don't make a mess which sometimes she doesnt go to sleep until 4am. I honestly don't know how much more of this I can take until I do something rash or stupid. The only reason I'm still here is my dog and my dad. I dont see them getting help any time soon, if there was a way to forcefully put them in rehab I would be  blessed but sadly I don't think its legal. They've both been in and out of rehab before with, obviously, no luck. I would move out in an instant if I had the money and I don't wanna just leave my dad behind to deal with both of then on his own. I doubt anyone will really see this but I just need to vent since I don't feel comfortable telling many people about this (hence the burner) but if anyone has gone through something like this or is currently, tell me anything on how I can cope with this because I'm running out of steam here. Thanks for bearing with my writing and wish me luck.

TL;DR mother and brother are heavy addicts and I'm becoming mentally and physically drained because of it. Any suggestions?",27Sep2020,1

86,"I met him online with the NuiT app somewhere at the start of quarantine. We had a beautiful relationship with great communication and we connected in every way possible. We fell so deep in love with each other and never went a day without speaking to each other on FaceTime, texts or an audio call. We talked extensively about getting married, having kids, and living this long life together with me moving to California to be with him in his new place whenever he found one and moved in. At this point, I had never been more happy in my life. I had someone who almost mirrored me in a way. We would spend so much of our time talking about anything, painting/sketching together on FaceTime, singing with each other, everything you can think of for hours on end and never get tired of each other. The dynamic starts changing a few months in with him not texting back as often as he used to and seeming slightly dejected. Two months ago, prior to these current unfortunate events, he had mentioned that he thought he was getting depressed and it was making him physically sick. He was never really the same after that. Weeks later when he wasn‚Äôt responding normally, he claimed the distance was because he was struggling financially due to COVID. Also, because he‚Äôs trans, his well-being was being affected negatively without HRT. He was stressed and told me that his personal life was unfortunately demanding a lot more of his attention at that moment. This was fine, I easily accepted this change. He consistently let me know he loved me and apologized profusely for things disrupting our relationship. It was better for a while as he was more consistent with communicating again. However, he ends up not contacting me for a week after telling me that he would call me that sunday night but I saw that he was active on other things, so this was unusual and not like him at all. After the week was over, he tells me that he was diagnosed with breast cancer at a consultation for his HRT. I was shocked and confused but I decided to be the brave one since he was going through it. I internalized everything and continued to be a supportive girlfriend like I‚Äôve always been to him. Throughout this difficult period, I wanted to understand what he needed and how he needed it. I kept communicating in the same way I always did but he left me in the dark constantly about his situation, which was extremely anxiety inducing. Not only does he have cancer, he‚Äôs affected by the fires. In the second to last message he sent, he finally let me know that he was stressed because of having to evacuate as well as helping his sister evacuate all the way in Oregon. He claimed that he couldn‚Äôt focus on anything except what was in front of him and he didn‚Äôt expect his life to be so hectic. He apologized twice within the message. I understood and I let it go and continued being encouraging and loving, as he told me he liked being comforted like that at the start of our relationship. The final text he sent was a long paragraph of him telling me that he was sorry for being distant. He was weak from his medication, his sister was helping him with the every day things and that he couldn‚Äôt have the phone close to his body because of the radiation in the 5G internet. (He claims this was doctor recommended). I sent him a message after a few days just so whenever he happened to look at his phone, his spirits would be lifted. I wanted to be there for him somehow because I missed him so much and it was seriously depressing me that I couldn‚Äôt be there to help take care of him. After this, I didn‚Äôt hear anything for days. I didn‚Äôt see any engagement with anything of his and something just felt ... off. I can‚Äôt explain it. I texted just to see if he was alright and the messages just didn‚Äôt send at all. They stayed on iMessage (blue) and then were sent through SMS (green) after a few minutes. It was like that for a few days with each message I tried sending and it suddenly clicked with me after sending the message again that I‚Äôve been blocked. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it because I knew in my heart he would never do that to me but I did a quick experiment with my friend just to see what would happen and it confirmed the suspicion I had when the exact same thing happened with our messages. I know he is alive because even though his tweets are locked, the follower/following count has been changing recently. He also is actively using his Spotify account. 

I‚Äôm so angry, hurt and confused. but mainly angry. for the last few weeks, I‚Äôve been here worrying so much about his health and if would I lose the love of my life in such a terrible way that I made myself sick being so anxious and he just blocks me randomly. He has put me through a rollercoaster of emotions for nothing, it seems. It hurts to know that he didn‚Äôt respect me enough to tell me something I did wrong, if he met someone else, changed his mind, etc. Also, I‚Äôll probably never get the closure that I need. I keep looking at my phone hoping he‚Äôll message me and it never comes. I just cry, drink, repeat. I‚Äôm stuck questioning every single thing he‚Äôs ever told me and trying to analyze every message and FaceTime call to see where things changed or what I‚Äôve done to deserve being rejected so coldly as if we weren‚Äôt still planning to have a long life together just three weeks ago. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs true anymore. I‚Äôm starting to think he was lying to me about having cancer as well as everything else in our relationship at this point. I don‚Äôt understand any of this. We never had an argument, a fight, not even one tense moment. We talked everything out rationally and calmly and we happily moved on once we reached a conclusion. So, why was this time different? I genuinely can‚Äôt feel better without having closure and it seems I‚Äôm not getting it anytime soon as I‚Äôm still blocked. I need help to find closure on my own. 

TL;DR - my LDR trans-boyfriend blocked my number randomly two weeks after telling me he had breast cancer. I know he‚Äôs alive because I see him engaging on other sites. Our relationship was great. Never argued or showed hostility towards each other prior. I‚Äôm angry and drunk. I need help.",27Sep2020,1
87,"Context: I was working for a company for 6 months, was let go in April due to the company essentially closing it's doors until further notice. It has reopened as of August, however they do not require everyone back.

I am wanting to e-mail my exboss to let her know that I would be interested  in applying again if the opportunity arose/would also like to ask her for a referral.

During my time there, my dad was sent to the ER a few times + ended up needed surgery, which caused me to be late/call in for work about... 4-5 occasions. I could tell they were unhappy with my performance as I recieved a message from my boss asking if I had problems with comitting to my job during my time there.   


The last company I worked for, I had stellar attendance/was never late, but it's unfortunate that circumstances reflected me badly so early on in this new company. 

I was on good terms with the team/the boss on my last day of work, however I feel like they would be hesistant in having me back due to my performance so early on in my hiring. (Understandable as I would also feel a bit worried in their position from a business point of view)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wanting to e-mail my boss to let her know if there are opportunities arrising in the future, I would hope to apply again and would also like to ask her if I could put her down as a referal as I am still job hunting. 

Would it be wise for me to mention how I felt my performance was not up to standard during my time there due to stress related from my family? (my boss/team were made aware of my situation during that period of time) and if so, how would be an appropriate way to word it?",27Sep2020,1
88,"At least I don‚Äôt think I do, I‚Äôm 15 and I‚Äôve been in a really weird spot for a while. 


Out of all the people in my family I am the most annoying one and it‚Äôs not because I want to be but it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want my parents to get pissed.  have 2 siblings, one is younger and one is older than me but very irresponsible so I have to take charge of most of the things in the house,  I remind them to do chores and other things just so my parents don‚Äôt come and yell at me or them, I just hate them yelling in general. My siblings find me obnoxious and so does my mum because apparently my attitude is really bad which maybe it is but I don‚Äôt know what I can really do about it, I second guess everything and think too much about everything that happens, maybe I am unpleasant to talk but I genuinely don‚Äôt know. 

My parents argue about money a lot and I usually wake up to them yelling at each other whilst in fear of them charging into my room randomly and pointing out something out of order in the room or asking my why I forgot to to something.

A few months ago our kitchen sink got clogged up and coincidentally I was the last one to use it, I was washing my hands and noticed the water wasn‚Äôt draining and as soon as my mum saw that she got really angry and told me to fix it, which I genuinely tried to do but to no avail. I looked up YouTube videos on solutions and tried my best, then my dad came home from work and found out what happened and started beating me as hard as he could for at least 10 fucking minutes, he chased my upstairs as I was rushing to my room in tears. He put all of the blame on me and I had to listen to his lecture while was sobbing unsure of what to say. He put 100% of the blame on me even though it takes time for sinks to clog up so I couldn‚Äôt have single handedly done it but in the moment I was just so scared and couldn‚Äôt think of anything and felt like it was all my fault. I offered to pay for it even though I didn‚Äôt have any money, I offered to fix it but he refused, it almost seemed like he just wanted to lash out on me for whatever reason. A few weeks after the incident my dad acknowledged that I didn‚Äôt single handedly clog up the sink but never apologised for what happened that night, he had no resentment. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have some kind of fucking PTSD from that shit. Whenever people raise their hand high when they‚Äôre near my I flinch because I‚Äôm always scared someone‚Äôs gonna hit me like my parents did and still do, and I don‚Äôt think that will ever change I think until I leave my house I‚Äôll always flinch from that.

I have a shit ton of other stories of my unfairly getting beaten up by my parents but I don‚Äôt think I want to share most of them.


My parents are also very manipulative, I was and am still currently being forced to become a doctor because it‚Äôs my mums lifelong dream for one of her children to become doctors and unfortunately I‚Äôm the only child she‚Äôs forcing to become one, my siblings are allowed to do whatever they want with their lives but I‚Äôm the odd one out.",27Sep2020,1

90,"So I was hanging out with my mom and my dad walked into the room. He normally does this so nothing new or anything. So after talking for a bit we get to the topic of drugs.

91,"Hi there. I have a multi faceted request for advice/opinions. But first, some background. I am an adult middle child, and not autistic (that I know of). My younger brother has high functioning autism that was diagnosed really young. Growing up, he would have lots of meltdowns so my parents spent a lot of their energy with him. My mom is kind of a classic ""autism mom"" and spent a long time in our childhoods trying to ""cure"" him in really stupid ways. 

 Then there's my sister. She was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome a while ago, but it was well into adulthood. She has a great job and can pass very well as a neurotypical person (just maybe one that people might interpret as being kind of rude). I think she's very ashamed of the diagnosis and doesn't acknowledge it. I don't think she identifies as being autistic. I don't know if it's every fair of me to call her that (more on that later)

Growing up, my sister was going through a lot and pretty terrible to both my younger brother and myself. To this day, my brother will not sit near her because he's still afraid of her. I've always had to sit between them in movie theater type setups. 

I think my sister was resentful of my brother for using up my parents energy, and resentful of me for my ability to build friendships (not that I even had that many friends) and communicate with others more easily. She would get frustrated and shut down and then get mad. 

Examples of terrible shit she did to me: 

-In group situations she would physically push me away from the group (even if it was my friend) and say things like ""Your face looks so  terrible and you should be embarrassed to be here"", ""Nobody likes you,"" ""You have no personality"" ""Nobody wants you here"" , etc. To try to get me to leave. 

-In high school, I would be afraid to sit near her. Puberty is really hard and I know she was going through a lot, but I don't think she was able to articulate or even recognize it in herself. A lot of her confusion and agression got funneled through me. A lot of times she would say something vague like ""Where is it?"" But when I didn't know what she was asking, she would just get frustrated and repeat the question over and over. Then she would start yelling at me until I cried and ridicule me for crying. (All mixed with the same personal attacks and insults/occasional mildish physical threats)

My sister is very much an adult now (as am I). She knows that there was a barrier with my brother (for similar reasons to the above) but she doesn't know why he's afraid of her. In her eyes, she's just a victim that everyone criticizes unfairly. Despite this, my brother and my sister are slowly starting to rebuild their relationship. 

I think she feels a similar social barrier to me as well and has been making a special effort lately to talk to me. Honestly, it makes me uncomfortable. I feel like my boundaries are being invaded. I can sense that she wants to become close but she doesn't seem to understand what a slow process it will be to do this. Her continued efforts to socialize with me are bringing up a lot of pain from the past and it's been really difficult for me. The thing that makes it difficult is that she doesn't acknowledge that she inflicted any of this pain. 

So anyway, thanks for getting through reading all that. My main questions are: 

1. If my sister doesn't identify as autistic, is it even fair for me to call her autistic? I think the way she treated me was a result of her frustration about social situations/shutting down/not being able to articulate her feelings. I don't know if she realizes that other people process things in a different way than she does.  Maybe I should reframe the way I think about her? Am I even being fair? I don't want to call her something that she isn't. On the other hand,  she was actually diagnosed with Asperger's. So maybe it's a matter-of-fact thing, like saying ""the sky is blue"". Also, denying her autism feels like it's also denying a lot of experiences I have with her that have deeply affected me. The fact that she is potentially autistic shows me that she wasn't treating me maliciously per se, but it was the result of other stuff. Or was it?

2. How do I communicate my reservations to her? My therapist said that I need to talk to her about some of these things but I don't know how, and I don't want her to get mad. I'm kind of afraid to, and I feel like she'll just deny and gaslight me like she usually does. I don't know how to say ""All I ever wanted was to be friends with you. You were a complete nightmare growing up, and you made me hate myself so much because I believed every single thing shitty thing you said to me.  I know that you are trying to be friends now, but it will take a long time. Also, you're getting too close and it's making me uncomfortable."" -- except not angrily and also in a way that she will be able to understand/not get mad at. 

If I'm going to live with my sister (oh by the way I live with her) I need to be able to come to terms with these things. I just don't know how. I think I really just  need to move out, but barring that, any suggestions/experiences/tips that you have would be really nice.",27Sep2020,1

I'm tripped into guilt the last two weeks for not voluntarily checking up on him in return when he told me he and his parents were kinda experiencing similar flu symptoms. He said he was going to get swabbed, but then I never followed up due to the reason I don't really want to get attached to him. I basically am just distancing myself.

96,"So, taking to reddit could be the most stupid thing I could do, but I‚Äôm out of ideas here. Formatting won‚Äôt be good, and this is my first post, written via phone, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this fits on here, if not, I‚Äôm sorry. Anyway, bare with me.

Okay, so.. I‚Äôve had something in my mind change, and I don‚Äôt know what. It was gradual, but quick enough to become noticeable by my few friends within a couple weeks of me feeling different.

For context, I‚Äôve been rather stressed out about one thing or another my entire life, wether it be my siblings, grades, friends, enemies, whatever, and it‚Äôs never gotten to me. I‚Äôve always been able to recover with one entirely efficient method.

As long as we‚Äôve been friends, whenever I‚Äôm upset, I‚Äôve been able to go to my best friend to rant, and they‚Äôve always been really awesome, really caring about it. Still are, that hasn‚Äôt, and likely won‚Äôt change.

I recently moved by surprise, which is a story for a different time, and didn‚Äôt have time to tell my friends at home goodbye, or pack most of my things, which brought me to tears quite a few times, but I got over it.

I also got dumped by the guy I had been dating just weeks later, which went the same. It hurt, but I got over it fast, things like that never got to me.

That being said, the stress with my parents, siblings and school also never got to me too much. I never had meltdowns or anything, I was always able to go to my perfect remedy, who had always been more than willing to help me. 

Well, lately, each of the little things, a sibling making a mess, a parent shouting at me, someone making some petty insult, they all started to *matter* to me more and more, and these things happen a lot, each taking a little chip out of me.

That, I think was either the trigger, or the first symptom to what I‚Äôm going to try to explain later.

I also enjoy reading and writing a lot. It‚Äôs not important exactly, but that‚Äôs what I do for fun. You‚Äôll see why I say sooner or later.

Well, probably two months ago, I woke up one day feeling extremely tired, not physically, but emotionally. On top of that, I felt extremely agitated and bored.

I decided to buy myself a book I had been wanting to read a while, and read the first few pages before for the first time ever, I became annoyed by it. 

Every point where something could have been worded better, or was over explained bugged me, despite me never having been bothered before. 

And, even more surprising to me, I was bored. Reading is my main pass time, and it‚Äôs a book with a good storyline, and yet I couldn‚Äôt get a chapter in without just shutting it and giving up.

‚ÄúOkay, maybe the book isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be‚Äù, I told myself, and I opened an app on my phone I use to read comics, to see updates on a couple of my favorites.

I still had the same sort of sudden disinterest, which didn‚Äôt make sense.

‚ÄúOkay, not in the mood to read. That‚Äôs okay, I should work on my book, anyway.‚Äù I sigh, turning my phone off, grabbing a pencil, and writing the next chapter which I had already planned and discussed with my best friend.

I get a few pages in (I write a lot and fast, and had sat there for a while) before sighing and looking through what was there.

‚ÄúUgh.. this doesn‚Äôt sound good at all..‚Äù I sighed. 

I realized through the next few days that I just.. didn‚Äôt enjoy the things I‚Äôve loved doing since I was seven or eight without failure.

I began feeling constantly empty (and I did search the definition of that term to be sure I used it right. I swear I‚Äôm not a boomer), and kept thinking back to things like my school back home, the friends I lost touch with, and my now ex.

These thoughts were at first curiosity, like ‚ÄúI wonder what so-and-so thinks happened to me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder how *ex name* is doing?‚Äù You know, normal stuff everyone thinks.

It soon grew into missing it all. Wishing I could go back, wishing I could do better, wishing my friends would just message me.

Then sadness and what if?s. 

It feels as I‚Äôm typing this, like a combination of the two, as well as some form of anger. But the moment that I think about it intentionally, it all fades out. It all becomes that emptiness I‚Äôve been stuck with.

The first part, my lack of interest ended only a few days later, but maybe a week after that is when all this started. It came back, and was quickly getting a lot worse.

This is the background I guess. I‚Äôm bad at writing things from a specific person‚Äôs perspective, and I guess that includes my own :P.

Okay, so, why am i telling you guys all of this, and not literally anyone else?

My parents are very strict. In fact, I‚Äôm not allowed to have Reddit at all, even. Which is why I‚Äôm tabbing out each time they enter this room.

I don‚Äôt think they would believe me, and if they did, they would find some way to punish me for it. They always make me regret going to them for help. I-.. I sound stupid. I‚Äôm aware, I swear, but it isn‚Äôt an option..

I think they‚Äôre a large part of my issue, since most of those things that began chipping away were things they did, or let my siblings do.

They are not physically or verbally abusive or anything like that, and they provide me necessities and things like my phone. It isn‚Äôt their fault, especially since they do not know. It‚Äôs just...

They‚Äôre parents. They get on my nerves, like any parents do, but they don‚Äôt care. The moment I try to explain a situation, they get angry with me. 

If I go to them hours later being yelled at to explain what happened (they‚Äôre often far from accurate with their accusations, because they‚Äôre very.. stubborn..) they tell me that they aren‚Äôt willing to discuss it because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trying to rehash drama.‚Äù

My siblings cause most of these issues, my parents are not willing to believe that they‚Äôre able to do wrong, so I‚Äôm blamed, and it frequently becomes them shouting at me while I stand there in absolute silence, chewing a piece of my lip off and clawing at my thumbs with my nails.

And this sort of leads in to why I don‚Äôt ask a professional. My parents laugh at the thought of things like anxiety or depression whenever it‚Äôs someone they don‚Äôt think capable of having opinions or emotions. 

They think things like that, when it‚Äôs people younger than them is simply ‚Äúkids these days‚Äù being extremely dramatic, so the thought that they‚Äôd get somebody professional to have a conversation with me is.. improbable at best.

Google repeats things that could be it, but as everybody knows, google is unreliable for things of the sort.

So, you‚Äôre my best bet, guys. 

In the last week, I‚Äôve been more stressed and on edge, and in the last week, I‚Äôve locked myself in the bathroom thrice to just quietly sit on the floor and sob, all over little things.

I got scolded because my younger brother caused a mess, while I was on the computer doing class, because I didn‚Äôt prevent it, for example. It happens a lot, always has, ever since they were born, and it has never caused more than grit teeth.

And now.. I feel this overwhelming anger every time, as well as the emotion that actually prompts the post at all. Being trapped.

There‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. And the only time I‚Äôve felt happy in the last two months was the few hours s a day I can spend with my best friend, which has even begun to feel less.. enjoyable...

I‚Äôm falling apart, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being pathetic like my parents would tell me, or if I should be concerned like my friends are. I don‚Äôt know what I should feel- but.. nothing at all, anger, rage and frustration isn‚Äôt it... so, Reddit.. what would you guys do? Assuming anyone reads this...

103,"These past months with me being ill, there's this guy that have liked me for years (but I dumped him midway because I had a bf that time) and have been the only one who regularly checks up on me now and how my treatment's been going.

I've quite started to like him because of how he genuinely cares. But I'm scared and may not be ready for a new relationship. I'm tripped into guilt the last two weeks for not voluntarily checking up on him in return when he told me he and his parents were kinda experiencing similar flu symptoms. He said he was going to get swabbed, but then I never followed up due to the reason I don't really want to get attached to him. I basically am just distancing myself. I'm sorry for sounding like an asshole. He talked to me last week and I just sounded cold and didn't bring up any topic or whatsoever. I guess I'm just naive and being a chicken. I'd like to post this to AITA but it seems to be not the right place for advice so I came here. 

I am quite aware I sound like a 5-year old but I hope someone clears the way for me. Thank you!",27Sep2020,1
104,"This is a sort of silly problem but I dont really have that many real life friends anymore since moving schools twice in the past year and not talking too much to my old IRL friends. So my best friends are all online at this point. I have troubles communicating because of the family I grew up with so I never really tried to communicate my problems with my friends. Recently I tried and the biggest one is that I dont feel like I get the same respect I give my friends. They are constantly DMing eachother while in the same call and kind of just giving me a big middle finger when I ask if they want to play for whatever the reason is. The reason could be basically not right now or if X friend is playing (which is a very big one I hear a lot) which kind of makes it seem like I'm just the friend to play with if there isnt anyone else. One of them wont even play if its just me. Also the fact that when a game ends and if someone joined the call I will ask something like ""Hey X you wanna join us?"" even if we have to switch to unranked. I dont get the same thing (besides one friend who I will say is not apart of the problem, love them to bits for all the love I get from them) no matter if its ranked or not. When I tried to communicate at first I only did so with one friend because trying to communicate to several people for something like this is to hard for me and  the problem is only from two of my friends and the other one I dont feel like I can communicate with at all because he is frustrating to talk to about things like this as he always trys to make it seem like he is never wrong, does anything wrong, etc and all I got were half assed answers and feeling worse because I was being a dick about it. The next time I tried I did better but still half assed answers and a lie that really stuck the middle finger to me. The things I had talked about havent changed in the end and is really only getting worse. It's gotten to the point where I started just playing singleplayer games and the few other games I play by myself. I rarely play that many games by myself. I also started just playing with old friends/friend more often but I dont see them as my best friends for the most part and it doesnt feel the same. I love my friends but I feel they dont feel the same about me as I do them.  


Sorry for this being poorly written I'm getting upset writing about it but I really want to know what I should do.",27Sep2020,1
105,"I‚Äôm female, My best friend who‚Äôs a guy or so I thought we used to be so close and we used to chill like almost everyday and talk all day everyday for like 3 years till recently for the past few months from like auguest he‚Äôs been ‚Äúreally busy‚Äù to busy to even chill with me or check up on me. I‚Äôm always the one who messages him first and even then when he replies back he would take hours to reply back and the convo is just diffrent/dry now. 

Which is crazy cuz this guy used to make me so happy and he was always happy around me too. He became like this out of nowhere I tried talking to him and asking him why he‚Äôs moving like this and if everything‚Äôs ok but he gets annoyed when I ask and never gives me a straight answer other than he‚Äôs busy which doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. 

What do you think I should do? Like I feel like I have to forget about him and fall back but it hurts to do that a lot because this guy meant the world to me, I would‚Äôve done anything for him. I used to like him too and he knows that and deep down inside I feel like that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs like this now, like he‚Äôs not busy he prob just doesn‚Äôt wanna see me. 

Honeslty I felt like he really liked me too but I think he‚Äôs scared or af least was scared of how much he liked me that he‚Äôs being distant now is what it seems like. Should I stop talking to him and messaging him? What do you think I should do",27Sep2020,1

107,"     My father has a friend who I'll refer to as R. R is a die hard Trump supporter and born-again Mormon who treats women like slabs of meat and says the 'gays' need to be rounded up into camps.  I have been through hell due to that family from almost fighting R over his stance on lgbt, which I may be apart of, the day after my mother's funeral. To being stalked by their 14 year old daughter when I was 18 and unknowingly having pictures taken of me that she proceeded to hang up around her bed. Which is now a 'joke' with my family. If I were to never see them again, I'd be estatic. 

     My father holds a middle ground with them and swears that R is his best friend while denying that he hold opinions like him. Constantly defending his friendship to R with ""if I needed him to drive an hour at 1 am to help me in an emergency he would"", while R has done that before I don't think it is NEARLY enough to make up for everything else...

     R has my phone number and has been constantly pestering me to join a D&amp;D campaign he wants to DM since he is willingly unemployed and is bored. I have used every excuse possible to avoid the session without outright saying ""No, I can't stand you"". I have had to give in before and attend sessions with my ex stalker to appeas my family.

108,"This is a long story. Ultimately I'm looking for help making a decision because I am stuck in neutral. I'm a 29(M). I've been married for 7 years now. I have a 5 year old daughter. My marriage to my wife was decent she's one of the few people I have trusted in my life, she's essentially my best friend. She's 6 year's my senior. I was pretty successful in my career. Worked my way to a job in the starting 6 figures top 1% salary in my field in the country. Our relationship like I said was decent. We hardly ever fought but I feel we never opened up with one another. I'd consider it a domestic partnership not two people in love moving through life if that makes sense. We lived modestly, but no matter how much I worked or money I made we were never more than a few weeks ahead with money. Then when we added a child to the equation, that few weeks lead turned to paycheck to paycheck. Stress on top of stress. I let her handle the finances. Halfway into our 5th year of marriage I had to start a lot of out of state training for work. We grew extremely distant. The week long trips away really challenged me mentally. (What am I doing? Why am I doing this?) I called her otw back from florida 1 night, a 7 hour drive after I was gone for 2 weeks, and the drive was after I did 8 hours of training that day. I drove straight through. I called and told her, I wasn't feeling myself and I really missed her and needed her. When I got home at around 11 o'clock. Is she at the door greeting me, happy I'm home? There to show me she's here for me? No she's upstairs asleep. So I turn right around and leave. Go sit in a parking lot around the corner and talk to a friend till late in the morning. Go home go to sleep and don't say anything just swallow it pretty much. A few weeks go by after that and I have a couple month gap in training. We have a new girl start at work. My manager introduces us and I am instantly thrown. She's beautiful, bubbly, very inviting and nice. She was seemingly a different color aura then anyone I've ever seen. Walked out with my manager and asked him, ""why would you do this to me?"" He laughed it off. Couple of weeks go by she's assimilated well to our group at work. Occasional lunches in a group, chit chats around the shop, we click very well. She's married with 2 young children with a husband in the military. As the weeks go by me and her start having tension. The flirting ensues. After a good bit of time goes by I have to go out of town again for 2 weeks. At about a week in I text my wife and let her know I'm not doing ok I'm feeling down and I need my mind off of it. It stays on delivered for a few hours. So I decide to text work girl. Instant response. ""Hey"" ""how's it going"" ""work misses you etc"" we end up texting back and forth for hours that night and into the next week I was gone for training. I come back and there is definite sexual tension between us. The flirting goes even harder. Then she pulls back really hard. (Husband is back from out of state training for the military) new years comes around and she's telling everyone she got tickets to a fancy party and paid for him to get an expensive suit and they're going to have a blast. So a week goes by and she starts flirting really hard with me at work. One night after work about 15 minutes after closing, she asks for a ride to her car from the shop. She goes to get in my truck on the driver's side and she's wearing heels and a skirt, ass looks amazing, so I grab it and squeeze. She doesn't react at all, doesn't say anything, i drop her at her car she says good night and I start freaking out. "" Did I read all those signals wrong? I'm gonna lose my job."" The next day when I see her she's all smiles and cracks a joke about the ass grabbing but I took it completely as ""oh I got your ass now"" so I start dodging her at work. About a week goes by and on a half staffed Saturday I'm scheduled to work with her so I call out but I have a big job to finish so I go on a sunday when we're closed. So I'm working by myself in a closed shop with no one for miles and in she walks. Said she had to get caught up on some training so she was going to sit in the break room and study for the peace and quiet. I say ok and go back to work. I have to wash my hands multiple times while I'm working and when I do I have to go in the break room. Every time I pass her she's staring at me giving me the biggest set of fuck me eyes I've ever seen. So after about the third time. I text her"" you need to tell me what you want. I'm getting mixed signals. The flirting the not flirting the hanging out, if you want me to come in that room you have to tell me."" She storms out of the break room and says "" No, we're married, we work together, there's definite tension but we can't"" I say ""ok, then it all has to stop. We can't flirt or talk or do anything"" She says ""ok"" and walks back into the break room. 30 seconds later she texts me ""Yes"" so I walk in there pick her up kiss her, put her against the wall, make out and carry her over to a table lay her on it, and then I stop say fuck I can't do this and walk out and while I'm otw to start back working I'm fighting in my head to just completely leave. I decide to finish my work. She comes out and says ""are you kidding me? I've never had a guy stop once they've started. What's going on? Your dick too small, or you don't know how to fuck?"" So my aries ass says ok picks her up, take her back to the break room and seal the deal twice. We leave and start meeting morning and hook up in the car, we both already did the gym in the morning so we just skipped it and hooked up before work. This goes on for about a month. I am now actively ""fighting"" with my wife at home. I can't tell her what's going on. So she suggests that I go get a hotel for a week just to have some time off. We've been together for 8 years and maybe we just need time apart. That weekend work girl tells me she thinks it's not just sex and she might love me. So the first night I'm there, she's there of course. We hook up she leaves late and I give her a key to come back in the morning. She comes back in the morning and we lay in bed for a bit and she tells me her husband is gonna take the kids to her parents in 2 days and she'll stay with me for the next few days after.  So that night I'm having second thoughts and I tell her we have to end it. I can't do this. We're done. Strictly work only and stop. She calls out the next day and the day after when she comes back I ask how she is and she says ""not great, I passed out crying with my phone open my husband found all the texts and now he knows what's going on. Said he told her "" oh so this is what's been going on, and oh you got dumped haha."" She starts talking to everyone at work like my friends are her friends and I'm trying to keep it quiet before one of us loses our job. So now instead of just ignoring her I have to talk to her to try and keep her quiet. Then my wife gets a message on facebook from a fake account saying that I'm having an affair at work with the person and that she's married and has a family. So now my wife calls me and shows me that and says wtf is going on etc. I tell her there was a little thing with a girl trying at work but I stopped it and now she's pissed ignore it. She says ok and we go on, then my general manager gets an email saying the same and they come ask me and I tell them no there's no truth in it. Work girl swears it's not her. I grill her for hours about how she's lying to me and she breaks down and tells me all these lies she's told to me and to others and it's all kinds of stuff. How she cheated once before when she was really young when her and her husband first started dating with her first love and all kinds of life stuff. I forgive her and admit my feelings for her and we go back to seeing each other. Now I'm living a double life. One at home with my wife and with her. I finally tell my wife what really happened. She freaks out and says she's going to her parents with my daughter a few states a way for a while and leaves. While she's gone she gets a facebook message from someone she went to school with that she didn't really know. Saying that your husband is having an affair and there's something you need to know about the woman. She forwards a number to me I call it and get no answer. They text and say they'll call back. They call me back and they're saying how work girl does this shit all the time. She enjoys breaking up families. That's why they had to move before. There's another woman's husband that won't talk to me because her and her mom are so conniving and dangerous they won't get involved and that she has helped her set guys up in the past but now that she knows I have a child she doesn't want to anymore.  I tell her to get me proof and she agrees. The next day she send me a picture that I trace back to a fake imessage website. Then I get a text from a different number telling me what a piece of shit I am etc. Then multiple texts from different numbers start coming harassing the hell out of me. Acting like they're from friends of work girl and her mom and ""outside"" people that know what I did and aren't happy about it. So the harassing goes on for a while then. My wife starts receiving texts, telling her what a piece of shit she is and degrading her like crazy. So she send me the screenshot and I go off. Leave work drive to her husbands house (she moved out by now because he started ""cutting"" himself in front of the kids)  pull up outside and slam the door loud as hell and stand in the street. So he comes out and I'm about 8 inches taller and probably outweigh him by 75 lbs. I start barking and telling him if he has something to say to me say it. Yadda yadda, he tells me that I'm drunk and he didn't do anything. (I don't drink) I'm looking down at him shaking and I just feel sorry for him. So I tell him what happened. Told him there's no reason to push with me I already hold myself in contempt. I feel like the biggest pos on the planet. He tells me he's not texting. Tells me it's probably her and her crazy ass mom. That's how they are. So he tells me he's going to help me figure out its her. I leave. That night he goes over to her mom's place. Tells her I came over there threatened him and I threatened the kids. She tells him to leave and he flips out and her mom has to ""throw"" him out. The next day at lunch I get a call from the local sheriff's department saying he is accusing me of assault and battery and I was drunk while I was supposed to be at work. I tell the cop I didn't do shit blah blah blah. So the cop tells me if there is 1 more instance of anything. He can get a restraining order which since they're married extends to his wife and kids. I say ok. Now the texts get really really aggressive. At me and my wife. Even texted my mom saying that she can't wait to meet her. They start texting me where my daughter goes to school. Telling me that my wife is cheating on me so I should leave her. A random girl shows up at my wife's job. Tells her all kinds of stuff about work girl. They know so much about everything. So many details I can't keep up with who should know what etc. I don't if i'm being gas lit by her and her mom so I'll leave my wife or if it's my wife or him. This goes on for months cops won't help me nothing. So I change my number my wife changes hers and it only stops for about a week. Then it starts back up. Finally my wife moves out. The texts are still going. Finally I jump in her mom's shit hard and talk to her step dad about what's going on and he tells me he doesn't know if it's her but if it is she's only doing it to help her daughter if she is. I also send a picture of my gun in the glovebox to the texters and tell them I'm about to solve everything. Texting stops. Me and girl start getting more serious. We're both separated. We have a decent couple of months then a few things happen. 1. she lied to me saying he hit her right before she left. 2. There's more lies that she didn't come clean about but still swears it wasn't her texting and she doesn't know who is. We break up for a bit then she comes begging me to come back. I do. Couple of weeks go by and she calls me hysterically crying telling me that her husband died. So he started dating some girl off of tinder and while it was supposed to be his week with his kids. He decides to make her keep them. Goes to a strip club and somehow ends up down the road from the strip club with his car parked on top of him with the girl driving and no one is charged with anything. Work girl is hysterical. I'm essentially pushed out by her friends and family because I'm this ""big ink stain"" on what's going on. A couple days after she tries to go get her stuff from the house and the tinder chick is squatting and legally since she left him she can't go in the house. I'm still in my feelings about her breaking down about him because he's supposed to be this horrible person but now it's like the love of her life died. So she gets them kicked out and I rent a uhaul so we can get her stuff. Her mom gets her friend to help that's also friends with her husband, and invites her first ""love"" whom she cheated with the first time which she says was a huge mistake. We go out drinking after. I have 1 and the friend is trying to tough guy check me about her and keeps trying to buy me drinks to get me drunk and keeps pushing her into alone time with first love. Finally she breaks down drunk and says she wants me. I grab her we leave. They bury him. I watch her kids for her during the service at my house. She tells me she's fine during all this. 2 weeks go by and I'm over at the house and her mom shows me pictures of her laying on his grave crying. So now I'm even more pissed. We get into a fight later and she tells me she didn't tell me that her first love at the bar when he kept pulling her aside was telling her he still loved her and he messed up leaving her. Said she hid it from me because she didn't want me to get mad. She doesn't get it's the hiding shit from me that makes it bad. The changing stories to get what she wants. The manipulation makes me think she was texting. So now they're trying to find dirt on the girl that caused his death and lo and behold there friend that's doing the digging is the same girl that messaged my wife on facebook about that there was something she needed to know about her. They were all friends her the mom and the husband but she wasn't supposed to be on speaking terms with her and the mom. Now all of a sudden everything is hunky dory. The twists and turns keep going. She's lied to me multiple times since. Who she's with and where she's at. I can't trust her at all. I love her. I've never felt so strongly about someone, but I can't trust her. I told her before the husband died I didn't want to be a stepdad because my daughter is my world and my sticking point the entire time was I want a good life for her she comes first. Now with him dead I'm pushed into that role. I don't trust her or her mom and I don't want them around my daughter so I've put walls up everywhere. I am stuck. I don't know what to do. I want to go back with my wife mainly for my daughter's sake. Financially everyone will be better but I'll have to live with the guilt of leaving her up shit's creek and 2 boys fatherless. It's not technically my fault but I feel it is. Someone please enlighten me on if I'm missing something, or if this is my karma of being shitty. I am lost and floundering every day. Help.",27Sep2020,1
109,"Hey all, so I‚Äôm kinda having some girl problems lol allow me to explain. So around the beginning of September this girl adds me on snap and she says I‚Äôm cute and I also find her really attractive (she lives like 10 minutes away from me) so we talk for ab 2 weeks and she tells me how much she likes me and that she loves texting me and that she felt like she was growing ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with me. As a guy who‚Äôs never had a extremely attractive girl talk to him like this I started to feel the same way about her. Then on my birthday (of course) she tells me that she is going through some problems in her life like friendship and schoolwork and all that stuff and she says that she is not ready for a boyfriend and the way she said it I kind of took that she didn‚Äôt really wanna talk much either. But she told me to wait on her. Like wait until she is ready for a bf because she really liked me and said I was the first guy she has really ever liked this much. So with tears in my eyes I told her it‚Äôs fine and she should take as much time as she needs. So like 2 days go by and she sends me a text saying why I don‚Äôt ever talk to her anymore and then I explained how she kind of sounded like she didn‚Äôt wanna talk when she told me that she wasn‚Äôt ready for a bf and all that. And she was like oh no I still want to talk And stuff. So here is where things get confusing to me. I‚Äôm already sad and stuff that she isn‚Äôt ready and said she needs time. So i get kinda get happy when she said she still wants to talk but oh boy was I wrong. After that night she doesn‚Äôt reply back to me for a week and a half. That whole week and a half she was the only thing on my mind and I couldn‚Äôt get her out of my head. That‚Äôs when things got bad for me. So about 2 days ago sent her a longgggggg paragraph pretty much explaing how I feel about her and then she said it was the nicest thing someone‚Äôs ever said to her and that she was crying over it. and she started to text me a little more but there was a catch she would send like to texts to me asking me what I was up to and stuff and we will be like mid conversation over text then boom she leaves me on delivered for the rest of the day and sometimes 2 days. So it‚Äôs almost like she is teasing me in a way lol. She is on my private story on snap and she will view my private story but won‚Äôt open my snap. I‚Äôm just confused how it went from her saying she loved talking to me and how whenever she saw my name pop up she got excited and replied immediately to it‚Äôs almost like she is ignoring me on purpose at this point. I don‚Äôt know how I should feel about this situation I‚Äôm in. Idk if it‚Äôs a sign she is losing interest in me or what. Some advice would be greatly appreciated :)",27Sep2020,1

It‚Äôs hitting me as I lay here that once this is done, I won‚Äôt have that to hold on to. I could find another job, but I love this one so much. I have other things I‚Äôm doing, but they are all remote. I honestly have no friends in real life right now. They are all gone for college. (My university is doing a phased return and I‚Äôm not in the same group as everyone else). My question that I need advice on is, where do I go from here?

122,"So i'm a young adult (22) and I've been going to school for Mechanical Engineering for 3 years at my community college with plans to transfer to a university after. I currently have this semester and one more before I have my associates in engineering (Took me extra time due to having to take remedial math, and failing Calc 1). So that is 4 years of just community college, and i'm expecting another 3 years of university realistically because I'm a busy guy and can't take 5 classes a semester. I have come to terms with ""school is not a race, and you'll finish in your own time"" but i have a couple big things in the way.

Biggest thing is that i'm working on a project with the Government that me and some other students developed while in undergrad school. It has a very big likelihood of being successful and its been about 1.5 years since it started. So i have been balancing that with school already. Now its REALLY starting to kick off, and I'll be traveling a lot and basically be working a second job, along with school. That leads to the next thing.

I have just been offered a job at my dream university as a staff member for a specific aspect of the Engineering program that heavily relates to what I want to do for my career. The position will give me a 75% reduction in my tuition due to being staff. So next year, after community college, I will transfer to that school. I can graduate basically debt free, and I already have a lot of experience under my belt. Biggest issue I have right now is how much stress this is causing me.

I don't know how people can handle working full time and school full time and be successful. I'm really maxed out on the hours I have per day already with school (taking 3 courses - Calc 3, Intro to Electrical Engineering, and Dynamics) and my project. Now I have a new job coming up that's going to be an additional 20-30 hours a week and I'm afraid its all going to come crumbling down on me. 

My thought is that I could delay school for the semester, and possibly the next. So 8 years for a bachelors, but I'll have no debt, a lot of experience, and a high likelihood of having a successful project that can benefit a lot of people. 

Is it worth it, or do I need to wake up and become a full adult and push through life no matter how hard it is? I can see the benefit of developing my work ethic, but I'm worried its going to break me.",27Sep2020,2
123,"It's been nearly a year and I'm still wounded.
I feel like my heart has a hole in it.
I don't get any emotional support from anybody currently.
I have two sisters but they don't seem to care enough.
I have been trying to find online friends for a long, long time.
I just need a kind, warm and considerate friend who sincerely cares deeply about me and has enough time for me. I don't know why that's too much to ask.
I don't why I should keep suffering alone like that.
I mainly spend my time listening to podcasts and playing video games to keep my mind off of thinking about how horrible my life is without my father and how dark my future looks, but it isn't enough.
He died so suddenly. At least my mom had been ill for a few months before she died, we were kind of prepared.
I need people, I need love, but nobody is there for me.
I don't know what to do.
Loneliness will be the death of me. 
It is devouring me.

126,"My mom (48f) is very difficult to deal with. She was born in Ecuador without being taught simple self care and morals. Her mom worked in America so she could save money to bring my mom and her brother to America as well, so this meant that my mom grew up with no mom or dad. My mom stopped going to school when she was still in elementary and then came to the US when she was 13.

My mom never bothered to learn English or go back to school. Everything she knows now was only learned through my dad or friends she made. She is very ignorant and stubborn.

Today while I was eating dinner with her, my phone alarm went off and played the ringtone named silk(iPhone) and she said that it sounded Chinese. This is not the first time she‚Äôs said things about Chinese people. She thinks that all Asians are Chinese. Her and my dad both say things like Ching Chong. I called her out and asked why she assumes any sound of harp is Chinese. She just kept telling me it‚Äôs Chinese music. I then asked her why she‚Äôs always calling Chinese people disgusting because of what they eat and acts like thinking about Chinese people gives her goosebumps, just because of things she sees on Facebook. She sees when some Asian people consume live octopus or eat dogs, bats, etc. But she doesn‚Äôt understand that not all of them do that!

I told her that not everyone does that and that she only thinks that because she‚Äôs seen it in videos and then says ‚Äúwell then what are they?‚Äù She has very poor English and I just kept trying to tell her that they‚Äôre human and that racism is not okay. She starts shaking her head and facepalming in disagreement as if I was wrong.

My dad never likes to hear us argue so he was just swaying side to side with his eyes closed and tongue out like a five year old acting like he couldn‚Äôt hear us. 

I told her that saying Ching Chong is horrible and she starts laughing and she does the slant-eye racist gesture. That was my breaking point. She clearly doesn‚Äôt understand how wrong she is, but I cannot get through to her! She never listens to what I say, and she has spent her whole life thinking that she is right. She is very uneducated and even when doctors tell her things she‚Äôs thinks they are wrong. 

Am I just supposed to let her get away with these things? She‚Äôs like a child trapped in an adult body. I‚Äôm so tired of it. It gets me really angry.",27Sep2020,1

Hi guys! If anyone can give me some tips about how to better my time would be great. So my school is already know for its academic rigor and is already staring to swamp me with work only two weeks in. I also have a part time job and within a week sport practices are going to go from a bi weekly 1 hour practice to a daily two hour practice. I‚Äôm already kind of freaking out about how I‚Äôm going to better my time and compromise with both my job and sports. I‚Äôm already taking steps however. 
Some things I‚Äôm doing are:
-using a planner and updating it religiously 
-getting a head start on any school work I have 
-communicating with my coach and my boss about my situation as well as my teachers 
-keeping my area and work organized(mostly)

I still feel like I can be doing more though to make my life less stressful. If anyone has any suggestions or advice that‚Äôd be great. Thanks!",27Sep2020,1

131,"15 year old female here. I've found myself as quite the emotional person for a long time, probably since the beginning of school. When I say emotional, I don't mean constant mood swings or that I easily get angry at people or whatever, but just whenever I make one small mistake I feel like absolute trash.

Like, for example, if I talk in class and the teacher calls me out on it, I just feel like I've disappointed them, and I feel trash. I'll also never do it again because I don't want them to be further disappointed. Or if a friend insults me in a way they seem ashamed, even if it's something that should bother me for 5 minutes I just keep feeling terrible about it. 

I don't really like to show my sadness in cases like these because I know it's ridiculous to feel this way. I'm feeling sorry for myself, I'm making too much out of nothing. I just start to think ‚Äùim a terrible person‚Äù and ‚Äùi should just die‚Äù even though I'm not suicidal (if it helps, I was 4 years ago), and just be antisocial and listen to sad songs until I feel better. I don't try to make it obvious that I'm leaving calls, DMs or whatever because of how I feel, because again, I'm aware I'm being too emotional.

Now this is partially irrelevant, but when I feel really terrible, my left hand really starts to hurt. I've tried to tell my parents about this but they think I'm lying or whatever. I don't know why it happens, but if it helps, 9 years ago I broke two bones in my left arm...? Idk, I just don't know why I feel pain there when I'm extremely upset.

I'm currently a senior in high school and I've managed to maintain a 4.5 GPA and do all the try-hard stuff for college applications (AP Classes, good test scores, extracurriculars etc). But one thing I haven't managed to overcome is my absolute fear of essays.

Essays terrify me more than I can say. I should specify I mean research papers more than any other kind of essay. **The idea of writing hundreds/thousands of words about a topic, having all the freedom to do it how I want, and knowing it will be subject to scrutiny.. terrifies me.** I have procrastinated to an extent I didn't know was possible. We had 8 months to write a big essay for the IB program and I wrote (and researched!) mine in a total of 10 days. It was so fucking stressful and at one point I vomited in the shower from anxiety. It's terrible and I have so much anxiety surrounding essays. I have one I'm currently procrastinating on, and every time I open the document, my stomach gets upset (I'm an anxious person, and certain levels of anxiety cause me to have to poop/vomit). 

I used to spend hours and hours on simple 2-page book analyses. Oh how I wish I were doing those right now. I managed to overcome my fear of doing these book reports after 3 years of doing them, which is something I'm proud of! But unfortunately I'm still new to research papers and they still terrify me. 

It's gotten to the point where I just *think* about the essay constantly. There are days when I'm working at my job, and the entire time I'm just distracted and thinking about this essay I have to do, and it upsets my stomach and makes me feel shaky. And then I come home and panic as I open the sources. Seeing all that information completely overwhelms me to the point where I've cried over it. I feel a ""block"" form in my head that literally prevents me from thinking properly. I know it comes with anxiety, because I never feel this block when I'm not anxious. 

As a result I do poorly. For the first time in my life I'm having trouble submitting things on time. This essay was due weeks ago and I'm still working on it. I know this is a terrible habit for college and I just want to know, has anyone else been through this? Have you overcome it? Thank you if you've gotten this far.",27Sep2020,1

As a child I was very......definitely.......painfully.....(insert every other adjective here).....shy.  Insecurity and self consciousness ruled my world.  All I knew was to get a job, get married, have kids, retire, and die.  Not once did I ask if these could be rearranged or edited.  Anyway, I have always been a hard worker (woohoo!) and by I guess a sheer accident I ended up dating this girl I liked in spite of my extreme shyness.  She saw my good qualities and we ended up getting married after a few years.....somehow.  I mentioned I was insecure and shy right?  Well we had a child about a year later.  Now ask any couple what happens after a year and they‚Äôll tell you reality sets in in one way or another.  In my case she turned out to be a completely different person heading in a completely different direction.  Let‚Äôs just say there were some significant ethical differences between us.  Anyway back to the story.  We divorced and now I‚Äôm happier than ever.  I know who I am, what I stand for, and I receive great satisfaction from every other area of life.

146,"So a good friend of mine, let's call him Mark, introduced my sister and me to his girlfriend this week, in a group chat on Instagram. I'll refer to her as Abby. (Just to clarify, I do know Mark in real life, but not Abby. I've known him for about three years.)

So she as seemed normal at first, but she started calling us weird nicknames and was just incredibly clingy with our attention. That was annoying, but the first thing that creeped me out was when I asked her how she and Mark met. They've never met in person, but they've been friends for five years, and started dating six months ago. I asked if they clicked as soon as they met, and her exact words were that they ""claimed each other as brother and sister"" when they first met and she referred to him as her ""best baby brother,"" since he's eighteen and she just turned twenty. Which was creepy already, but then she said she hoped they could go back to that brother/sister thing if they ever broke up. After dropping that on us, Abby then wanted to refer to my sister and me as her little sisters, since we're sixteen. (We'd talked for literally ten minutes.) Everything she says is just weird and kind of gross or creepy. She and Mark are incredibly obnoxious in all their conversations, and sometimes it's like my sister and I aren't there at all. 

She makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and I don't know how to get out of this situation. She throws fits if Mark isn't around or if no one talks to her, and she pushed for our phone numbers and insisted we call her, even after I told her calls make me anxious. She's obsessed with marrying Mark and talking about all the sex they'll have when they meet in person, right in front of us. 

Mark would be wildly offended if I tried to back off from Abby somehow, and I don't want to hurt him because he's a genuinely nice person when he's not being weird with his girlfriend, and I still have to see him in person. But he's kind of clingy with my sister and me too, always texting us constantly. And he can be kind of awkward so I don't how to approach the subject of not interacting with his girlfriend with him. We tried just not texting, but Abby and Mark freaked out about it, so it looks like they won't forget about us.

My partner and I (29 f, 28m) moves into a basement suite a year ago. We have had problems with out plumbing from the water backing up into our bathtub, it was a disgusting mess I had to clean up and we had to throw out a lot of towels and get a plumber in twice because our landlord only thew 200 to get it fixed the first time.

For a few couple of months I noticed that our bathroom smells musky, like pee. I keep a really clean toilet so I deep scrubbed the holding tank and put in a blue tab (cleaning tab) to keep it clean.

When I went to pour myself a bath (a week after I put in the tab) I noticed my bath water is the same as my toilet water! Why is that? My tap to my bathtub runs a little yellow before I turn on my shower. Why is this happening? Am I cleaning myself in toilet filth?",27Sep2020,1

165,"I've been thinking about posting and seeing if anyone has gone through something similar and can help me or something. But here it goes

I'm in high school now and I'm in online learning. A few years ago my family moved and I moved to another school. At first I wanted to start off as positive as possible telling myself and my family that the school was ok and great. Well I'm an introvert (extremely) the main reason I'm posting. The first day I met a girl in the same age as me, she was a lot like me, a very nice girl and we had similar interests. We became very close after a while but then she moved. While she was gone I became friends with another girl on the bus, and then we started having classes together, and talked. She has been kind of nice too I guess, but she introduced me to a group of people. I feel like I rely on her too much instead of branching out, so i do try and not get in the way of her and her main friends. I know that may seemed kind of messed up but idk I can't help it, cause I have social anxiety. And everytime I try and insert myself I am reminded that I am not capable of keeping others intertained, so they leave me by myself. Honestly I'm the type to bottle up my feelings until I explode (crying) at the dinner table when my parents poke at the wrong topic. And I hate that. I just feel like a burden to people around me sometimes, like I drag them down to my level of pathetic feelings that didnt even really need a big reaction, but heck I'm only human. Main point I end up by myself a lot. Literally one time someone I was talking to left me alone because their friend showed up to the table. And during classes everyone has their own conversations with friends they have had since elementary school, I try to smile and talk, but then in the end I am alone again. I've tried so hard for the past few years. Oh and that first friend I mentioned came back, I did try and reconnect. But of course I backed off like the idiot I am. I know she was dealing with her own sexuality stuff and I'm sure she was depressed or else she wouldn't have committed s. I couldn't bring myself to go to the funeral. I wasn't even there for her when I was supposed to be. I remember her telling me that she wanted to become a mother one day in the next few years. I hope she did find peace in heaven, and I hope she knows I and others did care for her. 

Fast forward and I'm in digital learning, I'm away from the hell called school. I still have good friends from my old school who do text me. But that second friend i was talking about before, only ever texts me when she needs help with her school work. She is never personal with me. Now that I think back that is all she ever talked about with me was school work. I guess I never made an effort though...  idk. So I basically begged my mom, I've been going to this hellhole for a few years now, please let me go back. And I know she is trying her hardest but when she called, they just gave her the principals email and told her that I can just ""talk it out"" with him and the councilor. Ok, so wouldn't I have already done that already if I wanted. I just want to spend my last bit of time of high school happy with true friends who are there for me. Anyways the only way I can go there is if my mom gives the school proof that we moved to another house zoned for the school. Which is were my nana enters (my mom would basically fake moving there). Oh wait no, since I'm failing my online classes (which is really hard by the way since they load me down with tons of nonsense that I am supposed to some how cram into my little peebrain) I have to go back to school at the end of the nine weeks, juggle my new job I just got... oh yeah i have to go back alone again. The wonderful place where I love to be, stuck in my depression unable to move forward and get myself out of this pit. Of course I would be nervous to learn new hallways at a school I've never been, but at least I would have someone to console me instead of relying on my mom all the time. I can't keep being a burden and a weigh down for her. I just want to move on. Damn I'm too stressed right now, I just want these miserable days to be over with and move on to adulthood already. 

Sorry for making you read all this and if you found it whiny. But I need an outlet so...",27Sep2020,1
166,"Honestly, idk what to do. I hope this all makes sense. I'm on mobile so formatting might be weird.

Just a bit of context: 
-My GF has been at this job for 2 years. 
-Leads/Managers love her. 
-Works her butt off and could've been a Manager herself but another (less experienced) person was put in her place. 
-I've worked there for almost a year with her. 

A newer person, let's call her... Mary... Has been working there for a few months. If you want juicy information about someone at work, Mary will always know. As soon as she came in she put the pedal to the metal and began to race to the top as fast as she could. So fast that our Manager told my GF that ""hey, if you want this position that's coming up, you're going to have some competition from Mary.""

Wtf, right? My GF has WAY more experience than Mary does. Here's the thing, the past 2 months, people have been complaining about my GF with blatant lies. 

First instance was from Mary, who said ""Hey, people think you're taking longer lunch breaks than normal. I mean, I don't care, I'm just letting you know."" 
We got that cleared up with HR real fast cause it was a lie and we log out times to perfection. 

Next instance was a different coworker (let's call her Blue) saying that she ""got scared"" by my GF'S temper when GF complained about the lunch time rumors. This was weird, because the most my GF said to her was that she was pissed, explained the situation, and Blue completely agreed with my GF! When GF apologized to Blue later on, she was crying and the two hugged. All three of us were super cool before all of this. 

Third instance is the most recent: Blue claims that my GF said that Blue was slow and had too much downtime with our job. This is a blatant lie. My GF has never said this. Yet somehow my GF still got in trouble and was in tears the whole way home after work. She was confused and is wondering if maybe she said something that got misinterpreted. (Almost like the feeling of gaslighting?) Our Manager, who happened to be GF's good friend, didn't even seem to believe GF about any of this.

On our way home, we had a thought...
Who is always gossiping about EVERYBODY? 
Mary. 
Who has been aggressively trying to get more power? 
Mary. 
Who has actually tried to undermine people and take credit for things? 
Mary. 

We have a hunch that either A.) Mary is spreading rumors to make GF lool bad and get her fired or take her job. 
Or B.) Blue is spreading the rumors for no reason at all.

We don't know what to do. We don't know if we should wait it out and be on our best behaviour, or maybe if GF should try to talk to Blue and sort things out, or just leave. If anybody has ANY advice they could give, please do. We're so distraught over this. GF is worried that if more rumors come up that she might be fired.",27Sep2020,1
167,"I'm currently interning at an F&amp;B company and one of my job scopes is to plan the weekly schedules for the part-timers the company has hired to help with the kitchen.

As much as I hate to say it, some part-timers are better at their jobs or more willing to put in effort into their jobs than others, and this makes it easier for the kitchen staff to work smoothly. Usually the staff would then feedback to me to give these workers more shifts.

For me, I have been trying to give all the part-timers equal amounts of shifts if I can (subject to their availability since all our part-time employees are students). But I've gotten feedback that putting a less efficient worker on shift always slows down the kitchen immensely and causes jams in fulfilling orders, and that takes a toll on the kitchen staff (who essentially need to work double to compensate as they'll be assisting the part-timer here and there to finish up orders).

So I'm wondering if it would be better to continue scheduling part-timers such that everyone works an equal amount, or schedule it such that the kitchen can work most efficiently (and have the less efficient ones fill the remaining gaps, if any)?

If I were to schedule everyone equally, is there any way to aid the kitchen staff when the less efficient part-timers are working?

And if I were to schedule part-timers based on efficiency, should I be honest with the part-timers who weren't assigned a shift about my reasons for leaving them out?",27Sep2020,1

I still live with my parents, long story short I had some medical issues and was in graduate school so staying home was a good way for me to save money. My boyfriend's current place is nearly unfurnished, he was screwed over by his previous roommates so he didn't have much to bring with him when he moved into where he is now. Aside from browsing furniture stores for sales and Facebook buy and sell pages, I am at a loss on how to furnish our new place without spending too much money so we don't need to be scraping by for rent and our other bills.

170,"Last month my neighbors flew down to disneyland for vacation and offered to pay me $20 a day to house sit and watch after their dog. On the second day it was pretty nice outside , sun shining and everything so I decided to take the dog (black lab) for a walk. I‚Äôm not going to go into great detail because it‚Äôs still bothering me to think about, but I didn‚Äôt have the greatest grip on the dogs leash and it bolted out into the street and got hit by a SUV and died on impact. Ultimately I think I might be to blame for this, the neighbors even told me that it probably wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea to walk him since I have no experience in owning any pets before. Rightfully so, the neighbors are pissed off at me and are refusing to pay me for the house sitting and they threatened to press charges but I don‚Äôt think they will follow through with that. I‚Äôm not upset that they aren‚Äôt paying me, I just think they took it over board when my neighbor, let‚Äôs call him Kevin, got in my face and yelled at me before his wife got him out of my face. She wasn‚Äôt happy either but she was a lot more grounded in reality. In my defense I didn‚Äôt know the dog would bolt like it did so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs 100% my fault, probably like 60% my fault and 40% the owners fault for not teaching it how to walk properly.

176,"My friend has been dating this girl for awhile and we got along at first but we slowly started to dislike each other. She is very self centered and always tries to turn other peoples issues into her own. But because she was dating my friend I kept a decent relationship with her.  


Sometimes she would do things that would genuinely make me hate to be around her, like for example if me and my friend got into a conversation with each other while she is around, she would leave the call (most of the time it was a call because of corona virus). She would then 'cry' to my friend on how were not including her, which generally is a normal thing to be upset about but the problem is that we try to include her every time but she doesn't talk because the topic of the conversation isn't interesting to her. So in other words, if shes not interested in something or get her way, she whines and makes everyone feel bad.  


When I say get her way, I mean it literally. Sometimes when we are hanging out, she will once again leave the call and whine if she doesn't get what she wants, for example; Movie, game, time etc.  


Now enough with the complaining, the real issue is that me and my friend are drifting apart because of it. I really care for the guy and I don't want our friendship to end and I have already told him this but he doesn't seem to understand or want to make a change. Me and his girlfriend argue every time we are around each other now, and I make sure to go into it with the intention of ""Don't say anything stupid, don't start drama and try to be nice"" and most of the time that's the case, but she starts an argument for no reason at all.  


Its gotten to the point where I try to hang out with him alone, and I tried to do this a couple days ago but of course, she got angry. Every time I try to plan something with him alone because I know what will happen, she somehow squirms her way in and if she doesn't, she makes my friend feel bad and we never get to hang out.  


He isn't reaching out to me to try to make plans, and she is always cocky when we argue because she knows that my friend won't do anything about the way she is acting so she always goes overboard on the things she says.  


I know I am not perfect in the situation, but I don't know what to do. Should I take his lack of effort as a hint to stop trying to do things with him? We barely talk as it is and the only time we do, it HAS to be around her. He is very passive when it comes to her because its the first girlfriend he has ever had so he is cautious which I understand. That's why I am asking for advice because I don't know what to do about the situation.

177,"Hello! I need some advice concerning my cat. Hes still a kitten, about 8 to 9 months old. I had asked my roommate to watch over him for the week due to a family emergency (wont go into details here) and I showed her how much to feed him, what to do with his water, and asked her to clean the litterbox at least once every 2 days (preferably every day). She said she was fine with this, and to not worry. 

I came back today to find him overweight by at least 2 to 3 pounds! In less than a week?! I looked around, seeing that she didnt change his water or mess with it at all. She didn't clean the litter boxes ONCE! And to top it all off, I had about 3 to 4 cups worth of treats... all of it was gone! There was only about half an inch of treats in the container. His food bowl was dirty, and she hadn't bothered cleaning it between feedings (I feed wet and dry food mixed) 

I gave my poor baby some water, and he drank for 4 minutes straight! I asked why he looked a bit more... ""Chunky"" and she laughed nervously, stating ""Wellll.... i thought he was too skinny, so i fed him a bit more"" 

She did not ask ONCE to up his diet, or voice concerns before i left... I feel so betrayed by her actions. Idk if I'm overreacting or not, but I dont want her even NEAR him after this. 

(As for some extra details, she once had a german shepherd puppy who she kept in a small crate every day, overfed, and abused by hitting when he did something wrong. I assume she does this with my cat as well, due to his new fear of rounding a corner too fast/if you move your hand too fast towards him. He flinches now... but I cant confirm it) 

What should I do? Should I confront her about this? If so, how?! I dont want to just accuse her of everything and be a bitch about it... but I also dont want her to overfeed him/abuse him behind my back.

178,"So my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday is coming up and I would like to send him a letter and a necklace in a small package. Only problem is that we live in different countries as of right now.

The information on shipping internationally is extremely confusing so if anyone knows how to do it and could tell me, that would be absolutely amazing!

My main questions are:

1. What kind of postage/labels/stickers will I need?
2. How do I pay for shipping it/does postage cover the cost?
3. Where do I go to ship the package/where in that place do I drop it off?
4. Are there restrictions on the items I want to send?

179,"i‚Äôm not sure how to explain this, but it just makes me really sad to remember how close i was with them before quarantine. we had such a close bond. but when school got cancelled bc of covid, i began to drift from them. i noticed that i haven‚Äôt texted any of them for a month or two, and i feel horrible for that. i also noticed that our group chat died months back. 

i‚Äôm not sure if they still talk to each other or feel the same way i do, but it makes me sad to realize how being apart for 6 months kinda made me drift from them. like now when i message them individually to open a conversation, it ends pretty quick because it just ends up being really awkward and we just run out of things to say. what should i do? is this my fault? is this another ‚Äúfriends come and go‚Äù situation?

181,"I am a primary school teacher. My school has 2 positions open for next year. I had my interview yesterday, I thought it went okay. My principal called me up about 15 minutes ago to tell me that my application was unsuccessful. I was hoping to stay on. They were advertising 2 different positions and I was passed on both. However because of the high needs of the students (rough area) they want experienced teachers and not a first year like myself.  I like to think I'm a team player, I start early and work late, I get along with others and have a pretty good relationship with my students.

 I'll admit this is a blow , I'm very upset and to make things worse I actually live in the school house so technically, I'm being evicted too and my partner is studying so we rely strongly on my income. I'm crushed and feel the burden of life on my shoulders.

186,"My 6yo already has her ears pierced but wants her ears pierced again. Her mother has many ear piercings and she wants the same.

My wife has been discussing this with me and suggested that for her upcoming 7th birthday she can get her 2nd holes done and if she handles it o.k she would consider allowing a 3rd set. She also said that in the future if our daughter wants any additional ear piercing she would take her each year on her birthday.

Personally I was against this idea. My reasons are as follows:

1. I feel our daughter is too young for multiple piercings and too look after them.
2. She is too young to decide and may change her mind later. If she does change her mind she will be left with several markings on her ears.
3. Her ears are still growing and the holes may grow apart.

I have expressed my concerns with my wife. She believes I am being unreasonable and even called me hypocritical given I did not express concern when she got her first holes pierced. In my opinion a single hole in each ear is different to 3 or more in each ear.

Any advice on how I should deal with this situation would be appreciated.",27Sep2020,1

189,"recently a lot of not so good shit has been happening to me. although everything sucks a lot right now, i wouldn‚Äôt say anything that‚Äôs happened to me recently has been traumatizing.  However, I keep having these really weird zone-out type things happening. I found online something that matched my symptoms, but said that it was a symptom of PTSD or overwhelming stress. I do not have PTSD, and I wouldn‚Äôt say my stress level is crazy right now. Really, I‚Äôm just sad all the time and that‚Äôs it. These zone outs are extremely scary, and they feel unreal. I feel my heart drop and my stomach turn upside down, very dizzy and blurred/dizzy vision. I also feel like I am not me, have temporary (pretty short) amnesia, and overall just depersonalization. After these episodes happen I feel really off and sick afterwards, including complete appetite loss and an inability to do really anything but sit there with a blank mind.

These zone-outs have happened before when i have been really upset as well (death of my grandma, death of my friend,  when my father went to prison, etc.) However, nothing recently had been so bad to the extent of those that I have listed. My boyfriend and I broke up recently due to him not caring and falling out of love with me, and this hit me particularly hard. In the meanwhile a lot of other people have expressed that I am not good enough so the feeling of not being good enough has kind of been piled onto me all at once. My mother told me she wish she never had kids, and right now I feel like I have lost my best friend and boyfriend, and that I am unloveable. Despite all these feelings, I don‚Äôt really think this is enough to cause the zone outs. Previously I thought it was an effect of me not taking my iron pills for my iron deficiency, but I have been on them and the episodes have happened 3 times today alone.

I am so, so, desperate to make them stop it is truly a horrifying experience everytime and I can not do anything during the day as they are prohibiting me from working. Is there any advice that could possibly help me prevent these, or tips on what to do when i‚Äôm in them? 

SIDE NOTES:
I have NOT been diagnosed with depression or anxiety 

I do NOT have PTSD

I have never been to a therapist

194,"Hello dear readers, today I wanted to tell you my most recent love story and at the same time ask for your advice on what I should do.

I have known a girl for several years (we are both 18) and it turns out that I had never liked her at all, I spoke to her from time to time and everything remained in a distant friendship, everything changed since last year, when we started to write to us more often, and little by little I became more sympathetic, and before I knew it, it turned out that I liked her, her way of being, her look, I loved everything about her, I felt like a blind man for not having seen before, but it turns out, that I became like her best friend, and she liked another boy, who was a distant friend of mine, but anyway, he was my friend, so as I always do, I put aside my personal happiness and I decided to help her to conquer him, just to see her happy; After a few months of the relationship between my distant friend and her, the boy left her for another, and again she returned to me as his comforting pillow. It turns out that he has surpassed that boy, and after some time planning, I was about to ask him to start dating, but I just discovered that now he likes my best friend from childhood, in fact, he has liked him for a long time, and of course , has started trying to flirt with him, of course she has not told me anything about that, I suppose because she knows that he is my best friend and she feels sorry, apart from that she does not know that I like, well, it turns out that my best friend He did tell me, but he didn't know I liked it either, since he hadn't seen it necessary to tell him, since he's flirting with more than 4 girls, and he's not interested, or at least he didn't seem like it, my friend He is very indecisive, and he was even, or rather, he is flirting with the girl who was my first childhood love, I told him it was fine, because I had already overcome it, but now this touches my morals a bit, I feel that after so many years helping my friends with their love affairs, losing opportunities to never go out with one of his exes, with a girl they liked, or even giving mine to see them happy, I feel as if in some satirical way, the world made fun of me, I know, I did all that was to see them happy, not to receive a reward, but now, I feel that I cannot continue with the friendship with the girl that I like, I doubt very much to tell something to my ""best friend"" again and I begin to question if being an honest and moralistic person is of any use to me In a world where those things seem to matter to the rest, this is probably just another story from the lot, and yes, for my age I still have a long time to meet more girls, but being so introverted, correct and ugly, I doubt I have any in a future, even more, I doubt I can trust someone again, I am not depressed, nor angry, I just feel empty, maybe because I have realized, that I may not have a true best friend, that I will always seek the happiness of others before mine, because it is what It makes me happy, but at the same time, it is what hurts me the most, sometimes, I just feel that in my dreams, it is where I can be happy, maybe that's why I write fantasy books, because that way, I can dream while awake.

Sorry if I have gone around the bush, I just want to know how to not look like a jerk, like an idiot without feelings, it is that I simply feel that I will not be able to trust my friend again, if I continue with friendship, I know that , because despite everything, he is the only one who, even in bad times, has supported me, I do not blame him for what his heart feels, I blame myself for what mine feels, but the simple fact of continuing to be the The girl's best friend, makes me feel bad, I don't want to break her soul, nor do I want to look like a spoiled person who leaves when he sees that he will not get anything, I just want to find a way for everyone to be happy, without having to put my happiness aside .

Thank you for taking the time to read my story, I hope things turn out well for you in life, and that you can know that beautiful feeling, which is called happiness.    :)",27Sep2020,1

197,"Hi,

This might be a little long. So, I have this chinese friend that I met during my internship. Today was his last today. After work, he ended up telling me the story/dreams/struggles and it was super painful to hear. So basically, his dad died when he was 12 (he lied to me abt this when i would ask him abt his dad, is vs was), his mom only makes 700 usd in china, goes to ucla paying 60-70k a year. most of his friends at ucla are international chinese students with very wealthy parents, and it sounds like they only come to the us to have some fun. on the other hand, his mom sold some of their property (his dad had bought some property before he died, his dad also wanted their family to immigrate) for him to attend ucla to pursue a better life in the us. but after going to school here, he really wants to pursue immigration for the american/canadian dream (he wants to pay back the money his mom used for education, be successful, etc), but been pretty hard for him to find a full-time job. so his back-up plan is to pursue grad school in canada. he told me a lot about how he was feeling, how he feels guilty for not succeeding, how he wishes he just gone to canada in the first place. he also told me that his mom says its ok if u don't manage to find (super understanding person), and how his mom being understanding contributes to his guilt (if his mom had forced him, it would've alleviated some of his guilt). he told me how he was jealous of me and how we get live normal lives and how a north american salary is unimaginable to most chinese people. he told me how he feels like he doesnt belong here and how he wants to pursue his hobbies (he loves languages, self-taught himself english). it was just so hard to listen, and i really couldn't say anything. its not like i understand. my parents probs can, but i can't. i want to help him, but im pretty useless. so i was wondering if anyone could give me any advice or help him finding a job post-grad. he's a data science major and really cool/brilliant guy.

But I've got a slight problem, we met online, and in the entire time we've talked I've never had the chance to meet her, see a picture of her, even voice call her.

208,"  

Hey Everyone,

I'm about half way through my Grad School program. I initially started to formalize skills I had taught myself through hobbies and personal projects so that I could eventually get into a specific industry. Since beginning that journey, I landed a great job in the industry I set out to and now I'm wondering why I'm still doing it. Specifically because it demands so much of my off work time. For the first time ever I've found that I haven't been able to give my best to any aspect of my life in the last few weeks.

By this I mean being a father, employee, student, and improving my fitness and health. I don't want to do less of any others, but feeling like I have no choice but to throttle back/eliminate one for my life's sake, it would have to be school. The only benefit I hear these days for Grad school is to either make more money or promote up. I make enough now to where not only has covid not affected me financially, but i'm thriving. I also prefer to be an expert in my craft, essentially a great worker bee, rather than move up to management. I'm not averse to leading, and do enjoy it when I've had to in the past, but at most would only ever want to do it in small teams working ""in the field"" so to speak.

He asked why I didn‚Äôt tell him and I did say that there was some stuff about me feeling a little like he didn‚Äôt care when I was upset sometimes getting to me and not making me feel like I could trust him with my feelings. He talked a lot about me abandoning him and our dog.

but it started getting worse, i started feeling unreal. not only me but everything around me. That life wasn‚Äôt real, every second i felt like i was in a dream. nothing was real, it all felt hazy. I would have moments where i thought i wasn‚Äôt even in my body, then i would think i was dead a lot. I lost touch with reality, everything felt off like i said, it was like a dream i feel like i‚Äôm in a dream. i wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell if something actually happened or not. (i still feel like this)

july i stated to have ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù.  I was feeling very sad about my dad dying, (he died when i was 7) it felt like it just hit me. But i would have moments where he was there, i could see him and hear him. 

i knew when grieving that could happen, so i didn‚Äôt think of it that much.

but it started progressing, i stopped having a lot about my dad, but i stated hallucinating new things.

like family and friends and anyone. They always corresponded to what was on my mind. 

for example, I saw my moms ex bf driving in their car while i was on a walk. i thought about him since i hadn‚Äôt seen him in so long. then the next day i hallucinated that he was at my house when i woke up and he told me he was back together with my mom. i went in another walk (in quarantine i went in many walks or bike rides) When i came back i asked my mom where he went, and my mom was super confused and said that she hasn‚Äôt even talked to him in a year. 

that‚Äôs just one random example. Then in august i met haru. i was in school and walked up to me and we started talking like we had known each other forever. it was very foggy. Then we would speak together everyday a lot. when  i couldn‚Äôt  see him i could hear him, sometimes i will just talk to him in my head. 

At first when i met him i was very confused, but i understood it wasn‚Äôt real when no one else saw him. it made sense since when i did see him it was just super ‚Äúfoggy‚Äù extra dream like. 

When i met him is when i stated feeling very lonely, which i think explains why he showed up. i don‚Äôt really have any one. i would say he is my most best friend. which sound weird since i guess he not really there but it feels like he is.

Some hallucinations got traumatic. 

like i said my hallucinations go with what happening atm. 

another example; my older cousin ‚Äúz‚Äù basically raised me when my mom wasn‚Äôt there, she was the closest person i had. but then i moved back in with my mom, and stopped seeing her. i grew to miss her a lot, i hadn‚Äôt seen her in a while. I felt like she was the only person i had at the time. 

i got to see her and spend the night with her, but it felt all off. that connection and love was gone. i felt like she was another person even though she didn‚Äôt change. like that z i knew was dead.

then i got home i hallucinated that she was bloody dying in my arms asking me to sing her the song we use to sing together.

i knew it wasn‚Äôt real but it really shook me up.

i couldn‚Äôt get that image out of my head. 

They can make me feel very sad.

but i feel like if i told someone they would think i‚Äôm crazy, or if i told an adult they would make me do or go to place i don‚Äôt want to. like my life would change for worse. 

What is this? What is happening, and what should i do?

224,"I'm a successful young woman, I know that, but I'm having a silly problem with self-esteem at the moment and want some reassurance and advice on how to be more present.

Here it goes:

I'm 21 years old. My first boyfriend and I dated for three months and had sex in that time. Seven months later, I connected with my second boyfriend who I was with for six months and with whom I also had sex. For the seven months in between, I dabbled in the dating world and although I didn't have 'sex', without going into detail, I was taken advantage of by two dates and had a few coercive sexual experiences.

I'm very happy being single now. I'm pretty resilient and have a 'press on' mentality but I know that this is healthy for me. Perhaps it is my young naivety, but I had a little feeling inside that my second boyfriend was 'the one' although as we grew closer, he dumped me for my 'past.'

I had worked through difficult and messy moments with my past and I understand that in the scheme of things it was a short time for those experiences to happen. Now though, I view those experiences as a means to learn to become a stronger, more assertive young woman.

I have a full and rich life. I graduated high school in the top 1% of my country, I work two jobs while at university studying to be a teacher, I have plenty of money saved and will be ready to buy a house when I graduate. I can't wait to travel, maybe get a Masters degree someday. In other words, I know I don't need 'a man' to be happy - I'm quite accomplished and comfortable as I am.

But I would like to have a family one day. The only problem is that I'm terrified now that when I do, in a llllloooooonnnngggg time connect with someone special, that I'm tarnished and 'undatable' because of my sexual history.",27Sep2020,1

226,"Okay, so I'm a caucasian female who's 18. I work at a trampoline park as a referee. My job consists of kicking out people when their jump time is up. 

One shift, there was these 3 little girls who's jump time was up. The whole staff kept telling them that they had to go and they wouldn't listen. So I finally asked them to take me to there parents so I could inform them. 

They were part of a large party and I met a lady who I believe was there mom. I tell the lady that their jump time was up and that they can't jump anymore. While I was informing her, one of the little girls grabs my whistle and puts it in her mouth. I was shocked so I pulled it out of her mouth. 

After this the lady goes, ""You know you don't have to do that."" And I was confused and said, ""Your kid just put my whistle in her mouth."" She then responds, ""She did not even put her lips on you whistle."" Then I respond, ""let me go get a manger."" And then she threateneds me and said, ""Yeah go get a manger before I whoop your a**."" 

I told my manager and she told me to wait in the office until the party leaves. The lady goes up to my manger and tells her that I pushed her kid and that I was racist towards her. My manger told her that she was lying. The lady starts yelling. ""Where is she? Have her come out? She's lying!""

Two of my coworkers come in the office and told me, ""You need to leave right now."" So then they escorted me out to my car and I went home. The lady ended up threatening a bunch of the staff and even the police. 

I feel unsafe at my job. Since then there was one other instance where I got called racist for kicking someone out. Most of our customers and staff are African American and I try my best not to discriminate. 

When these things are said to me I feel like I'm caught off guard. I'm wondering if you guys have any advice of how too handle these types of situations? Also I'm unsure if I should quit my job. I'm not sure if it's a safe environment for me if I'm going to get treated this way. 

I need advice!! Thanks!! :))",27Sep2020,1

228," Hi to whoever is reading this. I'm glad that you are the ""someone"" who is going to be giving some advice which I can use to support my girlfriend.  I'm a 16-year-old male who lives in Japan (so sorry If my sentences are incorrect).

  I recently got into a relationship with my classmate. Her parents divorced when she was in middle school.  I don't know the full reason but one of the reasons was the cost of the spent to go to the Hula competition in Hawaii. She was selected as the Japanese representative of every year. The father isn't really supportive about the whole ""Hula dance"" thing. On the other hand, is really supportive because her ancestors and etc (To be honest I think it's just for her ego).  But the flight money and other cost expenses are from the money which her mother hard-worked hard for. The mother wanted financial support from the father but the father didn't approve then the fighting happened...

 She recently was living with her mother but moved to her father's about 3 months ago. Apparently, she had a fight with her mother and decided to go to live with her father. Her father had already remarried. From what I heard her stepmother is really nice so that was great news and her father became protective. 

 Her ""original"" mother has been contacting her recently saying she was ""sorry"" and that she ""needs"" her. My girlfriend uses gifs and stamps to reply because she doesn't know what to do. She feels guilty that she isn't communicating with her mother properly since she had raised her and did a lot of financial support. 

 Her ex-boyfriend has been also contacting her recently. He's the repetitive kind. Block him, get's a new account saying ""Oh sorry, I must've have blocked you by accident."" (I'm not sure if she's still getting contact from him but I think It's affecting her mental health) The hole goes deep. Her ex-boyfriend was her &gt;!science teacher in middle school. I cant 't blame her. I think she was trying to mental support but honestly, that may have crossed the line. Her teacher kissed her and may have touched her. When I heard that I was honestly scared, I was scared that when I kissed her I hurt her. !&lt;

 From the few paragraphs above I think you may understand why she can't trust adults. So she doesn't go to a school therapist. I managed her to make her go to our school therapist and now her father is trying to make her go to a psychiatrist. I asked her what kind of mental illness she has but she hasn't told me. She denies it. She said she's ok but I know she's not. When we call each other and tell her how much I love her before going to bed she starts crying. 

 So the question is

How can I help her, not fix her ""help"" her",27Sep2020,1
229,"The website of the place I most desired to work mentions that ‚Äúonly 5% of applicants get the internship‚Äù, which I thought was only to encourage the competitive nature of the interview process. 

I had an interview this week and the next day was offered the position. In the paperwork they sent me to review it said ‚Äú7% of applicant get the position‚Äù. A minor inconsistency that wouldn‚Äôt mean anything if it weren‚Äôt for the other sketchy aspects I have uncovered. (Now I think it is a way to pressure you to take the job) 

There is a $500 fundraising REQUIREMENT for the position. On some reviews people mention that without raising the $500 in full, they will mark your internship as ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù and refuse to provide references for future employers. Other have said the fundraising is more work than the actual internship, and that the various titles of internships are a hoax because all the interns do the same thing - cold call for donations, mostly. One person even mentioned that they hire almost everyone who applies. 

I reviewed their tax form 990 to see where these donations go, and didn‚Äôt find anything specific. But I did discover that the director makes over 100,000. In an interview for a newspaper he brags about working a night shift and only accepting a salary to ‚Äúsupport himself and his dream of etc.‚Äù 

When I started snooping other websites for reviews on the internship, there were over 10 people who used the word ‚Äúpyramid scheme‚Äù and said they should be shut down, although they have been operating since 2003. Many people say that the interns are hired to do their ‚Äúdirty work‚Äù and that no one really knows where the $500 goes. 

My moral compass tells me not to work for them. But my logical reasoning wants to make excuses as to how working there would benefit me - even if I don‚Äôt do the fundraising portion of the internship, or if they don‚Äôt provide references. It would look good on my resume and fill my employment gap.

240,"Of the events I could remember, I (F) remembered when I was in elementary school, my older brother (M) who was one grade level above me taught me to hump my blanket in the private part of my body in front and between my legs (where the dick was located in males). I don't know if my brother knew he was sexually abusing me or just told me because he didn't know. He never told me to keep it a secret or anything.

A secret my brother did tell me was about ROMs and emulators. My brother would download a bunch of video games on a laptop where we played together and had fun. However, my brother kept telling me not to anyone else about this because emulators and ROMs were illegal. 

Another instance I could remember was sometime in middle or high school during a state fair where my brother and I were just walking around. My brother once poked me, and I yelled out that was harassment. My brother immediately backed off and never touched me there on that day.

However, one day in my freshman year of high school, my brother (in sophomore year) would chase me running around the school. I made it pretty clear that I didn't want to be chased, but he kept chasing me and grabbing me. It eventually stopped when we got tired. I didn't know if my brother was being abusive there or didn't know what he was doing.

The final memory I could remember was in my sophomore year of high school. One day, I didn't feel like going to school and just stayed in my bed. My parents kept knocking on my door to come out, but I didn't want to go to school. My parents then told my brother to try to talk to me to go to school. However, he was angry that I was making him late since my parents couldn't drive us until I got out of bed. The worst action came when my brother literally kicked down the door of my room, and I immediately ran to my bathroom. I wanted to tell my teachers about this incident, but my parents refused to let me do so. 

One thing I had to confess that I did harm my brother is that during elementary school, whenever I got angry, I would occasionally go to his room and wreck some of the things he owned. I regret doing that and know it is wrong, and I always wondered if that was a trigger for the actions he did against me.

I felt like I was abused by my brother. I still live with him, so I don't know what to do at this point. He never did anything against me for the past year so far, but his past actions still exist.",27Sep2020,1
241,"We‚Äôve known for 5 years. We‚Äôre really close with each other - in the summer we met almost every day doing all fun activities and she‚Äôs the only person I can open up to and have deep conversations with.

After summer, studies and work started. She‚Äôs busier than I am, works on the weekends but not like 24/7.

We hung out a few weeks ago as I asked her we should grab a drink somewhere or something. She works in a mall near the city, but it‚Äôs still 13 miles from the city centre and it‚Äôs pretty much a land and forest. She said I could come there to see her closing down the shop at 8pm and after that we could buy something to eat and just chill. 

I was like okay, maybe she‚Äôs tired so I don‚Äôt mind meeting her at her workplace. 

But then later, she asked me (this was everything over text) if I could drive her also home after everything (that‚Äôs another 4 miles to the opposite direction to where I live). I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing that, but I told her that it‚Äôs not my car and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll get it at all for that day, she basically said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs just 10 miles back and forth it‚Äôs not that bad and you like driving, can you just ask the car owner if you‚Äôll get it‚Äù 

I was like ü•∂ well I‚Äôm not your taxi but that was one red flag.

We met and everything was alright; was fun. We hanged out at the mall and then drove to one place close to her house.

AND NOW, I was asking her if she wanted to meet again on the weekend cause over here it‚Äôs the last warm and sunny days, we should do something fun as we always did.

She told me: ‚Äúwell if you want you can come to my workplace at 3 pm and we can get ice cream here‚Äù

I was like wtf? First of all I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúif you want‚Äù - don‚Äôt you wanna meet? Secondly, it‚Äôs 3 pm, you can go home and rest and we can meet in the city at 7pm and meet normally in a nice place as we always did. Not some mall that‚Äôs convenient for you.

And I bet she would‚Äôve also asked me again to drive her home.

So yeah that‚Äôs that. I just don‚Äôt know how to react but don‚Äôt people see how arrogant that behavior looks? How she‚Äôs trying to make everything convenient for HER?

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I just let her know I‚Äôm not interested in hanging out near her workplace every time &amp; I pointed out that earlier she mentioned she likes to be in the city more too. She just said she wants to have ‚Äúa chill time‚Äù. Wtf? At some mall?

242,"This might be a stupid question, but I‚Äôm not sure. Recently started a new job as a barista, and it was going okay until I had a migraine attack and had to go home early. The next shift my manager had a ‚Äòdiscussion‚Äô with me, asking about my chronic pain conditions and whether they were an issue. As a barista, being on my feet all day without anywhere or any time to sit down for my entire shift caused me so much pain and I really struggled. I said that my chronic pain conditions were an issue for me because I wanted him to understand (especially as my previous job ignored my pain and tbh made it worse). He then said that I should think about ‚Äòcalling it a day‚Äô meaning quitting the job because he didn‚Äôt want me saying I can‚Äôt come in or can‚Äôt do certain things and because it‚Äôs an issue for me, it causes an issue for him. I was struggling sometimes to do the job, but I was only there for 3 days and they gave me hardly any training and just left me by myself so that didn‚Äôt really help things. The manager knew about my health issues from the interview, on my first day when I signed a document and declared that I did have a long term health condition which he acknowledged and on the second day when he sent me home early, so it‚Äôs not like he didn‚Äôt know. I know he also wasn‚Äôt happy that I had to get the bus in to work because I need to drive an automatic due to my health conditions and I haven‚Äôt got the money for it. I did end up quitting because there‚Äôs been so many times they‚Äôve messed me around. I was originally hired in March and I quit my job when they told me so I could start there and they decided they couldn‚Äôt hire me after that because of covid. Then they hid the fact that I was only being hired until October instead of permanently until the last minute. Then they took days to get in contact with me about my shifts after I went home early. Sorry for the long post, just wondering if being told to think about quitting because my health conditions cause the manager issues is discrimination and wondering whether to go the company hr about all that‚Äôs gone on.",27Sep2020,1

My family is two states away and I have no friends here. I‚Äôm feeling very lonely. I‚Äôve tried going online to make friends but the meet ups are all mommy groups and bible studies. I‚Äôm not shaming that, but it‚Äôs not my thing. I tried bumble bff, but most of the girls on it aren‚Äôt people who I think of vibe with. I come off as austere and bookish to a lot of people and I‚Äôm more left leaning than a lot of people here. I‚Äôm not addressing this to put anyone here down, they‚Äôre nice people and I‚Äôm sure a lot more fun to most people than I am, but I‚Äôm including that to explain why i have no idea how I‚Äôll make friends here. 

I‚Äôm not the type of person to change myself to appeal to others. I feel like that would produce shallow friendships anyway. Should I be doing more?

250,"This happened back in December. I was in college and just starting to experiment with alcohol. I‚Äôll be the first to admit‚Äîit was a very bad night. I got way too drunk. Most of the night is a blackout, I know that I fell over once and puked at least 4 times. When I came to the next morning, I immediately apologized to my friends and thanked them for helping me. They laughed, told me that it was okay and that most of the stuff I did was pretty funny and they weren‚Äôt mad about it. 

I thought everything was good. But almost every time we‚Äôve drank since then, they‚Äôve brought it up. I know that they mean well, because most of the time they just laugh and make jokes about needing to cut me off before I‚Äôve even had anything to drink. It makes me feel ashamed. Almost I can‚Äôt drink around them because I don‚Äôt want to be made fun of again. I know they‚Äôre doing it out of a place of love. And I understood it and played along the first few times because like I said, I made a mistake and it was a very bad night. But it‚Äôs been almost a year now. I‚Äôve learned my limits and them bringing it up every time we drink is just embarrassing now.

253,"Disclaimer: I talk about breasts here. It's human anatomy, it's normal. 

My mom and her sisters (my aunts) are very blunt. They're not ones to be emotional or sensitive, and they have tough skin. They can take a joke, likewise, they like making fun of others. Growing up, they were known as bullies. But they're good people, don't get me wrong. 

My mom is in a video call with my aunts and I can hear every word they're saying. They start talking about their boob sizes (weird, I know) and eventually they talk about their daughters' breasts. My younger sister has bigger breasts than I do, and they compliment her for them. On the other hand, I don't really like my breasts. But my biggest problem are my nipples and areolas. I don't really want to describe them, but I just don't like how they look like. Anyways, my mom goes into full detail about how they look like to my aunts, and they're all laughing like the popular girls in high school everyone just hates. One of my aunts even says, ""Oh my God, they're so ugly!"" (in our native language). Anyways, that upsets me but I don't show it. 

Then they start talking about my baby sister's hair and how they hope it doesn't turn out like mine. My mom and I are the only ones with curly hair in the family, but she outgrew her curls and now it's straight. I love my curls, but since I don't do much maintenance because I'm home most of the time, they frizz up and get bigger. My mom knows I've struggled with accepting my hair since I was always so insecure about it growing up (my family used to make fun of it all the time), but she doesn't defend me at all. She just laughed. 

They even go so far as to say that we have African blood because of our hair, and they proceed to laugh again. It's disgusting how they condone these racist jokes, but Filipino moms have always been lowkey racist. 

I went upstairs because I didn't want to hear them ridicule me anymore. I wanted to say something but in our culture, talking back to your elders is a sign of disrespect, regardless if you're right or wrong. I don't know what to do, honestly. I've been trying so hard to come to terms with my body but to hear my insecurities being poked and prodded by my own family is a huge blow.

254,"I feel weird and a bit dumb writing this out, but I feel like I need any help I can get. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for years now, and have been managing work okay up until this point. I think I got worse when my cat died a month ago, and things kept adding up to add more depression. My grandma who disowned me suddenly calls me out of the blue, or my work load doubling because of people quitting, and dating anxiety. I feel like everything keeps adding up, and nothing gives. 

So every day, I feel like I'm just coasting life. I go to work, I sleep, and I wake up to go to work again. That and the bad parts added in, and I feel like I'm stuck in this terrible rut. On days off I go out with family, and I tried drawing as a new hobby. I even talk to my doctor more about changing my medication, but it all feels hopeless. Even on good days where everything is going great my depression comes back and feels like it is slapping me back to ""reality"". 

I feel so terrible that I think about ending it. I hope avoiding a certain word will not get my story taken down. Each time I write on reddit I can't seem to figure it out, so I'm sorry. I'm still learning. 

So now I have less than five hours before I go to work. I feel so off, like I can't focus. But I'm too scared to fall asleep because I'm scared to go to work. I feel scared because my thoughts happen more when I'm there. There are too many ways to hurt myself, and I'm scared because I feel like I have less control to not do something terrible. I tried talking to my parents, but they still want me to work, which I understand. But I don't know what to do. Because now I don't want to sleep, because I don't want to wake up in the morning. So I'm sleeping less and less, and I am trying not to get in trouble with my work. I feel like I was going to get fired from days off, and I want to keep a good reference for when I leave. The thing is though, that on the other hand I couldn't care less because what good is a reference when I can't even see myself having another job?

I'm trying to work past these feelings, but everytime I repress everything and end up having a breakdown almost every week. I even felt mortified because I had a panic attack in front of my coworkers on the day that my depression hit it's lowest.

I just moved in yesterday, I was anxious for my parents to leave but when they were gone I was fine. I'm in private rented so not dorms, and we're all pretty good friends already (as much as you can be before meeting each other). 

I was absolutely fine until like the middle of the night - I just started feeling really anxious and nauseous. I was kind of expecting it but it's really annoying. It's now the morning and I don't want it to ruin my first proper day here so I'm not sure what to do. 

I don't know how to explain it best, but I feel like my body is just feeling a different way my brain does. Like I don't FEEL anxious or sad but my body is kind of showing it? I guess it's a subconscious thing.

my sister said she needed to leave because she had work that next day and my ex told me that i should stay for a little while and she‚Äôd take me home after. i stayed and then we started to unpack some stuff in her new place. all of the sudden, we were in her kitchen and she told me ‚Äúi can‚Äôt be anything more than just friends with you right now.‚Äù we started to have a conversation about it and she said that i hurt her really bad because of what i said and i led her to relapse from self harming herself, and the new guy she was talking too was the only person that was there for her. she said that she didn‚Äôt want to risk the chance of being back with me right now because of how much what i said hurt and where it left her mentally. i understood and we talked for a few hours. i tried my best to help her see it through but she kept declining and saying that she couldn‚Äôt do it again, at least right now until she can fully forgive me for the feelings of pain i caused her. 
i really wanted a chance to get her back last night and really help her see that i was getting help and never wanted to make her feel less than ever again. she said for now she just wants to stay friends and that maybe down the road she would forgive me and develop feelings for me again. i‚Äôm not sure what i‚Äôm supposed to do at this point because i‚Äôve never experienced anything like this. i would really just like the chance to be able to get her back. 
i haven‚Äôt cut contact for an extended period of time before she invited me over because i broke up with her and made her feel like she was alone and had nobody, and i feel that if i did that now she would never forgive me for making her go back to a low point in her mentality. 
i just don‚Äôt know which direction i should head but i really just want the chance to show her i‚Äôm changing and getting help for the betterment of my own life and that i can handle our relationship this time around. we broke up twice before but she said this time was the last time she could
do it because of what i said and where it left her. can somebody please just give me some advice on what to do? she said she doesn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll want to be back with me or not, and i‚Äôm really just trying to make her heal and see things through. she says she wants to just start hanging out like we did last night but as strictly friends. 
that following night she invited me over to hang out with her and her friends, so i brought one of my friends (which she never met) because she said that she was upset i never introduced her to many friends while we were together. everything was going well and then the new guy she‚Äôs talking to called her and she went in the bedroom for about 20-30 minutes and talked while we were in the living room. this upset me quite a bit as i‚Äôm sure it would to anybody else just thinking about the person they love talking to someone else while you‚Äôre in the next room. after she came out i didn‚Äôt say anything and let it go. at the end of the night i hugged her goodbye and she seemed hesitant to hug me back. after i got in my car i texted her asking if she was okay and if i did something to make her uncomfortable and she said no. the next day after that she seemed very distant. we have each other‚Äôs snapchat locations on still and i noticed that she stayed the night at her new guys house that night and assumed that‚Äôs why she was being short with me and wasn‚Äôt really replying to my messages. that was last night at the time that i write this, and today has been the same way. she said she loved me and wants to stay in my life but she doesn‚Äôt trust me for a relationship, and that she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship with anybody. i don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs had any sexual thing with this guy yet but since she‚Äôs been staying with him i can only assume that she has. it just makes me feel awful knowing i can‚Äôt do anything about it. what should i do? if you read this far thank you so much and i would really appreciate some advice :(",27Sep2020,1

270,"So, I was on my dad's computer downloading a movie, and I noticed something in the auto-complete.


Tinder.


My heart sank, and I shouldn't have clicked it, but I did. I had to find out. My dad has a Tinder account, and has matched with several people.


One of them being one of my friends. This pissed me off, made me furious, but also killed me inside. I didn't want to tell my mom, because I knew it was very likely to split up our family. I told her anyways because it was the right thing to do. My mom didn't really react, she was fairly stone-faced. I showed her the messages he was sending to other women. The only thing she said to me is ""thanks for telling me"" and ""don't worry"". My dad hadn't come home until about 20 minutes ago. It's currently 1:20 AM. My mom walked up to him and asked him why he was out so late. My dad said he was with a work friend
 My mom replied with ""are you sure you weren't with (Tinder girl's name)?"" My dad asked who that was. After that, I didn't hear what my mom responded with. My dad didn't respond and went and took a bath. My mom came into the living room where I was, crying my eyes out, she told me ""Don't worry. I'm gonna go take a drive for a few minutes."" I asked her if she'll come back home after this drive. She said yes, and left. I'm currently sitting in the living room crying, while my dad is in the bath and my mom is out, the rest of the family is still sleeping. I texted my mom ""I'm staying up, if I don't see you come home by 8 AM... I'm calling the police."". I don't know what to do, and I feel disgusted and angry with my dad, and really bad for my mom, I just don't want my family to fall apart...",27Sep2020,1

274,"Hola, please read, i really need to vent. Recently I confronted my friend about his behavior that really made me feel like I was walking on glass when i talk to him or go near him. Just so u know he has adhd.

For example, i confronted him that he keeps bringing up the time my trauma was triggered and during that time I kept yelling, ""dont hit me dont be mad."" (&lt;&lt;Unfortunately i dont remember saying that because i kinda blacked out and it took over me.)he thought that i meant to say this to him, I apologized several times and assured him i wasn't talking about him and that I know he would never hit me. But after that day he keeps bringing it up, I keep having to explain to him over and over that i wasnt referring to him and i didnt know what came over me, he said he felt hurt that i said those words to him and it made him look bad in our friend group, but ive told him they dont think of u that way(and its true i had them confirm this.)

I also told him to keep other peoples secrets to himself, because its respect, i dont need to hear it from him, and they trust him. He also pressures me to tell the reason why me and my bf broke up and idk why he wants to know but I really dont want to tell him and same goes for my bf, he would say stuff like,""oh u dont trust me okay then, I thought we were friends."" 

I told him he should know when to stop. He keeps hitting my friend that at that point it could be called abuse. We tell him to stop and he didnt take this well, he would either call the person he hit awful names or just tell us to shut up.

During the time I confronted him, i never called him names or labeled him like annoying or bad. I spoke in a nonaggressive tone, I was really calm and didnt raise my voice almost sweet. I tried really hard making sure he didnt feel attacked so i changed my tone and sentence structure, i may have been a bit blunt at 2 sentences, like saying,""you're being defensive"" or ""you're gas lighting me"". On the first call, I asked him how he is and if everything is well and he replied with, ""sad"" and I said if theres anything i can do im willing to help and listen and then i told what i've always wanted to tell him. most of his replies sounded like he was annoyed, by his tone, ""geez okay"" ""okayy im sorry"" ""anything else?"" but at least he listened and he said he was gonna go which kinda sounded like an excuse but that doesnt matter. 

I called him a second time hours because i havent finished even half the list. he kept saying, ""is that it?"" ""okay"" ""may i go now?"" at least he listened. I'll remind u that my voice was calm and i was trying to structure the sentence nicely to not attack him, and then he said the reason why he acted like this was all because he was depressed. 

He bullies my friend because hes depressed, he hits my friend because hes depressed, he brings up the thing i want to stop beating myself up about because he was depressed. He disrespects boundaries because he was depressed. That was the most disappointing thing i heard. We all know one thing, dont use mental illness as an excuse for problematic behavior. I didnt call him out for it and he left the same way he did on the first call.

After that he tells friend(a) and friend(b) that i was attacking him and being aggressive and he feels hurt. It just looked like he was victimizing himself and good thing friend(a) called me to hear my side of the story and said they were proud of me for being brave, but they were pitying my friend since hes going through a rough time, hes depressed, etc. Friend(b) on the other hand keeps defending his actions saying that hes depressed and he had a rough past(most of us did tho but yea), friend(b) couldnt give a good argument on why my friend was being problematic and that it was okay.

278,"I dealt with body dysmorphia and depression, but back then I didnt really recognize what was truly wrong with me. The country that Im from highly regards women's beauty, so maybe thats where the influence came from but Im sure its not all from that. I blamed all my internal struggled on my outer appearance, and thought that I would be happy if I wasnt myself. I was a greedy fool. Although Im biologically a female, I never felt woman enough. I wanted to be beautiful and sexy. I wanted to be mattered. At one point, I started feeling subhuman, and believed I wasnt even average enough and that Id be looked at as odd or weird. That was bdd playing with my mind. 

I went to the plastic surgeon, without having opinions of what I wanted or what I didnt want. I couldnt express myself because I was depressed, and completely relied on the doctor. Looking back, that was so irresponsible and foolish of me to do. Its been 5 years since, and Im still struggling with bdd and depression. The only thing added to that is this alienation I feel toward myself and immense..immense regret. Its so true that you only see the importance of something when its gone. Looking back at my past photos, I dont know why I was so filled with disgust about my appearance. I lost that kind look on my eyes that I used to have. I wasn't beautiful nor sexy, but people liked me because I radiated kindness and warmth, and I can see that now. The flaws and characteristics on my face made me who I am, and I got rid of them. I don't like the way I look now. It doesnt truly represent who I really am, and I lost that warmth. I even lost the youthful look that I used to have because the doctor somehow managed to make my cheeks sag, so I just feel like I look older than I should be.

 All in all, things only went downhill after my foolish decision. But what is done is done. Ive wished for death countless times over the past years, and Im ready to break out of that toxic cycle because Im only wasting my time and youth that way. But its really difficult when you're riddled with regret and hopelessness. I keep torturing myself with the thought that I did an irreversible damage to myself. And that I have wasted my potential and time, because I disregarded other things that were truly important in life by hiding myself from the world. This is probably a very unusual post, but Id really appreciate some advices from you guys. I am seeing a therapist now and its helping me a little bit, but Im still having a hard time getting out of my head and not spiraling into depression.",27Sep2020,1
279,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago. My neighbour rammed his car into my car, and left without leaving any note and didn‚Äôt even bother to notify us (me and my family).

282,"This is gonna be very long. I'm sorry. 

TLDR: been f'd over by family and friends so much I can no longer trust people when they say I'm their friend, the like me, they love me, etc. How do i work on this? Yes i need therapy but covid f'd over my employment and therefore insurance, and I'm in USA so i can't afford it

This is more about friendship than it is romantic, literally the only people that i can feel confident about loving me in return are my husband and parents right now.

I have trust and abandonment issues firstly because of my sisters. Sister A and I were extremely close growing up, but she ended up in a relationship with a narcissist who has turned her against her family. She comes around to act nice and pretend to be the sister i grew up with when she needs something, just to turn around and call me a white trash hillbilly the next (because our parents moved into the country after she graduated, meaning my baby brother and i were raised rural and that makes us white trash i guess?) or basically just act terrible to me in order to sever our relationship any time her bf thinks she's getting too close with me again. 

Sister B is a selfish narcissist herself who has bullied me into an eating disorder, tried to get my dog killed, and tried to make me homeless. So basically 2 people who were supposed to be my built-in love have shown me even family can and will hurt you.

Then friends. Friends 1, 2, 3, 4, and I became friends in high school. We were all super close, the type that cuddle and say we love each other and all that weird crap. We were also the emo/goth/outcast group if that makes it less weird. I have always been a caretaker type and ended up taking the bulk of emotional baggage. And yes i know high school friendships rarely last much longer, but these weren't simply issues of growing apart so much as borderline abusive mindgames. 

I had Friend 1 hold grudges i didn't know about for a year and pull the ""you know what you did"" shit until i was having panic attacks, seemingly wanted to try to make up, then later blow up at me for wanting her to have a dress the same color as my other bridesmaids and ended our friendship over it. 

Friend 2 got upset with me being a ""mom friend"" and worrying about her (she'd cycled through 2 borderline abusive relationships back to back, i had to move her out in the middle of the night, there were reasons i was worried), so she kept things from me and talked behind my back to friend 3 and 4 trying to turn them against me. Friend 3 flipped out on her and told me what happened, i flipped out on Friend 2 as well, and i started relying heavily on friend 3, because my baby brother died around this time. They weren't very serious things that she hid from me, but it was pretty hard to hear stories of how terrible i supposedly was after helping her out so much. I was definitely extra sensitive due to my brothers health at the time.

I've recently discovered Friend 3 to be lying to me, keeping things from me, and trying to turn the few new friends i had been trying to make against me. Hurt that she pulled the same stuff as friend 2 and lied about some extremely serious life stuff, I've told her that for my mental health i can't deal with her/it right now. I had been her emotional crutch for 6 yrs, constantly running to her in the middle of the night to keep her from hurting herself, taking her to the hospital, helping her financially, etc. I needed her once and she wasn't there, and then i found out about all the lies. 

Everything from Sister B trying to get my dog killed to Friend 3s bs has occured in quick succession in the last year. 

Now friend 4 hasn't really done anything. He had a controlling gf who didn't let him hang out with me for a while, but that's about it. (I see him as a brother and I respected boundaries as far as not hugging and stuff when she said it bothered her, she just didn't want him around other women period) He and i have always been able to talk and joke and be there for one another, but after everyone else... i just can't trust that he actually still cares like he says he does. 

And i can't trust my new friends, and friend 2 has apologized and is trying to be friends again but i can't trust her either.

I realized how messed up i am today. Friend 3 and 4 were roomies and friend 3 just up and moved, giving away a lot of their furniture behind his back so i went and got him a replacement bookshelf today and had my parents help. (I'm the only one with a truck) my mom looked at me and said ""i hope he knows he's got a good friend in you"" and i just... shrugged. Cuz even tho he thanked me and said he loved me and what not, i just didn't feel like it was true. Like he could turn around and hurt me without blinking an eye too. 

Idk how to be able to build and maintain trust friendships now. I'm just so sure everyone will leave or hurt me.",27Sep2020,1

288,"*potential trigger warning*
My wife and I married young. As you can guess by our ages, we are still in the early years of our marriage. We met while I was in high school and she was in middle but fostered our relationship once we were both older (me being 22 and her 18). I know everyone tells you to wait but I knew I wanted to be with her forever. When I was 18 I went through what I thought was my first sexual assault. 
I had recently graduated from my military basic training and was having a night out with some friends. I had just finished what I thought was the toughest part of my life and felt ready to take on the world. So we went to a house party and got pretty drunk. So drunk in fact that another friend took me from the house party and brought me to a secluded where he had his way with me. I dont remember much of what happened but the feeling that it brought on to me haunted for years. When I finally started getting therapy for the sexual assault it brought more occurrences that I hadn't thought were inappropriate till the session began delving into my past. For instance, when I was in 4th grade my cousin used to make me give him massages to play his Xbox. Not thinking anything of it I did so, even when he kept asking me to go lower till I had my hands on his pubic region. 
Fast forward a couple of years, my wife and I weren't talking as much (at the time we were on and off). I had a family member reach out to me and wanted to get more involved in my life. She seemed like the mother I had always wanted. That is until she would ask personal questions that I didn't find too comfortable: things about what turned me on or how my sex life was doing. Not having a lot of female role models in my life I thought it was just normal family talk. One night she came to visit me and wanted to drink with me. Not thinking anything of it, I thought it would be cool to hang with my family member. We drank with a few of my military buddies and had a good time. I offered to put her up in the base hotel and she declined saying she didn't want me to pay for it. After my friends left, I got on the floor and attempted to go to bed. She was to take my bed as I slept on the floor. Eventually she got up and kept trying to lay next to me. At this point, I knew what was going on. I kept moving to the other side of the room to avoid her but she kept latching on to me or grinding onto me. I felt uncomfortable but I knew i wasn't supposed to have anyone in my room and could get in trouble if I called for help. Eventually I just gave way and we had sex. 
Now to the present. I went through a lot of therapy for everything and it has helped in a lot of ways. Now I feel like i wasn't as straight as I thought and am possibly bisexual. My wife has been supportive of everything and works with me. But after everything, I still flinch from the touch of others. I camt stand someone touching me. I find it hard to be intimate with anyone but myself. She has been patient but I feel like i am losing her. I know she wants more sex in our relationship but for some reason I can't find the will to want sex anymore. Please Reddit. If you have any advice or books that would be much appreciated. I know the story is long and might be confusing (there was a lot that has happened in between), but I need some help. I love my wife with all my heart. She was there for me through all my therapy and even was okay with me coming out as bisexual after we were married. I dont want to lose her but I cant seem to find the sex drive in me anymore.",27Sep2020,1

I‚Äôll then quarantine until the results are back. If they‚Äôre negative, I‚Äôll go back to school. If they‚Äôre positive, I‚Äôll quarantine and hand in my work over Google Classroom.

I think this is pretty reasonable, right? 

Wrong, according to my parents. THEY WANT TO JUST SEND ME TO SCHOOL. 

#THATS NOT OKAY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

Further context:

1. The reason I‚Äôm afraid of the virus is because I don‚Äôt want to give it to others.

2. I only have one friend in my class, as my other friends all left school (except one, in a different grade.) [IMPORTANT]

If I don‚Äôt have it/am not symptomatic (HIGHLY unlikely) it‚Äôll work out in my favor (this still makes me mad, since I just won‚Äôt know if I have it just without symptoms.)

If I do have it, I‚Äôll

1. probably spread it to someone

2. make the whole class quarantine for two weeks. 

This obviously is super selfish to do. 

This also means I‚Äôm the kid who made everyone quarantine for two weeks. 

Meaning I might lose my friend and lose all opportunities to make friends. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get bullied,but if my classmates do much as give me a weird look, I will feel so overwhelmed with guilt because I would deserve it. 

No one will believe me that I didn‚Äôt want to go to SixFlags, which is supposed to be a lot of fun. It‚Äôd be easier to believe I‚Äôm just a selfish teenager who‚Äôs lying because they were stupid and got COVID.

This essentially means I‚Äôll have no one for the rest of the year.

Let me tell you, if gossip gets out about you, it lives forever. People still sometimes talk about people who left the school four years ago (when I joined the school) *or even from when they were in elementary and have since left.*

This effectively means I won‚Äôt have friends for all my years going to my school.

So, Reddit, how do I go about this? How do I convince my parents to finally listen to me? Why won‚Äôt they listen to me? 

They promised to ‚Äúnot force me to have fun anymore,‚Äù (screw this statement) but also say I won‚Äôt be ‚Äúhome bound‚Äù (I‚Äôm not, *and taking me to Six Flags is not just ‚Äúnot letting me be home bound.‚Äù*)

How do I go about this? I‚Äôm 15, so it‚Äôs all up to them :(",27Sep2020,1

291,"I‚Äôm put in a tough spot. With COVID and being in college it‚Äôs been super tough. I go to Florida state university and they could care less about COVID. The state just said ‚ÄúF it‚Äù and opened everything back up to be normal. So you don‚Äôt have to wear masks parties can have no limit and it‚Äôs just stupid kids doing stupid shit risking everyone else‚Äôs health. 

So my boyfriend and have been pretty careful we hang out with groups of friends.Its  not like ragers or anything it‚Äôs just people hanging out talking and drinking and smoking. It‚Äôs definetly  been more boring lately because of Covid but whatever it works it‚Äôs enough. 

However, tonight my boyfriend and I went out with one of our best friends. He just had Covid and wanted to finally hang out. I thought we were going to hang out at his house. Instead he dragged me into going to ‚Äú small get together a‚Äù. We go to two parties the first one sucked and everyone was on molly and we dipped like 10 min in because it was getting weird. I was the only one with a face mask and my boyfriend didn‚Äôt have one on. Let me mind you guys that I have a weak ass immune system and this semester is BRUTAL. I have an insane amount of work to do and I don‚Äôt have time to get kicked on my ass due to corona. Also in the next couple of weeks my family booked tickets to come to Florida and my mom to come visit me in school and also my boyfriends and mine anniversary. So I really don‚Äôt want to get it. After that I wanted to go home and asked. Our best friend now at this point is losing his best friend title and is peer pressuring me an insane amount to just go to this small meet up of some people to hang. At this point it‚Äôs 1:30 am we go and it is insanely packed like I mean insane. My boyfriend goes inside with a mask with our‚Äùbest friend‚Äù to see another friend they saw and to check it out I get a panic attack and I go sit in the car and wait for them to come back in like 20 min. 

So that‚Äôs the backstory. But here‚Äôs where I need the advice. Like I said I‚Äôm really anxious to get it at this time. Because with my awful immune system I know it will affect me harder and I don‚Äôt have time to feel weak and out of it with everything going on. I haven‚Äôt seen my family in like 5 years and I don‚Äôt want my mom to cancel her flight.. blah blah blah. You get the jist. I hate it because everyone in my town doesn‚Äôt care about corona at all so it‚Äôs easy to see these parties on social media and have complete FOMO. And think like wow what I‚Äôm doing tonight is so much lamer. I feel like I‚Äôm truly the only one in this town that cares about it and I feel like a party pooper and I‚Äôm not like that at all and it‚Äôs putting me down. I have this FOMO but then when I go to something like tonight I have a complete panic attack. I can‚Äôt win. It‚Äôs also my senior year and last year here and it sucks because I don‚Äôt wanna feel like this for my last year. It‚Äôs also my last year with my boyfriend until we do long distance for like a about a year. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it crying because I told him that I‚Äôm frustrated with the whole situation and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I might have to go home. I really hate going home it‚Äôs painfully boring and it‚Äôs harder to work from home there. Plus I‚Äôm already having a difficult time with my classes with this online teaching(which isn‚Äôt even teaching it‚Äôs old videos they replay). I kinda gave him an ultimatum  and I feel awful about it because the last thing I want to do is be controlling and tell him what to do and who to hang out with because I don‚Äôt. I said I hang out with people who are negative and their friends who are negative and I‚Äôve still been able to meet new people this way. So I‚Äôm going to keep doing the same thing. The main thing that‚Äôs going to put me at risk is my boyfriend. So I feel like me staying here is kinda weighing on him. He has super easy classes and isn‚Äôt doing much so he kinda just wants to go out because he‚Äôs bored and everyone else is doing it and be ‚Äúkinda‚Äù cautious but if he gets it he gets it. I said I‚Äôm ok with him hanging out with people he knows are negative or even with a small group of strangers just with a mask on and being cautious. However, if he goes to a big party even with a mask on like tonight I‚Äôm not about it. Like tonight made me super anxious that he walked into that party and I‚Äôm almost debating if I should see him for a couple days to see if he gets sick. He doesn‚Äôt really know what to do. He said he wants to do this for me but he‚Äôs also has extreme FOMO and Ik that with our best friend now back in the fold and him already having Covid he‚Äôs going to go out a ton and invite my boyfriend to go to these strangers parties that are big. 


So what do I do. The LAST thing I want to do is go home but I think I might have to. Am I out of line asking that for my boyfriend? Should I just say f it and get corona? Like give me some advice cause I hate Covid and it‚Äôs putting everyone in toughs spots.",27Sep2020,1
292,"Context: I'm a 28m virgin, I'm struggling enough as it is in my everyday life with the pandemic, a change of career and trying to get my book published. 

My problem is that every time I have some downtime, my thoughts go sex or relationships. Some days I rub one out fast three to four times to get rid of the thoughts and focus on something else, but it always comes back. When I'm not horny, I'm fantazising about what it is to be with someone. 

During the day I have ways to get my attention on other things, writing, working out, cooking pastry or whatever. The worst is in the veening, when I start to get tired and just want to rest, that's when it comes back strong. And I'd just like to think about something else rather than wishful thinking and scenarios that are possible only in my imagination.

299,"*potential trigger warning*

My wife and I married young. As you can guess by our ages, we are still in the early years of our marriage. We met while I was in high school and she was in middle but fostered our relationship once we were both older (me being 22 and her 18). I know everyone tells you to wait but I knew I wanted to be with her forever. When I was 18 I went through what I thought was my first sexual assault. 
I had recently graduated from my military basic training and was having a night out with some friends. I had just finished what I thought was the toughest part of my life and felt ready to take on the world. So we went to a house party and got pretty drunk. So drunk in fact that another friend took me from the house party and brought me to a secluded where he had his way with me. I dont remember much of what happened but the feeling that it brought on to me haunted for years. When I finally started getting therapy for the sexual assault it brought more occurrences that I hadn't thought were inappropriate till the session began delving into my past. For instance, when I was in 4th grade my cousin used to make me give him massages to play his Xbox. Not thinking anything of it I did so, even when he kept asking me to go lower till I had my hands on his pubic region. 
Fast forward a couple of years, my wife and I weren't talking as much (at the time we were on and off). I had a family member reach out to me and wanted to get more involved in my life. She seemed like the mother I had always wanted. That is until she would ask personal questions that I didn't find too comfortable: things about what turned me on or how my sex life was doing. Not having a lot of female role models in my life I thought it was just normal family talk. One night she came to visit me and wanted to drink with me. Not thinking anything of it, I thought it would be cool to hang with my family member. We drank with a few of my military buddies and had a good time. I offered to put her up in the base hotel and she declined saying she didn't want me to pay for it. After my friends left, I got on the floor and attempted to go to bed. She was to take my bed as I slept on the floor. Eventually she got up and kept trying to lay next to me. At this point, I knew what was going on. I kept moving to the other side of the room to avoid her but she kept latching on to me or grinding onto me. I felt uncomfortable but I knew i wasn't supposed to have anyone in my room and could get in trouble if I called for help. Eventually I just gave way and we had sex. 
Now to the present. I went through a lot of therapy for everything and it has helped in a lot of ways. Now I feel like i wasn't as straight as I thought and am bisexual. My wife has been supportive of everything and works with me. But after everything, I still flinch from the touch of others. I can't stand someone touching me. I find it hard to be intimate with anyone but myself. She has been patient but I feel like i am losing her. I know she wants more sex in our relationship but for some reason I can't find the will to want sex anymore. Please Reddit. If you have any advice or books that would be much appreciated. I know the story is long and might be confusing (there was a lot that has happened in between), but I need some help. I love my wife with all my heart. She was there for me through all my therapy and even was okay with me coming out as bisexual after we were married. I don't want to lose her but I can't seem to find the sex drive in me anymore. I've never told the entire story before, but I figured I could be honest here.",27Sep2020,1

305,"Hey everyone! My boyfriend (19m) and I (21f) discovered I was pregnant two days ago! We were both in absolute shock, but that‚Äôs expected! 

Initially, we thought the best choice would‚Äôve been for me to have an abortion because we are still both young. Although, we aren‚Äôt those average party-loving young adults. 

Both sides of our parents and friends are very supportive, and even my mother(s) are excited to become grandmas, and that‚Äôs when I knew my initial decision was to keep the baby. I cried myself to sleep the past few nights thinking about going through an abortion and it would haunt me for the whole day. I knew in my heart I couldn‚Äôt go through with it, so here we are wondering what the gender is going to be! 

I go to the doctor with my mother soon to get checked up and see how far long I am. I‚Äôm guessing around a month or less! 

I am a tattoo artist in Alabama. I make pretty good money. We have our own apartment and have enough money to make it through the months generally. 

My boyfriend is an order processor who is so good he keeps getting raise upon raise. I‚Äôm proud of him! But I do worry about him, because he is still figuring his life out and is younger than me! But he wanted me to make the best decision for us and he even gets excited as well. 

So I have a few questions: 

1.) What can I expect the next few months? 

2.) Is tattooing as my job going to effect much? The studio is SUPER clean, professional, and entirely not a metal/meth head scene. We take care of everything.

3.) Coronavirus is still around here very bad as well, what precautions should I take more than a mask, sanitizer, etc?

4.) Should we move from an apartment to a house? Our apartment is a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom 
We would be due around late May (I‚Äôm assuming) and our lease ends in April, but we could move out earlier by some talking to our manager. 

5.) We have a 5 year old German Shepherd, who‚Äôs extremely sweet; and he knew before I did. (He laid on my stomach unusually prior before I knew). AND we have a year old tuxedo cat. I know to let my boyfriend handle the cat litter.",27Sep2020,1
306,"I'm 24F and was in a relationship with my ex for about 4 years. It's been 2 years since we broke up (on really bad terms) but finally ended all communication earlier this year. During my time with him, my friend (23F) always hung out with my ex but I never thought much of it since she was also dating someone else at the time. 

My ex always joked about how she was hot when we were together, but again I never thought much of it cause we were all friends and we had the kind of relationship where we could joke bout it and move on. There was a moment when I was jealous of their friendship but he reassured me that she would never date him. I used to hang out with my friend a lot too and it never occurred to me that she would actually be interested in him. 

Our breakup ended on really bad terms, it was to the point where he was blackmailing me so he could try to get sexual favors out of me. I was so scared of him after our breakup, I didn't know what would happen if the details of our breakup came out. 

Fast forward to today, I saw a picture of them together as a couple and I was honestly shocked  when I saw it. I couldn't believe it at first. I haven't talked to my friend in a year, but she never showed interest to my ex (while we were together or even after we broke up). I have not spoken to her in a year, but again never thought she would date him. We were never close enough to have a ""girl code"" but it still feels weird to me that she kind of broke it? Has anyone else felt this way before? :/

Although the cause of the breakup was not my fault, I'm still kind of scared my ex will reveal all the vunerable details about me, our relationship, breakup, and the intimate videos we once shared together to my friend. Although I haven't spoken to her in a while, I would still call her my friend...she didn't do anything bad to me (not that I know of) and I don't think she cheated when I was in a relationship with him. 

How would you guys react in this situation? 
Should I just act normally if I see her again? I'm scared she'll find out about my past mistakes with him. 

I'm trying my best to move on. I haven't dated anyone in two years, since I broke up with him.

Thank you to anyone that can give advice :)",27Sep2020,1

311,"Wow, that title doesn't feel grammatically correct, but it's 3 am. 

I've been best friends with my friend (we'll call her K) for just about 10 years now. She has two younger sisters (older than me, younger than my friend, I don't know their exact ages - late 20s/early 30s.) I'll refer to her youngest sister as A and the older one as N.   
They've never liked me. The reason K has told me they don't like me is because they think I'm stuck-up, and they think I'm ""flakey."" 

For the reason they think I'm ""stuck up"": I have really bad social anxiety, especially with new people (and particularly with new people I'd like to approve of me.) But it still leads me to being standoff-ish and quiet. I'm never rude or anything, I'll answer any question I'm asked and try to make it more than a few words, without babbling, I'll go out and do stuff with them, I helped K babysit A's kids before, and A's kids *love* me. 

For the reason they think I'm ""flakey"": K and I talked about moving in together since I was a teenager, and there have either been times where I was either supposed to come out and visit, or move (we live on opposite sides of the country), and I didn't come for one reason or another; they've *always* been valid reasons, be it money issues, my mom dying, health issues, etc. I do still spend quite a bit of time with her, all things considering. Last year, I spent 3 weeks with her. So I always make up for not visiting, and moving out *period* hasn't been an option for me due to financial and health reasons, let alone moving out and across the country. K understands completely. I assume she just vents in a moment of frustration with her sisters around, so now they think I'm a terrible, flaky person.

I try to be nice around them, I join them for stuff when I'm invited/K will arrange stuff for me to be around them while I'm out there to prove I'm not this awful person. N's husband likes me just fine, K's parents like me (her mom *loves* me; literally to the point she drove 2 hours to pick me up from the airport.) Like I said, A's kids absolutely adore me and constantly request me to come out, and want to see me when I am out. But A&amp;N hate me.

Is there anything I can do to right things with them? Or do you think they've just made up their mind, and there's nothing I can do?",27Sep2020,1

314,"Friday i was forced to take home 8 vials for stool samples after complaining about the semi random contents my butt produces (and after mentioning its most likely due to my poor and inconsistent diet). Since they have to be refrigerated (causing no end of arguments about its placement and position in the fridge among other things), i NEED to have them filled and out by Monday.

Now, my friend's mom who lives with us, a VERY out of practice nurse whom I accidentally showed the test list to, insists that laxatives and extra fiber are a no go as any change to my diet will mess with the results. However, not only is the ""collection"" process an insane hassle, but I have had trouble producing enough for a single vial a day if at all since its kinda a lottery/slot machine when i sit down and can really only do it once or twice at home. 

This is causing nothing but arguments and additional conflict to an already ""shitty"" situation (which I might make another post for because why not) so I want to just toss it all out and trust my original assumption or just resort to gorging on garbage fast food and lunchmeat/downing a ton of laxatives.

315,"Hi. I apologize in advance for the throwaway. It‚Äôs been a rough past year. I have a lot of feelings to get out and no one to ask for advice, so here I am. 
I‚Äôm 19. I‚Äôm a biology major. I get average grades. Im in my third semester but i am a sophomore and will be a junior next semester due to skipping one. I have a few A‚Äôs, a few B‚Äôs. One C consistently. It‚Äôs always in chemistry. I suck at chemistry. My goal was to be pre-med and go to medical school. The longer I go to school the more I fear it won‚Äôt work out. My GPA from my first two semesters is a 3.0. There‚Äôs no way I am going to get into medical school with a 3.0. I am taking organic chemistry now (online, involuntarily) and I have never felt more alone and isolated from my peers and classmates than I do now. I feel like I am teaching myself, and I feel like I am drowning. 
I don‚Äôt have any other options than medical school. If I don‚Äôt get into medical school then I will be in massive amounts of debt from my undergraduate with a useless degree if I‚Äôm not in medicine. But I don‚Äôt have any back up plans. I don‚Äôt know what else I would want to do if not medicine. I want to help people and I want to become a doctor. My end goal was radiology. I feel like it‚Äôs impossible to obtain. I feel trapped, like I only have one option but that one option is the most difficult option possible. 
I guess I feel like I‚Äôve set myself up for failure and now I‚Äôm floundering. I don‚Äôt know where any of my passion lies. I don‚Äôt know how to find it. I‚Äôm terrified. I don‚Äôt want to be in crippling debt because of an unattainable dream.

317,"For background, between the years of 2017-2019, I never got diagnosed but that was no normal funk. I had 4 suicide attempts.

Where I feel I was starting to move on up was around mid 2019, I was working a good job and sometime later I caught up with an old crush (I had previously let her walk away in 2018 because I was depressed, so I felt this was a 2nd chance.) and we started meeting up. Long story short, she eventually revealed she was moving for college, and my job closed and I was laid off, all in the same week. This would've been September 2019.

Catching up to the present, I work two jobs, got my own place, I'm eating healthy home cooked meals, working out, I'm working on starting a 2nd business, and I have for all intents and purposes overcame my depression, however, I had a realization. I could've done all of this at anytime, and ever since then I've felt compelled to work harder because now I feel pressured. I feel if I don't work harder, I'll become depressed again. When the work becomes too much, I feel like exploding, I want to break everything in a room, and recently it was spilling out at work, my manager and I thankfully talked and said it was okay if I need a few days to myself, but this has to change.

I know why I feel this way, I feel angry because of the decisions I made because of the influence of depression, would I of had a better relationship with that girl and maybe things would've worked out better? Would I had not been hopping job to job for the course of two years? Would I had spent more better time building skills and becoming a better person instead of being in bed crying about how worthless I thought I was?

Then this guy (18) joined. I knew him from before, but not for very good reasons.

324,"Hi everyone, this is a throwaway account for pretty obvious reasons, but I need some advice.

I‚Äôm a 20 year old amputee, congenital to be specific. I was born without my right leg and some of my left. This has caused major self confidence issues, I don‚Äôt look at myself like a normal person. When I see people doing literally anything my first reaction mentally is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that‚Äù. Now, this may come off like I‚Äôm pessimistic, but I‚Äôm actually a very optimistic person usually.

High school wasn‚Äôt great, as you could imagine for a wheelchair user. Now, I‚Äôm a guy also, so because of that my number one priority in high school was obviously girls lol. I didn‚Äôt have any girlfriends in high school, nor did I get laid. I‚Äôd see girls grinding on guys at dances and my initial response would be ‚Äúgirls couldn‚Äôt do that to me because I‚Äôm sitting down‚Äù (weirdly specific I know, this is just how my brain works). And I‚Äôd constantly compare myself to the guys I knew that were getting someone, and I wasn‚Äôt. This has lead to depression.

The last thing you‚Äôd need to know about me is I‚Äôm a musician. I‚Äôm a singer and I play guitar and bass and spend essentially all of my time writing and recording music. And this has been a great outlet for me, creatively and emotionally and I‚Äôm grateful for that.

Now my problem is, I‚Äôm very depressed and isolated. I work part time but other than that I stay in (partly due to COVID because we all need to stay in lol) and write music. I don‚Äôt really have friends anyway. And I constantly compare myself to others and I look at myself like I‚Äôll never have a girlfriend. It‚Äôs sad man. Part of me thinks that girls won‚Äôt want me because of my disability so why bother trying. I met one girl after highschool on tinder and we dated for about 2 weeks before it fell apart due to trust issues. And because disabled people are really discriminated against (I‚Äôm constantly demeaned and spoken down to) it has just reinforced the thought that I‚Äôm below everyone else and I can‚Äôt do the things they can do.

I‚Äôve never actually considered suicide, because I don‚Äôt want to die. But I‚Äôd like to start living.

What should I do? I‚Äôm broken and I don‚Äôt know how to fix myself.",27Sep2020,1

327,"This is a little longer than I realized it would be, so if you read to the end thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

I have only recently re-connected with my Mom (in the last 3 years) and our relationship has been halfway normal considering where it was prior to that (there was at least 5 years of no contact before this, my choice).

In this time I added her to Facebook so I could share pics of my Son and whatnot, and for the most part she didn't post anything crazy, just normal Minion memes and stuff. Recently there has been an increase of political posts, and I thought this was weird because all my life she was not a political person and never expressed any views.

At first it was whatever, I would see her pro-Trump things and just brush them off, then she was sharing false news stories that my Wife and I had to debunk for her with a 2 second search. Still nothing that would make me think twice about anything.

In the past 2 or 3 weeks she has been sharing some blatant racist posts, specifically singling out Black stereotypes. (she never posts herself, its always shared from some page or person with a large following). Not only did these posts start to get my attention, the hypocrisy is off the charts, I will need to explain a couple of them to illustrate my point.

The first one that made me question what she was posting was something trying to say there is no ""white privilege"" but the true privilege is:

\-Buying expensive shoes when you have no job (She is on Social Security and regularly buys $50-$70 Vans when she could be going to discount stores, thrift stores, Walmart etc...)

\-Getting a free phone with data plan ie: ""Obama Phone"" (she has had one in the past, and I think may still be on one right now)

\-Being on state subsidized  housing/food stamps and not needing to worry about rising taxes and utility costs and being to put food on the table (she is literally living in a subsidized apartment for $100 a month and is on food stamps)

\-Being able to protest about ""anything that triggers you"" without needing to call in to your job and face the consequences of doing so (she has not had a job in 18 years, is on Social Security, and could march her self down to any protest she feels like with no worries)  

The kicker to this post was someone commented ""I wouldn't know what its like to live like this"" and my Mom replied ""Me neither""

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing was something about you wouldn't have to worry about being murdered by police if you didn't commit crimes (My Mom has literally been a criminal for as long as I can remember, drug user, drug dealer, child endangerment, warrants, has been in jail herself)

And the post that sent me over the edge and made me realize I needed to speak up...

Its a picture of a school desk with plastic dividers to keep the kids isolated from each other, the caption reads ""These fuckers will think they are visiting their dad"" (My step dad, father of 2 of her kids has been in jail literally more times then I can count, and I once bailed him out when I was 17 using the money from my summer job) Something about being a Father myself really made my blood boil with this one.

&amp;#x200B;

There were plenty others, but these get the point across I think. So the other night my Wife and I were talking about it, and getting a little heated and I realized I need to try and have a real talk with my Mom. I have no clue what is going to come from it, but I need to say something so I am not complacent with these posts.

I feel like its one of 2 options here, either she is an actual closet racist, or is really dumb and somehow does not realize what she is posting is hurtful, neither of them is a good option.

I am seeing her tomorrow for my Sister's birthday and plan on pulling her aside near the end so as to not upset the party, I have been running through my mind how to go about the convo.

Has anyone had to go through something similar? How would you go about brining this up? Mind you, I don't have any problem severing a relationship, I have done it before and if it means my Son isn't exposed to that kind of thinking, I will cut it right out.",27Sep2020,1

The guy (31M) started messaging me (23F) a couple of months back. It started out friendly but quickly became flirtatious, and we decided that we should meet up one day. Soon enough, he started blowing cold. Only replying with short messages or leaving me on read. I understand that life is stressful, especially in these times, so I gave him space. This seemed to work as eventually his enthusiasm returned. However, when I finally grew the courage to provide a time and location for meeting, he rejected me, claiming his life was complicated at the moment. Obviously I was a little stung but I assured him that I totally understood and was there if he needed anyone to speak to. 

A week later, he‚Äôs blowing up my phone again, telling me the previous offer is back on the table. In the meantime, a few of us from our office have arranged to meet up for a drink. So we do our mating dance again over text until our night out. We met up for work drinks last week, he barely spoke to me and kept eyeing up my friend (38F). I ask him if he is actually interested in me to which he replies it‚Äôs a no go. 

The next few days I allow myself a small pity party. I know it‚Äôs silly but being rejected can take a toll on my self worth. My friend is there to support me and she is the closets person to me right now.

339,"Hi All, 

Just for some background I‚Äôm a 22M student currently at uni doing a PhD. I‚Äôve always struggled with mental health issues, mainly anxiety and depression. During my third year of university (2 years ago) my friend (not one mentioned in the title) thought it would be a good idea to join a sports team to make new friends, and find a sort of support group for when I was feeling down or anxious.

Fast forward to today and I‚Äôve been a member of the club since. I‚Äôll be the first to admit my mental  health has still been very rocky, but I was told throughout my time there that I had a network of people who cared for me and wanted to support me. I became decently friendly with an individual who we‚Äôll call James, and when the new year rolled around we decided we would live together in a shared house.

While playing video games last night, I lost to a friend of James and he decided to send a video of it in a group chat with himself and other members of the sports team (for warzone).  Being the anxious person I am, I asked James what the others had said in response to the video once I saw him replying with lots of ‚Äúhahahahaha‚Äôs‚Äù to one of their comments.

It turns out that a very popular member of the club, who serves as the clubs mental health first aider, had replied to James that I was now going to kill myself because of the loss. I pressed further and apparently James, who I use to confide in, has been telling others in the club about my problems and it‚Äôs been a running joke. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting but I feel very betrayed. I‚Äôm unsure what to do as I‚Äôm meant to be living with James for another 10 months. I want to report the club to the university as both James and the individual who made the comments I saw are integral parts of the club (actively participating in how it‚Äôs run) and I‚Äôm concerned this is building a toxic culture which has a facade of supporting male mental health issues whilst mocking it behind closed doors. At the same time, I‚Äôm extremely anxious that I‚Äôm blowing this all out of proportion. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? 

TLDR; My friend and person I confided in regarding my problems with mental health has been making fun of me with other members of our university sports club. Should I report the club to the university or am I overreacting?

This might seem like a long rambling and I am not sure if I  succeeded in delivering the message.

I was a straight-A student in school with a highly competitive streak and little to no interest in co-curricular activities. The only thing I ever did was read and write. And in college, I chose the path of engineering because that is what a million others did. And I got through the exams because again I hated failing. And I took up a career in something that had no connection to what I learned in college, yet again I just followed the path of least resistance. I was letting myself flow along with the circumstances that life created for me. I was satisfied with meagre pay and selling myself short. I did not think or even if I thought, my feelings bounced back after small episodes of depression. I mocked people who had aims in life. I was carefree. Real passion did not require work. And I would find my one thing in life someday in the future and would turn into a success overnight. Hard work was overrated as far as I was concerned.

This went on for two years after college. Recently I had come across the profiles of all my school mates and college mates. The underdogs and the unappreciated people. The ones who chose to catch the tangent rather than follow the curve. The ones who refused to believe in the path of least resistance. They seem to have achieved so much. The two years that had flown by for me seem to have dragged across for them. Almost like they had lived five years of quality professional life by focusing on one thing rather than two unproductive years like me.

But then I realised something. In fact, I realised a lot of things. Passion did not come to these people overnight. They had decided to invest a lot of time into the few things that interested them and the more they learned about it, the better they became at it. Passion is not what will come to you ten or twenty years from now. Passion comes from vision and grit. The will to dig deep and the courage to go forward even with tens and thousands of failures. Passion is created through hard work. The more I know about something, the better I get at it. The better I get at it, the easier it gets for me to solve the challenges. The easier challenges I get, the tougher ones I can solve. The tougher ones I solve, the better my reputation gets. And then I become a person of value.

All this begins with the will power and the vision. Thoughts and dreams alone can never get you anywhere. The first keystrokes for a writer are always difficult. It is easier to procrastinate and fool yourself. It might actually feel good for some time. When you have all these thoughts about success but you just postpone working for it to the next day. And the next day just goes on in a never-ending circle. At the same time, it is difficult but feels ten times better when you actually do what you were thinking of doing. And the good feeling is never a short term.

All this while my what I was doing wrong was putting a small aim that did not serve any purpose. Like doing a course or writing a blog post. I never had a vision. Why was I writing it? Why do I need a course? If all this is leading to the realisation of a bigger vision, perhaps I would have had the enthusiasm to continue with the path for more than two days. So what I need is an impossible dream. And everything I do from today should lead me one step towards that dream. This way I never lose the sight or prevent myself from going through the seemingly mundane tasks.

I should probably stop. What are your thoughts on passion? Do you agree with me?

346,"I‚Äôm 20f turning 21 in May, I have a history of serious mental health issues and have sort of been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia but had to leave treatment due to lack of funds so no full evaluation. I will be leaving my abusive parents‚Äô home in January.


I have friends from school and they are aware that I have schizophrenia and have attempted suicide in the past but don‚Äôt really know the details of my mental health history. I‚Äôm close with my friends and we chat frequently and have hung out on and off campus before. I have been to some of my female friends‚Äô houses and gone to parties with them. Most of them drank alcohol before the legal age and they want me to come to the bar with them and drink on my 21st birthday. I faced peer pressure to drink in high school but I didn‚Äôt because of my mental health issues and the fear of getting in trouble.


One person in the group, 19M, is not exactly close with me in terms of hanging out the most (I‚Äôm like 20 times closer with my female friends than with my male friends) but does know and understand the most about my mental health history and about trying to fit in and feeling alienated. He is from Saudi Arabia and he faced the same problems with being stereotyped as violent that I did and also struggled to fit in when he moved here a few years ago. I heard ‚Äúschool shooter‚Äù comments and he heard ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù comments. He told me not to drink on my 21st birthday because ‚Äúalcohol is a gateway drug and then you could start doing heroin or cocaine‚Äù and talked about how people get liver failure, DUI death, brain damage etc. He said that drinking alcohol can cause blindness if they made a mistake making it. He said that he isn‚Äôt going to drink even after he is 21 and he said that when his aunt was in college, a classmate drank 1-2 glasses of alcohol at a party and died from alcohol poisoning after 2 days.


My closest friend didn‚Äôt take a side but she told me ‚Äúmake your own choices because only you know what‚Äôs healthy for you‚Äù and said that she doesn‚Äôt drink because of her meds. She is also schizophrenic. Btw statistically 75% of people with BPD become alcoholics. Our other friends claim I will miss out and I feel peer pressure on both sides. I think a reasonable idea would be to have a party at home and watch movies and maybe sleepover, so that I won‚Äôt have to deal with possible harassment, predators etc or even just social discomfort at the bar/nightclub. I think I‚Äôll be okay if I try drinking once, I‚Äôm not going to get drunk as I calculated it online and I can have 2 drinks without getting intoxicated. Still, apparently that‚Äôs all it takes to die of alcohol poisoning... JFC I‚Äôm conflicted.",27Sep2020,1

353,"The past 3 years have been very concerning for me. This is in large part due to the fact that I have gone on a massive spending spree seeing shitloads of sex workers. In 2017 and 2018 I spent a total of $NZ3,000 on sex workers. Initially it wasn't so bad, as I was spending $60-80 per week on an escort. However, beginning in late 2019 it begun to increase drastically and it became commonplace for me to spend $200 per head. I am now 25 and in my last semester of university. While I have extended family that have set aside $10,000 for me to cover my student loans, I am concerned whether this spending is going to gradually negatively impact me in years to come. Prior to Covid-19, I was on a supported living payment, earning money sporadically playing gigs as a musician with fees raging from $150-300, which I would set aside and not spend on SWs. 

There are a number of factors that has led me to spending this ungodly amount of money on SWs:  


1) Sexual curiosity - being able to fuck certain types of women that I cannot/seldom find going out approaching to date/fuck women (Polynesian, black and large breasted women - that vast majority of women I approach tend to be white), as well as being curious about things such as sexual massage. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Being very knitpicky with the types of women I want to date.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Not generating a sufficient amount of interest from women that want to be involved in recurring sexual relationships.  

  
4) Being underwhelmed with online dating apps (I was permabanned from Tinder a few years ago).   


5) low prices were an initial excuse/rationale to go and fuck SWs.  


  
I am adventurous, active, curious, study music, play music, like to spend time out of the house and I am gradually in the process of cultivating solid friendships. I have made a considerable, proactive effort to meet women and ask them out on dates. However, I feel that I am not achieving that optimum results I want - this has especially been compounded by Covid-19.   


There are several financial incentives I have made over the past years to not see workers - including saving money to buy new headphones, shoes, driving lessons, gear, instruments etc. However, I have trouble maintaining this incentive and my sexual impulses and curiosity are getting the better of me. 

I attempted to resolve this issue by opting instead to spend money on sex parties. The issues with this however arose. Prior to the first and second lockdowns in my country, sex parties were few and far between and off course they ceased during the lockdowns. Most of the swinger parties allowing single guys were either fully booked or were underwhelming and involved me awkwardly loitering around with the other single dudes. 

I have attempted to resolve this repeatedly by diversifying my interests and broadening the types of activities I am doing within a given week, however I am unsure whether I am doing a enough in this regard. I am a very sexual person and a sex positive person at that, but it's probably likely that I have some blindspots. I did Skype coach back in 2016, but going on a strip club binge resulted in me haulting coaching. I have been on a good number of dates since then, but I only one of them has resulted in a friends with benefits type relationship. There have been good deal of casual encounters, happening sporadically - I had three in between the two lockdowns in June and July.   


I think the core of the issue here stems from casually browsing listings for the ""sake of curiosity"". This has been almost a daily habit, if so a timewaster that has resulted in me spending hours finding the ""best deal"" and ""the most alluring women who are either busty, 40+ or brown/black"". I get psychologically attached to these listings and start developing fantasies of these sex workers advertising themselves. Is there a way I can withdraw from this activity that doesn't involve installing filtering apps (I have tried this and this doesn't work).   


This hasn't been severely impacting my studies, but I feel that I really need to realign my financial properties and start saving.   


There are several compromises I have experimented with:  


1) No spending over $100

2) No booking than 1 booking a month.   


3) Go for sensual massage instead of sex.   


4) Only go to sex workers who are a) black/brown b) 40+ c) tall and curvy or d) busty - E cup+  


Do you think it's a good idea to choose and stick with one of these options? Is it better for me to quit sex workers altogether?   


I am serious about making a career out of music. However it's inevitable that at this point in time, that I would need to be making money outside of music in order to move out of my parent's place and buying and maintaining gear. Is living with parents and living off a job seeker's benefits detrimental to moving forward beyond this? The problem I am encountering with employment is finding work that  1) adequately pays and 2) that I am qualified to do - many job vacant listings out there are specialized and require specialist qualifications and experience (i.e. retail, hospitality, education, painting, poster hanging, delivery etc). I am working on getting fully licenced to broaden my job opportunities.

361,"I'd say that I've had a pretty normal and pleasant childhood, at least up until 7th or 8th grade. That's when the problems began for me. To start, I've always struggled in interacting with others and in participating in social activities. I wouldn't say that this is because of anxiety or some other factor, but just that I lack both the skills and desire necessary.  However, I've still usually been able to manage with my small group of friends. I've always performed poorly in school even despite me being intelligent enough to succeed, and in 4th grade my parents brought me to a psychiatrist were I was diagnosed with ADD. Another thing I think is important to mention is that I'm apart of a military family which means we move around every 2 years or so. I have no doubt that that has been one of the factors that has directly led to the decline of my mental health. In 5th grade, my family and I got stationed in Alabama. Needless to say, I did not enjoy my time there. Yet, before my 6th grade year had begun we had moved back overseas again and for a while things were looking up. I had made a new group of friends and for the first time in my life I earned all A's at school. But that all changed in 7th grade when I started to lose motivation and my grades slipped. Plus, at the end of the year we moved again. So once again I was forced to try and make new friends and after a couple months into the school year I thought I had found them. This is when I met my former best friend who we're just gonna call Ethan. I wasn't great friends with him yet though as our table had a lot of ""members."" As the year progressed, me and Ethan became closer and we started texting and playing PS4 together. Meanwhile, my mental health was beginning to decline for reasons I'll discuss later on. After the year had ended, everyone in my group of friends parted ways due to the military, leaving just me and Ethan. Ethan and I really had no other choice other then to become closer friends over the summer, which we did. We played PS4 and texted pretty much everyday. Over the summer he also introduced me to someone who he'd been friends with for years who we'll call Eric. A couple weeks before summer had concluded I began football practice. My mom had signed me up even though I did not want to. Those final weeks nearly ruined the entire summer for me. I would throw up before practice to avoid going. Eventually, I was ""sick"" long enough that my dad pulled me. In just a couple of weeks I had lost over 20 pounds. Going into my first year in high school I had the assumption that it was gonna be ""my"" year. For perspective, when I first move someplace it usually takes about a year for me to become acclimated to my new environment. I was way off on this assumption, as looking back this may have been the worst year of my life. At that time I had already been dealing with a ton of acne, and at first this did not bother me sense I figured I was at least good looking enough to get by but as my acne continued to worsen I grew insecure. Nothing was working so my dermatologist suggested that I take Accutane which he described the ""nuclear bomb"" of acne treatment. I agreed and was confident at first sense it had work wonders on my sister who had also suffered from terrible acne. Treatment usually lasts only 3 months but can yield a lot of negative side effects such as depression. After 3 months my acne had gotten worse then it was before treatment started so we upped the dosage. I was on Accutane for 9 months and I was receiving three times the normal dosage on daily basis before I was taken off it. And still no progress was made. During the school day I would try to go to the bathroom as much as I could so that I could pick at my acne. Sometimes I'd sit there and pick at my face for so long I'd be late for class and forced to report to the nurses' office. I called home sick from the nurses' so many times that my mom thought I wasn't getting enough sleep so she took away my phone and grounded me for a month. While all this was happening my relationship with Ethan grew stronger. My friendship with him might've been the only positive that came from that year, and we'd hang out all throughout the day. But towards the end of that year Ethan got a girlfriend and we started to grow apart. He kept breaking promises that he'd hang out with me and only wanted to hang out when it was convenient to him. I was moving at the end of the year so I was ready to move on from Ethan and start fresh elsewhere. However, after school had ended Ethan broke up with his girlfriend and began to reel me back in. We repaired our friendship and remained bestfriends even after moving. I was thrown into 10th grade midway through 1st quarter in a school of 3,000 students. That being said, I found it hard to make friends this time around because of a combination of my declining mental health and everybody's impenetrable cliques. Even though my acne had disappeared before the start of 10th grade, I continued to pick at my skin even when nothing was there and I'd do it until I felt some false feeling of progress. I believe that I have developed a severe case of OCD although I'd never self diagnose myself as the stigma around people like that is one of the reasons I have yet to reach out for a professional opinion. That, and that it is a little embarrassing. The only reason I have the courage to post this is the shield of anonymity. I also believe I might have depression. I've been discontent for the last 3 years and I practically live in my head. I've never thought about harming myself but I have fantasized about harming others. I've never consider acting on these fantasies but I've not been able to tell anyone because I'm afraid they'll stick me somewhere I don't belong. Everyday I'd sit alone at lunch and I don't even have anyone from school I talk to at, or outside of school, let alone a friend. Sometimes I wish something terrible would happen to me so that I'd have an excuse for being such a fucking loser. The last 2 years all I've had is Ethan, and all though I've determined that he was never a good influence on me, he's all I've had to rely on for the past 2 years. About a year ago, Ethan blocked the friend he introduced me to back before 9th grade (Eric.) He gave no reason and seemingly did so out of nowhere. Sense then I'd been worried he do the same to me sense he had constantly been threatening to cut me out and even blocked me for three days as a joke and to see how I'd react. Finally, one day he randomly blocked me on all social media accounts. I thought I'd give him a week but even after then he had yet to unblock me. So I asked him on PlayStation, ""Bruh are you actually fr?"" and then, ""I'm sorry if I upset you in some way."" He surprised me by responding, ""Fuck off that was so condescending,"" and then blocked me on PlayStation. Ethan was the only person I've truly ever opened myself up to and he rejected me. I'm afraid if people know who I genuinely am they'll abandon me just like Ethan did. What I want to know is should I fake having similar beliefs as everyone else and conform my identity in order to form meaningful relationships that last and where do I go from here? If you somehow got through reading my ramblings I appreciate it.",27Sep2020,1
362,"As someone who recently overcame depression and anxiety, it kinda triggered me when the misunderstanding occurred and I felt like I had to be careful when explaining to him what I meant so I didn‚Äôt trigger him more. It was draining and tiring for me, especially since I just had a mock exam during that period. I might have had a panic attack. I told him not to talk to me about his depression and anxiety ever again and to not text me for the next week to let me rest and heal from what happened. Also, my major exams are coming up. 

He texted me that day asking me how I was. I kinda feel uncomfortable. Now he no longer teaches me. Is there any cons to me telling him to not text me again without explanation? 

Btw, the misunderstanding was him asking if he‚Äôd done anything to make me feel uncomfortable for the last two weeks. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs aware of other people‚Äôs personal space or boundaries so there has been some times when he (31M) came a bit too close for comfort when he was teaching me. So yes, he did. I didn‚Äôt know how to explain that so I asked my mom, who told me to tell him ‚Äúsometimes you‚Äôre a bit too close for comfort‚Äù and said he‚Äôll get the message. But he didn‚Äôt. I apologised for not being as straight forward (I wanted to be at the start and just say that he invaded my personal space and sometimes comes a little too close so I‚Äôd appreciate him keeping his distance) and was straight forward to him after that.

He mentioned (and I agree) that he doesn‚Äôt know how to gauge personal boundaries and personal space or what makes people feel uncomfortable or not. 

He told me to tell him whenever I feel uncomfortable and I agreed to do so so when I respond to his message, I think I‚Äôll do that. 

I am a student and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate for teachers or adults (30+M) to tell young students (16F) about their mental health. I‚Äôve told him not to talk to me about it ever again and at least he respected that. 

As a teenager below 18, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for me to be put into this situation. He might think of me as a friend but I think of him as a teacher. He is also an adult, I shouldn‚Äôt feel weary when talking to him so he doesn‚Äôt do anything reckless. I am not responsible for his emotions and he has mentioned that as well. As a person, I believe it is in my right to stop any relationships that make me feel uncomfortable without needing to explain myself. 

Should I just tell him to stop talking to me straight up?

367,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I (28M - nonbinary) am friends with a guy (29M) who avoids confrontation at all costs. He's the sort of person who is always positive and cheerful, always plays videogames, doesn't talk about his problems or feelings etc.

These are traits I love about him, but there is a negative consequence from his attitude; miscommunication, and the lack thereof, which lately has been negatively affecting our friendship.

To provide the most recent example, last week we were chatting as usual, I shared some personal difficult stuff and he said something that sounded very hurtful and insensitive to me. So I tried to discuss this with him, shared my POV, to try and clear things out.

He used to begrudgingly be semi willing to talk it out whenever a similar situation happened in the past, but last week he told me he is unwilling to do so anymore. That it really upsets him that I keep bringing up ""negative"" stuff and doesn't want to have these sort of ""bad"" conversations again because he is a ""drama free"" person who stays away from negative people.

That's something I understand and can relate to, but I also told him that it's just not reasonable for him to expect us to never argue about anything. Disagreements and misunderstandings happen sometimes. You can't just avoid confrontation with others forever.

If he says something hurtful, am I supposed to pretend it isn't and/or keep my hurt to myself just so that he doesn't get upset either? What are we, children? Adults should be able to have adult conversations IMO.

He won't listen though, has been quiet and avoiding the matter all week and I don't know how to get through to him. Should I insist on the importance of communicating for the sake of our friendship? What can I do to salvage it?

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated. I asked on [r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/) twice but got no answers, and I just asked on r/relationships too.

Man.. you‚Äôve been through so much more than that and it‚Äôs a small dust compared to your current situation deeply inhale and slowly exhale, control your breathing and ask yourself again, IS IT SOMETHING THAT i need to be worried about or stressed? Will it have a huge impact on me in 10 years? I don‚Äôt think so.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to be yourself if someone is yelling at you etc it is their problems not yours if a human is yelling for example it means he‚Äôs psychologically week and been hurt a lot and it isn‚Äôt your fault and you have nothing to do with it, if they‚Äôre using offensive words against you it‚Äôs their problem and I promise I promise you 100% they don‚Äôt understand what can happened because of their actions in the future also they think that it‚Äôs normal because they‚Äôre in a really really low point in life and actually everything they say they don‚Äôt mean it, yes you can ask them do you really mean it? Most likely they‚Äôll reply YES, but it‚Äôs not true. Day is smarter than night as you already have noticed whenever it‚Äôs a day time everything‚Äôs seems so easier and your brain in functioning better, whenever it‚Äôs a night time it feels like everything‚Äôs different, if you‚Äôre ill or have a fewer at night everything‚Äôs gets more complicated the temperature goes up etc and it‚Äôs just an example. DAY is better than NIGHT, DAY is smarter than NIGHT.  And remember that if you know you‚Äôre right about something don‚Äôt you ever let some stupid people let you down, they have problems and you have nothing to do with it, and I repeat NOTHING IS YOUR FAULT. 

Whenever you‚Äôre stressed try to calm down as much as you can, why? It‚Äôs not only bad for your health but also when you‚Äôre stressed you‚Äôll mess up things you‚Äôre doing whether you‚Äôre working something or cleaning a room, you‚Äôll 100% forget something and you‚Äôll make it not the way you planned it, it can be the simplest thing you can think of, and later you‚Äôll get even more nervous about it trust me. Also your lay your hands in the air it‚Äôll show you about your inner situation whether you‚Äôre stressed or something else, you can slowly work your way up to fix things up.

Everything I wrote here is from my life experience and it‚Äôll help for everyone who‚Äôll want this to work, if you‚Äôll believe in it you‚Äôll see that you‚Äôre much more stronger than you think :)

Life is beautiful don‚Äôt get fooled

371,"I‚Äôm creating this to gain a third party view on the situation. I will be recalling the most notable events. 

I attend high school, and we will call her Z.
I‚Äôve known her for about 5-6 years, sat next to her in a few lessons (seating plan) throughout some of those years. We wouldn‚Äôt really talk much outside of school. I‚Äôm a pretty quiet guy. 

Then around a year ago, there was a period of time where she would always say hi, or hello to me. The moment I saw her, i knew she was going to greet me, I usually replied hello/hi, and we never really stopped to talk as we were both with our friends. (So yeah, she was with her friends, I was with mine, and when walking past eachother, she‚Äôd say hi to me) I never initiated the greet, she would always say it first. (Lmao am I a pussy or a dumbfuck for not doing it first atleast once) Eventually this stopped.

She was in my physics, biology and chemistry class. She sat opposite me in biology, and we would talk occasionally, it wasn‚Äôt often though. I must also mention that she had one of her closest friends in that class, and I sat next to her close friend, J, in physics. Z and J would often mess around, like try take eachothers rulers/pencil cases etc. Z would often reach across me to take J‚Äôs stuff. One time Z was walking past, quickly, and bumped into the side of me, and then apologised like she‚Äôd just stabbed me. So she apologised, and then walked away, later came back, and apologised again. Questionable to how sorry she was? Lmao, normally somebody may just say sorry once and that‚Äôd be the end. 

Now corona came along in March, and schools shut. I hadn‚Äôt talked to her until June/July when her birthday came, and it was just a simple happy birthday, replied with a Thankyou and a few hearts. (Standard) 

Then came the end of august. We had our exam results, and many people were changing schools. So I randomly messaged her asking if she‚Äôs still going to the same school and what subjects she‚Äôd be taking. She replied saying that‚Äôs she‚Äôs going to the same school, and listed the subjects; she then asked ‚Äúwbu, wait lemme guess what your taking‚Äù looking at this from a phycological point, most people would have stopped at the ‚Äúwbu‚Äù but she stopped herself, and tried to guess. (She was very wrong lmao) [point I‚Äôm making is, chances of somebody stopping themselves and guessing instead aren‚Äôt big] the conversation continued hours throughout the day. 

Then came my birthday, school has started, and she wishes me a happy birthday, and reply thanking her with a few hearts (standard), and then it would end there right? Well, she replied yw/your welcome followed by some hearts. [now I understand that some people reply yw, but most people I know don‚Äôt, and especially don‚Äôt send hearts with it] 

Now schools started, School is massive, and you can come and go anytime you want, so it‚Äôs pretty hard to find her/anyone, and when I do see her, she‚Äôs always with her friends, and I‚Äôm with mine. And I‚Äôm not about to walk up to her and start talking to her whilst she‚Äôs with her group of friends and I‚Äôm with mine. I try though, just a bit hard to execute irl. 

Now I understand that I might be looking into it too much, but I‚Äôm a quiet guy, I don‚Äôt usually go out of my way to talk to people I don‚Äôt really like. But Ay, when I‚Äôm talking it‚Äôs great lmao. 
A few years ago, I also had thought she may have had a crush on me. But ultimately, I‚Äôm at school to get A‚Äôs. The way I see it is, relationships are a hinderance to education, and ain‚Äôt nobody gonna stop me getting A‚Äôs
I don‚Äôt see her as a potential crush/gf, I just wanna be closer friends I guess.

My older brother (2years) molested and sexually abused me for 6 years and just the other day he was tried and sentenced to jail (120days) in youth court (adult court hasn't happened yet) and I was so relieved that I didn't have to deal with him anymore!

But my SiL now lives with me in my parent's place cause  she's foreign and was financially dependent of him.

I just don't know what to do, I felt ecstatic when I heard BB's verdict, but now I have to deal with her crying and comforting her.

374,"I'm a senior in high school. About 10 months ago, I got into a huge fight with my parents over grades. I was getting all B's. I was trying my hardest, but they kept saying that I was slacking. I felt depressed and just wanted to run away. Is this a normal interaction to have with them?",27Sep2020,1
375,"It seems I have reached the proverbial late-20's fork in the road. 

I'm 29M, unmarried (gf of 1 year), no kids, travel a good bit for work, and can choose whichever path I want. I'd like some input please from anyone who's been here before me.

I was born and raised in a small town in Pennsylvania but moved away after college. This spring will make 7 years that I've been gone. I've lived in the southeast, I've lived in California, and I've lived in the PNW. I've had a solid run - and while I'm not done traveling by any means, I'm getting to the point where I would like to set up a home base that I can come home to after traveling and start investing my time &amp; efforts into the people and culture around me. 

My 10-year old self has always dreamt of buying a piece of property in the west and starting a family out there. Nothing too extravagant. A place in a valley close to the mountains where I could raise a family with rivers, mountains, and wildlife as their playground. Outdoors are a big passion of mine so I would fit right at home.

On the other hand, with the exception of my only sibling and his wife living in Montana, the rest of my family all still live in Pennsylvania. I'm turning 30 in a month, I'm starting to think about my parents getting older and my cousins all having kids of their own. My hangup is I'm afraid to move home and regret not giving the mountains and the west a fair shake. Sure, it would be easy to be close to family, and sure its familiar - but what's the better option? Not to mention, I never wanted to be one of those who said ""Its too hard out here, I'm moving home.""

I know that I don't get the option of not paying a price, but - I'd really love to hear from anyone whose made a decision like this already and if you'll share how it turned out? 

TL, DR - Move back to my home state (Family, familiar, affordable) OR go after my childhood dream of planting roots in the west.

376,"I used to have a best friend. we stopped being best friends because I thought she was very toxic for me. whenever we would talk it would always be about her and how she felt, what she watched, what was going on in her life. I started to feel invisible. what made things worse was that because we were often seen together some people would actually call me by her name. 

I can't necessarily avoid her because we are still in the same class at school. But that was just a background. 

When quarantine began in March I figured I still needed to keep up with my studies and I implored someone to do it with. she is not a stranger but she is in my class as well. I didn't talk to her much but I thought, well why not study with her as it would be beneficial for us both. so I contacted her and we started motivating each other to study and what not, also asking each other questions.

We became pretty close and because we were both getting pretty sad being locked up in our houses with nothing to do but be confronted by our problems (lol), I shared my feelings with her about how I felt about my friendship situation and how It had such a huge impact on me. She sympathised with me and told me about how she barely even knew my best friend but what transpired between us was sad. We became really close after that day of sharing.

Whenever I would have a song I liked I'd send it to her and she'd do the same. Whenever I had a meme I loved I would send it over and she'd laugh. If she had some interesting story she'd tell me. We'd talk about our problems... In my country they opened schools up at some point so I was happy to have something to do with myself. At school everything was fine for sometime, then my new friend (let's call her 'Jane') started hanging out with my old best friend (let's call her 'Ann'). They got really close and even hang out without me. I was bothered about it at first but I got over it because I know I can't stop someone from talking to who they want to talk to. 

Fast forward, It became her that would mostly talk about her feelings because I do find it hard to talk about myself and my feelings. it was just easier conversing with a stranger at the time. But I would tell her things from time to time, i would go to her house to study but she would never come to mine. She said she would someday but the day she did come was not necessarily to see me so she left as quickly as she arrived.

Anyway, there was a day I asked her about something and she told me she would give me answer on it. Almost ten hours had passed and she finally texted back. She had spent most of that time talking to Ann on some long ass call. I got mad and I replied to two questions she asked with short answers and she said bye to me.

When we opened school again she just avoided eye contact  and stopped talking to me. It bums me out that I finally opened up to someone and they were so okay with throwing the friendship away. Jane and Ann are now extremely close now and it hurts my feelings.  How do I handle this?",27Sep2020,1

379,"this will be my first time posting on here &amp; I really dont talk to anybody, talk to family or go out so thats why im here asking for others opinions.

me and my daughters mother ended things 2 months after our daughter was born, it was a hard time for the  both of us, I was working three jobs while renting out an apartment just so i can create the family that iv imagined but working three jobs and with relationship complications it wasnt working out, I was 21 at the time and I felt burnt out.
Anyways, a little after we broke things off iv started to notice changes within my ex.. her personality was changing and her physical image was changing so I just had this gut feeling that shes on something &amp; i suspected drugs as the only cause because of the people she was hanging around, i knew what they were into.

I wanted her to get help &amp; i tried to be there for her but she wouldnt accept and would deny accusations for about a year my ex' s mom would call me asking where my ex is at... she was always running away until one day she left for good &amp; it has been about a year since anybody has seen her or heard from her..
every now and then id reach out to people and  they gave me information on where she could be so I went to some cross roads to ask around and one kid was familiar with her &amp; he said that she comes around very often so I was like ""cool, shes still alive"" and that gives me hope to keep going out there to find her to get her help but the thing is.. that everybody tells me ""
let it go, to focus on myself and if she wants help she will get it""
but i think that's pretty selfish to do to somebody iv know for years.

what should I do? let her go and focus on myself or try one last time?",27Sep2020,1

389,"For context, i‚Äôm a South-Asian female, immigrated to North America when i was 3. I was raised pretty traditionally for a south-asian immigrant family - parents busy at work to make sure we had a house and food, and being emotionally and physically abused for being a fat, not number one in the class student. 

i was constantly put down, insulted, compared with cousins (im an only child). if my dad hit me it was because i majorly fucked up and if my mom hit me i was just being bad. it was mainly slaps, punches, sometimes groping, and the occasional pinching/ squeezing their fingernails into my hand or arm. i was abused from whatever age i was old enough to remember (probably 3) until about 16/17.  I know my upbringing isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs considered normal in western culture but it‚Äôs kinda common for south asian parents.  

The part that makes me guilty is hitting my mom back was the only way I could get her to listen to me. This was when i was about 17-18. If she said i had to do something even though it was unfair or uncomfortable for me, i‚Äôd slap or shove her to make her understand my opinion/standing was strong. I know that‚Äôs fucked up, i know.  

At the time, i considered it to be okay kinda like tit for tat. i never noticed but i‚Äôve basically stopped now and don‚Äôt exactly know when or why or how but i don‚Äôt hit her anymore. if we disagree i tell her about something i tell her she doesn‚Äôt get to have an opinion about me or my body or my preferences.  however, i look back and i wonder what was wrong with me that i felt the need to hit her ? when i disagree with friends or other people with authority i usually go quiet and just let it be but with her i get aggressive ? why ?  

idk i just feel like i need to talk to her about what has happened to me and to her but i know that she will only see that what she did was proper south asian parenting and what i did was rebellious and makes me a bad daughter. i really don‚Äôt wanna bring it up now but i also wanna somehow make it up to her?",27Sep2020,1

(it is legal in my country) It was an awkward interaction and one of his friends introduced him to me. After the party, he texted me on ig and after talking for 3 days, I agreed to go out with him. The thing is, our ""dates"" took place only in his car and at night. His friends know about me but he still doesn't want to be seen together in public. We live in a small town and people talk. I don't really care about the gossip but he does. It won't be easy for me either since I have to tell my family about him. It bothers me because I feel that he's ashamed with me because of the age gap. He's very sweet and we clicked on our first date but I can't get over the fact that we have to hide. I'm not saying that I want to be affectionate in public but we could at least go out for a cup of coffee.

We agreed to just be friends for a while but we behave like a couple when we are alone. Also, he admitted that he acts differently because I'm 6 years younger than him. I'm mature for my age and I had an almost 3 year relationship before him. I date to marry because otherwise I date for a heartbreak. I don't want to waste my youth on someone who is ashamed with me. I'm thinking about giving him an ultimatum to make up his mind about me. I don't want to invest energy and time in a dead-end pseudo-relationship without knowing that we both will get accostumed with the gossip and have a committed relationship. He has a baby face so he looks just 2-3 years older than me.

What do you think? Should I focus on my studies and tell him to just have a platonic relationship or be patient with him to get accostumed to the idea? I really like spending time with him but I don't know if he's worth the effort

392,"I‚Äôm a 30 year old who has spent most his life hanging with a small group of friends or keeping to himself and has never been in a relationship. I‚Äôve always, always my whole life, been afraid of people. It started from an early age of being made fun of and growing up from a poor family, leading to a shitty, worthless view of myself. Getting laughed at and looked down on stopped as I got older, but the past still haunts me. My fear of people has basically become a part of my identity.

Well, I‚Äôm tired of it. I want to get to know people, go on dates, and try new things. Most of my friends have basically settled down with someone and rarely go out or want to go out to do anything, leaving me to get over this fear alone. Even when I talk to them I get nervous and shaky if it‚Äôs our first meeting of the day until I settle down and get comfortable. Does this happen to anyone else?

How do I approach people without looking like some weirdo? I‚Äôd love to make more guy friends and especially more girl friends because I‚Äôm extra nervous around them, even ones I‚Äôm not attracted to. Even if I do manage to strike up a conversation with someone, I never understood eye contact. Stare too long and you‚Äôre creepy. Stare not enough or look away too much and you‚Äôre still either creepy or uninterested. So where are you supposed to look then? People are hard.

I hear searching for groups and meetups was a good way to meet new people, but I cant find anything like that anywhere near me. Over the past year, little by little, I‚Äôve been liking myself more and more, but using dating apps and getting weird looks from people I try to talk to and making the situation awkward has been bringing me back into this sort of negative self-image. I‚Äôm in a dark place right now and feel hopeless. Ive tried therapy many times over the course of my life but it‚Äôs never helped. I don‚Äôt know how asking random people on the internet will help, but at this point Ive got nothing to lose and text is far less scary.

If anyone has any tips or tricks on where I should go from here, Id greatly appreciate it. If anything thank you for listening to my story.",27Sep2020,1

I've eventually decided that marketing seems to be the perfect major for me, I loved its combination of design, psychology, business, and critical thinking. My parents approved too right until the college's majors guide called my parents saying it's bizarre for someone with a high GPA to want to study the marketing major, apparently the stereotype is those who flunked high school would choose marketing due to the lack of maths and science. They told me to reconsider my choice and instead look towards the engineering and medical majors, both which I have ZERO interests in. I cannot see myself doing either of those for the next decades of my life, and doubt having decent grades if I chose one of those two fields. I always fail and lose motivation to study something that doesn't interest me.",27Sep2020,1

Lady: Hi there we are here because your smoke alarm gave us a notification that it was off.
(I had no clue it did that) 
Me: Oh okay my bad I‚Äôll put it back up
At this point the lights are on and I just now notice how foggy my room is.
Security: Are y‚Äôall smoking weed in here? It‚Äôs legal but not on campus.
Me: no we smoked off campus then came back
Security: so what‚Äôs the smoke
Me: sorry we vape 
(No central air and the windows were closed. Dumb I know)
Security: well those aren‚Äôt allowed on campus either.
Me: Oh okay my bad
Lady: you guys are also not allowed to have this candle 
Security: is it to cover up the smell of weed?
Me: no I thought it smelt nice

They ended up not going around my room but they took my candle. Smell is not sufficient evidence for weed you have to be caught with it. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm in the clear or not so if y‚Äôall would let me know how I should go about this.",27Sep2020,1
396,"Long story but, I left my hometown in Greece. When I used to live there and as a child me and my mother were estranged and I was ignored and pushed away by my uncle/ aunty and cousins, never talked to them and when I come back we never talk. We live right next to each other.

Last summer my younger cousin got into a serious motorbike accident and was in a coma. Anyway, he was sent from Athens back to my hometown recently which I am now visiting. He is left in a wheelchair and has brain damage and can't talk, apparently the doctors said he will recover a little bit but it will take time, but being around familiar settings and ppl will help him. 
I wish I could visit but our families have made it so we are basically strangers. I am very sad that this happened to him , he's a year younger than me (22) and it is such a tragic shame out of the blue. 
I don't really want to interact with the family in general but as cousins we never did much to each other ( neither friendly or hostile). 

I just want to show that besides the bullshit I am thinking of him and them and this tragedy in good heart. What could I give as a gift etc in this situation? 
My mother said they would appreciate if I gave them a visit but I feel so awkward as it would be the first time I'd have talked to them in more than I can remember. I don't even know if he can eat to maybe bring some nice chocolates or something. Maybe it's the action that counts.

That's all I have thought to give, some chocolates, maybe flowers? a gift basket with soaps? lol idk I just keep thinking about it and the situation sucks. It doesn't feel right to not do anything even if we are estranged.

TLDR; Cousin got into a motorbike accident, our families are estranged and hostile but I want to show respects someway.",27Sep2020,1

Give me advice plz from a guys point of view!

So just over a year ago I met this guy at a festival. We got each other‚Äôs snap but never messaged, until one time I messaged first (I waited until I turned 18), then we started talking and then met up again a week later. We hung out a few times after that but only at night. And he only messages me around midnight on weekends. Then a few months later we meet up again. After that a week later he unadds me on Snapchat. Lol I did care but then got over it cause like I guess we both didn‚Äôt really know each other that well and there wasn‚Äôt anything there (like he‚Äôd even show me his tinder and tell me things he‚Äôs done with other girls- I feel as though maybe that‚Äôs his personality type though he‚Äôs just so honest about everything). So I unadded his number and everything cause like I don‚Äôt want to ever see him again. But he messaged me last night asking me what‚Äôs going on. Like does he realise that he‚Äôs unadded me? Or what? Like I‚Äôm just so confused like I read his message and didn‚Äôt reply cause I don‚Äôt want to be hurt by him when I was the one who initially reached out but yeah. Any advice? And maybe reasons why people do that? Like why unadd me get message my number after a few months? Like whattttt shit confused me üòí Like does he just want my body?

Also I forgot to mention the first time after we hung out he did tell me he wanted to get to know me more which I did as well. And then that‚Äôs when COVID came along then when he messaged me a few months back he only wanted to have fun times. Then after he unadded me on snap he messaged me last night.

403,"So I was raped repeatedly by my ex husband over 4 years ago. It took me a couple years to even believe I'd been raped, but when I was finally able to accept what happened and I told my friends, they didn't believe me and stood with my rapist instead. We had the same friend group, and I was totally ostracised. 

I had a close friend who wasn't part of that friend group, and when I told her she hugged me and told me she'd come back and see me soon. She didn't, I didnt hear from her for months, and when I asked her why she never came back she told me she didn't remember our conversation taking place.

We were really close before that. She even lived with me for a while. She recently got my number (from my rapist, no less) and texted me asking me to get in contact with her. I ignored it. 

I'm torn. I miss her. But I don't know if I can get in contact with her. I was totally abandoned when I really needed my friends, and I have a lot of resentment. I loved those guys like family and they all just.. left. And hated on me. She didn't hate on me at all, but I felt the abandonment deeply.

I am crazy good at my job. I‚Äôve only been doing this since march minus three months in the middle where I had a fulfill a different commitment at a previous job (but that isn‚Äôt relevant). 

My manager is looking at me for a lead position, and so are a few of his current leads who see potential in me. I would love the job. I would manage a store and the people in it, I would get paid more, and have more opportunity to move up the company. But. I am pretty serious about my not working time. I have boundaries with work and I don‚Äôt like them to invade on my personal life. 

So this morning I have a choice to make. There is an online meeting this morning where the district talks about the new deals of the week so everyone is on the same page. I wouldn‚Äôt go to it usually because this morning I am not scheduled and it is at the same time as my church service (which happens to be the first one since covid started.) My faith is very important to me, more than this job is actually. My boss knows I go to church Sunday mornings so I am not put on the schedule until noon, but he sent me the link to the online meeting in an email and posted it in our district chat. 

Should I go? Or should I let it slide and assume he sent it to everyone‚Äôs email, not expecting the off people to join? The reason I mentioned the lead position is that the job is very hands on. You need to be reachable at any point in the day I think, and this could show him that I am willing to do that. Or I can just not go because I am not on the schedule.

Way before I even met my boyfriend and him knowing this always made him feel uncomfortable. But I always assured him that nothing would ever happen again.

I just brought a concern over my dad on the phone about a friend. We'll call her T. Yesterday I was at a friend birthday party. T told us (there were two friends there as well) that her mum had been giving her Korean diet pills, and she's hasn't been feeling well. We were concerned and asked if she told her mum about the side effect. T told us that her mum knows, that she wanted her to lose weight. T and her grandmother were feeling a bit shady with her mum giving her these diet pills. T doesn't want to take any more of the pills but her mum demand that she takes those pills. T planed on flushing some of the pills down the toilet. 

Today I called my dad, telling him I'm a bit concerned of T's health. My dad said that it none of my business, that this is T choice to make to how to deal with it, or confront her mum about. How that T's mum is trying to help her fit into society. And he said that none of this would have happened if I had just moved out with my brother. That I chose to stay with my mum, and that it her house. Because of that there was no way I could give T a room and help her. 

I'm feeling conflicted and upset. I know I can't do much but why does my dad has to always reminded me that it my fault for choosing to stay with my mum? And it always hurt so much that he kept reminding me. He always ridicule me for being negative and pessimistic. I kept trying to remind him that I am not him. I can't be what he want me to be.

417,"I just don't like my dad. He's not abusive or has a criminal background or anything like that, but I just constantly feel myself butting heads with him. My relationship with him is very painful. Every time I hear the sound of his footsteps, I get massive anxiety, because I know he is going to lecture me or find fault with me. My dad is also very disfigured. He has a fat, weird face, lots of wrinkles, thick thighs, a large potbelly, and he's bald. He has anger issues as well. Every time he is angry, he stomps around the house and punches his chest. It's so annoying when he does that.

And he also has terrible habits. When he eats a muffin, he tears it up into tiny pieces, which absolutely disgusts me. He slurps all the time, and when eats dinner, he often sits in front of the TV and eats with his bare hands. If it's something like a lasagna or pasta, he often spills the food on his clothes or on the floor. He continues to wear his stained clothes, and it makes me cringe in disgust. When he finishes eating, he literally puts the dirty silverware back in the cupboard without even bothering to wash it. Same thing with a mug that he just drank soda or coffee out of. My mom has addressed this behavior at least 1000 times, but my dad never does anything to fix himself, and it gets on everyone's nerves.

He also overcomplicates everything. When I was learning addition in 1st grade, my dad explained it to me using calculus. No, just kidding. But he still makes everything really complicated for no reason. For example, the day after I got my permit, he took me to an empty parking lot to drive. The first thing he wanted me to do was practice parallel parking. At that point I couldn't even park regularly or drive in a straight line. Are you joking? Or maybe a doorknob is broken, and he has to inspect literally miles of drywall before he starts fixing the doorknob. Right now I am in the process of applying to college, and my dad makes me create a Google sheet with all the information about colleges, like if they have any supplemental essays or require SAT scores. Come on, it's on the common application, it's on the college website. He's just trying to make my life complicated. He makes everything too complex. When we go shopping, he often goes from store to store buying stuff just to make his total costs go up to something like $50 or $100. He says it's easier for doing the tax stuff, but it's honestly bad for my mental health and the environment.

Also, I don't want to end up like my dad in terms of career. My dad works as a civil engineer, which I think will be extremely boring. I hate designing things or engineering in general. I'd rather be an English teacher, because I feel like that is my passion and my calling in life. However, I don't know how to tell my dad that.

420,"Hello Advice! My work colleagues and I have been dealing with an issue for quite some time and I'd like some advice on how to handle the situation. I work at one of the largest companies in Australia as an overnight stock replenisher. As a part-time employee, we will get scheduled shifts from say 8pm-1am. As the years go by, the company is expecting more and more work to be done while simultaneously reducing our hours (if this is relevant...the company has made massive profits during the pandemic). This ultimately leads us to having work still left to do at the end of the night; and this is where advice is needed. The managers of the store expect us to stay back, for free, until the entire store has been filled and tidied up and argue that if we leave at the end of our shift with work still to do that we are not doing our jobs properly. Do you think this is a reasonable request? I personally feel as though if I put in a good effort and work efficiently (which I always do, we have a specific minimum fill rate which I always exceed) then I should not feel bad about leaving on time as I have done my job and completed what I can in my rostered hours and also there are many employees that work much slower than me. However I can see where tension rises because any work that has not been completed, the manager needs to stay back and complete.

\*I plan on leaving in 2 months when I finish university anyways so this is more advice for my colleagues than for myself as it doesn't matter too much for me, but will still be good advice for any future jobs!

428,"I started a new job a year ago....I am a realtor, I‚Äôve had my license for about five years with moderate success. During that time I also ran a bar and grill. One of my regulars owned/owns a decently successful property management company. Roughly one year ago I got a message from his wife asking if I knew a licensed realtor that might be interested in working with him as a property manager. Knowing I couldn‚Äôt run the restaurant forever I figured it would be worth setting down and speaking with him. We had several great meetings and settled in a decent base salary plus bonus program and the commission split for real estate was better than where I currently was. Sounds great right? Well here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm not sure what to do. After my first month of ‚Äúhitting the bonus‚Äù his memory of the bonus structure and mine were different. (It was a small change but it frustrated me) I knew the potential for income was decent enough I didn‚Äôt think I should cause an issue over it. However this sparked enough in me that I asked we get my job description and pay contract finalized. (Things got busy and we never actually put pen to paper) well in the last month he sent me my contract and the commission split was absolutely horrendous, like worse than a new agent would get anywhere. I went to him and told him what I thought needed to change and we ‚Äúagreed‚Äù on a new split. He reworked the contract and it is better but only for ‚Äúmy past clients‚Äù is my split higher.

431,"Backstory: My sister has had many issues growing up. She is a very sensitive person and internalizes a lot of her problems. However, it seems she does the opposite of this when she is around her family or people she trusts to vent to. Consequently, my sister usually vents once a week in the form of an hour long temper tantrum. This has gone on since she was a young child and the behavior has not ceased even to this day. My mom is left trying to calm her down out of the state but she usually makes it worse. My mom recently got over breast cancer, but she is still on a chemo pill which causes severe brain fog and makes her err a lot in whatever she does. My sister and my mom share the kitchen, and whenever my mom does anything that ticks her off (which is inevitable because of the chemo) my sister goes into her tantrum state again. This all amounts to at minimum 3 hour-long temper tantrums a week (as well as constant nitpicking) where my mom is left to try to calm her down. Also, my sister is extremely controlling and just an overall toxic person. 

I worry for my mom. She rarely gets above 5 hours of sleep each night despite allotting double the time. Most days she is a zombie, living in fear of when my sister will throw her next tantrum, or criticize her every move. Having had cancer, all this stress cannot be good for her.

I also worry about how this has affected me as an individual. From a very young age I would keep myself locked in my room crying myself to sleep because I could not find peace in my home. I wanted her to be quiet, but she hardly ever was. When I was real young, I was a much more social kid, but throughout elementary, middle, and high school, I went back into my shell and became the kid who never spoke. 

Whenever I try to speak up and handle the situation so my mom doesn‚Äôt have to, she is always unreceptive. If I even go as far as to say a word, my sister‚Äôs tantrum will get even worse because she doesn‚Äôt want me involved and she doesn‚Äôt want to face the fact that I hear her screaming and yelling. 

She has gotten therapy. A lot of it in fact. But I‚Äôm afraid all the therapy was useful for is giving her the strength to show her face around her family after a huge tantrum without feeling bad. It‚Äôs kind of fucked up.

Fast forward to today: My family decided yesterday that we were going to order breakfast and my dad would pick it up and bring it back home. My sister knew about this. But for some reason, at four in the morning (my sister wakes up really early), she realized that we were also getting a food delivery today and we shouldn‚Äôt be ordering food when we have a surplus at home. My mom told her that we already ordered the breakfast. It was only 16 dollars for the whole family. But this was sufficient reason for my sister to get ticked off because she is very worried about finances even though we are not too poor. Around 4:15 I hear a door slam. That woke me up to a very groggy state. Then ten minutes later comes the yelling and screaming. I have an interview Monday and I heard that the amount of rest you get two nights before a big event is very impactful in how you‚Äôll do (even more so than the night before). So when I heard her scream, I immediately rose out of my bed and yelled for her to be quiet because I needed more sleep. This did not work. Instead, she told my mom to stop trying to console her because it was apparently MY MOM‚Äôs fault that my sister was throwing this tantrum at 4 in the morning!

It was not. It never is. She will do anything but blame herself for her behavior. She is a grown woman, but she can‚Äôt control her actions.

Anyway, she continued to yell and scream and I decided to stay awake and work on schoolwork. But this time I lost it. I‚Äôm done with her horrible treatment of my mother. I‚Äôm done with her toxicity. I don‚Äôt know what to do though. I‚Äôve been refusing to be in the same room as her and acting hostile. From what I can tell, this doesn‚Äôt even shake her. I wanted to text her that I hate her and that I hope she knows that, but I deleted it and didn‚Äôt send it. I‚Äôm not the type of person to do that.

I don‚Äôt have the money to move out, especially now with the virus. I‚Äôm a college student so I need to stay here unless I want to go into major debt.

Do you all have any advice for what I should do? Should I continue to act hostile toward my sister? Should I act like everything is fine? How can I protect my mom from all this stress?

Thank you for reading this. Sorry the post is a little sloppy, I just wrote this all just now.

Tldr: My sister is woke me up at 4 screaming about minutia. I have dealt with this my whole life. So has my mom, who recently got over cancer. I don‚Äôt know what to do- can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to move out, can‚Äôt intervene, etc.",27Sep2020,1

Ginger Cat
12 years old
Weight: not sure
Neutered: ?


So my family isn‚Äôt very good when it comes to pets, so lately I‚Äôve been the one to make sure that the animals are taken care of. 

Recently my dog passed away due to cancer that was found right before he died, so now I‚Äôve been worried about my cat‚Äôs health and want to schedule an appointment. 

However, the last time he saw a vet was several years ago, so I‚Äôm a little worried about what do do when they ask about his medical records because I‚Äôm not sure if he even has any. 

My main concern right now is that he has an upper respiratory infection because he hasn‚Äôt been meowing as much and when he purrs it sounds muffled a bit. He also has had a runny nose most of the time. But on top of the main concern, I have other things to bring up as well that I think should be looked at. 

So, is there anything I should be aware of when it comes to making an appointment for him? I‚Äôve been to the vet a few times for my dog, so I have an idea, but after running into some problems with how things were run at that clinic, I feel like it‚Äôs best to relocate to a different one for my cat (basically, they would rush me through every appointment with my dog, and not even perform a thorough check up, which left me feeling like I need to find a new clinic where hopefully my cat will be given the right amount of attention instead in case something is wrong). 


So, is there anything I should be aware of before or during the appointment?",27Sep2020,1

434,"Some context: I have a mate of whom I have been friends with for 10+ years. In the early years of our friendship we used to banter and have a joke around all the time. The last couple of years he has changed for what I believe to be the worse. Now, in his defense he has had a rough go of it. He went through a messy divorce and custody battle which is now resolved and afterwards had a string of toxic relationships. Now days he is the type of guy to be submissive and let others order him around with very little resistance. He seems to fear being alone which I think is why he rushes into these relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now days he just gets offended over everything, even when something isn't directed at him he takes offense to it. Not only that but he is a pathological liar without realizing he is. He seems to be so afraid of disapproval and disagreement that he will tell people EXACTLY what they want to hear despite believing the opposite. He whinges non stop about the current relationship he is in but refuses to take accountability for it or take advice from our friend circle. Our friends have outright told him that we don't want to hear it anymore and he stopped speaking to us for a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried addressing these issues with him multiple times but he denies any of it and... you guessed it, he takes offense to it. He also insists that he ""used"" to act this way but no longer does even though friends of ours have mentioned it to him also. Grading is a word I would use to describe this situation.

435,"I started an online craft business about a month ago. It‚Äôs not making me rich but it‚Äôs going ok. My best friend of 20 years recently suggested that I make a certain product. He even went and bought materials to help me make the product and has been helping me. The product has been selling pretty well now. When we went to discuss how to split the earnings he demanded that he get 50% and wants access (passwords) to my webpage. I do not believe he deserves that. I counter offered at 40%. The reason he does not deserve half is because I do much more than him. I am the accountant, booker keeper, marketing, communications, shipping and packaging, editing and printing, and drive to his house every day to make the product, which I could do at my house. He helps in manufacturing only. Yes it was his idea but he also uses my webpage to sell the product which wouldn‚Äôt have even sold if it wasn‚Äôt for the following I gathered through hard work. I do not believe he is entitled to half. This is costing me my friendship now. What do I do?

438,"I'd like to reach out to a guy I went out with twice 5 years ago. At the time i didn't realize I was not ready to be dating, my husband had passed away 3 months prior to me meeting this guy when I was 53.

I was at dinner with 2 friends. I got there early, went to the bar and ordered a drink. He was having dinner at the bar. My friends arrived, we got our table, ordered drinks and dinner. After a little bit of time the waitress brought over drinks for us and a note for me. It said if I was not attached he'd like to get to know me,  he thought i was lovely. I certainly enjoyed the moment and put the card in my wallet. The guy left the bar.

The next day I was taking my daughter to a bereavement camp to help her with the loss of her dad. While I was there I met other young widows.  We talked about our experiences and dating came up. I told them about the dinner. When they asked what i was going to do, I said nothing. Dating had not entered my mind. The consensus from the group was there was no time line to follow and there was no right or wrong way to do this. After thinking about it for a couple days I texted him. I explained about the loss of my husband and was not sure about dating. He shared he understood loss, having tragically lost a child 10 yrs prior. We texted back and forth. I decided to go out with him. We ended up going out twice. We had a good time both times. As I was leaving the 2nd date he started talking about an event he'd like to invite me to.  All of a sudden I was nervous, I didn't really say much and awkwardly left. Next day I apologized for my abrupt departure.

441,"Hi, all.

I have a job that I'm working from home, usually between the hours of 6:30 and 4. I usually go to bed no later than 10, I set a boundary to be off the grid by 9ish every night. There are some days where I'll be on the phone for the entire 5 hours of downtime, and I'm often finding I have to prioritize people( family members over friends, for instance) when the calls come piling in, often around the same time because most folks know my general work schedule by now. These are tough times, and I am often the one people call to vent to--that's the dynamic I have with quite a few people. Some of them can and will return the favor if I need it, and some of them won't or can't in this given situation.

I just feel like I'm stretched to my limits( already lower due to my own stresses with everything, plus maintaining my job) and the fatigue of not really seeing all of these people but still feeling obligated to them, 24/7 365 because of the availability of instant communication, is just becoming too much. I love all of my friends, I do, but it's just too much to juggle and it makes me feel bad when I have to choose, or when I can feel that I'm not giving my best to the third person who calls that night because I've already done a lot of heavy emotional lifting. And expressing this to them makes them feel like you don't care as much, because you confirm their suspicions that you didn't answer their call because someone else was more important.

I set boundaries as best I can, but it's just too much.

This is an anon account because I‚Äôm frankly scared to put this much out there for people who know me. I am a mid-30‚Äôs female and I was recently diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. In short, my migraines create symptoms that mimic a stroke. My left side is at 60-80% mobility and manageable pain on good days.

444,"My bully was not a typical bully. He didn't back down into physical or verbal abuse. He knew that if he were to verbally abuse, I could get him reported and expelled immediately. Instead he did things in half, all his abuses were indirect. He would pretend to be a friend, invite me out and would often record our conversations, especially the embarrassing stuff I say into a voice message. He would talk to my close friends, spreading misinformation in an effort to make them betray me and betray they did. I lost a lot of people I've made friends with over the years. Over time, he would eventually carry on with antiques until every student treated me with cruelty and contempt. All of this happened whilst I was left here thinking that I must've done something wrong to be put into the situation I was in before. 

There was this one time where we went out together and I told him my laptop was being repaired so I had nothing to go on with. He lend me his spare laptop to use, which I happily accepted thinking he did it out of kindness. When I returned it, I made sure to have all of of my accounts logged out and any personal files safely deleted. Apparently, I forgot to log out of Facebook (and probably other accounts which I forgot about too). He has been using this opportunity to stalk my private messages and feeding these to other people.

I discovered this recently and even **after changing my password**, he still somehow manage to access my accounts. I had to come up with a completely unique and hard to crack password to prevent him from logging in again, I don't know how he got pass through the 2 factor authentication I set up but that's that. I am thinking of completely migrating to a new Facebook account out of personal safety. What's worse, is that the guy denies everything I say and blames me saying that it's my own fault for being in this position. It was incredibly frustrating and honestly made my mental health worse

This is exactly what he said when I asked what he was looking for:

452,"Earlier the year due to Coronavirus all of the students who were attending the last year of my HighSchool were kicked out, thus sending everyone to apply for universities, colleges and so on. I've had a part-time 16 hour contract retail job since last year from June, and I'm not gonna lie, I love it. Yeah it's a pain right now because of everyone constantly panic buying and unruly customers but I love being busy. 

I love being busy, like I said. But apart from my job, I honestly have no idea what I want to do. I enjoy writing and drawing but don't think I'd enjoy journalism very much, or make it with art qualifications. My parents are very unsupportive because at my age my two older brothers already had apprenticeships, which is making me more stressed. Should I be further on in life than what I am currently? My mum and dad constantly compare me to them, tell me that I HAVE to decide what I want to do RIGHT NOW. But I don't want to jump into anything and then drop out, moneys money, you know? I've looked at various jobs, apprenticeships and college courses but when I've brung up courses that I would enjoy (Software development - programming) they freak out and tell me that I'm just copying my friends (who none of which are interested AT ALL in the likes of that, and that's okay!) And that ""they can't see me in that field of work."" Or that ""it's not right for you.""

457,"(I‚Äôm reposting this because I didn‚Äôt get much advice on my first post)

I might have COVID. My parents won‚Äôt quarantine.

Context: My family forced me to go to Six Flags, thinking I‚Äôd have fun when I have extreme anxiety over COVID. 

More context: I go to school in person with precautions.

Yes, I‚Äôm thinking the same thing. 

ALSO DON‚ÄôT GO TO SIXFLAGS LITERALLY NO PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN. THE WEBSITE IS FULL OF BS.

Anyways, I obviously most likely have COVID. My parents said I won‚Äôt be tested if I don‚Äôt show symptoms. It takes two days to manifest in symptoms. The second day after this is a school day. 

This is my game plan:

I want to take off for one day. I‚Äôll see if I have symptoms. If not I can‚Äôt (or *might* not be able to) get tested. If I do have symptoms, I want to get tested. I‚Äôll then quarantine until the results are back. If they‚Äôre negative, I‚Äôll go back to school. If they‚Äôre positive, I‚Äôll quarantine and hand in my work over Google Classroom.

I think this is pretty reasonable, right? 

Wrong, according to my parents. THEY WANT TO JUST SEND ME TO SCHOOL. 

#THATS NOT OKAY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

Further context:

1. The reason I‚Äôm afraid of the virus is because I don‚Äôt want to give it to others.

2. I only have one friend in my class, as my other friends all left school (except one, in a different grade.) [IMPORTANT]

If I don‚Äôt have it/am not symptomatic (HIGHLY unlikely) it‚Äôll work out in my favor (this still makes me mad, since I just won‚Äôt know if I have it just without symptoms.)

If I do have it, I‚Äôll

1. probably spread it to someone

2. make the whole class quarantine for two weeks. 

This obviously is super selfish to do. 

This also means I‚Äôm the kid who made everyone quarantine for two weeks. 

Meaning I might lose my friend and lose all opportunities to make friends. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get bullied,but if my classmates do much as give me a weird look, I will feel so overwhelmed with guilt because I would deserve it. 

No one will believe me that I didn‚Äôt want to go to SixFlags, which is supposed to be a lot of fun. It‚Äôd be easier to believe I‚Äôm just a selfish teenager who‚Äôs lying because they were stupid and got COVID.

This essentially means I‚Äôll have no one for the rest of the year.

Let me tell you, if gossip gets out about you, it lives forever. People still sometimes talk about people who left the school four years ago (when I joined the school) *or even from when they were in elementary and have since left.*

This effectively means I won‚Äôt have friends for all my years going to my school.

So, Reddit, how do I go about this? How do I convince my parents to finally listen to me? Why won‚Äôt they listen to me? 

They promised to ‚Äúnot force me to have fun anymore,‚Äù (screw this statement) but also say I won‚Äôt be ‚Äúhome bound‚Äù (I‚Äôm not, *and taking me to Six Flags is not just ‚Äúnot letting me be home bound.‚Äù*)

When Covid hit near the end of my senior year, it was also in the middle of the fundraiser. I became incredibly depressed those last few months of high school and didn‚Äôt keep track of anything I did. When I came back to drop off textbooks they asked for the chocolate money but I was 99.9% sure I remembered turning it in and I had looked everywhere for the money at home, so I came to the conclusion that I must have turned it in and forgot to write it down.

Here I am like 6 months after graduation, going through old boxes and behold, $45 of fundraiser money my dumb ass never turned in.

I can‚Äôt even get into the school right now because of COVID but they are in session every other day and I will be a coach for this particular program so I will end up seeing them eventually. But I had promised the instructor that I had turned the money in because quite frankly I was convinced that I had and had absolutely no idea it was still at home.

Should I turn up awkwardly with the money and hand it over and deal with getting yelled at and mocked or just leave it be and shove it into savings? I feel incredibly guilty but I‚Äôm not sure if it outweighs my fear of getting chewed out.",27Sep2020,1
460,"All throughout middle school I didn't have many friends cause I was an odd kid, but in high school I became more social and met this guy. We quickly became best friends for three years until now. High school is now over and we're going to different colleges in different countries (but we're currently still home cause classes are remote), but we still talk a lot, every day and generally have a good time. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, we've always argued quite a bit. One or two times it's become major where we didn't talk for a few weeks, but we've always made up. More specifically, \*I\* have always made up with him. I'm always the one to reach out and apologize. No matter how big or small the argument is, or who's in the wrong, I apologize first. He sometimes apologizes after I do, but not often. My personal belief is that in arguments, even if the ""fault"" might lean to one side or another, both people have done something wrong in hurting the other person's feelings. Therefore, I apologize and try to make nice with the situation I'm in. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, I was suggesting we meet up for lunch since we hadn't seen each other for a while now. We've also both been busy with online university. He starts talking about how he can't go to lunch because he has too much work at university. And I (very passive aggressively) say that I also have work to do but I make time for people I care about. He then says that I don't really have that might stuff to do, my work is ""just reading and writing"" and could be done quickly and easily, while he had to do group presentations and stuff. Trying to be mature, I took a few hours off from our conversation and replied with a lengthy message about why what he said hurt me. The TLDR for the message was that the things I'm passionate about are the most important things to me, and by belittling my work, he was belittling me, and I felt hurt and didn't want type of attitude from my best friend. He replied with ""ok"". 

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't talked about the issue since then, and he hasn't texted me as much (clearly cause he's angry) and we've just made casual jokes about basically nothing in the days after that conversation. I still feel extremely bad about what he said, and feel like blatant disrespect is not an isolated incident but a pattern in our friendship. I realize that I was probably rude by being passive aggressive in that moment, but that didn't warrant him to minimize what I was working on. And replying ""ok"" to a message where I was vulnerable and telling him what I felt was clearly a dick move. I also do realize that I probably created a pattern of letting him disrespect me throughout our friendship, and I've tried to address it and he's made little to no changes in his behavior. So I'm not sure if this friendship is still salvageable or should I just cut him off, especially since I kinda never have to see him ever again unless I want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My longtime best friend belittled my work and when I confronted him about it, he ignored the issue. I've noticed a pattern of disrespect in our friendship and am struggling whether I should cut him off or not.",27Sep2020,1
461,"ill skip over the details but till my sophomore year in high school i was quite social and athletic and overall well liked by everyone. Fast forward to junior year i got addicted to drugs, attempted suicide and became very nihilistic in general and i cut off ties with everyone even those that tried to help me but none of them were being genuine and i was sure of it then but in retrospect i think my sentiments were premature. Not like the world owes me anything so I'm not bitching about that but i only had one person left in my social circle. before corona at school i kind of became a part of her clan and i never fit in or made sense there but i was just grateful to not be alone. My personality is a tad intimidating i have been told and people tell me that I seem very standoffish and i try not to be that way but everyone in her group thinks i hate them? thats what my friend tells me. Soon her friends started saying that im a lesbian because I only talked to her as i really felt uncomfortable talking to nearly everyone and the efforts i did put in were in vain because i was just a joke to people. after that my friend started distancing herself from me . I text her always initiating 99% of our conversations and she just gives one word replies.  My question really is that is it okay to just leave because i'm pretty sure that's what she wants but i told myself that i already cut off ties with all my former friends and i wouldn't do it again.

Over the course of this year I realised that I‚Äôm no match for Anne and that she sees me no more than a friend and so I decided that for me the friendship with Anne is more important than exposing my romantic feelings for her so I just kept all of my feelings under wrap and kept my friendship intact with her. 

Now today I when I met them both I carried my pocket size sketchbook with me and abbey wanted to see the sketches in my book and I completely forgot about the stuff I wrote in it regarding Anne and handed over the book to Abbey.

469,"So I have this habbit where I constantly distract myself whenever I feel sad. I forget about whatever is making me sad and I suddenly become happy, until I remember. Sometimes I forget emotions completely and I m starting to feel like a psychopath. 

Recently my little siblings (9,12,15) moved out to the other side of the country, and I was heart broken. At least during their departure and the days leading up. After that day I just didn't care. To me they were like my own children, I watched them grow up and I basically raised them myself. So why is it that when they went I felt nothing. I continued as if they never existed. 

While feeling emotionless would be scary, the fact is that most of the time Im just happy. I haven't been depressed in a long time and seeing other people depressed now confuses me where back three years ago I could easily relate. It just worries me but then after 30 seconds I simply forget and move on. I remember back in school I heavily overthought and would often allow thoughts and worries and stay in my mind for weeks. Now its a passing thought like my mind is a ever working factory, never stopping if theres a mistake or accident. I can only keep my attention now cause I'm tired and slow thinking. I likely have ADD but I miss sadness somehow, I want to feel human for longer than 5 minutes. Even typing this I'm starting to worry less as if the problem is disappearing  but I just feel calm. 

Im currently jobless, my dream is to make music for a living and Im really passionate about but without getting a job and getting my own place away from my dads it cant happen. But whenever I get motivated by feeling crappy in my current position I become content with my life until I remember Im not.

He is also someone who does not have a very active social life compared to mine and other than me he'd always hang out with another mutual friend who initially fed him things like I was bad for him and I'm not a good person to be associated with, few confrontations and no changes.
Now from hanging out everyday and to knowing everything about each others life, he has gone on to do everything we did with his friend leaving me alone during this time, when I cut off my toxic girlfriends and have been going through therapy and having a rough time with my family (he knows exactly what's happening too)
Everytime I initate a conversation, he's always busy with his other friends playing games and barely even catches up. When I confronted him that I feel lonely, he said ""I dont know what to say"" and then proceeded to just send memes and nothing else. A few days back he told ""XYZ has done more for me than anyone else"" and I felt so hurt because he has only used him whenever he was free and to play video games and tag him in his plans and I don't know where I went wrong.

472,"Its been 3 weeks and I'm still kicking myself for how I reacted when the high winds and fire came through. The fires were caused and exasperated by 40-50 mph winds in our area. We had trees in front of our place that I was afraid were going to fall on us even before the fire, which leads me to the first point.

1. Pack early. 
   Packing early will give you so much peace of mind. It will allow you to take time to  get everything you need/want. I wanted to pack when it was just strong wind. I didn't because I am an idiot.

2. Pack anything that is even a little sentimental. 
  This is where I was the dumbest. When we received the level 2 be ready prompt I was annoyed. I thought that it was just an inconvenience. I thought that I would have to unpack in 12 hours and it was all stupid. Spoiler** it was not. I did take my most sentimental items but I did not take all of them. TAKE THEM ALL 

3. Run through the house with your camera for insurance. 
  This is hoping you still have power at this point but if you don't use your cell phones flash light. This will help with insurance so much.

I had hope that some things I left would still be there - they were not. Wild fires take everything. I've been back and the fire took everything. It's all rubble. Do not leave behind anything you need/want. Pack and take those things early.  

4. If you don't know about it until the last minute just run.                      
      Don't risk your life to grab some stuff. After all it's just stuff. You won't be missing anything if you're gone.

I do plan on asking for her number/asking her out. However, I again, do not know how old she is. We both work in different departments. The minimum age for the department she works in is 16, I believe. There is a SLIGHT chance that it is 15. Either way this means that she could be 15,16,17,18, maybe older. I don't believe she has her driver's license as she always gets picked up by someone else. This could indicate she's at most, 16. Or she simply just doesn't have it yet.

Pros~    Flexible schedule, tips, my only other friend is my shift leader, can listen to music throughout the shift, super easy all i do is drive, hot girl who possibly might be into me works there, best manager i‚Äôve ever had, free food on days i work there

Cons~ Cant ride my motorcycle, hardly make anything from checks (19 hours or so a week), tips can be very inconsistent ($25-100+), my car isn‚Äôt the best on gas, car is running on 270k miles but it‚Äôs a honda so it‚Äôll last 800k more,",27Sep2020,1

I've tried finding hobbies, friends, or anything that interests me but nothing does anymore. I used to really enjoy makeup and stuff but I just realized I only liked makeup because I think I'm ugly. Nobody knows I lay in bed every night and wish to die. I used to see a therapist but I stopped because he wasn't helping me at all and I just felt worse after our sessions. I don't want medication because the thought of having to be on pills to feel okay just makes me even more sad about life. I would like to see a new therapist when all this is over with covid and whatnot but I'm the meantime I feel hopeless. Sorry for rambling and the self pity...

I moved to a new state almost 2 years ago after a huge breakup with my toxic ex. It was a really bad relationship like I‚Äôd cut off all my friends I had and just let myself rot away with drug addictions, just letting my whole life revolve around her it was really bad and ended with me finding out the baby inside her was not mine at 6 weeks. After that I urged my mum to move down to another state where my dad was living which she was pretty happy to do because we have moved around most our life anyway and there was nothing left for our family there. Anyway I had been smoking weed everyday when we moved here for a fair while but about 3/4 months ago I‚Äôve lost track at this point I managed to quit for a while and start boxing which I love soo much definitely was on the way to changing my life and I had so much motivation. But then the restrictions got a lot stricter in the state I am currently living in, probably about 3-4 weeks ago maybe longer and it‚Äôs just so hard man. It‚Äôs only stage 3 but the gym was closed the only thing that was keeping me going and I fell back into smoking weed.. It‚Äôs so damn hard like I just feel so alone like My ex still pops into my head constantly I‚Äôve made no friends, i have tried dating apps but have had no luck like i just suck at texting I don‚Äôt even know man but dating apps just kill my self esteem even more. I really wish I had made more of an effort to put myself out there before covid started. I was doing a course and had people to hang out with there but they were all stoners and since I started going to the gym I wanna distance myself from people like that.

485,"So I'm not sure whether I'm being ungrateful or I'm being rightfully disappointed about this issue.

I'm in a small friend group of about 5 and everyone's known each other very well for about 4 years, and they're all very good people. The only problem is to do with birthday gifts. For context, my friend group is all at least middle class, and they definitely don't have money issues (their families always go on overseas holidays, have pretty nice clothes, etc.).

I know that I shouldn't give to receive and it's the thought that counts, but I feel kinda disappointed each year, when friends don't give me gifts, give things that aren't exactly appropriate, or just forget. For example, last year, one of my friend's gift was a single keychain souvenir that she got from her holiday. I would be fine with that, but the point is, that *everyone else* in the friend group also got one, so it was definitely not meant for my birthday. 

And the thing is, I talk about my interests a lot, to the point my friends know all my favourite characters from my favourite series, and all the things I like. It really puzzles me why they don't really bother to find something suitable. 

On my side, (I'm still a minor so I don't have much pocket money, but) I shell out about $50 for each friend each year for stuff I know they want (I straight up ask them what they would want and they're usually happy to provide an entire list), or for the times I actually don't have any gift ideas, I still make a card for them, and buy them food whenever we go hang out for the next two-three weeks.

And it's not a situation where no one gives gifts, since I have pooled money with other friends to get a more expensive gift, and they do give stuff to each other.

I'd just appreciate it if my friends showed that they put some care and thought into this. Maybe I'm just being really spoilt and salty here, but I need advice on how I should deal with all this.",27Sep2020,1

I was around 5 to 7. So I don‚Äôt remember much.

But I remember how he hit me and I broke my hand. I remember how hard it was using my other hand to write that I couldn‚Äôt stop using my left hand to write.

My parents stop me and said your hand wouldn‚Äôt heal if you keep using it so I had to stop.

I remember using my right and thinking it was impossible.

But that didn‚Äôt stop me from using my left hand, I do half of everything with my left hand,

Clean
Cook
Throw
Kick
Sewing 
And so much more.

But I have noticed that my right hand speed is faster when it comes to writing compared to my left hand.

It was because my parents didn‚Äôt help me go back to writing with my left when I broke it and it healed.

They just allowed me to use my right hand.

So from young age to now, I can still use my right hand and left.

I notice my sister wants be a left handed person.

She tries to write with her left hand for short period of time then stops.

She grew up using her right hand from birth.

Today she told my little brother who believes anything that when she was small she use to write with her left hand.

I went downstairs and asked her why would she lie.

I told her he believes anything.

She‚Äôs like shh don‚Äôt tell him.

492,"I'm so upset because I messed up at my job and I feel awful. I gave someone a discount on a service because I thought they were an employee, they were not an employee. If there are any discounts the person who performed the service gets that taken out of their pay and so the person who did the service is really mad and non-stop texting me about it. 

That would be not that hard to deal with but then my dumb-ass had to go and lie about it saying I put the wrong discount on. Now I dont know what to do because I said the discount was because I messed up on another appointment of hers and was trying to fix it and the person who did the service says the shouldn't have been on him which is true but that's just how our company works. If that were the case I wouldn't be so worried about it but this client shouldn't have had a discount at all. 

So what I want to do is refund the client and charge her again but I need permission because my manager is gone..if I wait until Tuesday when shes back to fix it I have to come clean about lying.

I guess i just feel like an awful person for the whole thing. What do i even tell my boss when she gets back? 

Also I work in a big building sp I could find another manager to give me permission but I'm worried she would be mad I didnt wait for her? Would any of you be mad? 

I guess for context I work in a building with many different departments under one roof, we work very close together and often use other managers to help us when ours is not there. There is also a manager of everyone in the building but its sunday I doubt shes going to be there. The reason I'm worried she would be mad is because I'm not sure she would believe it is time sensitive.

Also for context the discount that I said was supposed to be given was 20% the discount I gave was 25% but it was a large service so both would effect the person who performed the service a lot. 

Also I know its dumb but I have no friends and no one to confide in and I tend to blow things out of proportion, do you guys think I did a really bad thing or was it a mistake? I want to calm myself down and say people make mistakes but I'm afraid it's much bigger than that, especially because I lied, i didnt mean to it just came out when the person who did the service yelled at me but that not really amd excuse.",27Sep2020,1

For example: should I try to explain rationally, why that particular thing is not dangerous, or is it of no use?  Should I avoid such topics or continue to talk with her about them? 

We are close friends, and we chat almost every day, but last months it often revolves about questions of possible illnesses. She has also some issues with fear of sudden death. Now she has some appointments at different doctors scheduled, and had already had some visits, but as far as I know, nothing ""bad"" was found.

Regardless, hurtful words were exchanged on both ends. I usually get over things fairly quickly, but my friend doesn‚Äôt. I tried for months to mend our broken 7 year friendship, but she wanted nothing to do with me. 

Fast forward almost two years later, she messages me out of the blue. We catch up and she‚Äôs opening up to me (about really personal stuff) and initiating conversation just when I think we‚Äôre done talking. She often told me during these conversations that she missed our friendship and still cared about me. So after a week of constant conversation, I ask if she is wanting to rebuild the friendship. She told me no, she just wants to be acquaintances who talk a few times a month... 

I‚Äôm really confused because she is continuing to talk to me daily and open up to me. I would think that as ‚Äòacquaintances‚Äô we wouldn‚Äôt be engaging in such deep and frequent conversation.

496,"This has been a long issue with our friend group for a long time, but last night i basically hit the no tolerance zone.

I recently graduated with a Bachelors of Social Work degree and became licensed in January. I had know this particular group of friends a while before I graduated so I was still in undergrad. However, last night I sat through about a 15 minute conversation about how those witjiut degrees are more valuable than those with one. 

Now don't get me wrong, I understand college isn't for everyone and some people really do have a lot of experience in the work force, but my one friend in particular has been especially impacted by COVID. She was laid off from a position that hired her knowing she doesn't have one because the CEO REALLY saw her potential and knew her background being a single mom. She is a hard worker and he saw that and promoted her. Which is great for her! But she also dropped out of college which was a huuuge decision for her to make because it just wasn't working out. 

However, these friends weren't around before my degree was even a thought.  I had maybe 5 days off in 3 years because I was an assistant manager for a company and nobody wanted to work their shifts. I worked way too many hours for very little pay while running a store. (My boss at the time wanted to do as little as possible and pawned work off onto us.) And this is just one example in particular. U eventually left to get experience in my field which I was in undergrad. 

But last night I had to listen to ""im more experienced than those with degrees"" and ""im more valuable with my exoerience"" and ""i worked my ass off to get here I was."" While im just sitting there with my lips together waiting for them to realize what they're saying. Then my boyfriend looked me in the face and stated ""I could start a revolution.""  At that point I was hurt because as a single mother, I worked, put myself through a 4-year degree, had no friends because I came out of an abusive relationship, and cared for my daughter that started to have medical issues. I told them I worked my ass off too and why aren't I capable of doing the things they claim they can do.

Im so frustrated and don't really want to be around it anymore. If I tell them they're being especially rude about my background how likely is it going to affect our relationships?

Tl;Dr my friends and boyfriend keep saying they're more qualified, capable, and have better work ethic than those with degrees, forgetting im the only one in our group with one.",27Sep2020,1

So in junior high school I moved to a different country. And this guy in school - let's call him Steve - was of the same nationality as me so we became friends. 

So Steve was really intelligent. He was an over achiever and was fairly popular as well. But he was really fucking smug about it...damn I just hated his guts sometimes. As an average student myself, he made me really self conscious.

But as I said, he was only like that sometimes. We were still friends and often had genuinely great interactions with each other. But I suppose it's easier to remember the negatives. 

At some point he left school and I've only seen him very occasionally since then - with the last time being last year. And everytime I saw him, predictably, he would be part friendly and part smug. Also of course he went to an elite university and doing well in terms of his career.

In a way, the image that I have of Steve in my head is way worst than what he actually is like in real life. Also, I think about him way often than I care to admit - and I know it's unproductive and stupid. He probably doesn't think about me at all.

I think he really hurt my self-confidence at some point and my fear of failure is partly linked to him. How do I stop this? How can I just move on? There's already enough happening in my life, I don't need an imaginary rival haunting me as well.",27Sep2020,1

523,"BACKGROUND: Earlier this year, I took a break from grad school abroad due to anxiety attack. That period was difficult yet I still do not know the main cause of the attacks. I thought of homesickness/exam anxiety but I really dont know. I felt like I gave up too easily at that time and just went back home. Maybe if I stayed a bit more, I might get better and I would not have to take a break. 

RIGHT NOW: I have to decide whether I should go back to study abroad. First, I am scared that I will get my attacks again. Whenever I remember those times, I get somewhat traumatized. Second, I am getting paranoid with the virus. What if I get the virus abroad, will I be saved or will I die? Another thing, what if I went abroad and felt that I want to go home again and I cannot because of quaranatine issues? Plus, coming back home means I have to be quarantined in a government facility which is definitely going to shoot up my anxiety. 

If I finally decide not to go, I think I will forever regret my decision. I dont just want to end up doing office work my whole life. I feel like I want to do something more. I think grad school abroad can somewhat widen my opportunities by about 20%. But that doesnt go well (which is 80% chance), I might just end up with an office job after grad school. 

Also right now, I have a job offer. It pays lower that my grad school grant by 50%. But the thing is, getting the job might be a much better option for the long term, cause my ""vision"" of what life is after grad school might not work.

Should I go for something stable and not go out of my comfort zone? Will not taking the challenge during covid be reasonable? Or should I take the risk see if I fall or win?

Please help. I very frustrated and I feel very hurried cause I have to make a decision soon.",27Sep2020,1
524,"So I started university 2 weeks ago and for a certain course the class is divided into small groups where we do exercises for two hours. The problem is that during these sessions we have to go in front of the whole class and we have to do and explain exercices in live.

This isn't something new, it was already a thing in high school to go to the front of the class, but the thing is that I struggle with this particular course and I'm literally unable to do that. I don't know anyone in my group and there's pretty high chances that I have social anxiety so I'm literally terrified that the teacher will ask me to go to the front of the class. On top of that, everyone think this course is super easy so I will look even more dumb. It's 100% sure that I will embarass myself.

When the teacher started explaining that we will have to go in front of the class I started to panic very hard and I ended up having an anxiety attack. My heart was beating very fast, I wanted to cry so bad, I was sweating and I couldn't think straight, so I asked to go out of the class and I broke down in tears as soon as I was in the hallway. I was crying and shaking, I couldn't breathe proprely and I could barely speak to the teacher's assistant that followed me in the hallway.

This never happened before, I never had an anxiety attack before so it scared the shit out of me. And it still scares me.

Now I don't know what to do, I have to go to these work sessions but it literally terrifies me to go back.  I'm terrified to embarass myself in front of the class and the teacher and I don't want to have an anxiety attack ever again.

Does anyone have any advice for me or has anyone been in a similar situation before ? I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.

534,"So my university 'requires us' to be in the country as some exams are oral. The covid situation is getting worse by the day. I am going back home and, if necessary, I will travel for the exams.

Our banker said, 3 months ago, that I will most likely get the loan to live, but some inside sources suggest that we will not be getting the student loans. The consequence is that I can not legally stay in the country for more than 3 months, as I need some specific document. The requirements to get the document are that I am a student and that I have a certain amount of money at the time of the application in my bank acc. I won't have the latter.

My issue is that due to covid I am staying home as I can't afford to get sick. The consequence is that I am socially isolated and in a really bad place mentally. There's also just too much stress, and for whatever reason we have group homework but I am pulling most of the weight, which causes a vicious cycle of neglecting watching the lectures to do the homework. In the end I don't really have time to relax.

539,"I'm not sure when this started, but I've always had some kind of tic. When I was in middle school I would do the finger-snapping motion constantly, then I had a period of constantly pulling at my upper lip. So it's not new but now it actually hurts me

I was able to stop more or less for a while and my lips had finally healed. But they got dry at some point and I started doing it again. It sucks, my lips are constantly painful, I break the skin until it bleeds and I don't know how to stop. Sometimes the impulse is so strong that I'll be in the middle of doing it, realise, and try to stop myself and be unable to.

 I also pick at my scalp, but that's recently been less bad. Had a period when my scalp was quite itchy if I didn't wash it for a couple of days and I constantly felt the need to pick at it, but since its not as itchy anymore the impulse is less strong. I tend to pick at the skin around my fingernails as well, but much, much less than I used to. 

I constantly put on a Neutrogena lip balm that's normally good, but if I pick at my lips it doesn't even get a chance to seep in before it gets wiped off.

The only thing that keeps me from picking as much is wearing liquid matte lipstick, the kind that doesn't come off easily - but those tend to be quite drying for the lips so I don't think it's a solution.

543,"This is something that goes back 14 years to when I was only 10. I used to go to the same elementary school as this girl until I transferred because of relocation and bullying. I never grew up as a cool kid or anything, I was extremely timid and shy with an army cut in my childhood. I used to wear a button up shirt with pants that went up-to my waist that were held by my belt. I was also a snitch, be it swear words or unfairness I would rattle so of course I was never well liked. I was a social outcast and I had one friend named Sukh(Not actual name) who was also bullied just like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm bringing this up because recently on my instagram feed this same girl came up and she's speaking out for the South Asian Immigrant community which is the category I fall under. It sickens me even more that her story of her speaking out was shared by my first cousin brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied a lot, It didn't just stop at school. I remember when I was in a lineup to enter music class where we play the clarinet here in Canada, well I did anyways. A group of kids told me to make animal sounds (Something to do with my nickname) and if I didn't entertain their idea they'll tell the teacher that I swore or middle fingered them, my word against theirs so I did it and it wasn't a one off occurrence. Yes by animal sounds, I mean barking, mooing, quacking whatever it maybe so I can appease them.

&amp;#x200B;

Another time where an older kid grade 7 told me to ask a girl what the word sex means or he'd hit me. I did that and got detention for a week, recess and lunch gone, my freedom was taken from me and my parents were called. I told the adults but they wouldn't believe me and I still didn't know what that word meant until a few years after.

&amp;#x200B;

The bullies managed to find out where I live, didn't help that my house was really close to the elementary school. I remember standing outside in the driveway as a target dummy so an older kid could practice his soccer skills, I wasn't supposed to block or dodge. That same kid entered my house and watched porn on my computer because I was timid and easily intimidated when my parents weren't home. They found out about the porn and thought it was me they looked disgusted. Another kid who came to my house on his bike and extorted me for pop, chocolates and play station 2 games and never gave them back. Who bullied me the most, since we were in the same class, same grade and he was the bully boss. Luckily for me he got into an accident and was wheel chair bound for the rest of the school year so he couldn't visit me anymore and wasn't as intimidating.

&amp;#x200B;

My only friend at the time who was Sukh, unlucky for me and him he lived on the same round cul de sac as my classmate and the bully boss. I remember when we were out playing and we ran into my classmates older brother. I don't remember what transpired but I remember him repeatedly throwing a tennis ball at me and bouncing it off my body in front of all the houses of the cul de sac while I was still on the road. He would let it roll back to him and repeat until it wasn't fun for him anymore. After that day I don't think I ever went back to Sukh's house or tried leaving my home even.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually the bullying got to me, I started being extremely unhappy. As a 10 year old boy I started trying to kill myself. It didn't help that strangers were bullying me but the adults didn't believe me either. My brother a few years younger got caught swearing by a teacher in the playground and you know what he said he learned swear words from me. I got into detention again the adults didn't believe me.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents were disgusted by me, adults thought I was a liar, and my own brother made stuff up to get himself out of trouble. I had nobody to turn to, I was bullied in school and in my own home. As stupid as I was I tried holding my breath because I knew you need air to live. I realized after a few tries it wasn't working, so I resorted to taking the shoelaces out of my shoes and tying knots to choke myself, luckily I wasn't very successful in that endeavour. My parents found out eventually and we moved and I got to start with a clean slate.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this was all behind me, but today I saw an instagram story shared by my first cousins of this classmate who's advocating that south asians should stand together as a community and we should help each other that we're a community and the suicide of an international student which recently happened is really sad.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me is so mad that she's preaching all this on social media when her own older brother is a predator/bully. I was bullied pretty openly at the time so I'm sure she knew. I guess we were both 10 years old at the time so I can't hold it against her. I don't know what to do. All these old memories I had buried resurfaced and I don't remember crying nearly as much as I did typing this. Should I DM her and tell her about it? Should I call her out for being a hypocrite? Should I let it go since it happened 14 years ago and it was ""little kids"" playing. Should I post this publicly on her page with proper information, If I gave the names and events the validity of my story could be determined but yes I have no proof of her brother pelting me. Nobody knows the whole events, only bits and pieces not even my own parents if I come out with this what will people think of me? Am I a petty person for bringing up something from 14 years ago when I was only 10 and we didn't know any better.

I never knew her brothers name but I knew her name and my friend described him as her older brother. Her name and the name of the other bully who got into an accident and their faces are something that are permanently etched in my mind.

544,"Hello all. 

I am getting registered to vote and I am trying to figure out which address I am suppose to use and keep getting different answers. Long story short I had a relative who I lived with die and recently the house got sold and I no longer live there ( I live at my college for now.) I have been told by some that I would have to have the ballot mailed to my written living address on my id (previous home but that got sold,) others say it would have to go to my mailing address (another relative is allowing me to get most of my mail mailed to their house,) then others are telling me it would be mailed to my current residence (my college.)  I don't want to risk getting in trouble for voter fraud or something for having it mailed to the wrong place so can someone who is 100% sure of where it is suppose to be mailed to tell me which one its actually suppose to be?

545,"I'm a 22 year old graduating from a good engineering school this semester. I've always been good at school and I wanted to be an aerospace engineer going into college. Maybe it's because I smoked and drank so I got lazier, but I realized I just don't have the drive to be an aerospace engineer.

Once I heard the grueling hours spaceX employees work, I realized I didn't want that kind of lifestyle. After two internships and lots of career research I realized the best profession for me would be user experience designer. 

So here's where the problem comes in. Every week after I catch up on school work, my motivation to accomplish my goals falls apart. I sit down to start working on a portfolio and I just can't get myself to do it. Even if I have tons of free time. And its the same way with losing weight, improving at rock climbing, and any other good habits I try to develop.

After school work, I just can't pull myself to improve myself at all no matter how much time I have. Any advice?",27Sep2020,1
546,"I met ‚ÄúRachel‚Äù (not her real name lol) shortly after college when we first started at our first real post college jobs as coworkers. We both worked our way up the ranks and became managers about the same time. Over the years we became very close basically inseparable. We move on from our first jobs but remained close friends. 
Fast forward to 2019, this is when things started to change. I began to notice Rachel become more concerned with material things and status. She had recently become engaged to a man who used his things and appearance as a status symbol. To give you an example he told my husband he was more of a man than him because he had a better looking beard and would constantly talk about how much things he bought cost. 
She asked me to be her Matron of Honor, which I accepted. I put a lot of time and money into my duties for her wedding and in the end do not feel she was grateful for what I did. I am not saying I did the job of MOH for her praise, but a thank you would have been nice. 
After her wedding I saw us drift farther apart. Money and things became more important to her. I felt like she was trying to model herself as a Real Houswife...even though we‚Äôre from a mid-sized Midwest town. 
When COVID hit and our state was on stay at home orders, my income was severely impacted and I had the looming stress of possibly losing my job. There was minimal communication from Rachel, except for her to text me about shallow questions of wether or not owned certain luxury items or make rather racist comments about protests happening in our area. 
Example: I had talked for years about saving to buy a Louis Vuitton, but I also have my priorities in order. Remodeling my kitchen was more important. Setting aside money for my son‚Äôs college was more important. I have bills and a mortgage, I can‚Äôt just drop 4 grand selfishly on myself. 
Rachel knew I was struggling financial as well as emotionally because of COVID. One day she texts me ‚Äúdid you ever buy that Louis Vuitton?‚Äù
You know I‚Äôm struggling to try and pay my mortgage and you think it‚Äôs appropriate  to ask me that?!?!

Next thing I know she‚Äôs flashing pictures all over social media with her new Louis Vuitton. 
She‚Äôd send snaps of getting her $150 facials and bragging about all the ‚Äúgreat COVID sales going on‚Äù...we‚Äôre in a pandemic and all you care about is what you can buy?!

It was very obvious her and I were in different places in life and had different priorities and having her as a friend was not best for my well being. There were a lot of other things that transpired but I‚Äôm trying to keep this to the point. So I stopped talking to her. Blocked her on social media. It‚Äôs been 3 months and she‚Äôs not once texted me, so clearly I wasn‚Äôt that important to her. 
I know this is a long post, but I felt the back story was important. 
My question is, I feel like I need closure and let her know why I‚Äôm done having her in my life and why. 
Should I write her a letter? Or just let it go?






TL/DR: should I just keep ghosting my former best friend or tell her why?",27Sep2020,1

548,"To be clear right up front, she didn‚Äôt cover for the abuser. She filed charges and cut ties with that entire side of the family. The point of post isn‚Äôt to get justice, or to get her to admit wrongdoings. I just want to end the secrets. 

I‚Äôm a 19 year old male, I found out recently that when I was about 3 years old, a 16 year old cousin that I haven‚Äôt met since tried to rape me. Im told he was unsuccessful, but I don‚Äôt know what he did accomplish, if anything. I‚Äôve just found out, but she doesn‚Äôt know I know about this. I have no memory of the event, but the signs that it happened are there in my personality and in my family‚Äôs history. I‚Äôm not mad at her for hiding this from me, and I honestly agree with her decision. I want to tell my mother I know, because i want her to know I don‚Äôt blame her for this, and I want to try and ease any guilt she may be feeling. 

That being said, she also hid it from my dad, who she was divorced from at the time. I feel like should tell my dad, because I believe this event may be partially responsible for shaping my personality to what it is today, and I think it‚Äôs important that my dad knows about events that might be responsible for making me who I am. 

I don‚Äôt want to cause conflict between them though. I worry that telling my dad might make him hate her more, and the last thing she needs right now is being accused by him. I‚Äôm just sick of hiding that I know. I want to hear her say that it happened so that I know I‚Äôm not imagining things, and I want him to know because I think he‚Äôd want to know that kind of thing even if it‚Äôs hard to hear. 

How should I go about telling them? My dad knows that I know a secret, but not what the secret is. He‚Äôs promised not to talk to her about it, and he says he never wants to talk to her again. Should I tell him at all? And how do I break the news that I know to my mother?

559,"I'm 24F and was in a relationship with my ex for about 4 years. It's been 2 years since we broke up (on really bad terms) but finally ended all communication earlier this year. During my time with him, my friend (23F) always hung out with my ex but I never thought much of it since she was also dating someone else at the time. 

My ex always joked about how she was hot when we were together, but again I never thought much of it cause we were all friends and we had the kind of relationship where we could joke bout it and move on. There was a moment when I was jealous of their friendship but he reassured me that she would never date him. I used to hang out with my friend a lot too and it never occurred to me that she would actually be interested in him. 

Our breakup ended on really bad terms, it was to the point where he was blackmailing me so he could try to get sexual favors out of me. I was so scared of him after our breakup, I didn't know what would happen if the details of our breakup came out. 

Fast forward to today, I saw a picture of them together as a couple and I was honestly shocked  when I saw it. I couldn't believe it at first. I haven't talked to my friend in a year, but she never showed interest to my ex (while we were together or even after we broke up). I have not spoken to her in a year, but again never thought she would date him. We were never close enough to have a ""girl code"" but it still feels weird to me that she kind of broke it? Has anyone else felt this way before? :/

Although the cause of the breakup was not my fault, I'm still kind of scared my ex will reveal all the vunerable details about me, our relationship, breakup, and the intimate videos we once shared together to my friend. Although I haven't spoken to her in a while, I would still call her my friend...she didn't do anything bad to me (not that I know of) and I don't think she cheated when I was in a relationship with him. 

How would you guys react in this situation? 
Should I just act normally if I see her again? I'm scared she'll find out about my past mistakes with him. Have you ever experienced something similar to this?

I'm trying my best to move on. I haven't dated anyone in two years, since I broke up with him.

561,"I don‚Äôt know where I stand with this girl?

I don‚Äôt know where I stand with this girl

I‚Äôm creating this to gain a third party view on the situation. I will be recalling the most notable events. 

I attend high school, and we will call her Z.
I‚Äôve known her for about 5-6 years, sat next to her in a few lessons (seating plan) throughout some of those years. We wouldn‚Äôt really talk much outside of school. I‚Äôm a pretty quiet guy. 

Then around a year ago, there was a period of time where she would always say hi, or hello to me. The moment I saw her, i knew she was going to greet me, I usually replied hello/hi, and we never really stopped to talk as we were both with our friends. (So yeah, she was with her friends, I was with mine, and when walking past eachother, she‚Äôd say hi to me) I never initiated the greet, she would always say it first. (Lmao am I a pussy or a dumbfuck for not doing it first atleast once) Eventually this stopped.

She was in my physics, biology and chemistry class. She sat opposite me in biology, and we would talk occasionally, it wasn‚Äôt often though. I must also mention that she had one of her closest friends in that class, and I sat next to her close friend, J, in physics. Z and J would often mess around, like try take eachothers rulers/pencil cases etc. Z would often reach across me to take J‚Äôs stuff. One time Z was walking past, quickly, and bumped into the side of me, and then apologised like she‚Äôd just stabbed me. So she apologised, and then walked away, later came back, and apologised again. Questionable to how sorry she was? Lmao, normally somebody may just say sorry once and that‚Äôd be the end. 

Now corona came along in March, and schools shut. I hadn‚Äôt talked to her until June/July when her birthday came, and it was just a simple happy birthday, replied with a Thankyou and a few hearts. (Standard) 

Then came the end of august. We had our exam results, and many people were changing schools. So I randomly messaged her asking if she‚Äôs still going to the same school and what subjects she‚Äôd be taking. She replied saying that‚Äôs she‚Äôs going to the same school, and listed the subjects; she then asked ‚Äúwbu, wait lemme guess what your taking‚Äù looking at this from a phycological point, most people would have stopped at the ‚Äúwbu‚Äù but she stopped herself, and tried to guess. (She was very wrong lmao) [point I‚Äôm making is, chances of somebody stopping themselves and guessing instead aren‚Äôt big] the conversation continued hours throughout the day. 

Then came my birthday, school has started, and she wishes me a happy birthday, and reply thanking her with a few hearts (standard), and then it would end there right? Well, she replied yw/your welcome followed by some hearts. [now I understand that some people reply yw, but most people I know don‚Äôt, and especially don‚Äôt send hearts with it] 

Now schools started, School is massive, and you can come and go anytime you want, so it‚Äôs pretty hard to find her/anyone, and when I do see her, she‚Äôs always with her friends, and I‚Äôm with mine. And I‚Äôm not about to walk up to her and start talking to her whilst she‚Äôs with her group of friends and I‚Äôm with mine. I try though, just a bit hard to execute irl. 

Now I understand that I might be looking into it too much, but I‚Äôm a quiet guy, I don‚Äôt usually go out of my way to talk to people I don‚Äôt really like. But Ay, when I‚Äôm talking it‚Äôs great lmao. 
A few years ago, I also had thought she may have had a crush on me. But ultimately, I‚Äôm at school to get A‚Äôs. The way I see it is, relationships are a hinderance to education, and ain‚Äôt nobody gonna stop me getting A‚Äôs
I don‚Äôt see her as a potential crush/gf, I just wanna be closer friends I guess.

I (27f, USA) just moved to the UK for grad school and into a house I'm sharing with 3 other students (2f, 1m, Greek).

I've tried hovering and striking up conversation but to no avail. They can speak English very well but speak in rapid fire Greek 24/7 which is totally fine but it means I can never join in on conversations or even attempt to deduce if we have anything in common. They were friendly enough via Facebook messenger prior to us all moving in together but the group chat I made for us on there is gathering dust and they've not shown any interest in speaking in person beyond a ""Hey"" when we pass in the hallway.

569,"Hi guys, I (25F) have been with my bf (27M) for about 7 months now. The first 2 months of our relationship were kinda rocky, we didn‚Äôt understand each other much, we misunderstood each other and argued quite a bit, and kind of, argued in ways that made each other angrier. 

I guess we were both trying in our own ways, for instance, my work was especially busy at that point (9am to 2am job), but he couldn‚Äôt understand how work could be that busy, and often initiated activities together, like watching a Netflix episode together everyday over video call, etc (our city was in lockdown less than a month after we got together). I‚Äôd try to stick to the Netflix timings even if this means staying up even later to work, but as work got busy, he‚Äôd be unhappy if I couldn‚Äôt make it, and I‚Äôd be unhappy that he couldn‚Äôt respect that I had work to do. When I was unhappy it hurt him, as he was trying to spend time together even though we were physically apart. It was just a lot of these things, amidst more petty things like, me not saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù back when he said it to me, me not reading his blog properly even though he had read every single post of mine, etc etc. We basically had very different expectations in a relationship, and I suppose because I had fewer emotional needs and was busy to begin with, it was easier for me. I just was annoyed that we argued all the time. 

Fast forward one month into lockdown, a girl he reconnected with (a girl he used to have an interest in about a year ago, got rejected and then got over her in a week) started texting and flirting with him. He flirted back (was rather intense flirting, I read their insta messages and it hurt me quite a bit) saying that it was partly because he used it to fill the attention I wasn‚Äôt giving him, because he felt desired, and also because the flirtatious nature of her messages kind of, goaded him to reciprocate I suppose. He said he had no feelings for her. He‚Äôd stop replying her sometimes, and she‚Äôd follow up with new messages about 80% of the time. She‚Äôd tell him about her very personal, intimate problems, and he‚Äôd comfort her. When we argued he‚Äôd reply her texts after ignoring her for perhaps a day, and she often asked him if he‚Äôd only look for her when we argued. She was interested in him, and he knew. She also knew he was attached. From what he says, I had always been on his mind, he wakes up thinking about me, looking forward to my messages etc. We stuck to our Netflix timings and he was always excited throughout the day for that moment (I do recall him talking about what movie/drama to watch a lot, and I also do remember brushing him off at times, since I was so busy at work). When I was upset over things at work he‚Äôd call me to make sure I felt better, though all this while flirting with this girl on the side. All this time, he felt like it was wrong to be texting a girl this intensely, but he had told me that he was talking to this female and I was okay with it (I generally am okay), so he said it made him feel better about his act. That being said, I didn‚Äôt know they were talking in this manner. (He stops me from talking to my guy friends a lot and gets jealous quite easily, so I just trusted him at that point.) He claimed that if I had stopped him from talking to her when he had told me about it, he would have stopped. 

Fast forward 2 weeks after this girl appeared, we broke up after an argument. In this argument I said something like, ‚Äúif this is really what you want, you can find another girl who fits you better‚Äù (he kept saying my pov was unattractive to him, but I know, was wrong of me to say that). He then responded something like, I‚Äôve always been trying, how could you throw away our relationship like that? I said the same thing again, and we broke up. He asked her out the same day, though he explained it was more of a coping mechanism, he was just thinking, since they could converse, he could get to know her better. A rebound? Or way to get over a breakup fast? If you will. 

He brood over our breakup for 2 days before calling me back, asking if I wanted to get back together. That he misunderstood me and wanted to give it another shot. He stopped texting her after because it would be unfair to me since he had already asked her out, deleted her chat and ghosted her. He said she had played no part in his decision making process, and he never missed her after he ghosted her. 

5 months on, we understand each other a lot more now, are happy and fulfilled. We ironed out our disagreements, and he has also been trying to be more understanding about my work, showering me with a lot of affection, etc etc. I trust him when he says he hasn‚Äôt been talking to any girl since we got back together. But he had kept this incident from me until now, when I found out through a friend. The girl claims he had hit on her and crossed the line, then ghosted her. She also claims that at that point in time, she felt like she had the power to press him to make a decision to choose between me or her. He was confused, saying that even though yes, he had crossed the line at times, he had never liked her, and would tell her about us. They never called, never met in person. What would you do?

All he had to say was ""I wouldn't be comfortable hanging out with an ex, I'm in a relationship."" I kind of understand where he's coming from but at the same time, no I don't because I'm **not** trying to get back with him. But I didn't want to say that and sound rude or desperate so I just said ""Ok totally understand"" and that was the end of it (he even left me on read -\_- )

Question is, now what? I feel so cold and empty on the inside, but not really sad. I feel like I've cried it out of my system over the last year+ but I still miss him like crazy. I don't miss the sex or the cuddles or the dating, I just miss him and being his friend. We were able to tell each other deep dark secrets that I've only shared with my therapist and he'd never told anyone his. The breakup was rough but I never made myself hate him like I've done with other exes to help heal the hurt (plus he never did anything to me) We broke up because his depression was spiraling out of control and it was bringing me into a dark place and I didn't want to be there if he killed himself (or vice versa).

I thought he was my best friend. But I guess he didn't feel the same, because I know if an old friend, ex boyfriend or otherwise, asked me to hang out, I'd jump on that opportunity. I'm just hurt now... I tore down a wall I've built  over the years and he basically just helped me build it back up higher than before. I feel so stupid now...",27Sep2020,1

And for the first 8-12 months the car will be mostly used on open road and after that it will be used almost daily in a big city (I'm going there to a university and will need to drive most of the time in morning and afternoon traffic)

I can‚Äôt really take care of myself, since my parents refused to teach me life skills and wouldn‚Äôt let me move out. I think in order to be ready to be on my own, at a minimum, I need to learn to cook and I need to review how to drive since I haven‚Äôt driven in like 3 years even though I have a license already. I‚Äôll also need to get a car most likely. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt really have much free time to learn these things, since I have 2 jobs and going to school right now. One job is contract and ends in 2 months. This job isn‚Äôt that much of a time commitment, so it won‚Äôt really save me that much time. I also need to study for interviews to get a new job and ideally, would like to get fit, since I think having too much fat can directly impact your productivity and effectiveness of everything you do. 

Given all this, I‚Äôm not sure how to prioritize among: Interview Prep, Cooking, Driving, Jobs, School, Health/Exercise

My waking hours are basically: school work for like 5 hours and job work for like 8 hours, 1 hour eating, 1 hour downtime spread throughout the day as time to step away from stuff, 1 hour flex time if I need to do something that day or if I need to do more work or more school that day.

581,"So, I used to date this person who unfortunately got sucked into a drug addiction the past 2 years and has fallen off pretty bad in life I.e, has no work, lost relationship with friends and family.  His addiction has also gotten him to the point where he gets manic and can be paranoid. Hasn‚Äôt been diagnosed but it sounds like he gets psychosis from the drug use.



Thing is things have gotten pretty bad between him and his parents. They currently have a protective order against him because of things he‚Äôs done, I‚Äôm not 100% on everything exactly because I‚Äôve only heard from his part, but know for a fact he has stolen from them. Regardless of the PO, they still let him stay at the house because he‚Äôs got no where else to go. But it‚Äôs like an ongoing cycle, they will be decent for  3 or so months, then he‚Äôll act up and they will call the cops and he‚Äôll get arrested. He‚Äôs gone to jail at least 4x this year. Regardless of what he did, they end up letting him back in and it repeats once again. Even before they started calling the cops on him every single family member and friend have closed their doors to him, not even let him stay once with them.



So the past times he‚Äôs hit me up and I‚Äôve let him stay at my place for a couple of days, with the condition that no drugs are allowed here. But he‚Äôs always failed, so I have to kick him out.  Over time, each and every stay had gotten worse. By the last time I had asked him to leave, he wouldn‚Äôt want to cause he had no where else to go, he was pretty much homeless, but I had to call the cops to get him to leave as he was lingering around the apartment complex and staying in places like the laundry room or the pool. I. Add it clear the last time that it would be the last time I‚Äôd let him stay seeing as he kept doing the same thing over and over again. I felt terrible. I‚Äôve tried to help him but I guess he doesn‚Äôt want and doesn‚Äôt seem like he has the need to change. 



I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in over 2 months, but recently I started gettin calls from jail. From what I know is he got out of jail  on Wednesday evening , having been in there for 3 days and then he go rearrested again on Thursday around mid day. So he‚Äôs in there now and has court this coming Monday. This is information I found online from an inmate search page.



What I am concerned over is, in the past he stopped asking to come over and he would just show up, knocking at my door. The last time I didn‚Äôt let him in because of the prior time where he wouldn‚Äôt leave. I also don‚Äôt want him lingering around the complex. 
He‚Äôll play me the same story that his family is so effed up to him and what not. Can‚Äôt help but feel sorry but at the same time I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs put his family through. He‚Äôs been offered multiple times to go to rehab but he feels like he doesn‚Äôt have a problem. I‚Äôve tried to at least be a friend with boundaries because as an addict I know he probably takes advantage. I‚Äôve been told to just ignore him which is heartbreaking and gut wrenching.

582,"I (19f) am feeling kind of bummed out and disappointed.

Every year for my birthday I throw a fun party with friends since my birthday kind of gets overshadowed by other family members. (I share my birthday with three other family members who always get a bunch of gifts while I ALWAYS get one gift card). 

That‚Äôs why I always do a birthday party with my friends. I just feel more appreciated there. 
I never really do anything with alcohol, honestly, it always ends up just being a fun get together where we play boardgames and reminisce. I really love seeing them all happy and having fun. It‚Äôs the highlight of my year.

So this year, When I began organizing my birthday party all my friends were eager to come. They all said yes immediately. 

Then in a weeks time, our covid numbers increased. They increased because the government started sending kids of elementary and high school age back in. My friends and I are in university so we have online school, meaning we have been house bound.

Bc of the increase, some of my friends parents have become stricter and r hesitant to let my friends attend now. They r even blaming our age group saying we‚Äôre the REASON for the increase when we haven‚Äôt left the house EVER!  Some of My friends parents r even being hypocritical and r still meeting up with their own friends. They even REFUSE to speak to me about the party in any shape or form.

I can tell all my friends r miserable and this breaks my heart. (We haven‚Äôt see each other since march. It has only been long zoom and FaceTime calls.)

Now, we won‚Äôt even get to see each other for a decision the government made. Not us!

I was able to pull some strings and I have a family member who owns a restaurant. He has allowed us to have my birthday there before opening hours, meaning we‚Äôll be the ONLY ONES in the restaurant. There‚Äôs high ceilings and it‚Äôs a super large space.
I also told my friends that when we‚Äôre not eating to wear their mask and we‚Äôll even be seated at separate tables. 

I know I should just be happy no one has gotten sick and that we‚Äôve been safe for the time being. I know I should be grateful in a way, but honestly I just feel like I‚Äôm going insane. 

I miss them terribly and everyone is miserable. It sucks bc my birthday  has always been this nice symbol of friendship and memories. I honestly just want everyone to be happy, but I guess that‚Äôs just too much to ask.

How do I get over feeling so disappointed over something that is completely unfair and just not my fault without feeling like I‚Äôm being super entitled?",27Sep2020,1

Fast forward to today, the influence of the protester (FSA) control in the region was dying, and I was expecting a female from my cute husband. However, Assad's forces came closer and closer to me and my husband who is a soldier. Bomb sounds were almost deafening at the point when the incident occured. I had a miscarriage, so my husband invited me to his military complex where he would contact the FSA generals and get a medic to treat me. The next day, I woke up at 4 AM to intense clashes with the regime forces. My husband was unable to defend the position and retreated to the complex. Soon after, we were besieged. After 2 days, this afternoon, block A was captured by the regime forces and it was very nasty. They resisted till the last man died. That could've been my husband. Luckily, we're in block B, but I'm getting rumors one of the generals were shot dead and they advanced into the kitchen. That only leaves the main lounge, the WC, and the stroge room which are heavily defended with bulletproof walls and glasses. Heavy fighting at the door and the machine gun sounds are deafening. One bazooka and the entire room is dead. I told my husband not to resist but he insists on fighting till the end. All I can hope for is that I don't die for this stupid and worthless political disagreement. He says that they will achieve a breakout by recapturing the kitchen and block B to gain full access to the military capabilities, but at this point, our only hope is relief, and I will die for a war that I'm not even fighting in if that doesn't happen.",27Sep2020,1

My mom (47y/o), has recently separated from my dad. She‚Äôs never had a steady career and spent all her adult life taking care of me and my siblings. She‚Äôs held a bookkeeping job for the last 5 years at my aunt‚Äôs (dad‚Äôs sister) business. Suffice to say, that job of hers is still connected to my dad and his family. She hasn‚Äôt been able to work due to the lockdown and is now thinking of applying for a proper job in a non-voice account at a BPO company. She doesn‚Äôt know a life outside my dad or us (her kids: 27F[me], 23M, and 20F). We (me and her side of the family) are encouraging her to go for it. I wrote her resume and her sisters have been helping to get her a job where they work.

For some background, my dad works abroad, so they don‚Äôt see each other. My mom is still living at the house we‚Äôd built several years ago, and my parents had an agreement that she will stay here until my younger sister finishes school and becomes stable herself. For context, we are from the Philippines (Southeast Asia). So, all that basically means that she doesn‚Äôt have anything that ties her to this house and to my dad‚Äôs side of the family once my sister finishes college and can support herself.

To be honest, my mom is not courageous. She‚Äôs been very dependent on my dad since they got together in college. She feels indebted to my dad‚Äôs family since they supported us in so many ways through the years. Especially financially. I love my mom so much, bless her heart, but she isn‚Äôt smart or wise. She does not have that many skills. I don‚Äôt know how to support her through this transition without her feeling bombarded by information or making her feel ‚Äúless,‚Äù for the lack of better term.

At the end of july I received a call from my friends mother telling me that her daughter really likes me and thinks im fun to be around and asked if i would become a respite worker for her as i have nursing experience just incase something bad were to happen while i was with her (basically it just means you are paid to take them out places and have fun). I was VERY hesitant on accepting because i already had no time for myself but sorta felt guilt tripped into saying yes because i knew the family and am friends with her older daughter. Before we started working together for the month of august her mother sat me down and discussed the pay and hours id work. I told her i could only allow one day a week for 2-3 hours because i was working 2 other jobs and still wanted to have a social life of my own.
Throughout the month it was fine for the most part but i soon came to realize her daughter who i was working for was lying to me about things and taking advantage of me into spending my own money for things for her (i am too nice of a person to say no to these things but i do regret it). And the one day a week soon turned to 2 days a week 4 hours each which i did not initially agree to.
Anyways, at the end of august i sat down with the mother and she discussed the pay id be getting from the month and said she would send in the pay form to the company and they would send back the cheque within a week and she would give it to me. Her daughter was sent to the hospital a week after this discussion and was there for 3 weeks. Her mother texted me a couple days ago asking for my school schedule to we could set up a day to hangout again once she is better, so i sent it to her and she never responded. 
My concern is that its been almost a whole month and i still havent gotten paid for the work i did last month. Im not sure what to do or say. I am not even sure i want to keep working with her because if the experiences. 
Looking for advice.",27Sep2020,1

607,"I am a 16-year-old guy and I am obsessed with different suits, waistcoats, ties, most only worn by 40-50-year-olds. I love waistcoats and I want to wear them everywhere. I would also LOVE to try out a pocketwatch. I have not yet told my parents this. They would probably not think that it is appropriate since those clothes are usually only worn to formal events. The people at school would probably also think it weird and make comments. 

I know that it would make me a lot more confident but it would also make me stand out since all the other guys at my school wear popular brand T-shirts and oversized hoodies.

Would it be fine for me to go to school in more formal wear instead of the normal jackets I wear right now? If it would seem too strange, are there any similar clothes that are not as formal?

TLDR: Would it be weird for a younger male to wear formal clothes every day? (Waistcoats, Suits, Ties, Blazers)",27Sep2020,1

609,"Hey everyone, 

I picked up a job as a garbageman after I was laid off from my office admin job at a local tour-guide. Before the tour-guide job I was working at my families restaurant, where I was practically the GM. 

Anyway, I've kind of had a dick attitude at this new job. I often show up when I feel like it and don't really follow all the rules. The other day I send a text to my boss after missing a meeting basically saying that I can't hear another lecture about such a menial job. Now I'm embarrassed and guilt ridden. I don't want to go back, because it's hard to face people when things are so awkward.

 I think I need to start thinking about getting a new job. One that challenges me a bit more. However, I do have a tendency to run away from things and there's a part of me that thinks I should stick it out and make things right. At least try to leave on better terms. Overall I'm a bit of a man-child and I'm trying to correct a lot of that, and I've done a lot of good personal growth over the last year, but I'm on the fence about this one.

612,"So i work with this guy for about a year now together on a daily base and simply put, hes insufferable. He constanly talks down to me, literally thinks hes the smartest guy in our company and treats me like i cant tie my own shoes. 

Its very obvious that he isnt empathic or that he have any social competence, which isnt needed at my job, but it still makes the job so much worse.

I will leave this company in a few months, until i quit ive decided to let me bully and swallow my pride until i can finally leave this fucking place. 

FAQ: Why dont you tell your boss?
A: I dont want to start any drama a few months before i quit, i just want my peace.

Q: Why dont you defend yourself?

A: Not an easy answer. I know this might sound stupid but it doesnt really matter who you are, but i cant defend myself because i dont want to hurt anyones feeling. You could literally be hitler himself and i still wouldnt say anything - i wish i could, i know it doesnt makes sense, but i just cant, which is exhausting in its own way.

I tried it though. Turns out it only leads to unneccasary, steamy discussions anyway which are exhausting and lead to nothing. He treats me next day the same as if i just swallow his toxic behaviour.

Almost immediately on one of them I got an unauthorized purchase from which I immediately called my credit card company to report the fraud and get a replacement. My other credit card on the other hand never got charged for any unauthorized save a few tiny 2 dollar purchases that each time I could tell if they were fraudulent or automated from sites that I frequent such as twitch for example. 

Just the other day I got a 30 dollar payment that I did not make through a PayPal with my name on that same card. I called up that company and reported it, the whole thing. I told them that after checking my personal PayPal, that card is not even on it as an option so they canceled the card and are sending a replacement. My mind is at ease... that is until I wake up this morning to see an almost exactly the same dollar amount charge on the card that was just made and hasn‚Äôt even reached me at my address yet. 

I immediately deleted all but one of my virtual cards from my account that are linked to the main card (minus one to Amazon because a big purchase is pending). I‚Äôm currently working on changing the password to the account as well. The only thing I can‚Äôt tell, which is borderline giving me an anxiety attack, is which side of the line I fall on between someone having had access to one of my virtual cards, which automatically updated to the newly made card, or if I‚Äôm suffering some serious fraud/ god forbid identity theft. 

I‚Äôve checked all my other accounts for checking, saving, credit, all of it and I see no suspicious activity whatsoever.

When I ask myself what I want, from my heart, it's absolutely to move in with him. I love him, he loves me, and we get along well when we're stuck together for extended periods of time. I miss him every day when I'm not with him. But from a rational point of view, it really isn't the best idea. He's moody, I'm sensitive af and depressed, and HE is NOT too keen on the idea. He says it's mostly because he's never lived with a girlfriend, he's used to being on his own, and he doesn't know if he's gonna cope well. He does often say he wishes I would just move in with him, because saying goodbye is hard every time. 

I don't have a lot to lose. I hate my current place and the neighborhood, but I can't find any affordable apartment anywhere at this time. So I would be more than happy to split rent with him. But he's worried if it doesn't work out, our relationship won't work out. 

Should we just go for it and see what happens, even though we both have doubts?",27Sep2020,1

647,"First, I'm new here, I'm writhing it on mobile and English isn't my first language, so please excuse any nonsense. Also might add this will be mostly a rant, cause I just can't fall asleep, tho I'd really appreciate the advice. TL;DR: (I think it was written like that) at the end. It's gonna be long, so buckle up.

I really have no idea how to start or name this thing and maybe some background is a good start. Sooo, when my mom told the donor of bio material (as I call my father) that she's pregnant, he said that he doesn't want anything to do with the baby. Mom tried to explain that she didn't want money or anything from him, but just to have a relationship with me, he declined. Later on my grandpa, who passed away when I was like 4 (my only father figure), told bio dad that he would kill him of he came close to me (he was serious). That's what I know of the story, my mom never had a case opened in court against him and in my birth certificate there's no father listed. This I learned after gramps died, until then I was told that father had died of a stroke and honestly I'm thankful that mom told me that an early age.

Not gonna lie, my mom hasn't always been consistent in my childhood (still isn't and has always been a little cold), because she had always worked multiple jobs to support me. My grandmother, who was one of my primary care givers  along with my mother (tho grandma worked less than mom) 'till I was 11-ish became an alcoholic after gramps died (God, I miss him tons) and emotionally and verbally abused me. You see, I've come to realise that grandma is a narcissist and a control freak, who basically stripped me of any freedom as a child and didn't let me make decisions for my self (e.g. didn't even let me choose clothes for school). I got free from that ""prison"" when me and mom moved out. Later mom gave birth to my half-sibling, who on their part took away the little attention and affection I was getting from mother.

Throughout my life I had been feeling worthless and like a looser and have also been told this, also I had never had a so called ""rock"" to help me in rough times, everyone has let me down, even relatives. My only true and loyal family I consider my best friend, who's basically told me this: ""You know I'm stepping in the dark and don't know where I'm going, but at least you're here holding my hand and leading me"". The thing is I don't know where I'm going in this dark place, and there's no one to take my hand and lead me. 

I've tried so many things to make myself feel worthy of people's love or earn it. Like, I'm on top of the classes in my year, I've gone to multiple Google conferences as a participant, I have finished an Gourmet course paid by my school, I constructed a robot for a competition and kind of won kind of not, etc. But I can't help feeling worthless, weak, like a burden.

Here comes the problem. You know, how Facebook sends you notifications with people you might know  and the thing is I come from a really really small town. So last month the notification was for a man approximately the age of bio dad and his first name (I know only it and it has it's variations). It's been bugging me for a while. I don't know what to do, I just feel so so lost and lonely, cold. I just want some love, unconditional love.

Some other info: I'm 16 and trans guy, who's quite fond of girls. Mom is not fond of the fact, but is not the worst one either. So, yeah I'm quite the disappointment. And after grandpa died we moved to one of the biggest cities in my country. I'm so sorry I troubled you guys and I'm thankful if you've made it this far. Also I'm afraid to contact him, because mom will probably learn and I'm afraid of her reaction, tho it won't be bad, she will just be disappointed again, I think.

TL;DR: Some time ago Facebook send me a notification with a person, who I might know, appearing to be my father. I really want to contact him, but I'm afraid of everything and mom's reaction.",27Sep2020,1
648,"I had a panic attack about 2-3 days ago. It was a really bad one. I think the worst one I‚Äôve ever ever had. 

I‚Äôve been feeling really weak since then. I feel dizzy/lightheaded, I have no appetite, I feel drained, and uneasy sometimes. 

I noticed that before I sleep, I feel like my head tingly or something and idk if that‚Äôs me overthinking cuz again, I experienced a really bad panic attack. 

I‚Äôve had no appetite or such lately, but I‚Äôve been sorta forcing myself to eat. Today morning, I felt like puking. 

I vented to my family for the first time. It felt so much better. After opening up, I‚Äôve felt better mentally. 

I‚Äôve cried. I‚Äôve cried so much, my god. The most I‚Äôve cried in a really long time. I find myself just crying and I think this stems from the fact that I suppressed so much for a while. 

I guess part of me crying is because I‚Äôm tired and I just want to feel normal, but the more normal I want to feel, the more not normal I feel. Which again, is expected. Unfortunately. And possibly because I just need to cry?

After disappearing again for a few months, today I discovered she is living in a car, is broke, and is about to lose everything.

But deep inside me I know they love me but that's not the way that I can express myself too....

The person I love the most is my sister (from another mother) and it's the connection I feel with her is something which I can call what love would look like, we both can't live each other without texting each and everyday. I love her more than anyone else right now and due to that sometimes I've over-expressed myself or kinda over-reacted to my feelings... But now it's been a week since I've talked with her cuz she was feeling I was being too much over and she wasn't msgin me as she did before cuz this made her feel awkward... I decided to not talk to her for a while until she sends the text first...

Now my brain feels like I'm all alone and there's no one to whom I can say I love you ‚ô•Ô∏è and they feel the same way... I am really feeling empty on the inside and nothing is going well...

Idk maybe I'm just sensitive because I always tear up after an argument. I don't think he's trying to be funny because nobody laughs when he insults someone. I'm trying to avoid him right now because I'm going through a state where I don't feel like a good person and I'm trying to become better by doing positive things like, working out and doing Muay Thai after this pandemic. 

Anyways, I want to avoid him because I don't want to feel worse about myself. I feel sensitive and feel unconfident to do anything. I'm scared to confront him because he's probably going to tease my more and say that I'm sensitive. Or maybe if I talk to my parents they might think he's joking and I would have to brush it off. I'm tired of being insulted.

On Snapchat I posted about how the white people who benefit off black culture and have black friend support some of the most racist hateful things and I was speaking in general. He takes offence to it and we are arguing back and forth til finally he removes me off of Snapchat and says how he can‚Äôt handle my story and how I always talk shit about white people and I‚Äôm constantly bringing him in drama (mind you he puts himself in) and he can‚Äôt have his opinions and that he wants a break.

A few days later I text him and tell him that I don‚Äôt wanna be friends anymore and that I told him that everyone has a right to their own opinion but the livelihood of people should be an opinion and I wished him well and good vibes. But now he goes on a rant saying how I‚Äôm racist and that I need to educate myself and how I need to grow up and that I‚Äôm childish. Then he blocked my number. I tell a few friends and co workers about what went down and continued with my day at work 

I was sent out to go get something and he follows me out there and he‚Äôs trying to talk to me and I asked him to leave me alone and to stop talking to me and he continues to try and talk so I ended up just leaving. About 20 minutes pass and I checked my phone and he has his girlfriend text me talking about how I need to leave him alone and I need to grow up and stop being a victim when like dawg I haven‚Äôt done anything or said anything like I ended it with him.

Later that day at work I have to get sent home and it‚Äôs because he told on me saying I was causing problems at work when I‚Äôm trying to avoid him.

668," 

TLDR;  Roommate has a beef with a friend of mine. He trashed my things in the  garage, smashed holes into the TV, and ripped out my 1 year old ghost  pepper plant that finally started fruiting. Amongst a million other  things, this is the most recent.

Long  story short, he has threatened me, tried to intimidate me, poked me  /chest bumped me, etc for the last 5 years. Most of the time I just  ignore his bs and then he apologizes a few days later. I'm not even home  a lot of the time, or if I am I just mind my own business.

Firstly,  he rarely gets along with anyone and is constantly losing and getting  jobs because he is so volatile (hes a bartender who can fake nice).  Because of this, whenever I have a friend or two over, we would just  hang out in the garage and play nintendo or cards in order to steer  clear.

He originally said that  that was cool, and it actually ""keeps the tweakers and coyotes away""  from the alley which he condoned. He has cameras set up all around the  exterior of the house and blacked out the windows and has guns because  someone stole his weed plants in like Jan. (it was likely the sketchy  neighbors that moved in and were subsequently kicked out.)

One  of my friends (who used to be a neighbor) stayed over one night with  his 2 small ""toto"" type dogs which are not aggressive. RM's cat, which  he throws shit at and hits, will randomly swipe at you if you walk by.  He's scratched me half a dozen times.

The  next morning his cat had a laceration on its forehead and he blamed my  friends dogs for attacking his cat. By the pictures, you cant even tell  if its a bite or what. The cat was fine regardless. He told me to never  have the guy over again and was blowing up my phone for hours while I  was at work the next day trying to get his number. He eventually got the  number through a mutual friend of theirs and blamed him and called him  names etc. Which was like a year ago.

In  the last month or so my same friend would come over and hang out in the  garage and we minded our own business. My roommate would turn off the  power to the garage and lock the switch (which is not his) which powers  the security lights and all 3 units' garage power. Then he would watch  the cameras and claim that my friend was disrespectful by throwing his  cig butts in the dirt 5 feet from his parking spot in the alley (which  he didn't), or peed there (because I told him not to go in the house to  avoid conflict), and one time where he set his phone down on the hood of  RM's car and lit his smoke then picked it up, claiming he threw it at  the hood (I have this video), and if he parked or stopped in front of  his parking space (blocking him in) even though we are right there the  whole time and he isn't trying to go anywhere. We stopped hanging out in  the garage and I told my friend, just don't come by anymore.

About  a week ago, my friend got food from my work when I was getting off and  followed me home thinking I was gonna park and hop in his car to go to  the bar. My RM was outside tinkering with his cameras. So my friend  tried to talk to him wanting to apologize for any misunderstanding and  my RM said ""Ive got nothing to say to you."" then came in and yelled a  bunch of bs to me. I told him it's not my problem, you should talk to  him. I wasn't home for a few days and I came home to my plant ripped out  and thrown in the garbage, my half of the garage had my things thrown  all over the place, and my tv had 3 smashed holes into it.

He's  threatened to kick me out, which he has no authority to do, but he has  lived here like 15 years and is friends with the landlord. Should I file  a police report and can I get him evicted (during covid?). Otherwise,  what's the best course of action. I haven't seen or talked to him in  about a week until just now when I came home .",27Sep2020,1

672,"

Hey Reddit, I think my friendship is near death or absolutely dead. I just need opinions on what to do. So me and this girl have been friends for 5 years now. Since I was 15 and she was 12. No type of attraction or anything like that just strictly friends. We even lived in the same house for a year. About two years ago we got super close and have been ever since. We talked all the time, and always hung out and watched movies, etc together. She also has this other friend that has treated her horribly a lot of times and she's forgiven her because that's the type of person she is, which is good because I believe people deserve chances. 

Recently, in the last few months I noticed that she hasn't been really talking to me as much as we used to. I was always initiating the conversations, and trying to make the plans. So after I realized something was off I asked her if anything was going on and that I felt she wasn't really putting any effort into our friendship anymore. She said ""I'm sorry, you're right I'll do better."" So fast forward another couple of months I texted her one night and she never responded so I asked her if she was okay the next morning and she said ""I just don't feel like talking anymore"" I was like oh wow okay then. So a few days later she texted me and was like ""hey sorry for what I said the other day"" but I never responded because I wasn't happy with what she said and then she texted me again and said ""you want me to show effort but you won't text me back."" Then her twin sister texted me and asked me why I wasn't talking to her and I explained to her why and then I got another text from her saying ""she hit rock bottom last week and she's really sorry for it and I should look deeper."" But I can't read minds you know? 

So our friendship kept going and started to happen again but this time I realized she was doing Everything for her other friend and talking to her all the time and I was thinking to myself well I guess I'm getting replaced so I stopped talking to her for an entire day and apparently I was the worst person in the world for it because she cried and wouldn't talk to anyone that entire day. So I felt bad and started talking to her again. So now let's fast forward to this week. I try to make plans to go to a restaurant today, I let her know on Monday that we can go Sunday multiple times. She tells me she's had to babysit this weekend I said okay cool so we can plan another day. So I asked her what she was doing today and she said nothing and I said I thought you were babysitting the weekend and she said that was yesterday and I was like I thought it was the whole weekend and she said I thought you wanted to go on Saturday I was like noooooooo I told you multiple times Sunday. That's actually the second time she bailed on me for plans this week. 

*** When she didn't want to talk anymore , she did later tell me she was battling depression at that time but she's good now***

So I'm at the point now where I'm not sure if I'm the problem or she is. Because I need more opinions I'm willing to accept if I'm doing something wrong here but I'm not sure if she is or not. I'm thinking I should just drop the friendship now because I think it's fading away. She's still talking to the other friend everyday and drops anything for her to hang out. 
What do you guys think?

so basically my mom is travelling and taking the emergency debit card with her to another country (yes it is necessary for her travel and she can't not  travel) and my brother spends his monthly 1000$ allowance for shit and then ends up depending on the emergency card which is ment for only emergencies (hence the name) Today at lunch my mom told him that she would be taking the card with her and he tried to argue with her but it didn't work so he said he lost his appetite and left im already mad at him for that, second of all when my mom is about to leave to travel (we may not see her until like 2021)  he doesnt do anything so I tell him that she is living but he looks at me and goes back to playing video games, then my mom being the nice person she is goes to our room to say goodbye but he ignored her like she didnt exist because of the stupidest reason and that is what triggered me so much and thats why I want to make the next few days like hell on him(please don't try to change my mind just tell me stuff I can do to fuck with him and the pc is mine but he took over it when I moved out but I can do whatever I want with it)",27Sep2020,1

676,"My friend, say Mary used to be friends with Marie. I met Marie through Mary.

Mary and Marie had a falling out. When Mary and Marie tried to make up they couldn‚Äôt find a time to chat and eventually Mary said Marie wasn‚Äôt taking the conversation seriously enough. I am Mary‚Äôs closest friend. She was so hurt Marie wasn‚Äôt taking it too seriously because she had more to lose (a whole group of friends). 

Mary has told me i trigger her when I bring up Marie. When I post on Instagram she gets triggered. The other day she brought up that I triggered her by bringing up Marie. She tried to explain why Marie is abusive. Then told me I was dismissing her because I don‚Äôt agree. She got mad at me for mentioning Mary‚Äôs name a few weeks ago, I felt like she was holding it against me and it seemed out of place. 

Mary has also implied she would rather me not be friends with Marie. Altogether though, it‚Äôs too much for me, I apparently trigger her, her not wanting me to be friends with Marie, holding me accountable for saying her name, and then now trying to convince me Tamara is abusive, telling me I am dismissive of her feelings. (I‚Äôm really not). 

I believe Marie was hurt by Marys actions, and Mary didn‚Äôt care enough. They both have a right to their feelings however. 

I told Mary today that I‚Äôm setting a boundary, she can‚Äôt try and convince me Marie is abusive and not a good person, and that she needs to accept Marie and I are friends and that‚Äôs not going to change.

680,"I recently turned 18 and I feel really depressed because of numerous reasons. I've been really anxious about moving out, even tho thats what I feel I need to do to survive, but at the same time, I don't bother doing anything about it. I havent looked for a room or a job. I feel as if my life isnt mine, im just watching things happen. To cope with dissociating I've tried smoking and it helps to a certain point, it makes me feel sadder but at least I feel something real, I guess. I started to self harm again too.

I recently met a guy who I really like to be around with. He's 2 years older and already has his driver licence, so he came to pick me up once for a date, and it went perfect. I've only been talking to him for 4-5 days and I can already admit I wanna spend all my time with him. Yesterday he went back to the city where he's studying, 2 hours away from where I am now. 

That means I'm at my house, alone with a mom I hate, fighting my mind while I couldnt care less about it, and falling in love at the same time. I've been having constant headaches and insomnias. 

I feel so dissociated. While I recognise I like that guy, at the same time all I feel is rejection and hate, even though he has clarified he's liking what we have too. 
When im around him my mind just shuts off and stops processing, like im too tired to think. We've hooked up and while it was all happening I felt like it wasnt real.

Sucks that the only thing that keeps me grounded is self harm, and recently it hasnt even worked for me. I feel like I need someone to punch me so hard I start to feel real again. 

not asking for any advice really, just wanted to share my mind. but if you do know things that might help someone feel real and grounded to earth, i'd appreciate it",27Sep2020,1
681,"Got a job offer for more money (20%) but am hesitant for some reason...

Me: about a little over a year into my first gig out of college.

Current salary: $66k, work for a well-known corporate banking enterprise, great work life balance, great job stability, decent benefits, meh co-workers, great boss.

Offer: $85k, work for a low-key design agency, unstable work balance that comes with agency, uncertainty about job stability because of the pandemic + election, younger coworkers, seems like a really nice boss.

Current job counter offer: $71.5k, guaranteed promotion in 5 months to add an additional 10% ($78.6k).

I'm hesitant because I'm trying to think of the job AFTER my next job and how my resume would look by then - I also don't particularly hate my current job, but I also don't particularly love the job offer.

689,"Hello everyone,

As the title states, I've done something bad. Here is the meat of it, my best friend has a crush on someone who I was secretly conversing with . Secret meaning, I knew she had feelings for him, but I too had feelings for him, thus I didn't want to bring it to her attention and made my move in private. Said friend had told me multiple times that she was fine if I were to date this boy, then proceeded to tell me she was very depressed. I asked her if she was ok and she said no, but she has an appointment with a counselor next week. (This is a critical moment, as I was going to tell her about me and the boy during this encounter, but decided to bide my time because of her worsening emotional state). 

Fast forward to later that evening, the boy and I are watching a movie in my room, when my friend (who knows where I keep the spare key outside of my apartment) decides to let herself into my apartment at 2am because she was drunk and wanted to talk. She sees me in the bed with the boy and immediately leaves. The next morning I call her and apologized, I understand that I am in the wrong in this situation, and she claims that she does not wish to have contact with me because of the situation. I am still seeing this boy because we have feelings for each other. 

\*other important details, my friend is 5 years older than I am (27) and has never been in a romantic relationship, so part of me believes she is more upset with the fact that she hasn't found a boyfriend. We both work with this boy. The boy and my friend did not talk, or communicate outside of the group setting of our mutual friends. She had shown no direct interest in him, nor did he to her. She has told me a similar situation has happened in the past where she has had a crush on someone and they liked her friend instead. Yes I understand that I am a shitty person for doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to keep my relationship with the boy and my friend and if so how do I make things right with my friend.

tldr: my friend caught me in bed with the boy she has a crush on, who she said she didn't care if I dated, and is now upset. How do I make things right?",27Sep2020,1
690,"I posted this before, but no one really responded to me. Anyway, I am 17F. My older brother is currently 18M. Of the events I could remember, I remembered when I was in elementary school, my older brother who was one grade level above me taught me to hump my blanket in the private part of my body in front and between my legs (where the dick was located in males). I don't know if my brother knew he was sexually abusing me. 

A secret my brother did tell me was about ROMs and emulators. My brother would download a bunch of video games on a laptop where we played together and had fun. However, my brother kept telling me not to anyone else about this because emulators and ROMs were illegal.

Another instance I could remember was sometime in middle or high school during a state fair where my brother and I were just walking around. My brother once poked me, and I yelled out that was harassment.

Another instance is one day in my freshman year of high school, my brother (in sophomore year) would chase me running around the school. I made it pretty clear that I didn't want to be chased, but he kept chasing me and grabbing me. It eventually stopped when we got tired.

The final memory I could remember was in my sophomore year of high school. One day, I didn't feel like going to school and just stayed in my bed. My parents kept knocking on my door to come out, but I didn't want to go to school. My parents then told my brother to try to talk to me to go to school. However, he was angry that I was making him late since my parents couldn't drive us until I got out of bed. The worst action came when my brother literally kicked down the door of my room, and I immediately ran to my bathroom. I wanted to tell my teachers about this incident, but my parents refused to let me do so. When my parents finally took my brother to school, I grabbed a marker and scribbled comments all over objects in my brother's room about how abusive he was. When he got home after school was over, he was furious even though he kicked down my door in the first place. A couple of months later, my parents defended my brother's action by saying that I should have gotten out of bed and gone to school when they told me to do so.

I felt like I was abused by my brother. I still live with him, so I don't know what to do at this point. He never did anything against me for the past year so far, but his past actions still exist. I don't know if it was my fault or what.",27Sep2020,1

Both my parents are alive and well, they love way more than I deserve and we‚Äôre middle or upper class, I‚Äôm happy with how facilitated I am.  

The happiest year of my life was 2018. Before that I had little or no control over my life. In 2017 I got a bit of freedom, O levels had just started I was out of my house till 5am with friends I had managed to make when I was a kid and it had no consequence.  

Now even if I waste 2 hours of my day it costs me my soul and I waste twice that much because it‚Äôs sad how hard you have to work and I feel like this will go on till I die because it‚Äôs an endless cycle of pain and suffering which keeps increasing with every chapter of your life: school- college- uni- married life- then you‚Äôre old and pathetic but still have to work. Then you‚Äôre completely senile and you lay on your bed, to rest? No but because that‚Äôs all you cAn do. it‚Äôs like When you cross your 15 th birthday you‚Äôve signed up for a never ending cycle of misery. All you can do to stop it is take your own life which I would very very much like to do but guess what.. I go to hell? So all I can do is sleep every night wishing I pass away painlessly and going to college in the morning wishing I get killed in a road accident.  

To add to all that I have ADHD and very poor social skills. I don‚Äôt have a single friend online or otherwise who I could talk to about anything or just have a chat with.  

I know I‚Äôm just 18 and I shouldn‚Äôt even need any advice but what‚Äôs the point of living if you can never be happy? I see my father who makes good money still depressed because of how I am turning out.  

Again I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask and I really apologise if I wasted your time",27Sep2020,1
694,"My ex-wife was letting an older man molest my 13 year old son during our separation. I told my attorney. She mostly ignored me. The supervisor for visitation would not allow me to talk to my son about it.

At the next hearing my ex-wife not only agree to disclose that she had hidden an asset, but also agreed to divide it.

I was in complete shock. No one ever mentioned the asset before the hearing. I never thought that I would see it again because my ex-wife is greedy.

We each got $25,000 and my attorney got $80,000 to be held in trust.

I fired my attorney after the hearing. She went on to represent my ex wife without disclosure to me.

I was subsequently cut out of my children's lives. I asked the judge to tell my why. He could not give me a reason of any kind.

After my divorce I checked the attorney's website. She listed the judge as a personal reference and a former employer.

My son recently turned 18, so I was able to speak to him. He confirmed that he had indeed been molested.

I told my son to go to the police to report what happened to him. A week and a half later the judge filed an order on his own accord (and without a hearing) that I needed to have supervised visitation with my adult son.

I have three other kids with that mother. I have strong reason to believe that they are also being molested. I can't confirm that because I haven't seen them in over 6 years.

I made the appropriate complaints. The Commission on Judicial Performance declined to take any action.

I complained to the State Bar of Ca., who then started an investigation. I was forced to dismiss my complaint after I was hacked, harassed, stalked, threatened, and ultimately assaulted.

I've also spoken to the police. They told me that there is not enough evidence to investigate. After my son confirmed that he was molested, I went back. They said that since he is 18, he would need to report it himself. They also said that the sexual abuse that I suspect about the three others is separate from what happened to my son, and that there still was not enough evidence to investigate.

I am currently at a loss. The government officials within the Santa Clara County who are supposed to 'care', as well as within the State Government, already know what is going on. A small number of people have derailed me, while the vast majority don't want any involvement.



Does anyone have any suggestions?

697,"I started university 2 weeks ago and for a certain course the class is divided into small groups where we do exercises for two hours. The problem is that during these sessions we have to go in front of the whole class and we have to do and explain exercices in live.

This isn't something new, it was already a thing in high school to go to the front of the class, but the thing is that I struggle with this particular course and I'm literally unable to do that. I don't know anyone in my group and there's pretty high chances that I have social anxiety so I'm literally terrified that the teacher will ask me to go to the front of the class. On top of that, everyone think this course is super easy so I will look even more dumb. It's 100% sure that I will embarass myself.

When the teacher started explaining that we will have to go in front of the class I started to panic very hard and I ended up having an anxiety attack. My heart was beating very fast, I wanted to cry so bad, I was sweating and I couldn't think straight, so I asked to go out of the class and I broke down in tears as soon as I was in the hallway. I was crying and shaking, I couldn't breathe proprely and I could barely speak to the teacher's assistant that followed me in the hallway.

This never happened before, I never had an anxiety attack before so it scared the shit out of me. And it still scares me.

Now I don't know what to do, I have to go to these work sessions but it literally terrifies me to go back. I'm terrified to embarass myself in front of the class and the teacher and I don't want to have an anxiety attack ever again.

Does anyone have any advice for me or has anyone been in a similar situation before ? I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.

My sister just asked me to watch a show with her, but I said that I wasn't sure if I could. She got upset and I totally get why, I've declined multiple times just because I'm scared my eyesight will go bad. I don't know how to tell her about it.

703,"Question: **Describe a time when you worked on a challenge that focused on meeting user needs? How did you solve it?**

My answer:

""During my last project for my Masters's degree, I had to create a game app for children. Due to my university‚Äôs policy, I was not allowed to user-test with children. This prevented me from directly user-testing with children. In order to resolve that, I did some primary and secondary research by reading academic literature as well as interview parents and teachers. However, my client still wanted to receive feedback from children. 

I solved it by creating a detailed guide and instructions on how to user-test with children and surveys for children. As well as a clickable prototype on Figma of the app. These were shared with my client and parents so they could share them with children and user test. Afterwards, the results were shared with me and I made changes to the design accordingly.""",27Sep2020,1

705,"so i tend to compliment people a lot. just casual stuff, like ""hey, nice shirt"" or ""your makeup looks good today!"" (if it is obviously makeup, of course) and i was wondering if it is okay for me, a white female, to compliment a black person with natural hair if they have a traditional hairstyle, such as box braids, afros, dreadlocks, etc. ive done it before and had mixed reactions. one girl got offended over it, when i told her that i liked her braids(i don't know if there's a proper nane or not) , and i've started to think i did something wrong. of course i do not culturally appropriate, and would not even think to coly the hairstyles, but i just thought it looked nice and wanted to let her know i liked it.

I'm going through a very hard time in life, like my life literally imploded on me and the only thing I have left is a job and my dog. I currently am trying to work it all out but I'll be homeless for the next couple of weeks until money starts flowing again. 

Now it's getting cold in Oregon. I just moved out there so my support network is basically no one. I have family in Fayetteville NC and my Dad in Myrtle Beach SC, all I care about right now is my dog being taken care of and both my family and my dad said they'd take care of her until I'm in a position to take her back. 

My issue is that I'm only working with a couple hundred dollars and it's pretty far to get her where she needs to be. She can't stay with me bc of how my life is and if she did there's a possibility of her either dying, getting sick or stolen by other homeless people in Portland.

Idk maybe I'm just sensitive because I always tear up after an argument. I don't think he's trying to be funny because nobody laughs when he insults someone. I'm trying to avoid him right now because I'm going through a state where I don't feel like a good person and I'm trying to become better by doing positive things like, working out and doing Muay Thai after this pandemic. 

Anyways, I want to avoid him because I don't want to feel worse about myself. I feel sensitive and feel unconfident to do anything. I'm scared to confront him because he's probably going to tease my more and say that I'm sensitive. Or maybe if I talk to my parents they might think he's joking and I would have to brush it off. I'm tired of being insulted.

712,"Hi! I'm a current freshman in college. I actually used to live in the same city where I currently go to college, and I went to elementary and middle school there. This guy who's a year older than me went to the same schools, but we didn't actually become friends until I was in 7th grade. I developed a huge crush on him, but kept it a secret as I didn't know how he'd react and I knew I was going to be moving soon. I moved, and we didn't keep in contact, but we had each other's Instagrams and Snapchats. At the end of my senior year of high school, he added me on his new Snapchat. I was surprised that he remembered me at all, and I decided to start a conversation a few weeks later. We had a really nice conversation, and I learned that he actually went to the same college that I committed to! He told me to hit him up once I was on campus. We didn't talk over the summer, but once I was on campus, I snapped him and asked him if he wanted to meet up. He said yes, gave me his number, and we texted for about a week leading up to our hangout. We basically went out for lunch (he paid for my meal!!) and sat in a park and talked for hours. I had never connected with anyone like that before and we were laughing the entire time. The whole thing seemed really date-like and at the end, there was a little bit of silence and I really wanted to make a move but was too scared to do so (also there's high-key a pandemic going on, lol). I texted him afterwards telling him I had a good time and that he should hit me up whenever he's free. He told me that he ""definitely would hit me up sometime soon that week"" and that we should go around more of the city. I thought he seemed really into me, but it's been two weeks and he hasn't said anything. I can't stop thinking about him and I *really* want to see him again, but I feel like I've made all the moves so far. What should I do? Should I text him?

713,"I've worked with him for ages, and he was friends with my oldest sister when they where in highschool. 

It started because he flirts with EVERYONE. I've got a bit of a promiscuous reputation anyway, so it wasn't long until I hit his radar.

It started light, he would lean on me or fix my clothing. One night I was helping him after work and one thing led to another.. then it happened a few more times

And now I do basically nothing at work, since hes quick to do it for me (as inconspicuous as he can). Hes so sweet, he'll listen to me ramble on and on and knows what to say at the right time. Hes incredibly sweet and can make me double over laughing, and a few days ago he even said I was his (in response to a creep perving on me)


And the issue is, we cant be together. Even if we both left the job, other social issues (such as an age gap and being close with both my older sisters) make it a nightmare to ever bring him home, as well as a pretty toxic household environment.

714,"So we're moving in to our home and a neighbor introduces herself. She seems very nice, and is apparently very wealthy. She has a ton of good quality stuff she wants to get rid of, she seems to constantly replace perfectly fine things with brand new things - and we just happen to need some of the things she's giving away. So we gratefully accept some clothing and small furnishings for our place. How nice!

Well, other than being generous with her things, it turns out she's not very nice at all. She continually invites herself over. I put her off as much as I can but eventually give in. Then she talks and talks and talks, I can barely get a word in. And when I do, she tops whatever I say. If I've climbed a hill, she's climbed a mountain, that kind of thing. Fine, let her talk down at me. But then she insults how I decorate - in a really passive way. A ""zapper"" you don't see coming and can't believe just happened. If she ever asks a question, which is rare, it's only to redirect the conversation to herself. She talks badly about another neighbor even though this neighbor has been helping her out.

I've grown to absolutely hate spending a second of time with her, but I feel obligated because of the gifts she gave us, and also because I don't want there to be bad blood with someone I'll probably live close to for a long long time. But I dread the next time I see her, every time. I feel like a schmuck now, like I should have known ""nothing in life is free"", but I genuinely thought she was just being generous.

719,"Hey there, throwaway because I have a lot of friends/family on here.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a 6-year relationship (from 21-27), we broke up two years ago. For the first year of our relationship, he was cheating (unbeknownst to me). I found out much later, about a year after, but felt that he had reformed himself and things were good for a while. As we grew up, we grew apart, but as a lot of relationships go, the old, comfortable was hard to escape. 

For the last year of our relationship, I was honestly pretty horrible to him. I was very resentful, angry, and I had a lot of wounds, insecurity and anxiety from the relationship. I totally acknowledge my role in it - that's why i'm writing in. I really put him through hell. I blamed him for everything wrong with me, with us, I would ghost him, I would go to his house for an hour and then leave because I didn't want to be there - I knew I wanted out but I was afraid i'd regret it. I had to have caused him a lot of pain, and i'm very ashamed and guilty of it.

I've been in therapy for the last two years and have grown up a lot (I'd like to think, at least). I got into a new relationship that has been very healthy and happy for me, and it's really brought tremendous guilt and shame for how I treated my ex. Again, I am very over the relationship and honestly so happy and free, but I am wondering, should I apologize? How do you cope through disappointment in yourself through things like this? I am reading Brene Brown's book about shame and those feelings and while the general takeaway from that and therapy is ""it's not your problem to carry that"" - i am. and i'm wondering what the general public thinks or how others have handled this in the past.

He really reformed himself and did try and rebuild trust, I give him that.

724,"1. Personal financing - credit cards, credit scores, home loans, taxes, interest rates, loans, car investments vs leases, etc.
2. Handling insecurities - view your flaws as unique differences from you and others. Flaws are what make you you, are what make you special, and are what make you stand out.
3. Validation - Find meaning and purpose in your life other than doing what every other person is doing, find value within yourself and find what message you want to send to others. Value is not brought by the material items you own or the likes you have on Social Media.
4. Beliefs - Just because your parents behave, think or act in a certain manner, does not mean you need to do the same. Branch out beyond just your parents, and try to understand why they do what they do. Times have changed from when they were kids, what worked then may not be practical for you now.
5. Dependency - Similar to validation, learn your self worth and don't accept relationships that take away from you. Don't stay in something longer than you should if it no longer provides value or benefits to you. You will not forever be alone, and in the chance you believe that you will be, learn to find value in being alone. You get to do whatever you want, with no compromises, you save money, and your mind isn't consumed thinking about another person and their wants and desires. It's okay to be selfish if it isn't bringing harm onto others. Your next relationship is always better than the last.
6. Pressures - men, jobs, people, women, friends, parents, teachers, etc might put you in a situation where you feel uncomfortable or feel that you are not doing something that is morally aligned with your values. Do not give in. The awkwardness of saying no in that moment is far better than the lifelong regret or cringeworthy disappointment you might face if you say yes. When one door closes, another one opens. Always remember that.
7. Research - Research things before you do it, whether it is researching discounts, researching a job position and duties, researching others experiences about a situation, researching secret tips about something. Look into something before acting on it, you might find something that will help you navigate the situation more efficiently.
8. Trauma - Goes along with beliefs. Understand your traumas and how events you might have had may have shaped your perspective on the world. I had no idea a breakup from 5 years ago shifted my personality and beliefs as much as it did, and was considered a traumatic event, until I watched a webinar about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and started getting professional help about it. Trauma prevents you from enjoying the beauty of experiences and life. Work through it, or at least understand your trauma.
9. Substance Use - Understand why a large amount of Americans use drugs and alcohols, it is an escape from reality, but not a solution. Getting addicted or dependent on a substance is more of a hassle in the long run than actually solving the issue. Use substances for enhanced experiences or enjoyment of an event, but there is no need to get obliterated every weekend.
10. Information - Relevant primarily because it's 2020, but look into everything, question everything you hear or read. Anyone can write anything on the internet, yourself and myself included, and anyone can pass on that information to the next person in conversation. So with that, question it, research it. It can be overwhelming on where to start, but ask around, read different sites, try to make sure what you read is actually consistent among different sources. Also understand everyone has different experiences, so their beliefs or facts might be true to them, it does not mean it needs to be true to the fact, or true for you. So just educate yourself on what it is and make the best guessed decision you can with the information you have found.
11. Variety - Do everything, learn everything that interests you. Don't limit your skills to solely one task. Understand what your strengths are and what you are good at, and expand on those. You are able to learn new skills and traits too, it takes time and effort, but you can add it all to your list of skills you bring to the table. That waiter job you have now, analyze it, observe it, see how the business and management operates, study what makes that company and employees successful. That fast food job you have, understand how it has become efficient. That babysitting job you have, maybe study the interior design or how the parents parent their kid. You can apply all those skills and that information to your next and better job or opportunity.
12. Drama - What is important now will truly pass. Think about any grief you may have once had, from a death or breakup, or a hard class you took, and look at you now. Those feelings you had in that moment might not be as strong as time has passed. Don't make any drastic decisions when something seems overbearing, overwhelming or unmanageable. Take a breath, take a walk, go outside, etc. The feelings that come with that tweet that has resurfaced, or the accusation that has been made, or the new information you have just learned, will subside over time, and you will find a way to overcome it and carry on.
13. Goals - Enjoy the journey, because typically whatever goal you have is not actually what you told yourself it would be once you get there. The more money you make, the more money you spend. The bigger house you get, the more things you have to fix. The nicer car you get, the higher the insurance. The idols you want to meet, take shits too. The dream job you work to get, you will still be stuck with your same thoughts. You want to be famous, you lose your privacy. You can't escape shit, so its best you realize that now, and that you understand that reaching your goal doesn't remove all the struggles you currently face, you are simply just faced with new ones.
14. Believe in yourself. No one else will until you give them a reason to, and that reason is usually because you will have suddenly become of value or benefit to them.",27Sep2020,1

My boyfriend travels for work, and moves frequently from place to place, and I am currently in the last few months of my Bachelors degree, and work at a job that I am fortunate enough to have to earn a decent amount of money, but that‚Äôs about the only benefit. 
He recently got an offer, that is for a permanent position (as long as he likes it) to move to the other side of the country (we are both on the East coast), and the first thing out of his mouth was, ‚ÄúI want you to go with me.‚Äù We have been wanting this for AGES, but have not found the right timing where I wasn‚Äôt physically going to classes and where his jobs would be more permanent and stable, allowing us to build and grow together. We both feel that this is the opportunity to start what we want together. 
However, my parents are talking about it 24/7, constantly bringing up worries, questions, and how sad and heartbroken everybody in my family will be if I go, yet they say still support me and want what would be best for me. I do not dislike my parents, and they are not bad people, but they are kind of controlling and super nosy, and it drives me insane because I am naturally just a private person (I am 25, so you could imagine why). 
Due to being torn right down the middle, and very very emotional because I am sensitive and not looking to cause any heartbreak or bad blood and every time I go back home all I feel is tension and sadness, I am having the hardest time making a decision as to if I should move to the opposite coast, or stay. 
I have gotten the suggestion of waiting until the first of the year so I can finish my degree in peace, or to go ahead and go just to see if I like it, and if not, I can always change my mind and come home.

728,"A few months ago one of my best friends was diagnosed with genital herpes. Her and I are both women in our early twenties. I love her dearly for she has been endlessly loyal throughout our years of friendship, but she occasionally looses her moral compass when it comes to men and sex. For example, she has unprotected sex with men during a herpes outbreak. I fear that she will give somebody herpes and ultimately wind up in a legal situation because of it.

I am extremely sorry if this concern comes off as insensitive to anybody who has herpes. We are the same size in clothes and like the same stuff, so when she comes over to my apartment she tries on my things from bathing suit bottoms to jeans and it leaves me wondering if this is unsanitary considering her herpes. 

I'm unsure what to do about these issues, but mostly about the fact that she has unprotected sex during outbreaks. I know that it is her life and her body, and I simply cannot use all of my anxiety up on her issues for I have my own, but I am very concerned and unsure what to do.",27Sep2020,1

What I love about you. (I go on to explain really rare details that I love, relate to and also have) You are legit the girl of my dreams. Please tell me what's wrong, it can't be that bad. I'm going to feel bad about messing this up forever. I realise I've lost such an amazing person. I think you're overreacting. Don't follow common things people say about something like this. I'm nothing like the common things said. You barely know me. I don't do this. I can't believe I am. I just can't help the way I feel about it. I'd do so much for you.

Listen I was on reddit for a long time, years in fact and then you appeared, gave me a chance, you're so nice, I read over and over our months of conversations. Everyone I meet in life is so not as nice as you, they put me on guard I was giving up. One person online who in all the years I've been here, has stuck around, they are an ok friend, it's so common to ghost online. You were the second longest to and I thought I was safe with you because we were trying to have a relationship so I opened up for the first time ever anywhere. Not everything I said was serious. Much of it was outright unnecessary and I'm definitely not the same, I wanted you to witness how I come to my senses, it's when I impress myself the most, but you left, it's not even that bad, in hind sight; I wanted you to see how to do that for yourself. I just want you to know that I'm not messing you around. I want to become a great developer and start living, I know I can. I have studied it so hard, and I'm so driven to do this. I want to share the journey with you, you get it so well, I know you like that since once I'm there, it will be so different. I like the way you are also driven and ambitious. I'll be good to your journey too. I didn't mention it but I was actually saving up to come see you.

I thought you weren't for real so I pushed you away in disbelief. You're the only one I've done that with and the only one I've felt this way with. I don't even care I still love you no matter what and will be what ever you want. I apologised for how I was, I apologise again. I was not supposed to put those things on you. You are the only one I feel good with, well if you also feel good about it that is and if not, it's worth figuring out. A big part of why I was the way I was, it's not as bad now, my parents were splitting up and I couldn't tell you out of knowing you were already quite upset with your own thing, my normal sense of life was changing dramatically. I want to work it out, fix it between us and get back to being ourselves. You should know the real me. We both have our problems which is perfectly ok, everyone does. We don't have to talk all the time if you don't want to, I understand that, do what makes you feel good, I'll always be around as company for what ever reason and I mean that. I want to send you cute things and random gifts and be an uplifting energy for you, I want to be another reason that you are happy with no obligation for you to return the favour.

Just one step at a time. Take a minute to think. Lets chill, what's up?

\---

I'm sure she has moved on now, there's no chance for anything to happen anymore. I'm just feeling so empty and left in the dust. I can't believe I'd ever meet someone like that. It was legit a rare thing. I have dreams of talking to her with a huge sense of something missing. I wake up crying sometimes wondering why I'm crying. Now some of this is to do with me just being a lonely person. I've always been lonely and I think I've forgotten how to deal with it as well. I used to love how on my own I was. It was beautiful. Now there's a spirit there keeping me humble. I'd much rather that be a real person but I doubt they'd ever be able to make me feel the same. That's ok because I understand that sometimes in life you have to change.

Thanks so much.",27Sep2020,1

735,"So I already know I have ezcema, but due to distance and finances I am unable to see a dermatologist. I have dozens and dozens of medicated lotions which help some, but at work I can't seem to get relief for dry, flaking, cracking skin on my hands.

I apply lotion at work constantly, but I think since I work with glossy paper and matte finish materials my skin will dry out again a few minutes after applying lotion. Lotion also poses a problem when handling products at work, as the lotion visibly rubs off on some products and that has to be wiped off. 

I'm just sick of the skin on my fingers constantly being dry and cracking. Any advice is helpful.",27Sep2020,1

My goal is to be able to live off art, at least 50% of the time (the other 50% could come from a day job).

I'm so fucking lost and confused. No one in my fucked up family or backward, tiny little village (in Central Europe, but still ‚Äì the fucking irony ...) has studied or done anything like I want before, so ...

737,~7 years ago~ When I was about 5-7 I was in my mom room playing with my sister 6-7 (forgot what age) and then my big brother came in 17 or 18 and so we starting playing with him (basically me and my sister would be under the cover and he would try to grab us and drag us down playfully) and he got me and pulled me down and I was (fake) yelling at my sister and then we kissed (we didn't know what sex was so we thought kissing would say us it was a little kiss on the lips) and our brother saw what we did and started yelling at us and he whooped my sister and me and I ran downstairs and waited for my mom to come home then I told her and I don't know what happened after that.

749,"TW: Domestic violence, abuse

Background info: I work at a small shop owned by an older married couple. For this post, I will be calling the husband ‚ÄúDave‚Äù and the wife ‚ÄúSusie‚Äù (not their real names). 

Because this is a family owned business in a small town, I‚Äôve known Dave and Susie even long before I began working for them. Even when I was younger, something about Dave just gave me a bad feeling. Now that I‚Äôve started working for them, I‚Äôve began to realize things that I think might be the reason why.

-Although the store is owned by both of them, Dave requires Susie to do most, if not all, of the daily management work. He may occasionally come by and supervise everyone, talk to a few employees or customers, but that‚Äôs about it. 

-Dave does not let Susie have a personal phone. She had a cell phone, but he then started making her leave it at the store when the work day was over. If myself or other employees have to contact them outside of work hours, we have to either call Dave‚Äôs personal cell or call the landline, from which Dave can monitor the conversations Susie has.

-Dave and Susie converted from being ‚Äúregular citizens‚Äù to being Mennonites about a year before they opened the shop together, meaning that Susie had to give up a lot of things that were important to her life and has begun serving a more ‚Äútraditional role,‚Äù and working at the store, despite being a college graduate who once earned a very high wage. Obviously this isnt an issue if it‚Äôs the lifestyle that makes them happy, but Susie has revealed to me once during conversation that it was Dave‚Äôs choice for the two of them to make this life change, not hers.

-There‚Äôs other small behaviors that are really questionable as well, such as sexist jokes that I‚Äôve overheard Dave making in the breakroom (despite 90% of the employees at the shop being women), or the fact that Susie seems to be constantly worried about whether or not things as insignificant as how boxes are stacked in the storage room would make Dave happy.

All of these things seemed fairly unimportant at first, if not a bit odd or uncomfortable, and they didn‚Äôt start to be concerning until a few days ago when I was cleaning the shop after closing. I accidentally spilled some of the water from my mop bucket onto the floor, and I went to grab some towels to dry it up, but Susie began freaking out. She was on the verge of crying and sounded terrified, talking about how Dave ‚Äúgets very upset with her‚Äù if people spill water on the floors. I asked her if she was okay, but she clammed up and refused to talk anymore. We cleaned up the water and then hid the towels from Dave, but she still looked scared when she got in the car with him to go home.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do about this. As an abuse survivor I know I might just be reading too far into this because of my own past, but I‚Äôm seriously concerned that Dave might be hurting Susie. All of my coworkers seem to love Dave and have none of the concerns that I have. I don‚Äôt know who I can ask for help about this situation so I‚Äôm hoping some of you can help me.

Am I overreacting here? Is there anything I can do to try and help this situation? Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.",27Sep2020,1

She‚Äôs currently studying to get into grad school in mainland China and I‚Äôm in my senior year in university(SF)

The reason we broke up in the first place was bc at the time, she was uncertain of her future and wanted to figure out what she wanted to do in life.

765,"Okay so this is my first post on Reddit, bear with me as Im uncertain on how to do all this üòÇ
Also on mobile ‚úå

I got kicked out of my moms house in April right as I turned 18. My mom has alot of mental issues and has been trying to kick me out since I was 16, but couldn't legally evict me until this year. Because of this, I hastily moved in with my boyfriend and his parents, who were gracious enough to let me stay with them rent-free until I moved into my college dorms, which was in August. 

In 2019, my dog, Stripe, passed away, and my mom wouldn't allow me to get another (yet, she got her own dog in this time üòí). Stripe was my best friend and my emotional support animal for 5 solid years, even though he was never registered, and his loss took a very heavy toll on me. I would say that Im still greiving over him, but its definitely not as painful as it used to be. When I moved into my bfs house, I figured I would get another animal to fill the hole he left. I asked my bfs mom if this would be okay with her, since its her house the animal would be staying in. She agreed, but only if the animal I got was a cat, since she has two other cats who definitely don't like dogs. I felt like this was perfectly reasonable, and I eventually got a kitten from a friend of mine.

I got my cat, Morty, in late May, and he was not even 6 weeks old, but my friend couldn't afford to keep him or his siblings, so I took him in as a bottle-fed kitten. He quickly warmed up to my bf's mom's cats, and grew very close to them in the few months I lived there. My bf also warned me that his mom would grow very attached to my cat, and she did. 

When I moved out, I couldnt take Morty with me because my dorms only allowed registered ESAs to live there. He obviously wasnt registered then and still isnt now, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Bf's mom agreed to take care of my cat until I have everything sorted out. My bf has since moved out of his parents house to move closer to me (Im two hours away now) and he got his own apartment here. Said apartment allows people to have cats and dogs, but only up to two total. Bf wants a dog now that he's able to, and this has created a few problems for me. 

My cat absolutely hates dogs, so Im hesistant to bring him to the new apartment since it will have a dog living there soon. Morty has a nice life right where he's at right now. He loves the other cats he lives with and he definitely loves my bfs mom, so even without the apartment, I was sort of split on whether or not I should have Morty move with me. I would be taking him from everything he's known for almost his whole life. However, Im also very attached to my cat, and Im sure he could eventually get used to having a puppy brother, but I'm willing to do anything thats in his best interest. 

So I've been thinking a lot about letting my bfs mom keep Morty. Theres alot for me to consider, so Im very uncertain on what I should do. On one hand, Morty is currently happy where hes at and bf's mom loves him (even though he is almost always an AHüòÇ) and I dont want to take him away from that because it feels unfair. On the other, Id be losing the animal I'm already very attached to and already paid all the vet bills for. Bfs mom has agreed to repay me for the vet bills, but I couldnt possibly take her money for it if I make the decision to let her keep him, since shes been so kind to me. Another good thing to mention is that she and her husband are moving into a substantially smaller house in the next few years, and I feel like the space would be too cramped for three cats. Especially since Morty is a very hyperactive cat, while the other two are lazy loafs. 

Im already swaying towards letting her keep Morty, but Im just so uncertain about making the right decision for both me and my cat that I'm just inbetween choices. 

I do have the potential to get another animal soon, but Im not sure that I'll properly be able to bond with it like I did for Morty and my dog before him. Having an animal that I can pour all my love into is a necessity for me to be able to cope with everything thats happened over these past few years.

Ive heard plenty of advice from my friends, but nothing theyve said has helped me make a solid decision. So I entrust you, my fair strangers on Reddit, for your advice and your opinion on what decision I should make.

766,So let's say I want to start learning something and I have a hard time getting motivated. Also I've been having a pretty hard time emotionally for a long time which also makes being motivated pretty difficult.

I have diabetes, type 1 &amp; I feel like it's a pretty dangerous situation to be in since I dont know what my coworkers do during their days off and who they interact with. So any of them can have the virus and easily spread it to me.

773," Hello, I live in an apartment and my downstairs neighbour's ceiling fan is causing a slight vibration across the majority of my living room floor and it is especially able to be felt directly under my desk where my feet are most often. My landlord refuses to simply just maintenance the ceiling fan downstairs so it isn't so aggressively vibrating and is having maintenance people come into my apartment to feel if the vibration is real. It is very annoying having the bottom of your feet constantly vibrating, it is similar to your feet being asleep. The vibration is hardly able to be felt while standing due to the weight of ur body suppressing the vibration where you stand and it is most intense around my desk, this is not good because the maintenance people aren't going to have sympathy and will not want to sit in my computer chair in a specific spot. 

So I need to come up with a DIY solution for under my desk, what I have in mind is cutting out a square of finished plywood and attaching anti-vibration feet meant for washing machines, as well as attach some padding for my feet which will probably be these super cheap yoga mats I have.

My concern is if those anti-vibration feet for washing machines and stuff will work to keep the vibration from my floor off the plywood? Or any other ideas that could work that I'm not thinking of? 

I think the anti-vibration feet are the best option because I also need the plywood to stay close to the ground so it is like a normal sitting position. I think isolating the vibration to the small surface area of the rubber feet will be better than a large surface area like an anti-vibration mat. 

 I have tried stuff like thick yoga mats, blankets, even an ottoman lid, I have tried turning off everything in my apartment and nothing in here is causing it. I can put my ear to the floor and hear the specific humming that comes from ceiling fans. So at this point, my only option is a DIY solution. My chair has a leg rest but I don't want to have my feet up constantly, so the foot hammocks and stuff like that won't work, the footrests on amazon won't work I don't think due to the large surface area on the floor or too small of rubber feet.",27Sep2020,1

776,"Throwaway... but here's the question...

As embarrassing and sickening to me as this is, I have completely demolished my relationship with my mother unknowingly.  I am 17 years old (male), and have always had anger issues when I was younger, and today, it has gotten better, but I am far from perfect by any means.

Today, my mother and I got into it for a quick minute or so, just yelling matches as always, and by the end of it, when we were sort of calming down, she told me the reality of our relationship, that it is nonexistent.  She told me about how I always berate her and never want to answer questions or anything, which is all true, not on an on-purpose level, but I just get upset whenever people ask me stuff about school and stuff.  I don't do this to my father, but I do get into yelling matches with him as well.  My mother tells me I don't respect her, and I believe her, but not because I know or choose not to respect her, but because of my actions in the past and present.

I never meant for this to happen, I LOVE my mother, more than anything, but I have burned this bridge to ash, and I don't know what to do.

I wish I could cry about it, but my body won't let me.  I have no clue why I act out towards her or disrespect her more than anyone else, and I do not say this as trying to make people feel badly for me, because I am not the victim, she is.

Is it possible to subconsciously hate somebody??  I don't hate her, but she feels I do, and I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm disgusted in myself, completely and utterly disgusted, but the whole thing just feels ""grey"" in my mind, if that makes sense.  I don't hate her, but she feels I do, and everything I have ever done proves her right, but I feel no hatred, the exact opposite in fact.

Am I a narcist? Sociopath?  I don't understand at all.  

Explaining how we got to this point would cause me to have to tell my whole life story, which I have no interest in doing.  I'm just numb to the world at this point, and I wish I could go back to when I was 5 and start everything over again, because I have burned all the bridges I possibly could before I reached 18 years of age.  What is wrong with me? I have ADHD, that's it.  I have seen hundreds of different doctors and psychiatrists over the years, that's all I have, I only have ADHD, why can't I just act normally and be a good kid?  Why do I only feel this numbness towards my mother?

777," I recently finished my master‚Äôs degree and, in order to work in my field and for multiple personal reasons, I need to move to the US. I can either:

A) move to DC where there‚Äôs plenty of work in my field and the metropolitan feeling I‚Äôm comfortable with

B) Move to New York where I know plenty of people

C) move to Denver which is close to family and has many jobs, but is too small for my taste

D) Something else??

I‚Äôve spent my entire adult life in short term sublets in different countries and cities. The city I live in now has been my longest commitment (a little over 1.5 years). I used to enjoy this lifestyle, but I now realize how hard it is to have a nice lifestyle (friends, job, apartment, relationship) when you aren‚Äôt settled somewhere.

I want to live in one place for the next 10 years at least. But I haven‚Äôt been in America much, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd like and wouldn‚Äôt.

How do you find a long term place to live? Which US cities have a high quality of life? How do you keep from constantly moving, but remain upwardly mobile in your personal and professional life??

now that i‚Äôm 18 i wanted to find her, and most adopted kids do. i did a DNA test a few years back and had spoken to a second cousin who i yesterday found out is my great aunt. i got to call her and learned so much. 

she knows my mothers parents but has never met my mother. she has met my uncle though. now here‚Äôs where things went south. my mother had a bad past with drugs and has sever heart issues now. 

my great aunt talked to them and told me that when i was about 2 my mother came back and said she had an 18 month old son in foster care and had put a baby girl up for adoption before him. a family member tried to take my younger brother but unfortunately due to his abuse in foster care they couldn‚Äôt take him. 

my grandparents said they wanted to find me after they found out about me but didn‚Äôt so they didn‚Äôt mess up my life.  they still have this worry now and are debating if they want to talk to me. 

of course i am completely fine with them not wanting contact and will respect that but i can‚Äôt help but be sad. my brother went through so much in foster care and my poor mother is 39 and has a pace maker and other things to keep her heart working. 

i feel like i should be happy cause i will stay in contact with my aunt and her kids / her close family as they want to have contact with me and she‚Äôs gonna send me family photos. my grandparents even agreed to let her send ones of them and i‚Äôm beyond happy and excited but still sad. i‚Äôm not sad that i might not get to meet her as i never really expected to i just can‚Äôt help but feel bad she‚Äôs possibly suffering. 

the other thing is she had a 3rd kid no one knows anything about other than they exist. i want to try to find my brother, i don‚Äôt know if we share a dad or not but maybe one day i can find out. he is about 16 now. he knows about his mother and about the family but i don‚Äôt know if i should wait till i know he‚Äôs over 18 to try to find him. 

if anything i feel i should try to find his adoptive parents and ask if they‚Äôd be okay with me contacting him but i don‚Äôt know.

can i try to find my brother or should i wait or should i not at all?",27Sep2020,1

I‚Äôm not breaking any new ground here by saying that 2020 is an indiscriminately hard year.  I recognize it‚Äôs been hard for everyone financially and emotionally, but I could really use some guidance.

My girlfriend of 11 months is going through a divorce (the process has been delayed by several months because of the pandemic and a very messy custody battle).  Throughout our time knowing each other I‚Äôd moved into her old house, but were forced to move out so her friend and her husband could move in and fix it up to sell it.  We moved into a temporary house and then moved again to where we are now.  Both houses were and are too small for our family of four kids and five pets.  It‚Äôs hard to keep clean and organized and we‚Äôre always having to scrimp together cash to survive and fix up a house we know we aren‚Äôt staying in.

I was furloughed from my old job, so I got a data entry job working at home, but that proved impossible having to constantly monitor the children with their online school.  I‚Äôve had to sell my car and some rare collector‚Äôs items I own to make sure we won‚Äôt starve.

On top of all of this, I‚Äôve been forced to move out because of a bullshit legal dispute between my girlfriend and her ex-husband.

Hi All,

For a bit of back story a few years ago I met a guy at a party and we kissed at the party. I never heard from him until years later when he contacted me saying he was in my country now and wanted to meet up and that we should date.

I politely told him I was not interested. He however persisted to the point that I had to block him. He was not taking no for an answer and told me things like ""I'd never meet a guy half as good as him"", I would be ""lucky to have him etc"". I blocked him for months but he used other numbers to ring and text me during that time. Some of it was sweet like him saying he thought we could have something special, some of it was downright abusive calling me names and just hurling insults at me. It would go back and forth between being nice and then mean.

I found out recently through a mutual acquaintance of ours that he has been living in homeless shelters for over the past year in my country. For reference I'm not in the US. I'm in a European country where it is quite easy to get a job and accommodation.

In his last message to me months after I blocked him on a new number he said he had a new girlfriend and he wishes me the best. Our mutual acquaintance confirmed to me she saw that on facebook and sent me a screenshot. She also sent me the screenshots of him making sexually suggestive comments to her after he got a girlfriend. I find that disgusting to begin with but the woman he is dating has 2 kids from a previous relationship so it feels like its kinda worse.

I do know he is in a really rough homeless shelter in my city and I feel really sorry for the guy as I genuinely think he is mentally ill. Our acquaintance said he needs money to go back to his home country. I know its not my responsibility or anything but I am just really worried about him being in a shelter here at winter time.

Do you think I should give our mutual acquaintance money to give to him or just let it go? There is no guarantee he would not just spend the money immediately on other stuff. He evidently I have heard from other people smokes regularly and has a bit of a drinking problem. I'm just conflicted as the logical part of my brain is telling me to stay away from him completely but my conscience says I should help him as he is living in a homeless shelter that is dangerous. What do you think?",27Sep2020,1

Heres the thing, I cant do it anymore. My life is complicated and it just got worse recently. My sister (28f) and i are trying to convince her to move in with her but shes several states away a place she has never been. Shes now planned with my tio(m56) to move in with him but several problems.. He's had A Lot of alcohol abuse history, he has to get a downstairs apt anyways and they both plan on his two daughters (17 and 18) to take her to the bathroom and personal things like that. 
They havent even asked them but I think it's awful to put that on them. They are so young to have that kind of responsibility. This stuff isnt easy, the getting up at night is not easy. I think its so wrong to place this on them, this is full time. Plus, I tried getting them to stay with her for a day and they wanted to babysit their niece instead. I can't do it anymore but doesnt mean i dont care and i want to be sure she will be okay. Shes even saying to go to a nursing home which she has been and it was an awful experience and we don't want her to. 
Idk, what could I really do at this point?",27Sep2020,1
794,"I‚Äôm 16 F. Yesterday I went to a hair appointment my grandmother set up for me and during this appointment. During a lull in the conversation she asked me if i even cared for her because i wasn‚Äôt talking to her. The comment really upset me and I started to cry but I lied and told her that I was overwhelmed with everything else going on. (I‚Äôm not overwhelmed, I got accepted into my dream school and high school right now is easy to manage.) But I felt so awful lying to her but we were in public and I was not about to start something in the salon with everyone there. For background, I have three sets of grandparents because my mom was a widow and we remained close with my brother‚Äôs side. My grandmother on my brother‚Äôs side passed away last year and all three families felt united in a way. Everything was going well, but then yesterday happened. She told me that I must speak to my other grandmother more or treat her better than her. She then went on and said that I shouldn‚Äôt be crying or feeling lonely because I can‚Äôt see my friends because they‚Äôre really not that important. She doesn‚Äôt believe I can handle myself in college and that I should stay in state and close to my family. She‚Äôs also a high school counselor so of course she ended the conversation with ‚ÄúI can help everyone else‚Äôs kids but my own.‚Äù And then laughed. I felt absolutely destroyed and trapped in that moment. Later in the evening my mom did something to piss me off and I blew up at my sister and i felt so bad (I apologized last night). I told my parents what happened and my dad confronted her today and it sounds like it didn‚Äôt go well. But my question is, how should I move forward? I have so many milestones coming up that we‚Äôve been waiting for but now I don‚Äôt know if I want her there.

796,"Hey reddit, 

I‚Äôm 23F and am considering a complete career change. My family aren‚Äôt being supportive at all and I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm just being unrealistic.

I have a physics degree and have been working in finance for a couple of years. I find it really boring and I feel like I want to do something more worthwhile with my life.

I love animals so have been considering going back to university to become a veterinarian. I‚Äôve quit my (fairly good) finance job and I‚Äôm now working for minimum wage with a bunch of 16 year olds cleaning poo and feeding birds. I‚Äôm trying to get work experience in a vets to see exactly what it involves but with Covid I‚Äôm really struggling to find anything. 

Should I train as a vet, the earliest I can go back to university is at 25. This is assuming I get into the competitive course on my first attempt. I would graduate at 31. 

My family‚Äôs concern is that it‚Äôs too long to get qualified. This is a worry I share.... I‚Äôd always assumed that in my 30s I would have bought a house, maybe starting to think about kids. Not graduating. They think that I was starting out on a good, solid career path and I should go back to finance or something similar and start saving for a house.

My family are also concerned I may be rushing into this suddenly after the grief of losing my mother a couple of months ago. We were very close and her death was a huge shock. They worry I‚Äôm not making sensible choices right now and I should try another career path with less training. 

Honestly, her death has affected me deeply and it‚Äôs partially what‚Äôs spurring me into being a vet. I had a huge existential crisis about how life is short and how I‚Äôm only going to be here once, so why spend 40 hours a week doing something that I find mediocre? If I could do ANYTHING, what would I do? And the thing I kept coming back to was being a vet. I wrote a list of everything I want from a career and nothing checked all the boxes as well as being a veterinarian did.

A huge part of me wants to continue to pursue it. However, my family do have some sensible arguments and it‚Äôs giving me doubts. Maybe I am being unrealistic, and I should just stick with the easier, lower risk option. 

Any objective advice would be really appreciated because I‚Äôm so confused. My old job has said they‚Äôll give me my job back if I start again within the month so I have to make a decision soon.",27Sep2020,1

Should I even mention to one of them that I‚Äôm trying to get the other to accept their apology? Or should I keep silent and let it go, and wait to see if they get back together as friends (which I‚Äôm having a hard time believing that would even happen anymore). The difficult part of this is because we ALL work together, and we ALL have the exact same shifts. We also all live literally next door to each other.

My problem is I was raised that men are tough, strong, and that the only acceptable emotion to show is anger. I was on drugs and alcohol bad for a long time partially due to this more than likely, and have been clean now for four years. Its been tough not knowing how to deal with feelings of inadequacy, just being less than, and a general feeling of not belonging.

808,"i'm 15 now, (f) but i still feel 8. i feel 8 and 80 at the same time. i've always been called mature for my age and i never really fit in with my age group. i rushed through my childhood assuming everything would work out once i became an adult. now that i am a teenager, i regret that a lot because i feel like i've missed out on so much. i'm halfway through my teen years, and so far they have been nothing short of disappointing. i don't have any friends and i have really bad social anxiety. i'll be SIXTEEN in a few months, which many consider an adult. the thought of me being 16 is so foreign, that's such a big and scary age and i just want to freeze time and be 15 forever. i don't want to move on to the ""next chapter of my life"", i don't want to go to college and move away from home. i don't want to get a job, i'm just a kid. i just feel trapped in regret. i regret everything i say and do, i recognize that i'm wasting my teen years but i just feel so stuck, with social anxiety everything is impossible and i can't even leave my house. and i know how much i'll regret that when i'm older but i don't know what to do. 

i just want some comfort. i don't want to be old. i get sad when i look at old people because almost all of them have some mental/physical medical problems and they're all too tired to do anything. no offense if you're old, i love old people but i have breakdowns at the thought of being old and wrinkly and too exhausted to get out of bed, reminiscing on my youth and regretting how i let fear get in the way of so many opportunities. 

i feel like i'm running out of time. so many people have accomplished so much by the time they were my age or younger, and i'm just here, hyper-aware of my existence, overanalyzing everything about my past and future instead of just living in the present. it's so bizarre that i'll be 20 in five years. shouldn't i be 12? 20 is so big. that's an adult. i'll be halfway through college. i don't even know what i want to major in, it seems like everyone else my age already has their life figured out. either that or they're partying and enjoying their youth. i'm sorry if i'm coming off as jealous or lazy. i'm just scared. i really don't want to grow up. any advice??",27Sep2020,1

813,"Not quite sure how to explain this properly, but-- This girl's like a sister to me. She practically lived at our house over the summer and still stays over every weekend. I spend a fair amount of time with both my sister and her, and she's a great kid.

Anyway, I heard through an unreliable source (my other brother) that he overheard her telling my sister she has a crush on me. Now, I don't necessarily believe his word. But at the same time, I don't want to wholly discount it. I think I'm able to recognize the signs of a dumb crush and I think it's in the realm of possibility she might just feel that way about me- I don't mean to sound full of myself or anything, I just don't think it's necessarily impossible. The hope is that she grows out of it and it never comes up-- I am most certainly not a pedophile and to be frank I'm uninterested in relationships with people even my age. But if for whatever reason *she* ever admits to me that she has a crush on me-- I'm not quite sure how to react.

815,"I'm  (F21) using a throwaway because this will include some uncomfortable details, so *trigger warning*.

When I was 15 years old, I'm pretty sure that I was sexually assault by my boyfriend (also 15) and for years it has been playing on my mind - I have a lot of guilt and shame surrounding it. 

When I say boyfriend, at that age all we had done was kiss in private, no physical activity had ever taken place (except for hugging and hand holding) or even really been talked about between us. 

My guilt and shame is because I had been drinking. It was at a silly teenage house party (the legal drinking age in my country is 16, so yes we were all underage) and so it was one of my first experiences of being drunk. 

The party was outside with about 30-40 people, and I remember stumbling around outside until he and I and a few of our friends went and sat on the trampoline in the middle of the garden. I was in and out of consciousness whilst sitting there, and the next thing I remember is him trying to kiss me and leaning onto me, and my friends were trying to pull him off of me, I only remember hearing a voice of one of my friends telling him to get off, and she later told me that she tried pushing him off of me.

Then the next thing I remember, is briefly waking up and realising that my skirt was pulled up and he has inserted his fingers into me, and that's the last thing I can remember. I couldn't move, speak, or acknowledge what was going on, but I was aware of what was happening for only a brief moment until I lost consciousness again. 

Apparently I was making noises but honestly I have no recollection of doing so, and this makes me feel shameful too because it makes me question myself. 

I then remember being awake again, very confused, and he was gone along with everyone else on the trampoline. I was just laying there by myself. I sat up, and then saw him running around to all the boys at the party asking him the smell his fingers. He was chasing people around, laughing and making faces as if he was disgusted by it. I immediately knew it was about me (especially because we were dating), and felt extreme embarrassment and shame. 

I eventually left the trampoline, I remember feeling embarrassed and shameful but nothing else, as I wanted to pretend like it never happened. I was confused and unsure of what really took place.

I walked past one of the boys who was by the trampoline (and I assume saw it take place because almost everyone seemed to be looking at me), and he was stood on a platform of sorts, and he faked a kick at my face, making me jump. I stopped and forced a laugh, and he said ""I could easily kick you in the face from here"". I stupidly laughed again and said ""nice try, go on then"", and then he full on kicked me in the nose, giving me a nose bleed and bringing me to tears. I then left the party for that reason, when one of my friends saw it happen. 

I don't know why that last bit is relevant at all, but I suppose that was the last thing to push me over the edge and feel shameful for everything that took place, and I used that final event as my reason for being upset and leaving the party. 

I was terrified of being in school from then on, but I wanted everything to be normal, and I wanted to be non-existant. I never spoke about it to anyone, including my parents, as I saw it as an incredibly embarrassing event on my behalf. I saw myself as stupid, and I think it gave me an intense anxiety around all if my peers. Many people made fun of me, and when I had the courage I would laugh along with them. One of my friends tried to speak to me about it, but I just said that I remember nothing and that I was embarrassed for being a drunk mess. 

Was this sexual assault?

 I feel a lot of guilt and shame, but perhaps I am overreacting to something that I am only now facing? I have no intention at all for bringing it to anyone's attention, other than simply opening up to my parents because I'm currently getting therapy for it along with an abusive relationship that I used to be in and so I feel like I should open up to them. 

Should I tell my parents, or should I move on in private with the help of my therapist? If you were a parent would you want to know this?

I feel as though I have been carrying a lot of negative feelings with me, including that towards my self worth. I wouldn't say that it 'haunts' me, but I certainly detest the idea of it ever taking place, and I think it relates to me trying to normalise negative things that have happened in my life.

Sorry for the long post, and I would really appreciate any advice. 

TLDR: I think I was sexually assaulted as a teenager by my boyfriend of the same age in front of my school peers. I don't know if I am overreacting to the event, or if I should tell my parents? I would like to open up the them but perhaps it would be better to move forward because it took place 6 years ago?

819,"I just wanted to see your guys' opinion and what do you guys think I should do. So when I was a very young child I never thought about how much a healthy family foundation is. Up until recently where I've been reading a bunch of articles on how family shapes a child. I have always had to face my parents arguing constantly, they were and are never affectionate, my mother always told me I can't be verbal about my feelings and what goes on in home to other people. I remember I had a couple breakdowns, depression phases in my teens and series of panic attacks. And because of all this I have struggled to cope during my Sixth form years. This is because not only did I have reoccurring images in my head that I will come back home where my parents argue, but because they never loved one another I felt like I was always stuck in the middle. I still feel like this. The person that keeps causing this pain is my mum she's always put unrealistic goals for me, compared me towards people, told me its better not to have a child like me because of how pathetic I am. And I know I'm not because I've achieved such high GCSE's, very good A levels and I'm off to university. I'm not going to lie my academically strong side has kept me going because even though education can be draining at times especially where my mental health is, its the only place that has helped me survive through my teens and will when I'm going to go to university. However, I feel like I will face a series of obstacles because my mother is very toxic, she is manipulative and she always shouts at me, and puts me down, this so severely affects me  . The shouting at me since a young age has gotten so bad that when I hear people raising their voice at me I get panicky and I will get an anxiety attack most of the time. This situation causes me to cry so so so much. Over the course I've developed anxiety/depression/ I am extremely sensitive, I have insomnia and  I feel like I have symptoms of a personality disorder ( however that is not diagnosed). She also threatens to hit me and my dad and there's times where I am scared of her.  And I know some people will say ohh move out, I can't because Im not financially stable and its hard to walk away because I will feel lost, and confused and scared. Alot of people tell me I am strong because I've dealt with this since I was 6 but I don't feel that way, I feel numb to pain at times but I still feel it.

821,"Her moving in with her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with me and I don‚Äôt want to make it about me. They‚Äôve dated for 3 years and he got the opportunity to move out and he asked if she wanted to move with him. She said yes.

I really should be happy? I just know that those times it‚Äôs taken her 48 hours + to respond to my texts, it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs been with him. And I‚Äôm the one she contacts the most of her friends. Since they got together I see her maybe once a month. It used to be like twice a week.

I know we‚Äôre growing up, and that the next step is to sort of find your SO and build a life with them. Honestly, I hope to be the fun aunt that can come babysit their kids one day while they go on a date or something. 

I truly am worried that if they move in together, she‚Äôll just never have time for the rest of us. I have other friends of course, but she‚Äôs the one person I can just do nothing with for hours and still be content. Do I tell her I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to forget me? Or do I bite my tongue and congratulate them? Or both?

She told me over Snapchat and I just replied back with a video saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I should congratulate you or bully the fuck out of you‚Äù which is just our humor. She send me another snap asking if I figured it out yet. I didn‚Äôt reply. She‚Äôs send another one I haven‚Äôt opened.

I know I‚Äôm being horrible and not very supportive right now even though I want this for her. I‚Äôm having one of those days where everything just kind of hurts? Not just because of this. 

It‚Äôs kind of out of the blue, which she said so herself. I don‚Äôt wanna make this about me, I‚Äôm just a little worried. I can‚Äôt relate to her at all, and she can‚Äôt relate to me, because while they have their ups and down, their relationship is great. My relationships have all been so toxic and abusive that I can‚Äôt even imagine wanting to wake up to a partner every single morning. I really don‚Äôt understand how she would want to prioritize her boyfriend over her friends.

So yeah, should I voice my worries? Or just keep them to myself?",27Sep2020,1

I (18M) was being intimate in the bathroom because it's the only room with a lock and I feel more comfortable here rather than my own bedroom. 

I was getting it on and my brother (17M) asks for his toothbrush and if he can come get it. I'm used to my family being respective when I tell them to wait a little and I expected the same but when I refused him getting in, he basically ripped the door open (our lock is not even a proper lock, it's like a very cheap henge) and he caught me with my hand around my penis, because obviously, I didn't expect this to happen. I was so baffled I just sad still and he doesn't close the door, he walks right in and just acts like he didn't see anything.

Idk wtf to do know, this is VERY weird and my brother and I don't get along very well (that's probably why he did it) but the fact that he just walks in and carry on. I feel like I can't tell anyone and if I told my parents they would probably do nothing cause he's always aggressive and can't be controlled.

I‚Äôm a shy not super outgoing person guy but I absolutely hate being alone. 

Aside from the gym, work, biking. Netflix, watching NBA, I really have nothing to do with my time (never had hobbies in my life). I spend hours driving alone or just lying in bed doing nothing. 

How can I make/meet new friends? What can I do to change my life?

827," Hello r/Advice Community, 

(**Before you read**: I managed to do 3 Years of College, I didn't go further due to mental health again... it got really bad again... Ugh, it's like a cycle how it ruins my life... Anyway, I'm much stronger in myself and I just need some encouragement from anyone who wishes to support me on this journey I'm yet to find myself on. It's worth mentioning that I do have an income but it's from my freelance work. That's all I can say for now, I just hope anyone who's older than me will be able to give me some great advice! Thank you!) 

I apologize if I‚Äôm bothering any of you with my post for wanting advice on something that maybe sounds stupid. I don‚Äôt know, I just feel like I‚Äôm being a burden on all of you by posting this. It‚Äôs taken a whole lot of courage within myself to post this today. Long story short, I‚Äôm starting to worry that I may not be thinking in the right mindset. It‚Äôs been many years of being trapped by mental health and I‚Äôve finally started to take that control back within myself. I‚Äôm really proud of myself and I want to finally be able to move forward with my life. The main problem I have is one that I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate to. I know that there‚Äôs no single answer or solution in this and I‚Äôm aware that some of you are going to disagree with me and that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm okay with all of you sharing your opinion and I actually would really appreciate brutal honesty. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve found myself in a situation where I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I used to work a pretty basic job but it was still good enough to keep my life on track in terms of financially. I‚Äôve got so many people telling me that I‚Äôve got potential to go onto bigger and better things but I don‚Äôt know where to go. Like how do I find resources or anything that could help me find something that would be able to keep me afloat and possibly allow me to do something I truly enjoy and maybe one day make it be successful. I know this sounds like a big ask from you all. I‚Äôm sorry for that, I just wish I had the answers for this. I‚Äôve seen so many people around me follow their dreams or at least get something that‚Äôs allowing them to look great financially. 

Do you have any advice or tips you could share from your own life experience? I‚Äôm just looking to rather go into trade because that‚Äôs what my aunt has told me I should at least try to do. My hobbies are writing, drawing, singing, music, video game development, working in a team, etc. I may have more like I wish that I could go into acting or do something that involves that kind of work. Anyway, I just want to know if anyone could point me in some sort of direction so that I can then discover a path that will give me hope. I want you to know that I‚Äôm trying to be more confident about this and I‚Äôm trying to be strong while feeling miserable that I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out what to do next‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm a failure deep down but I didn‚Äôt want to admit that. I just hope someone can help me with this situation :(

I‚Äôve probably worded this incredibly badly and I don‚Äôt even know if I can put my feelings into words. I just hope someone can understand and I truly will hope that someone will be able to give me some sort of reply. 

Thank you for reading! I truly appreciate it and I appreciate any help you guys can give me!

Im rather shy and quiet but I opened up when I found out he is also into raving/drugs etc. Btw im super super nice which he might have misunderstood. I smile/blush a lot but thats because im rather shy. Anyways he asked for my insta at work and I gave it to him (as friends I thought). I mentioned that i was going to a rave later that night and he said he is jealous but he will be chilling with his friends and that im welcome to come (all guys) if i want but that he knows i wouldnt cuz i have plans (raving).

833,Ok so this has been bothering me for a few weeks now. I just started my sophomore year of college and I had just gotten moved in. I met my roommate and he seemed like a really cool guy. He started asking me to hang out and so we did. For the first 2-3 weeks of school we hung out almost every day. We would go out to eat and hang out. He was talking about how he was so happy he finally had a good roommate and one that he likes. He was talking about how we would have to try all these good restaurants and how there are some places in his hometown (which is around 2 hours away) that we‚Äôd have to visit sometime. We hung out a lot and one time we were talking and he asked me a question and it came out that I am gay. He said that it didn‚Äôt bother him at all. But then after a few days we stopped hanging out. Like really at all. We went from hanging out almost daily and being really good friends to nothing. I don‚Äôt really know what else could have caused it besides me being gay. Nothing had really changed until I said that and then within a few days we just stopped hanging out all together. Do y‚Äôall think that it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm gay? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking it or not but that‚Äôs the only thing that changed. We Snapchat but haven‚Äôt hung out in almost 3 weeks.

835,"I have a bad habit with texting that stems from years lacking direct human contact because of severe OCD.

Because most of my contact occurred through the internet (and phone) and was with people i didnt know in real life (and would lie a lot to because i was young and bored), electronic communication for me is linked to that time in my life when i was lonely and just living fantasies through it. I also used to talk to people just to have my thoughts heard. It never felt real and neither did they.

This problem has persisted with real communication with people I actually know.

i often send too many texts or i go on tangents or i tell dumb white lies for no reason other than i can because i feel disconnected from reality again/like this person is not real once that phone is in my hands. It's only when things get serious that i remember ""oh wait this is my actual person, im not just talking to myself.""

I dont mean to do this, but i know it has ruined a friendship of mine because i end up talking at instead of to them and i say shit that doesnt need to be said/i wouldnt say normally.

I was just trying to casually reach out to this person and i found myself doing it again. I apologized and im not going to text them anymore but i feel embarrassed, ashamed, and lonely. Especially because i know this person did not want to talk to me anyway.

How can i stop this? I obviously cant just not use a phone forever, but it is so deeply ingrained as a coping mechanism at this point idk how to stop it.",27Sep2020,1
836,"Hi everyone,

I need help with how to approach my younger brother in a way that's mature but also firm.

Background info: I (21 F) live at home with my younger brother (18) and our two parents. My brother just graduated from high school this past summer as a straight A student with honors and all the other fancy accolades that you can achieve in high school. We were all super proud of him, celebrated it, gave gifts, etc.

The problem, though, is that my brother refuses (and has refused for a long time now) to do literally anything for himself other than doing well in school. He only started showering daily/taking care of himself when he was around 16, but aside from that, he doesn't do anything that even remotely resembles basic upkeep. He's in college now but schoolwork is easy for him so that's not the concern for me.

He doesn't clean his room (it's literally a mess 24/7) and only does laundry when his entire basket is overflowing, despite my parents literally pushing him to do it so he can have clean clothes. He needs to be reminded to take out the trash in his room because it's overflowing. His desk is covered in used dishes (even though he's not supposed to eat in his room because we've had issues with bugs). He puts up a huge fight whenever we ask him to do literally any household chore -- clean the bathroom that he and I share, vacuum his own room for the sake of cleanliness, even washing his own car are all things that he will only do if you harass him nonstop for a day or two (sometimes more). Oftentimes he will just ignore everyone and I'll end up resorting to cleaning up myself because I simply can't take it anymore.

My parents kindly encouraged him to get a job the last couple of years, not because he has to pay any bills or because they want to charge him for anything, but just so that he learns some responsibility for himself and to have some extra pocket money in case he wants to buy something and my parents aren't around to cover it. They never pressured him by threatening to kick him out or anything like that; they wanted nothing in return other than seeing him enjoy the fruits of his own labor. He refused to get a job or even seriously look for one until the last 6 months, and in the end, he finally got a job through me and my office but only because I got the job for him. My parents bought him his own car and asked for nothing in return (he doesn't even have to pay for gas), but even then, he refused to get a job until someone else took care of it for him.

Now that it's time for him to apply to colleges and continue on to the more ""serious"" part of life, he's putting it off until the last second. He threw a fit last year when my parents didn't want to pay overpriced tuition at one of the fancier universities in my state (California), but now that he's ready to handle it on his own/take out a loan in his own name, he still hasn't submitted any applications to transfer or done any research about what he wants to do next with his life or where he wants to transfer. He waits until the last second for everything (this deadline is in three days) and he absolutely refuses to grow up and handle his responsibilities on his own.

He's a good kid, with no issues related to drugs, recklessness, or anything else that a typical ""troubled"" teenager would do. He literally sits at home (when we're not at work) and either watches soccer with his friends or does schoolwork and then returns to playing video games or more soccer. I'm talking 70% of the day is just him sitting in front of his computer or watching movies. We have to harass him to get up and do anything more than the bare minimum (I'm talking showering and doing his own laundry) and even then, it's like pulling teeth. The only time he leaves his room is to eat lunch or dinner with us.

Last side note: today I asked him to take my car to the car wash while I was out shopping for groceries with my mom. He didn't even have to pay for the wash -- I would reimburse him once he got home, and I thought it was a reasonable request because we carpool to work 3x a week and I drive every day and only ask for gas money occasionally. He argued tooth and nail that he couldn't go because he was watching a soccer game and that he would do it later. Fast forward to when I'm home from shopping with my mom and he's *still* sitting in front of his computer doing absolutely nothing, and when I (visibly irritably) ask why he hasn't taken the car, he simply shrugs and tells me to take it myself since ""you're home now"" and I can ""do it myself"".

How do I deal with someone who refuses to take care of himself, and who won't do anything for anyone else in the family? Is this just how normal 18 year old boys are and I'm just too high maintenance? Am I asking for too much?

TL;DR 18 year old younger brother skates by doing the bare minimum and is seemingly indifferent about anything that doesn't involve his immediate interests and hobbies.",27Sep2020,1

839," 

Me (25F) and my bf (26M) have been dating for 3.5 years.

He has lived at home with his parents for the majority of that time, while I have gotten a job and my own apartment. We both live in the same state, but I moved closer to where he is because I'm not incredibly close to my family anyhow. So he and I live about 45 minutes away from each other.

But I've been struggling emotionally lately as it relates to this relationship. His job is a temp job, and in his defense, his job truly is 60+ hours a week with a long commute, working every day of the week, and not knowing when he will get a day off until last minute. I don't want to be selfish, but in 5 months I have only seen him twice, and only been on a date with him once, mainly because of his schedule. He runs some events for his work, and he originally told me I could go to some, but then since told me he wants to keep his work and personal life separate. So he only invited me to one, but it was super last minute, and I had a prior commitment. Recently, it was his mother's birthday, and all the women in his family planned a party for her together...but I never even received an invite, let alone got asked to help plan anything. Granted, my boyfriend was working and couldn't go. Additionally, even before he started this busy temp job, we would only see each other once every week or two. He says he will probably move to a new city after this job. When I asked what it meant for us he said ""you can follow me there and live with me if you want."" But aside from that he talks about moving in in the future, talks about ""when we are married one day"", etc. it sends a lot of mixed signals. Another really random thing that concerns me: after 3.5 years, we do not have one picture together as a couple because he won't take one with me unless I beg him to.

For example when I bring up these things to him:

\-About the party: he said his family loves me and that I need to stop overthinking things, and that I am welcome over his house any time to see his parents, even when he isn't there.

\-About not seeing eachother: he says it will get better once his temp job is over.

\-Photos: he doesn't like having his picture taken. He's too camera shy.

He tells me all the time how much he loves me, cares about me, etc. and talks about a future with me, but I see a big difference between what is being said and what he is doing.

I see a future with him. I want to be with him. But I need him to step up. I don't need his world to revolve around me, but I need some commitment. I've asked for a set time we could call eachother each week. He says okay, but then it never happens.

Tldr: I love my S.O. so much and see a future with him. When we are together, and even when we are texting or talking on the phone, it is clear that we are great for each other...aside from him not having time. He is really busy and I don't feel as involved in his life as I should be at this stage. I've had these conversations with him a lot. What would you do? I know he is definitely working a lot right now, and that it's a temporary job, so I really don't want to seem like I'm not understanding about that.",27Sep2020,1

    I had 4 cats and now I only has 1. They lived with me for more than 5 years (oldest of them 10 years old). There are no particular cause for their death. Three separate mornings I woke up and find their dead bodies. It's all just very sudden because they have such a huge presence in the house. 

    Traumatising childhood memories that my mind kept buried away recently got triggered somehow and I remember unpleasant things that I really would rather not remember especially about my family members.

     I was also almost got murdered by a family member.

All of these happened in the past year and I just feel like all the fight has left my body. I used to be opinionated and now I don't even have the energy to care enough or love people I care about. Everything is tiring to do and I don't even know what to live for.

How do I get back the fire and energy inside of me? Or how do I face my family members whom I am close to but remembered them for who they once were? 

I don't have any specific advice to ask for, but can someone please tell me where do I go from here?",27Sep2020,1
846,"So let‚Äôs call him Leon. Leon just turned 15 and started going out with this girl, let‚Äôs call her Samantha. They‚Äôve been going out for a week. Today he was in the shower and decided to call her. That‚Äôs just something they do, it‚Äôs not a sexual thing (at least as far as he tells me), he just does it to tease her because she likes it. She probably likes it more than he does, to be honest. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs harassing her.

But today her dad picked up. Being in the compromising position he was in, Leon hung up as soon as the dad said hello. Now this is how her dad responded. He called again, and Leon didn‚Äôt answer. He texted her saying that ‚Äúyour dad answered‚Äù. This is what the dad, who was still holding her phone, texted back.

‚ÄúAnd so fucking what I am her dad and your to much of a little bitch to answer when I said hello or answer your phone when I called back if you can‚Äôt talk to me then you can‚Äôt talk to her. Understand?‚Äù

Even if my friend wasn‚Äôt in the shower and panicked, it would be a little too much for a response like this from anyone‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs dad. You‚Äôre HER dad, not his. This is how Leon responded.

‚ÄúOk. I wanna know something. Why are you so much of an ass to talk to a kid like that... I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Treat others how you wanna be treated. This convo is over. Bye.‚Äù

This is what her dad said. ‚ÄúDONT be a disrespectful little shit when an adult says hello you say it back and don‚Äôt hang up‚Äù

So after that the girl gets her phone back, right after this. Which seems to imply to me that she knew her dad was using her phone to talk to her boyfriend and only asked for it back when she realized things went sideways. Leon is understandably upset, and he says he can get her dad in trouble for being mean, or whatever, but he also made a good point that it was inappropriate to want to call him while he was in the shower. If he got to say hello to Leon, he must have heard the shower at least, and he still called back.

But Samantha was defending her dad the entire time. I can understand and respect this. She said she‚Äôd choose her dad over her bf any day. But when he brought up the part about him being in the shower and being able to get him in trouble for being inappropriate, she first said she (and her dad) wanted to start over, before suddenly saying she was breaking up with him.

I‚Äôm not sure what the situation is now, I guess it‚Äôs not over yet but, I just wanted to know. How was Leon supposed to handle this? How should he continue to proceed after this? In fact, I was the one who pointed out it was creepy of her dad wanting to call when he was in the shower, and being so mad that he didn‚Äôt want to when Leon hung up. I feel maybe I didn‚Äôt do a good job of advising him? How should this situation have been approached?",27Sep2020,1

848,"I'm an 18 year old Georgian Male living in Tbilisi. And I'm having issues with my appearance. Im very insecure about it.

When I was a kid, I was probably the most handsome kid in the entire grade (I'm not saying that just to cope or larp, im being dead serius). I got attention from girls and in maybe 3-rd or 2-nd grade, I remember that my first crush kissed me on the cheek. I didn't know how to respond, since it was my first experience, but I just walked away. I remember being described as cute, smart and good looking. I had my first kiss with another crush a few years later. I just went up to her and kissed her, she kissed me back. For some reason, in both cases, I never continued my relationship with them, idk why. I was a social, fun, athletic kid back then, and I was at the top of my classes.

But things changed... a lot...

Since I was 12, I have had continuous weight issues. Im now sitting (not standing because Im a fat fuck) at 28 BMI. I have also had mental issues, such as social anxiety and depression (medically diagnosed) which I'm trying to overcome even today.

The issues with my appearance are as follows:

1. due to high BF% my face looks wayy to round
2. Shitty haircut, don't know what style suits me
3. Huge ass nose. Im from caucasus so a lot of people have that trait, nearly my entire family, i cant live with that
4. But this one pains me the most, I have a shitty chin, it looks as if its recessed (it probably is tbh). My lower third is super weak. I have some dental issues and my jaw is a bit fucked, so im hoping that once i fix that, my jaw will move forward, but I doubt that.

Bros i wanted to ask you, how can I fix my jaw/lower third and how can I overcome depression? I know this is not the best sub for me to post this one, but I feel like I can relate to you people.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",27Sep2020,1

853,"This one has a bit of backstory. In my freshman year of high school (I'm a sophomore) I met this girl who is in the same homeroom as me. She has an amazing personality and is super caring. At the start of this year, I realized that I have a huge crush on her. I was looking back in my notebooks from last year, and found a sheet of paper where we said hi to each other. I thought that that would be an amazing opportunity to start a DM chat with her to eventually lead to asking her out. I sent a picture of it to her, but I then realized that she won't see it unless she tries to start a DM with me. My plan is to at school tomorrow (Monday) tell her that I sent her something on Instagram so she'll see it and get the chat going. So that's my plan for tomorrow. But right now, I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack. I was shaking and felt extremely nervous. It almost hurt to talk, so I wasn't letting anyone talk to me.

854,"Hi, I‚Äôm currently stuck between a rock and a hard place and I need some major advice. I fell in love for the very first time with this girl 2 years ago and although we never progressed into a relationship, we were best friends and nearly inseparable that entire time. This, of course, never helped me fully get over her and although I‚Äôve improved drastically, there‚Äôs still a part of me that‚Äôs struggling to let go. Back in June, she moved in with me because she works in the same state we go to school in but her family lives in a different state and being the awesome best friend, I let her move in with me! Before classes started, I moved out of my dad‚Äôs place and into my first apartment with a mutual friend of ours being my official roommate (she‚Äôs living with us until she finds her own place). Ever since she moved in with me back in June, our friendship started falling apart because I realized I would never fully get over her if she was always at my hip as my best friend and when we moved into the apartment, it just got worse. She started sleeping in my roommates bed (all platonic, or so I thought) and she basically dropped me as her best friend for the sake of ‚Äúgiving me space‚Äù and ‚Äúletting me heal‚Äù and immediately moved my roommate into my old position as her new best friend. This hurt like no other and I‚Äôm currently battling those demons but these demons must‚Äôve been trained by Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather because wow... Anyways, I‚Äôve always had suspicions they were fooling around due to the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù sounds I‚Äôd hear at night and I‚Äôve confronted her a few times and she always gets overly upset and makes claims like ‚Äúwhy would I do something like that?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt look at him that way‚Äù and things of that nature. I also confronted him and he‚Äôs a bad liar but this time, he seemed like he was being genuinely truthful. I had no other choice but to believe them although my spirit never sat right with their answers. Now onto the icing on the cake. They went out yesterday night (Saturday) for a ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù as he said and they would be back later that night. They didn‚Äôt return until this morning (Sunday) in completely different clothes and she claimed they went to a friend‚Äôs birthday celebration and had alcohol so they didn‚Äôt feel safe driving home. This would be completely understandable but there‚Äôs holes in their story like the fact that they planned on coming home so why bring an overnight bag? And the fact that they didn‚Äôt decide to go to the birthday thing until after they had already left so they should‚Äôve had to come back for clothes but they already had a change of clothes and whatnot. Lastly, shortly after they got back, they left to go to the tennis court and I saw her book bag was left open so I figured I‚Äôd take a look and I found lingerie, lace panties, massage oil, and her night clothes. I wanna go ahead and say that I have no issue with them fooling around because they‚Äôre consenting adults with full control over their bodies and their actions but when I initially confronted them, I asked that they be upfront with me if something happens between them so I have a chance to cope on my own instead of finding out in a less fortunate way. Unfortunately, this is the less fortunate way i was trying to avoid and I‚Äôm gonna confront my roommate tomorrow morning about the holes in their story and ask him to tell me the truth while presenting my evidence and I‚Äôm hoping he finally comes clean and tells me they‚Äôve been lying this whole time. After he comes clean, I plan on telling my ex-best friend that she is no longer allowed here and she needs to find another place to stay immediately (she moves into her own apartment on Thursday so she‚Äôd only need a place from Monday-Thursday). We have another mutual friend in the complex she can stay with and there are also cheap hotels in the area she can stay at if she doesn‚Äôt want to stay with our mutual friend so she has options. At this point, I don‚Äôt really care if she sleeps in her car for all i care but I‚Äôm just completely torn up from her being my first love, me never being able to fully stop loving her, her fooling around with my roommate of all people, and her lying to my face multiple times. 

If you were in my shoes, how would you handle it? Is there a better way for me to handle it? Should I even say anything or should I just keep it to myself?

I also wanna add that I‚Äôm a HUGE over thinker and the curiosity/unknown drives me to severe anxiety which is why I simply asked that they be upfront with me so I can just accept it and not have to overthink every little thing",27Sep2020,1

858,"I don‚Äôt know what else to do at this point. 

My friend was divorced in January because her husband randomly up and left her and their young daughter and decided to move in with his new girlfriend who he‚Äôd been seeing while they were married. Their marriage wasn‚Äôt a good one; she always found him on dating sites and spending money on camgirls without telling her. He never tried to hold down a job and always berated her for trying to get a college degree. 

My friend has had a tough time coping. It‚Äôs dissolved the last shred of confidence she had and she‚Äôs barely kept afloat as a single mom in college. I‚Äôm like her only friend and I‚Äôve done my best to be be there for her and listen and give advice however I can, but I‚Äôve been urging her to go to therapy for months. It can be expensive but the university has free services and maybe her insurance covers some of it too, I don‚Äôt know she won‚Äôt look into it. 

He‚Äôs all she‚Äôs talked about and she expresses no interest in moving on. I understand, it‚Äôs still fresh. I‚Äôm just trying to help her have some other interests besides him. 

Now he‚Äôs broken up with his girlfriend and they‚Äôre talking again. I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs going to cave and let him back into her life and try to make things work. But he‚Äôs done this time and time again and I‚Äôm positive that he‚Äôll hurt her again and she‚Äôll have to figure out this whole mom thing all over again too. It‚Äôll probably affect their daughter worse as well. He hasn‚Äôt visited her, talked on the phone, or paid child support. 

Is it wrong for me to urge her against this? Maybe he‚Äôll change and they can live happily together, but I doubt it. Do any of you have advice about what she should do, or how I can help her?

871,"Yo, just some backstory I'm currently (17 M) from a small town in the north of Ireland, the events in the story took place from around about September 2016 - April 2017 we where both around 13 ish.

Note: Was never the best at English in school so forgive my wording and sentence structure. I'm also an extremely shy and isolated person with social anxiety and problems talking to girls in general I also over think little things and details to the point of insanity. 

Ight, so it started the summer of 2016 I eventually got up the courage to message my crush at the current time and we became friends I started  hanging out with her and her friends outside school and we became rather close with both of us exchanging personal information and worries we had with each other. During this time I also grew close with her group of friends one of them being my 2nd  cousin and I kinda acted as there councilor or someone they could talk to get something off there chest or to ask for advice etc, one of these interactions occurred in November 2016 when my cousin had just broken up with her Bf at the time and was extremely distraught and fell into a deep depression going as far as to cut herself and trying to OD on what I'm guessing was painkillers, Thankfully she managed to get over the break up and from what I last heard is doing fine.

Anyways, a couple weeks go by and we're hanging out after school when my cousin randomly takes a pic of me (unknowing of me) and posts to her story for some reason. Later that night I get added by a random girl on snapchat (the one who had a crush on me), I asked my friends if they knew who she was they said she was friends with them and also kinda worked as a therapist trying to calm my cousin down when she was going through the breakup, so I added her back and we started talking she clearly had some sort of feelings for me but I was too naive to realize it and still really liked the girl that actually got me into the group. We talked practically day and night, we had good chemistry and she didn't take stuff seriously she was just super chill and had my type of humor. I liked her she was like a 7/10 and I was like a 5/10 at the time, as we talked more and more she opened up about a lot of stuff such as her worries about her dad being in jail in Iran (she was 50/50 Iranian/Irish) and kept saying she felt safe talking to me and told me she liked me ( I assumed in a friendship type of way) with her even taking an 30 minute public bus to get to my house to try meet me but unfortunately I wasn't home at the time after which we just kinda started talking less and less with it eventually stopping when I stopped hanging around with that particular group, I thought it would of been weird to message her when I wasn't really friends with her friends anymore.

As more and more time passed I thought it would be weirder and weirder to reach out and just to move on with her being little more of a thought in the back of my head as i just given up trying to talk to/get with girls and focused more on playing games such as Rust rather than going out but since I turned 17 in July I feel extremely lonely more and more each day with not ever had a first kiss or really talked to a girl since her so its really all I can think about almost to the point as where I just want to mess up my chances with her that much to the point of her disliking me so I can just move on and stop stressing over it. I have no idea what to do I asked a couple of my close friends and they told me just to move on that it was 3 years ago and that she probably doesn't even remember who I am.

PS. She is now like a 9/10 and extremely popular I'm about a 6/10 and extremely introverted. Im also the type of guy to think everything happens for a reason and that it was just to weird to be just a coincidence.

 Within the first week that guy already started flirting with some underaged girls in that class. Two days ago, he suddenly texted my girlfriend with a lot of hearts in the message. My girlfriend immediately showed the message to me and blocked him on every social media in front of my eyes. Well, except for Instagram, because she didnt know his username. Not even 10 minutes later, a  classmate texts my gf, saying that the guy asked why my girlfriend blocked him. I explained the situation and why I dont want them to have contact. Around half an hour later he found the Instagram usernames of both me and my girlfriend. He started to threaten both of us.

I thank you in advance for taking the time to read this, and for proving any advice/input.

The situation: 

I come from a low-income single mother household. I am currently a junior/senior at a pretty decent University in terms of prestige and rigour, but I am absolutely an imposter. For many reasons. I am studying Economics, and am currently taking micro-theory and some computer science, classes. The problem arises out of my weak mathematical intuition/understanding. My logic and problem solving is weak. I sort of cheated my way through school since I can remember by abusing my good memory. I never understood any of the maths and sciences. Somehow finessed my way through all the way here, and now I am having a very hard time understanding anything in class. Memorization no longer works when you need true problem solving (creative problem solving) and concept manipulation to solve and understand more complex topics. I have started self-studying my math now from the beginning, but it seems like there is no hope for my actual classes. I have too many gaps in my knowledge and logic. I did the same with intro micro and macro and calc 1 - calc 2. Now it is hard to understand my classes because I never truly understood the prerequisite information. The secondary issue is that I am here on scholarship. Financially I am very very poor. If I take a semester off to self-study I lose my scholarship most likely. Also, after being a pretty solid student my whole life, this has come as a very traumatizing surprise for my mother, and for myself honestly. I never thought it would come back to bite me in the ass. 

In summary:

Close to graduating senior studying Economics. Memorized my way through the lower pre-requisite courses and now it is hard to grasp the more middle-upper level ones cause I never truly understood anything. My math even at algebra is significantly weak. Going to school on a scholarship and If I take time off to fill in all knowledge gaps I risk losing the scholarship. I also do not want to waste time. I dug myself into a giant whole.

876,"So a good friend of mine, let's call him Mark, introduced my sister and me to his girlfriend this week, in a group chat on Instagram. I'll refer to her as Abby. Just to clarify, I do know Mark in real life, but not Abby. I've known him for about three years. 

So she as seemed normal at first, but she started calling us weird nicknames and was just incredibly clingy with our attention. That was annoying, but the first thing that creeped me out was when I asked her how she and Mark met. They've never met in person, but they've been friends for five years, and started dating six months ago. I asked if they clicked as soon as they met, and her exact words were that they ""claimed each other as brother and sister"" when they first met and she referred to him as her ""best baby brother,"" since he's eighteen and she just turned twenty. Which was creepy already, but then she said she hoped they could go back to that brother/sister thing if they ever broke up. After dropping that on us, Abby then wanted to refer to my sister and me as her little sisters? (We'd talked for literally ten minutes.)

 Everything she says is just weird and kind of gross or creepy. She and Mark are incredibly obnoxious in all their conversations, and sometimes it's like my sister and I aren't there at all. Abby does all this weird roleplaying stuff like just randomly commenting her actions i.e *kisses Mark passionately* and *runs to Mark crying* and stuff like that. It comes off so awkwardly. 

She makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and I don't know how to get out of this situation. She throws fits if Mark isn't around or if no one talks to her, and she pushed for our phone numbers and insisted we call her, even after I told her calls make me anxious. She's obsessed with marrying Mark and talking about all the sex they'll have when they meet in person, right in front of us. 

Mark would be wildly offended if I tried to back off from Abby somehow, and I don't want to hurt him because he's a genuinely nice person when he's not being weird with his girlfriend, and I still have to see him in person. But he's kind of clingy with my sister and me too, always texting us constantly. And he can be kind of awkward so I don't how to approach the subject of not interacting with his girlfriend with him. We tried just not texting, but Abby and Mark freaked out about it, so it looks like they won't forget about us. 

So what should I do? Should I try to talk to Mark about it, or see how it plays out? This has all happened in the first two days, so I could just monitor the situation? This has been draining and kind of cluttering up my life so I just want out, but I don't want to hurt Mark. 

Thanks for reading this far, by the way!",27Sep2020,1

880,"Hello. Im m19.
I would like to hear others opinion on this.
The situation with me and my family is that they all love me. They believe in this family has to hold together and blabla but I just cant do it. I dont identify one bit with a single family member. Im so fucking sick of explaining myself to them. If I want to be left alone they come to me and talk to me even more and when I loose my shit and scream at them for wanting to be left alone they think Im being rude. Its a fucking joke. They think that I have an obligation to answer to them because I am family. What the fuck. I am my own human, I can do whatever the fuck I want. But they dont understand that. They judge me for fucking everything I do that they dont agree with. I cant even imagine how they would react if they found out that I take acid and smoke weed. That I fucking despise some of their world views. That they piss me off so fucking hard.
They are the conservative Christians that believe all drugs are basically meth and are like just good people and I just dont fucking wanna be like that. I am not like that. I never talk to them about my issues. I dont want them to know. Its none of their fucking business. But I just dont know how to do this.
The more I wanna be myself the more I come in conflict with them. Im so so looking forward to the point of my life when I have enough money to move out. I hate it with them. But I cant change my situation because living where I live is expensive as fuck and Im still in university. 
I just dont know how to not loose my shit with them.
I have my issues and figure stuff out by my own by thinking about it. Weed helps me. But when I want to be in my own head they come at me and want to ""help"" or spend time with me which is litteraly the last thing I want.
I also dont really care about them. It sounds harsh but I dont think that I would be that sad if my grandparents died. I dont know why but I just dont care. Like I have my own values and only one other person in my life that I actually care about. Everybody else doesnt matter to me. Me and her. Thats all. And people dont understand that. And I cant deal with that.",27Sep2020,1
881,"My girlfriend of 1 year and 3 months broke up with me very suddenly 3 weeks ago (she had shown pretty much zero sign of loving me any less than a lot). I took three days to truly understand why she did this, and had a phone call with her where we ended on great terms. I showed great respect for her and this decision, and she said she still wants to be together when she gets home. In a sense, this is a win-win for us. She has never had the chance to be single and feel totally free in college and I know this is something she would regret not having done. Also, since she showed no signs of wanting this, she does have communication issues to work on and this break could definitely help.

Since it happened, I have only reached out twice. Once to casually check in on text, which went very well, and once when I felt super insecure after seeing she took our photos down on Instagram (didn‚Äôt mention this of course), but it was an excuse to talk to her. Lasted about 8 minutes, went well, I can tell how hard it is for her to talk right now. she still talks to me like she loves me a ton, but has a tone in her voice that its genuinely painful. She said she will reach out in a few weeks and that I shouldn‚Äôt hesitate to either, though I wont.

She left me because she really, really loves and misses me. But, she cant be with me right now. She is in college, and needs to enjoy herself. I get it. She wasn‚Äôt enjoying college wanting to call me all day and think about me 24/7. It made her sad and homesick. she knows that breaking up with me would be so hard for me since im alone at home rn with my parents doing my semester, but she had to follow her heart. She cant live her life on my terms. Anyways, I get it. I get why she left. It could not be more normal, and respectable tbh. Like, I don‚Äôt want to be with a pushover anyway. She is showing strength while maintaining compassion, god I lover her lol anyway‚Ä¶.

So in about 50 days, she comes home. Most likely (my parents and all of our mutual friends) think we will get back together and have an amazing few months here when she gets home for break. If she gets home and doesn‚Äôt want me, as hard as it will be, at least ill have my answer. Ill know how much she really wants me in about 50 days, or less.

My question is, what are some strategies to stay strong through this time? If she wants me, she will come back to me. When that day comes, What type of man am I going to be? I need to be strong enough to be with her or strong enough to walk away if need be. Ive been exercising a literal ton, listening to Kid Cudi and Kanye, but im totally falling behind in school work and cant stop thinking about her getting with other guys right now (which she can do, but you know, sucks to think about haha. Though my sister thinks she definitely won't. doesn‚Äôt matter.) Any advice on how to get through, maybe even **enjoy** this time? I feel like im getting tested by life, its kinda sick, I can prove myself to me and her and the world by being strong. But ya it sucks. Can't really distract myself with all my friends (away at school, im not cause covid and my condition). Would love some random tips and advice. Thank you all so much!!!!!!!!!!",27Sep2020,1
882,"Hey all, 

I‚Äôm sure there are a million of these types posts on this sub. I feel like I just need to write out my stream of thoughts and get them on paper. I‚Äôd appreciate any guidance anyone can give. 

For reference, I‚Äôm a 24 year old guy. 

My whole life I‚Äôve just kind of felt ‚Äúregular.‚Äù ‚ÄúAverage Joe.‚Äù Most of my friends had distinct interests or personalities or things they wanted to pursue ‚Äúwhen they grew up.‚Äù I never really had that. When I was younger I sort of liked the idea of being a teacher, but of course I had no idea what subject I‚Äôd want to teach. 

I started out my younger years being shy and timid. Super nerdy. Kept to myself. But as time went on I learned to be more confident and charismatic. I have good manners and one of those ‚Äúfamiliar/pleasant faces.‚Äù I know how to be nice to people. I‚Äôm non-aggressive and mild mannered. The only reason I mention all this is because I think its probably the only thing that gotten me this far in life. 

Obviously, everyone is into \*something\* in one way or another. Growing up I enjoyed music and playing guitar. I was really into video games. Sort of a tech nerd - just liked random gadgets and computers and stuff. Later on I got into nutrition/health/fitness. And I‚Äôd say these are still probably my main interests to this day - But I don‚Äôt really feel truly passionate about any of them. 

I just went through the motions in high school. B average GPA. Didn‚Äôt really like school or any subject in particular. I casually played guitar in a band and did some tech stuff. 

Then came college. I really should‚Äôve taken a gap year but I felt pressured to go right away, so I did. Went in ‚Äúundecided‚Äù lol. Funny to think back on that. Outside of anything academic, I had an incredible experience and loved being there. But about half way through I realized I needed to pick \*something\* as a major - So I finally made a decision. You guessed it - Communications. The study of nothing. Or everything. Depends on how you look at it. So I spent my last two years of school giving speeches about random topics, and doing group projects on random topics. How helpful. 

So I graduate. I job search. A pandemic hits. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to find a job. Its remote which is nice, but it is of course, average. Average work, average pay. Its easy, but I just sit in the office all day by myself. I‚Äôm living with my folks for the time being. 

To sum this all up, I obviously lack purpose. I‚Äôve lived my whole being comfortable just cruising by. Life happened to me, and I just rolled with whatever that meant. But I‚Äôm realizing that I am at the point now where I can‚Äôt do that anymore. Everyone is moving on with their life and I need to do the same. I just don‚Äôt know how. 

I lack purpose, but I also lack the motivation to find that purpose. The truth is, if I had enough money to sustain me forever, I wouldn‚Äôt care if I did nothing with my life. I‚Äôd be perfectly comfortable having no career, or anything like that. Just live. Marriage and kids? Eh, could take it or leave it. I‚Äôd probably feel compelled to help people in some way if I had that kind of money and time but, that‚Äôs all I got. 

Now, I know this is isn‚Äôt anything new. I know there are millions of people that probably feel similar. My question is - how do you deal with this? If you feel that same, how do you handle it? If you‚Äôve made it out, how‚Äôd you do it?",27Sep2020,1
883,"I'm the typical college freshman that did well in high-school and had high hopes for my future but im starting to feel like I'm holding myself back from reaching my goals.

I've always dreamed of being a Veterinarian and have even worked at a Veterinarian hospital for two or so years in high school so I chose to go down the pre-vet track. I've been an all A's and one B student in high-school with little studying. I've always been a gamer but I've always give a lot of focus to school. But over the COVID break (which was just school going online) and summer break, I did nothing but play games when I wasn't working and ive completely fucked over my routine for school.

After a couple of weeks with many ups and downs I‚Äôve (M22) decided to message a girl for the first time since I can recall.

It was essentially on a plate for me as one of my friends girlfriends friends, was asking if he had any single mates and I was forwarded essentially by my close friend. We followed each other on social media (Instagram) around 4 weeks ago, and today I came in with the mindset of ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô and just messaged her.

888,"My neighbours upstairs often scream during the night and also day. It sounds really violent up there and sometimes a woman and kids are crying. I have tried talking to them but they usually don't open, even though I can clearly hear them behind the door. When they decide to open it's hard to confront them because they don't really speak the language that is spoken here. They use their kids to translate. So far I got the excuses: Their kid is deaf so they have to scream and ""we weren't loud"". Doesn't explain all the crying, trampling and aggressive moving of furniture.

I hesitated to call the police because I was anxious that they would stop when the police would arrive. Today was the first time I called the police and of course exactly that happened. Police left and half an hour later they started again.  My partner has audio proof of the fights on her phone and when she streams her mic easily pics it up aswell (Some viewers even commented on it when it happened)

890,"i‚Äôll try my best to keep this short and sweet. any encouraging words or blunt advice or anything else is very much appreciated, even if you don‚Äôt have experience in this specific area.

i‚Äôve been raised as a girl my whole life, but have hated it. i have memories of when i was around 6 years old and i wanted to be ‚Äúone of the boys‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt understand why i couldn‚Äôt be. i remember first learning about puberty and i was so scared because i didn‚Äôt want to look like a woman. i guess what i‚Äôm saying here is that this isn‚Äôt anything new, but in recent years i‚Äôve been able to put words to the feelings.

i‚Äôve been using a different name online for around 5 years and use they/them pronouns. i have around three friends who know this, and i‚Äôve recently come out to two members of staff at my college, who instantly started using my chosen name and pronouns. everyone so far is really supportive and it‚Äôs been really encouraging.

but now i need to come out to my class. this is my choice and nobody‚Äôs putting pressure on me. it‚Äôs making me sick having to listen to a name i don‚Äôt associate with myself and pretending to be ‚Äúone of the girls‚Äù. i don‚Äôt know how to do this though, and i‚Äôm scared i‚Äôll put it off due to the anxiety of not knowing what to expect, but it needs to be done.

my class is only small, and we‚Äôre pretty close due to that. but i‚Äôm also aware that not everyone understands what it means to be non binary and i might need to explain this a bit? (i honestly have no idea what a ‚Äútypical‚Äù person knows about the lgbt+ community) i also don‚Äôt know how to correct people if they mess up my name/pronouns without sounding patronising. or what to do if there‚Äôs a ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù and nobody takes it seriously and i fall apart lmao. i‚Äôve never come out to multiple people at once or people who i don‚Äôt 100% trust, and i generally have pretty bad anxiety, so this is fuckin scary to me.

i don‚Äôt know how to do this, what to expect, or what to do afterwards. i also don‚Äôt know whether to try to explain what it means or to just kinda throw the information out there and see what happens. i‚Äôd really like to have this done by november as a deadline. so any comments are really helpful at this point.

we‚Äôre both 17 and both seniors in high school. me and my crush met at work and we‚Äôve known each other for about a month. yesterday me and my crush were hanging out and we got ice cream and went mini golfing (it wasn‚Äôt a date) i don‚Äôt think she knows i like her and i want her to know without telling her just yet. because right now she likes one of her female friends (she told me she‚Äôs bi) and i‚Äôm not sure if she likes me back yet. all my friends are telling me to hang out with her again and flirt with her and i‚Äôll be honest i really don‚Äôt know how to flirt. like basically we teased each other a lot yesterday when mini golfing and who i better. I won btw, i was making fun of her cuz she lost her ball in the water lmao. but there was one time where we were both sitting super close, like literally touching legs, i really wanted to put my arm around her but i kinda pussied out. like one of my friends thinks she like me back cuz we talk a lot. like we play Minecraft together. but idk i‚Äôm worried that her friend is gonna get her.",27Sep2020,1
906,"This long but please read, it would mean a lot.

The last 6 years of my life have been eventful, and I'm not going to give you the full rundown but I will summarize. When I was around 10 my mom had a surgery where she was prescribed pain medication after. In the nicest way I can put it, the doctor who prescribed the medication was some dipshit who was just in it for the money. She got addicted, the doctor kept on prescribing and that went on for a year. After the doctor said no cause they didn't want to get caught, she went illegal while beginning to cheat on my dad. A whole bunch of lies came along with this obviously, and I had no idea what was going on at the time as I was too young.

She then started ""dating"", if that's what you wanna call it, this rich 60 year old while simultaneously draining my dad of all finances. Who was at first trying to get her help, then later fighting her in court. We ended up having to sell our house, I lost my college fund and so did my younger siblings. Luckily, we have 2 pairs of grandparents that did fine in life and we got to move in with 1 pair while seeing the other frequently. The divorce finalized a little while ago with her only being allowed to visit and everything began to settle down. I could list so many reasons how my mother has done me wrong but I won't, I simply believe that it isn't her.

When I was 13 I stopped talking to her after I had this foggy feeling in my head while also being tired all the time. (Thank god that went away when she moved out, the doctors tested me for some diseases but they were no help.) I was forced to go to therapy at 14 for not talking to her which I promptly lied to get out of, just because I felt horrible that my dad had to pay more money for something I know he couldn't afford. I have been offered to go to therapy after which I also rejected. Part of the divorce agreement was I had to unblock her on my phone, I try to ignore her texts but sometimes I hope something changed and I read them.

My birthday is coming up and she sent me a text where she does her usual ""I would do anything to make it better"" ""I don't know why dad did this"" which I can ignore but, she also added how since I'm going to be able to drive soon she wants me to visit her and ""talk things out"" cause I'm old enough to choose to. Which is wrong for a couple of reasons: 1. She legally isn't allowed to see me on her own and 2. Why would I want to walk into a house where these shady ass people shoot up 24/7. I miss my mom but I don't know what to do, I have to meet her tomorrow for my birthday and I want to text her ""That's stupid of you to text me, don't show up tomorrow"" but I also don't want to make a big deal.

I still love the old her, and I would do anything to get her back. I guess part of me hopes this could be an opportunity to. Another part of me wants to bring this to my dad, but he will just tell me to ignore it. I'm tired of constantly having to deal with this in my head while pushing her away, what should I do?",27Sep2020,1
907," Back in March, right before COVID happened, I (19M) started school at Universal Technical Institute. I was not happy the first month and a half and I caulked it up to it being because of COVID and they moved classes online. I ended up moving back home to Cincinnati for awhile because I could get my old job back and not have to worry about finding another job, which was hard around campus. Once I moved back I was so much happier. I guess it was because I was relieved to be near family and friends even if I wasn't hanging out with them all the time. Just knowing they were closer was so nice. Well back at the beginning of August I had to move back to school because they opened the campus to the hands on portion while always keeping the online classes for learning. I did find a job shortly after moving back. Ever since I have been back I have been miserable. I have no support system here and my roommates are horrible they just prefer to keep to themselves. I was thinking of moving back to Cincinnati and attending a local college there for the same thing. I just don't know if it is the right choice. I just need some advice.",27Sep2020,1

911,"I gotta preface by saying I love my best friend and I‚Äôm happy with who I am as a person. I wouldn‚Äôt change myself to be more like her because it‚Äôs just not me. But I don‚Äôt know why i can‚Äôt turn off the insecurities when we go out. I‚Äôm a little bit heavier than she is but not by much. I would describe her as petite/athletic and me as midsize, just before plus. I‚Äôve accepted my body and I work out and eat healthy, so I don‚Äôt want to change myself to make guys like me more cause that‚Äôs just silly in itself.

When we go to bars it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm super quiet and unapproachable. I try to give off positive vibes and smile and make conversation with the guy and his friends, but guys just flock to her first and the night always ends with her giving the guy her number or leaving with him to another bar.

Us parting ways doesn‚Äôt bother me, I‚Äôm totally fine with her doing her thing and I‚Äôm independent enough to go home by myself or do my own thing. But it just feels like no matter what I do, new guys I meet just aren‚Äôt into me.

Is it just the body type that guys look at? I wish I could give them more benefit of the doubt but it seems like that‚Äôs all it is. I‚Äôve seen guys at bars hit on girls who are super drunk and obnoxious but have nice bodies so I guess that‚Äôs all it takes...",27Sep2020,1

913,"For a long time now I have wanted to go to med school. My life took a serious of unfortunate turns resulting in me dropping out of college (long story I won't get into here), but I am now at a point where I'm back in school, soon to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Biology, and my old dreams of attending medical school are in full swing again. I've been extremely excited about it (also nervous as I know this isn't an easy road by any means), but last night I was talking to my brother about the average amount of debt that a med school student graduates with, and he got very negative and serious about it, and asked me deadpan: ""Is it worth it?"" I gave him all of my reasons and to be honest he still seemed very skeptical about it, like I'm about to make a huge mistake.

This is something that I have wanted for a long time, and I had convinced myself that I'm ""too old"" to be a medical professional (I'm still in my 20's if that's relevant info to anyone). This is the first time in FOREVER that I've been excited about the direction that my life is headed towards, and to hear that and see the doubt on his face kind of crushed me, I've been dwelling on it all day. I know that $200k+ is a hell of a lot of money, but I also know that I am damn smart and capable of doing it, and I can't think of a more fulfilling, worthwhile, interesting profession to go into.

914,"I met this guy at my first job almost a year ago. Things were great, we got close, but things went a little too fast. We started dating and it's like he just stopped showing interest unless it was in bed. We break up and we were like strangers for awhile. 

We go close again but in a fwb kind of way. A close friendship began to form. I've always had major feelings for him but he didn't want anything serious like that. Every once in awhile he would put a stop to it. I would pretend like everything's fine, go home and cry and try to hammer it into my mind that it didn't mean anything. Just friends who fucked sometimes, nothing more. Shortly after, we would get close again like nothing happened and again, he would end it. Rinse and repeat. 

He did the same thing this month, ending things right before my birthday. Then on my birthday we got ""close"". A week ago, before his birthday he said he wanted a relationship. I told him to take some days to think about it and he said he was absolutely sure of it.

So now we have this relationship thing going on. The first night was cool, he seemed genuinely interested. However I kept my guard up. Now, once again, I feel like background noise. A few times we've hung out he doesn't seem interested in actually spending time with me. He's either on his phone or playing video games. On his birthday that's all he did while I just laid in bed for hours staring at the ceiling, even said I wanted to spend time with him but he just acted like there was nothing to do and went back to his game.

I don't want to lose him. Despite that he really is a good friend and I love him. But I'm tired of beating myself up on the inside wondering what's wrong with me for him to just lose interest like that when we were very close before. When we hangout now it feels more like it's out of necessity for a stupid relationship status, not because he actually wants to be around me. 

I expected this to happen but I guess I didn't expect how soon it would. 

Do I break up with him?",27Sep2020,1

I have no problem with using the correct pronouns on other people. I'm just happy they have found some they are comfortable with.

The problem is with my own because i know that if I just simply make a post saying ""hey can you try calling me this because I don't know of I like it"" that's so not ok. You dont just choose your pronouns because you like them right? So yeah this may not be a problem at all but I just want confirmation that I'm right.

So this might be a hard one and ill try my best to put a tl;dr in at the end.

I'm 15m and over the past few years I've really struggled with my mental health. I'm not diagnosed with anything but its pretty obvious i suffer from depression and what I believe its schizophrenia. I've been through one or two 'traumatic' experiences in my life. I've only told my best friend about this stuff and shes really helped me through most of it but I've been declining a lot during this pandemic with being not able to go out and see my friend(s). I don't really like being at home as it feels like i'm always juggling multiple tasks with little to no help.

I do struggle with self harming as I use it as a coping mechanism when I get too stressed or upset and I have attempted multiple times over the past year... I also just want to add that I think I might have ADHD or some behavioral disorder. I love my best friend and I know we will always be there for each other but I'm scared that I will get really upset one day and mess up and just commit. I don't want to leave her cause she says that she'd be broken and wouldn't be able to cope without me and deep down I know shes right. Recently I've been bottling it all up because I don't want to talk to her about it in case it upsets her. We tell each other that we love each other every night and i always promise ill still be here when she wakes up.

Anyone got any advice on what I could do to 'fix' my mental health. I know this might make it difficult to give advice but I don't want my family knowing as both my grandparents are slowly killing themselves in different ways (Alcohol, Starvation) and I don't want to upset my mum. In all honesty i just want someone to talk to whether it be a professional or a redditor.



Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

920,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

My dog needed an operation. I spent several months in 2018 collecting donations. I raised around $3,000 from various sources - Facebook, GoFundMe, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've had a few appointments with the vet, and they've indicated that the surgery is probably no longer necessary and may create larger problems than it would solve.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I handle this situation with the donors? I still have the money, I just haven't really posted updates this year (it's been a weird one, y'know?) and I don't want to be like ""Hey, I decided not to have the surgery, thanks though!""",27Sep2020,1
921," I‚Äôm 18 and So for the last 3 months I‚Äôve been working over 70 hours a week. (Some weeks 60-65) 12 hour shifts. And I barley get any time off. All of this because I have to, to pay bills. My mom is sick and can‚Äôt work anymore. So all of the responsibilities of adult life are on me now. 100% of the bills. Insurance. Food. Pet supplies. Medicines. Budgeting . Everything.
I work so many hours and I don‚Äôt see a penny of what I make. If I make 700 one week. I‚Äôll have 15-20$ for gas and food for the next week. If I have a slow week only making 500 or so. I‚Äôm left with under 10$. This week was the first time in 6 months I spent something on myself . I bought a 20$ RC car and I‚Äôve felt so f****** guilty for the last 3 hours I can‚Äôt think straight. I‚Äôve had to stop going to jiujtisu. Stop seeing my gf as much. Stop playing video games stop all hobbies.  And my life consists of work. Work. Sleep. I can‚Äôt find a better job. I can‚Äôt work less hours cuz we will lose the house. I can‚Äôt budget better because 98% of the money goes to necessary bills that have to be paid.

922,"Maybe it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt do any of the ‚Äúnormal teenage stuff,‚Äù ‚Äî like drinking, drugs, dating, sex, partying, etc. ‚Äî until I went to college, I don‚Äôt know, I just feel about 6 or 7 years behind others socially and emotionally and it‚Äôs quite embarrassing. 

I didn‚Äôt even have any crushes, or much interest at all in the opposite sex, until I went to college. 

Then everything just hit me full force. Now that I‚Äôm almost done with college I still feel excessively emotional, insecure, dramatic and embarrassed about the stupidest things. I have a silly but massive( and sometimes painful) crush on one of my married professors. I‚Äôm not exactly depressed but I cry all the time for hardly any reason, have silly romantic fantasies, do stupid and impulsive things, and care way too much about what other people think. It seems very much like the kind of things a 15 or 16 year old girl would feel and think. 

Intellectually/academically, I‚Äôm probably a bit ahead of my peers, in general, but socially and emotionally I feel nearly a decade behind. No one has ever made me feel bad about any of this (except for maybe my parents and people on the Internet) but when I think about it it makes me feel really embarrassed, as if they all possess this wisdom that I won‚Äôt for another decade or so, or maybe never? I worry sometimes I‚Äôll never grow out of it? 

People tend to try to help me without my asking for it. I don‚Äôt mind this in fact I find it really sweet and take their advice seriously, but even people a couple years younger than me often say things like ‚ÄúI used to be like you, this is how I got over it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI felt that way when I was in high school.‚Äù My friends, and even just people I meet, automatically try to protect/mentor/fix me. I know they just want to help, and I genuinely appreciate it, but it does make me feel inferior. 

But I guess it‚Äôs my fault, because I clearly give out that vibe of ‚Äúhelp me!‚Äù I mean, here I am asking for advice from strangers! 

I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm asking. I guess I‚Äôm curious to know if this is something other/many 20 somethings experience? Is it something I will eventually grow out of or am I stuck? How do you think I come across to others? Annoying, pathetic, immature, or just emotional and sensitive? And what‚Äôs the difference? Finally is this bad?
