0,"Me(23f) and my gf(24f) recently went to a family reunion.

 When we got there everybody asked why my roommate came along. I explain that she's actually my gf and everyone went silent. Awhile later my aunt came over to me and asked if it was ok to ask my gf to leave since everyone was uncomfortable with her around.

I said that the only way that she would leave is if we both left and me and her went home. My gf is upset because she feels like she ruined my relationship with my family. I do my best to comfort her but she hasn't been talking much. What should I do to help her understand that she didn't do anything wrong

I told them I was attracted to girls a few years ago but they claimed it was just a phase",25Jun2020,1
1,"I'm in accounting at a small company of like 50 people, there's 4 people in accounting. Month close is referred to as our busy time, usually it takes a few days at other companies but here it's like 14. I say its referred to as busy because essentially we are always that busy. This company has unlimited PTO and flex time which is cool for a short dr appointment but there's never any downtime to take off time. My whole team is constantly behind and working overtime. I feel like I'm the only person on my team who really doesn't like this. I'm salaried, I get no pay for working over 40 hours. 

 
My friend was murdered a few months ago. I dropped everything that day to go back home. We were already in quarantine, I was already working from home. Those next 2 weeks were hell, her murderer was on the run and we were all looking for him. After taking that one day off to drive to Kansas, I was drowning in work, my emails were crazy backed up and I had deadlines to meet. The next day my boss asked if I was going to take off any additional time. I said ""I want to but with just one day I'm crazy behind."" I really did not see how taking multiple days off could be an option. ""My boss said yeah but its period end. There's a lot to do. This is how it is, you're going to be behind. You need to be okay with being behind."" I took this as yes, there's no stopping that. I didnt take off any additional work. I didnt quite understand what she meant because I'm fine with being behind, shes the one who's going to gripe at me for it. Oh and she still hounded me for not making deadlines that week.

Any ways, I did it. Got through it. Next month or so, the stress built up,  I couldn't focus, and I made a ton of mistakes. My boss IM'd me about not getting a task done and I low key exploded and IM'd her that I have too much work on my plate to do in a week, I needed time off, I should have gotten time off before but I felt pressured not to take time off. I talked to HR about it, the death, the stress, the impossible workload, and that PTO isnt an option if I'm expected to constantly meet the impossible deadlines. HR gave me a week off. 

When I got back I was given a written warning about not meeting deadlines and making mistakes. After telling HR about not getting bereavement, my boss said that she wasn't pressuring me to not take time off. What she meant was that it's okay to get behind. She literally got on me about deadlines that same week and now I'm being written up for missing deadlines. They said that I misunderstood, not that my boss purposely pressured me or that she could have communicated better. 

Now my boss is constantly watching over me. She acts as though shes helping me. We literally go through everything I plan to do in a day and everything I got done the day before. Everytime she's questiong why a task took me so long. There's always a clear reason. She even took time out of both of our days for her to watch me do a report. She had no complaints or tips for me to improve. Yet she keeps scrutinizing everything I do and how long it takes. I didnt get one thing done from yesterday, that has no real deadline, it's an internal report that only I work with. She got angry and said she didnt see why I didnt do it. I told her everything I did yesterday. She said I could do a specific task faster. I told her it wasn't fair that I'm being reprimanded when I clearly got all this other stuff done yesterday. She said she wasn't reprimanding me, she was only asking questions. 

When she's not blatantly questioning all of my work, shes saying small things, implying that I'm going slow or doing something wrong. She's constantly telling me contradicting things then gets mad at me for not meeting deadlines. She specifically told me not to work over the weekend and that I dont need to do overtime but I have to meet all the deadlines for a large amount of work that requires overtime. 

I'm definitely going to get fired soon but is this gas lighting? I thought her communication sucked but she isnt acknowledging that or anything else I say",25Jun2020,1
2,"I am okay. I got on the elevator (floor 7) to go down to the ground floor, and the elevator fell really fast to floor 3 and then stopped at a standstill. It stayed on this floor for about 10 seconds with the doors closed and then went down to floor 2 where the doors opened and I got off. Really scary. 

I emailed my landlord to inform them of this as they should definitely check it out, and I was concerned something worse could happen to the next person who went on. They [emailed ](https://imgur.com/gallery/KyJr6Eu)led saying that **a technician was fixing the elevator while I was on it and that’s why that happened.**

4,"It's been a year since i had a this kinda relationship on this girl. Our relationship was easily broken because of how we treated each other. That toxic relationship turns out to have effect on my mental illness. Then months later i still want her to be mine again but i am trying to improve my self to suit's that personality that she want. But then it was like my conscience push me to just forget her and move on. It wasn't so easy so i message her on ig and tell her if we can just be friends so my conscience will not bother me anymore. But time goes by, it's like she hates me so much like i belong to the trash. I know i have a fault but why would she treat me that way even though i am trying to be a better person?",25Jun2020,1

7,"Today I told my old man about a girl I’ve taken an interest in. I jokingly said, “yeah but I think she’s too good for me. She’s a nice Christian girl.” 
Said this because I’m a little more on the rough side and she’s a pretty genuine, outgoing individual 

He immediately followed up with, “sometimes those are the sluttiest girls there are.” And goes on about how I don’t want to get myself into trouble 

And then I got pissed off and I’m pretty much trying to tell him I don’t think she’s like that 

And then he follows again talking about how human nature is human nature and you never know what a persons true intentions are, how she could just be putting on a front to seem like a good person, etc 

Then I got even more pissed and I’m like alright whatever I don’t need you to tell me about it. Went about my business. 

I’m currently really pissed about it. I could partially agree with him that some people who grow up in really strict households break out when they’re older and end up being a little wild. But I really don’t think she’s all whack like that. But he just shot it down for the most part 

1) how do I not be super mad at the moment? That made me never want to tell my old man about another girl I’m dating again 

2) how do I talk to him about this if it comes up again? He’s pretty stubborn and sound in his opinions",25Jun2020,1
10,"My mother has 3 kids. Me [20F], my sister [15F] and my brother[6M].

For the last year and a half, my[20F] life has been on an emotional roller coaster. My mom[35F] suffered a horrible miscarriage at 9 months. This took a big toll on her because of course the baby was gone but then her boyfriend at the time ended up leaving her about a month later. Their relationship was never ever ideal but we never thought he would leave her at a time like that. So my mom was already going through a depressing situation and then he breaks her heart on top of already being an emotionally abusive boyfriend. 

So after being with him for the last 4 years, she got into another relationship with a guy 4 months after the miscarriage. Me and my sister felt like she was moving too fast but we didn’t say anything. Her new boyfriend was very toxic as well. Very blatantly disrespectful and inappropriate. They broke up after like 7 months. NOW my mom is “in a relationship” with another toxic man. I just feel like she’s spiraling. She’s drinking a lot more, crying out of no where and constantly has a bad attitude. It’s hard to catch her on a good day. The only one she’s sweet to is my little brother. He’s her baby. 

This situation has effected my whole family, but especially my little sister and my mom. I found that my sister had wrote her feelings on a piece of  paper and said things like she hates her life and no one loves her and that she has no one. I ended up talking to my aunt about the info and we had a long talk with her and gave her some reassurance that we love her. She confessed that she feels like our mother doesn’t and that she’s felt that way for a long time (before the miscarriage). Me and my aunt tried to advise her on when would be the best time to talk to my mom about it. We didn’t know if we should choose a day where she was in her regular sad mood or a “happy day”. Though we would hate to ruin one of her rare days that she was happy we felt that it would be too difficult to talk to her if she was in a bad mood. 

So my sister ended up having the convo with my mom and my aunt in the same room. I wasn’t there but from what I was told my mom went OFF on them and she kicked my aunt out. She was pissed because she felt like they were trying to kick her when she was down. 

The next day My mom asked me did I agree with my sister that she’s a “bad mom” (which is not what my sister said). I told her that that’s not what my sister said or meant, she just feels that she’s not emotionally there for us and was more so interested in men, going out and was mainly only there for us financially &amp; that I agree with that. She didn’t say too much to me other than that she was tired of this “shit” and she wish “it” was over.  

Since my sister had opened up to her she doesn’t really talk to me or my sister. She only speaks to us when we speak to her. She’s still loving and spoils my little brother, but that’s it. She cut off contact with my aunt. She still has her boyfriend, who does nothing but disrespect her and does sexually inappropriate things to her in front of others, including us.

My mom has never been the “nicest” or the most emotionally sensitive parent but she’s all that we’ve had and she’s very protective over us. I feel that she’s a good mom based on the circumstances of how she grew up and how she was raised. I don’t know much about my moms childhood except for that my grandma was on drugs and she didn’t really have her father. Whenever me or my siblings were to ask any little thing about her childhood she would get the worst attitude and tell us that we know not to ask her about it. Now that I’m older I am able to piece together that she may have been abused in different ways when she was younger. 

I decided to talk to my grandma about it and about how I wanted to know more about her childhood/adolescent years and my grandma just said “you’re mom has some real issues that she needs to get over, she’s been through too much and never wanted fixed it”. She refused to go into detail but I guess I got the gist of what she was saying. I couldn’t force her to share what exact trauma my mom went through. 

A recent situation that has concerned me is that since she is drinking more and my brother is starting to notice her acting “weird” ,as he would call it, &amp; he’s starting to be worried. Also last week she left her phone open after she passed our and her and her boyfriend were arguing through text and she was literally begging this man not to leave her because he’s “ the only person” she has and that she seriously “cant go on” if she suffers another heart break. 

I’m starting to freak out and have too many thoughts about something happening to her. I don’t know how to approach her. I don’t know how to help her. She is dealing with things that I can not help with. I can’t tell her I saw her phone and I can’t tell her about the info my grandma told me about. I feel like I’m losing myself and causing my self to be overwhelmed by all of this. I can’t stop thinking about if something happens to her. I’m also worried for my sister too. It’s taking a mental and physical toll on me. I have cried everyday since I saw my moms texts. It’s all too much and I feel like I’m responsible for everyone’s happiness and wellbeing. 

I just wish I could just make everything okay. 

I just wanted any advice for dealing with situations like this one and how I should approach my mother about it.",25Jun2020,1
11,"I’m by no means a religious man, therefore I should not believe in the notions of ‘souls’ but it’s the only word I can muster to explain how deeply I feel about this sensation. Here’s how I feel... 

I was born and partly raised in a small seaside village, a little gem on the Cornish coast that is adored by the locals and people travel from all over the UK and Europe to visit it in the summertime, it’s truly a beautiful place that would blow you away. I was moved up north to the city when I was young, but continued to visit family that remained in the village all throughout my childhood up until I was about 17. When I was younger, me and my friends/family would be by the sea every single day. We would play in the boats, go fishing, swim in the harbour, be on the beach from sunrise to sunset. I learnt to surf, how to swim, save lives in choppy seas, how to navigate, so much. We would sit on the harbour wall and watch the sun sink into the crystal blue water on the horizon, towels wrapped around us, and wish that these days would never end. We all agreed that we’d get silly little local jobs like waiters, lifeguards, fishermen etc so we could truly live and die in that haven we called home.   

Now, it’s all I think about almost every single day. I’m stuck in a job that I don’t necessarily hate, but I don’t love it. I sit in traffic staring into the floor wishing I was prepping a kitchen for a days service overlooking the harbour, or preparing a boat for a day on the sea catching fish for the locals. I browse the local houses for sale in the area at least 3 times a week, praying an affordable property comes about so I can even have a chance of living out this dream (ideally not, even 2 bed shells sell for 260+). As I said, I’m not religious but I constantly feel like my soul is being ripped away from me, and it’s going to where I should truly call home. Most of my family are still alive down there, grown up of course but they do not have this feeling because they live there. They live their own lives so there’s no chance of me crashing for months until I sort something for the long term. I’d also have to find a long term, secure job which could also throw a spanner in the works. 

In a nutshell, I want to move 350 miles south to my childhood haven to half my salary for the sake of potentially being 100x happier. Do you think I should do it? If so, how? Does anyone else feel like this?",25Jun2020,1

Then, I worked various jobs for 3 years, living at home, did a semester of uni, and I have been working construction for the last year and have been moved out in a rental house with 2 roommates for the last 6-7 months.

This is still the case and i know i am bi. But thats not my problem. In the past i never thought about genders i just accepted that i was a boy but the last 2-3 years i think often about me being a woman. My favorite color is Pink. I like female clothing and i like romantic stuff. I dont really hate my name but since i thought  about being a girl i cant really identify with my name anymore. I like to play video games and i pick female characters since i started playing. I never liked picking a male character. I even pretended to be a girl for some time and im not proud of it but at the moment it felt right. Oh and i absolutely hate my body. I would love to have a female body.
I am really scared to show my real self to the public. Nobody knows me like that and i am scared to loose somebody. I would like to talk to my parents and tell them about this but i just cant. Everytime i think about doing that i just cant. Even when i know that my parents would accept me. I just dont know where to go or who i am.

16,"So lemme start this with some background. Me and my brother are teenagers and we both have xboxes. In 2019 for my birthday I received Modern Warfare (2019 version not remastered) and I played it on and off but overall had a good time with it.

After a period of me not playing the game, my brother came to me and asked if he could borrow it some time. I said yeah and after a while he took it and started playing. Fast forward a short time he is playing the game a lot (he currently has 100+ hours ingame) and a while ago he asked if he could still play the game in return for him giving me a game to play (Fallout 76). I immediately started playing it because I love Fallout but got burnt out after a few hours and put the game away.   
Fast forward a pretty long time and I get the urge to play some Call of Duty. So I ask to borrow it from my brother and he says yes, so for some reason when I put the disc in my Xbox it has to download again (which is 5-6 hours) and I only get to play a few campaign missions before we have dinner. After dinner, my brother goes to where I keep the game discs I use and takes the disc back without telling me. I text him why and he tells me “Because we traded for it”, then I talk to him and he says that he thought that we would permanently keep the games we traded. He never said or implied that when we initially traded games and I’m kinda mad at him for that.   
So reddit... any solutions? Also sorry if I said “while” a lot, I have a problem with using certain words a ton lol.",25Jun2020,1
17,"Currently a rising college freshman at UCSD and I’m starting to have doubts about major and career choice. Going to include tl;dr at the beginning since the post is long. 

**TL;DR: originally chemistry major on premed but have doubts due to hours and being locked into just learning medicine. considering engineering but I have commitment issues and don’t want to make a choice I might regret. dream is to make world-changing technology and be knowledgeable about science (like protagonist in Dr. Stone). need small push in some direction.**

I’ve never really thought about career choices and what I wanted to major in until junior year of high school except that it was going to be something science related. At first, I gravitated towards medicine (and I would like to preface my parents don’t care what I do as long as I’m happy and have job security) because I liked being a student and always learning compared to getting a bachelors and going straight into a job. It also felt the most practical and I would have that knowledge in general. Also I really felt like dedicating myself to something, so I felt the time-consuming element of being a doctor was fine. I ended up taking ap chemistry and really enjoyed the class, so I decided to be a chemistry major on the premed route. 

I ended up studying for the ap bio exam by myself because I heard medicine was a lot of memorization, so it felt like a test. It was interesting but it wasn’t as interesting as my chemistry, physics, and math classes which I enjoyed A LOT more (maybe because I was in a classroom setting though but it felt like biology was just memorization). This made me think of taking a career in engineering since I liked my physics and math classes. What pushed me more towards engineering is was watching an anime called Dr. Stone. If you don’t know what it is, it’s basically the journey of the protagonist using science to rebuild civilization. Watching this anime really made me want to know more about science. I thought it was cool knowing all these chemical reactions and the names of chemistry furthering cementing being a chemistry major. I liked these niche types of shows about rebuilding a civilization and started to get interested in engineering as I read about remaking technology and the like. After getting accepted to a college and enrolling, I started to doubt the premed route and considered doing engineering. I’ve been going back and forth between them, usually staying on the premed route but then again here I am. The problem I now have with going into medicine is the hours since when I have a family, I would like to spend a lot of time with my kids and S/O, which is the biggest con I can think of for medicine. Also that it locks me out of learning something besides medicine. I also feel I have a sunk cost fallacy with how much I committed into being premed and the med school process. One thing I have figured out is that I want to be in a teaching position at the end of my career and see working at a teaching hospital being fine.

As a result, I started digging into engineering fields like chemical engineering (much to my dismay wasn’t that much chemistry), nanoengineering/materials science (was too brand new and necessary to go to higher education), computer engineering/electrical engineering (I have no experience programming so I was hesitate to dig further), and mechanical engineering with robots

One piece of advice given to me about my scenario is to explore in college and decide my major later but I feel like I’d be behind if I were to commit to a certain later. The two things I regret is not having any experience in the fields, so I really don’t know what my future would be like if I commit to a certain path and not taking a computer science course (didn’t think I would like to work behind a computer 8 hours a day but I wished I at least tried so I had more options). 

The one dream I do have is to work on technology that would change the world or making an A.I. like Gideon from the flash would be really cool. Something like mechatronics would sound cool. I just want to learn more about science and become someone like Senku in Dr. Stone.

I guess in the end, what I’m struggling with is finding out what I want to do in the future and need a small push somewhere.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated and if you have any questions (need me to explain something or elaborate), I’ll try to answer them.",25Jun2020,1

22,"Let me start off by saying that I fully support the black lives matter movement. It's something thats LONG overdue. Being a half white, half latino man, I KNOW I have privilege. My friends always joke with me saying I'm ""The Whitest latino in America"". My mom is Italian/German, and my dad is Lantino. His parents immigrated from Chile. I look way more like my mom. I look white.

I come from a very poor family. My father is a Janitor and my mom is a waitress/cook. My step dad works many odd jobs. I'm the oldest of 10 kids. Do I have privilege if I come from a broken home? If my dad only makes $27k/year? Or if my stepdad is in and out of rehab and we can barely afford the electric bill?

I was having a conversation with my best friend growing up. His dad is a Doctor of Nurse Practionier, and his mother is a chemical engineer. He is half black, half white. He is currently attending Syracuse University, and his parents are paying for most of it. I went to community college after not being able to afford college...He told me that I have more privilege than he does...and I couldn't help but question my thoughts and actions.

Do I have more privilege than my friend? Do I have more privilege if he comes from a wealthy family, and I come from the wrong side of town?? How should I think? Do I recognize my privilege?

28,"My (30'sf) neighbor (26f) lives in an apartment building next door to mine. Her building is 3 stories and has over 30 apartments. They all share a keypad to enter the building and hallways and handrails, laundry room etc. She never took the pandemic seriously, went to a strip club, and came down with symptoms 2 days later. She's confided in me because she's appointed me as an adoptive older sister of sorts and was seeking empathy and advice from me and my husband about treatment and testing etc. She became cagey the last 2 days when I asked about her results and goes on about how she's thinking about keeping her results secret from everyone. HIPPA doesn't apply here (that's specifically a protection that your MEDICAL CARE TEAM cannot disclose your medical records) and I've read statements from the ADA and CDC separately that in cases of public health, privacy protections don't apply. She's been insanely irresponsible (won't wear a mask, went out line dancing one night and to get a tattoo the next, goes out to eat every day) and I'm starting to hear other people in that building coughing through the windows. My husband doesn't want to cause a panic in the building but I feel like they should know if they've been exposed. We talked about not disclosing WHO in the building is infected if we were to notify neighbors (she lives alone and my husband fears people may escalate any fear they may have and her safety may be at risk) but we're still at odds as to whether or not to notify them. Without her positive result confirmation, it's speculative, but her symptoms line up with the virus (coughing, fever, loss of taste and smell, extreme fatigue, diarrhea...) and her sudden secrecy about her results is cause for concern. I am asking if I should inform her fellow building dwellers that they may have been exposed to the virus and if so, should we disclose WHO is infected (as an aside, she is the building manager and works directly for the leasing company of the building she lives in. That's why I'm torn about disclosing the ""who,"" as she is a representative of the building company and that may mean the company needs to be held accountable for disinfecting, possible law suits etc. The leasing company is aware of her infection as they have instructed her to stay home from work until she is quarantined 14 days.)

Tldr: someone I know may have infected an entire building with the virus but I don't have proof. Should I inform the tenants?",25Jun2020,1

Last year my mother said: ""We talked and worked things out, we are still friends."" But when I asked if we could head over she got pretty angry and said no.

36,"I live in Missouri, USA. On last Tuesday, my friend (male, 66, 5'8"", 170lbs, white) and I were out trimming his donkeys' hooves. We were in some high grass. I was bitten by a tick, but he was not, as far as he is aware. We were doing some other mildly hard work in the heat. As soon as we got home, he became very weak and fatigued, and soon became ill. His skin was extremely sensitive and even touching him made his skin hurt. For about two days before this, he had been having diarrhea.

Soon after this, he became very ill. His fever would be around 100 degrees F during the day and then at night would spike to 103. I was checking on him regularly, making him drink water. I couldn't get him to eat anything, food tasted very bad to him and he refused to eat. He vomited several times although this was not a prevailing symptom throughout this whole ordeal. He became congested, so much so that although he had no trouble breathing, he was coughing up phlegm. His mouth has been extremely dry no matter how much water he drinks. This has been going on for over a week now.

He then became so weak, I guess just worn out from being sick, and could barely walk. He was stumbling around all over the place as if he were drunk. As a result...

He fell. Down the stairs. Twice. The first time was not an issue, he was fine and I didn't know about it. The second time, he was trying to go to the bathroom and fell down the stairs on the way there, not even intending to go down. I was in the basement when I heard it, I knew what it had to be and I ran to help him. He was unconscious, but it was not hard to get him to wake. He was extremely confused, obviously concussed. He was talking nonsense and scrolling on his phone when it wasn't even on, for around five minutes. This was admittedly a little funny although I was worried.

I tried to get him to the hospital, he ""ran"" away from me as best he could, and went upstairs. I tried to stop him but I couldn't risk him falling again. When he laid down, I called an ambulance. He did not understand what was going on. When the ambulance got here, he was apparently lucid enough to answer a few pathetic questions about his name and location, so he was able to deny treatment, which I thought was fucking ridiculous. He was quite obviously unwell and his temperature was 104.

Since that happened about three days ago, he has been mentally slow and somewhat confused, saying things that don't make any sense and doing things that don't make any sense. I am extremely worried.

This morning, I was able to get him to the hospital by lying to him and telling him we were going to the farm. The doctors do not know what's wrong with him. I don't know where the illness ends and the concussion begins, as he was already so fatigued before he fell that he was reacting slowly.

His ears hurt and he has some sharp pains in his face sometimes.

We HAVE been tested for covid-19 and came up negative.

He does have some medical issues. He has some kind of genetic tremor which he takes cyclobenzaprine for. He has high blood pressure. I can't remember what else, but he takes around 7 medications every night and one in the morning.

He is my best friend. I'm only 21 but he has been incredibly kind to me, he is a very smart man who I care about a lot. I'm very worried that even if he comes out of this alive, he will not be mentally sound. I don't know what the hell I would do if anything were to happen to him. Will you please take the time to tell me your opinions?

Ask any questions you need to. Thank you.",25Jun2020,1

40,"So I'm 5 years post undergrad with a B.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies, mainly in cultural studies, race studies, and the arts. I was also really interested in Business Administration, but I got this degree because I wanted the flexibility to work across more than just one discipline. 

After I graduated, I ended up going into the social services field. If I'm being honest, the first job I got as a patient coordinator in a psychiatric clinic didn't require a bachelors and I just took it because I needed employment. A year later, I got a position with a foster care program for unaccompanied refugee minors - which I loved and that put to use the education I'd earned from my B.A. I ended up leaving because of my daily commute and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program where campus was really far from work.

For the past 2 years I've been going back and forth about being a Social Worker. I even applied at a different school and backed out before settling into this one. I'm afraid of what it will look like financially for me in the next few years if go through with this. I've heard from most people that you don't make that much money as a Social Worker especially in the first few years as an MSW without a license. 

This is pretty much the one setback I have about being a Social Worker. I've always been passionate about being an agent for social justice and social equity and developing the wellbeing of society. I especially love working with youth and communities of color, immigrants and refugees, and that's where I'm hoping this path will take me. 

But I also really want to make money and aspire to a certain lifestyle, which is why I'm also leaning toward an MBA. There's an online program at the same school that can land me an MBA in 1-2 years with prereqs. I'm not necessarily interested in being an accountant or business manager but I have an entrepreneurial spirit and I'm very creative. I just started an online business selling my own art printables and trying to make some passive income. Granted, I haven't sold anything yet but it's just a matter of time. I freelanced as an SEO and copywriter for a little while. I'm a decent writer - I've written successful grant proposals before and I've written two novels attempting to break into publishing. 

From what I've seen and heard, Social Workers tend to be overworked and underpaid and this terrifies me because I'm trying to get out of where I am. I'm trying to leave the place I live in a way that won't burden me too much financially. 

My reasoning for being a Social Worker is about empowering people who—like myself—come from vulnerable and marginalized communities. My reasoning for wanting to switch and go into business is about empowering myself. 

I don't know what to do. I've already started my MSW. It's only the first quarter. I don't mind what I'm learning or the career itself. It's the return on the investment of the next three years that terrifies me. I feel like at 18 years old I was pushed to go to college too soon and just picked something that sounded interesting to me, without really thinking about what I wanted my life to look like long term. I feel like I should have spent more time working and exploring different fields before I went to college. Now at 27 I can't help feeling like I'm doing the same thing all over again. I've only shadowed Social Workers as an administrative assistant or patient coordinator—I've never actually done the work myself in order to know that this is what I want to do. But everyone has been encouraging me and telling me this path is just ""right"" for me. Me, I'm not so sure. 

I'm scared, walking through a dark tunnel and just hoping there's light at the end of it. I don't know what to do. Do I plough through and get my MSW or switch to an MBA? Pursue both at the same time? Or quit altogether and figure out what the hell I want to do with my life?",25Jun2020,1
41,"My mother is a kind woman, however, every time we speak it's almost never to converse; instead, she asks me to do favors and tells me of things I should help with and this has been going on for the past three years.

It starts out really well with the girl I talk to, the fireworks start off and the passion and emotion is amazing. Around the 2 month mark, I notice there is a lack of affection and communication isn't as often. It puts me into a panic mode and I worry that they don't have feelings for me, so it does cause me to text more and cling in a way. I'm a very affectionate and sensitive guy and whenever I get into a new relationship I always communicate how I feel. I feel that communication is key and to always express how you feel. I struggle with depression and anxiety and trying to manage a relationship is like walking on eggshells. I'm not sure what to say in the right time when they are upset or distant. I feel that I'm the reason they are like that. There's been times where I question if that person wants to be with me when I notice they are distant. Often times, I am told that I mayter and that they arent going to go anywhere, but I end up getting dumped or cheated on.

43,"My sister, like many other people, has been posting often on her instagram about the BLM movement. For reference we are both white. I thought that this was fine and spreading awareness and educating people is great, until she started to get over-praised. 

The problem that I had with her receiving so much praise online is that 
a) all white people should be expected to speak up in the first place and
b) we should be boosting black voices, and focus less on the voice of a white girl

To complicate things, I have also heard my sister say the n word twice within the past ~2 years give or take (we were alone one of the times, and the other time we were with a friend.) Both times, I called her out for it immediately (as did the friend we were with for one of the instances) but she just pretended like she couldn’t hear me. We live in a mostly white area, I’ve never heard my parents say the n word, and I am her younger sister but i still knew that it was very wrong, so I’m not sure why she thought she could say it. 
If it matters, both times were “out of context” eg. referring to a friend as “my ‘n word’”. 

I do not think this was just a couple “slip ups” either, being that I am autistic and she uses the r-slur (retard) towards me and makes my autism the butt of jokes. She also liked a comment on one of her BLM week ago about not using autism as an insult because it’s ableist, so there’s a bit of hypocrisy. 

She’s also tried to take credit for local protests saying that she’s going to say that she co-organized one of them on her college apps., although she didn’t organize it at all. Also someone in my grade recently referred to her as an “activist”... 

So here’s what I need advice about: should I tell people that she’s said n word? I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to get people “cancel” her. We also share mutual friends, and these are some of the people who have been praising her online. Also, I’m not fully comfortable speaking to my sister directly, as she was very physically violent with me recently and I still haven’t fully mentally recovered.",25Jun2020,1
45,"My friend recently failed their sophomore year of high school. 

During the pandemic, one of their parents got laid off and they was tasked with helping pay the bills. They worked long hours at their part-time job in order to keep food on the table for their family. Because of that, They barely had any time to focus on school. They got into contact with their teachers but they weren’t as sympathetic to their plight. They ended up failing their grade and they have to repeat it next year.

They’re absolutely devastated and they think that their life is slowly falling apart.

As their friend, I want to support them as much as I can during this tough time yet I have no idea how to go about it. I am a minor with no job so I am in no position to provide them with financial support. I feel incredibly guilty that I am unsure how to properly comfort them.

46,"Me and my girlfriend would like to get engaged. We’ve been looking into rings lately and, as romantic as it would be for it to be a surprise, we both agree that we want to aim for something extremely affordable (we are saving to move in together, which is much more important to us). Ironically, she’s one of the only people who knows about the whole thing.

We want something modest and inexpensive that can still serve as a precious symbol of our love. We would love something simple, but unique, and we’re not very showy people. We don’t need anything really flashy.

It’s a little embarrassing to say we’re still quite naive about the process though. We don’t have a clue of where to start looking for rings, or how to go about finding the right size, or anything of the sort.

47,"I graduated with a BFA in 2016 and since then have been working full-time in an arts-related job. I like it but I don't see myself doing this in the long-term and I've felt very burnt out. Last year I applied to an MFA program that does genuinely interest me, and I ended up getting a full-scholarship.

Doing this would involve a time-commitment and moving to a new city with my boyfriend which stresses me out. I do like the current city I live in, and see myself living somewhere more rural/small town in the future. I also don't think I want to be a full-time artist as a career, though I am passionate about it and think I'd learn a lot from this program. I keep feeling uncertain and think I should maybe pursue something more practical such as Library science, massage therapy, or something in healthcare, although I don't feel set on any one particular thing. The other side of me feels I should pursue this program , and if I don't enjoy it I can always switch paths. Or I could graduate from the program, pursue art independently and find an alternate job or career for money.

56,"I’ve had this situation, I’ve been trying to block this guy out of my life because he makes me feel bad about myself. The only issue is I don’t know why he makes me feel this way. It’s not like I’m jealous of him, I’m not a jealous person. And it’s not like he shames me or bullies me for who I am or what I look like. He’s actually pretty nice and really funny, but he’s immature. Really immature. And I feel terrible, absolutely terrible saying that, I would never mean to say that, but I can’t think of a nicer world.

Now I would never change him for the world, I think he’s a great person, and I just think I take things to personally and too seriously to handle the things he says. For example a running joke he has is he will say a Spanish phrase and since I don’t speak Spanish I ask him what it means. It always tends to be something like “f*** yourself” or “I like your d***.” I don’t know why this makes me insecure it just does, and it shouldn’t, because it’s a joke. 

He also tends to mute himself mid conversation and I get the suspension he talks about me. I try to open up about my problems and my worries and he’ll make a jokes or ignore me. He laughs at random things I say, texts his friends videos and pictures of me, not as if I’m his friend, as if I was a joke. He screenshots me when I’m not looking and sends it to his friends. He laughed when I played him a song I wrote, and that song was very personal to me. I thought he was laughing at my voice, but he just wasn’t listening. He says he does these things because he likes me, and I want to assume that’s the reason, but I always assume I’m just some sort of inside joke to him. 

In the end I want to get over our differences and become friends, but he makes it really hard for me. After every conversation I end up feelings ugly, sad, and bad about myself. I really don’t know why I can’t take a joke, or laugh along, but I just don’t feel any sort of comfort with him.

However, her faith in recovery is a lot less than mine. I've been diagnosed with ASD, BPD, Social anxiety, body dysphoria, body dysmorphia and a whole other cocktail of things ive kinda just stopped remembering over time. She's never been properly diagnosed/pretty much avoided it her whole life but we are pretty certain she has ASD too. Very suspect traits- Naive, can't go off routine, socially awkward, has always been described as 'weird', special interests, etc- 
 I don't think I'd ever find someone else I have more love, patience, compassion or dedication towards. She's my everything and I don't think I'd last without her. So wherever she ends up, I'm pretty sure I'll follow suit. I know it's not healthy but we're only really ever happy when we're together and I just- I don't know what I'd do without her. She.. can get pretty manic. She doesn't feel like she can ever fit in to this world but I can tell she wishes deep down she could. She loves fantasy and anime and wishes deeply she could have that kind of hope and enthusiasm- Even applying that sort of logic to the real world. She's so nice, but so easily hurt and I want to protect her so badly. I want her to know that it's ok and that we can have our own happiness but- She's convinced that only on the other side she can be happy and that all she wanted would be right there. 
I would tell her someone all this who can help her, like authorities but- I don't want her to lose trust in me. I know if I did this, there'd be no repairing it and from that point I don't know what I'D do. I want to fix this. 
Anyway- Now for the relevance of all this. We made a suicide pact.

There has been a few low points since then and my partner has been very strong and being doing addiction counselling, has given up all drugs and is more in control when they drink. They will start regular drug testing to help their case in court, have a good job and talented at sports. I have never been so broken the last few months at the thought of losing him if things go wrong with his court case and he ends up in jail. (We are in Ireland) he is an amazing person and very supportive partner. Addiction is a chronic illness and it took too much of a grip on him but has turned his life around. 
He knows I worry about this and I try let on I don’t think about it as much as I do but I have a constant fear of what might happen, how we ultimately have no control and how wonderful things are going now but it could all be ripped away. I can’t imagine my life with anyone else. 
Has anyone any advice for things he could do in order to help his case or anything at all! Feeling desperate 😭",25Jun2020,1
64,"So, here’s where I’m at. I have still been, fortunately, working full time the whole time the quarantine has been in affect.  I work at a solar equipment supplier and if anything we’ve been much busier than usual. I’m questioning if I truly have time to commit to two classes this summer, as right now, it feels like I don’t

Assuming I work a perfect 40 hours in a week, 8am to 4pm, with 15-20 minutes of travel and then getting set-up. I am then able to sit down for “class” at 5pm and go until about 8pm, I take a few breaks here and there, so lets call that 2.5 hours of class time. That would be 12.5 hours of class time M-F that I have available, if I’m being that efficient.

Since I want to do 2 classes, that means I’d only have 6.25 hours to dedicate to each class. I haven’t included weekends yet because I don’t want to rely on dumping all my work onto the weekends.

Does roughly 6 hours of in week “class” time sound like enough for both classes? 

However, I’m worried I’ll get left behind and already feel like I am in some way since classes started 2 days ago. Again I don’t think dumping all of my work onto the weekends will be a good idea, I want the weekends to be available for me to put in “study” time while during the work week will be class time, if that makes sense.

Sorry I’m rambling, I just want this to be worth while and not spend a bunch of money just to fail. I don't have good experience with college classes, I have trouble staying focused. My two classes are both CS classes. Intro to Networks and intro to Linux/Unix. I'm not a total newbie at either but I definitely have to start from the beginning with both. 

What do y'all think? Any feedback helps, thanks.",25Jun2020,1
65,"CW: sexual abuse, sexual harassment

Hey everyone,

This is my first time posting here. I am currently a college student and have recently come to realize that I was sexually abused as a child through years of therapy and reconciliation. Unfortunately, through this therapy and education I have also recognized that some of the behavior that I exhibited as a high school student (before I really recognized that what had happened to me as a child was sexual abuse) was sexual harassment. It mostly consisted of ""jokes"" (what I considered to be jokes back then; I would find them incredibly offensive now) to a girl I went to high school with that undoubtedly would have made her extremely uncomfortable. 

After graduation we both went to separate colleges and have not spoken since. We were pretty good friends in high school (at least in my perspective) and she hasn't mentioned anything about it. From what I gather we left things at a relatively amicable place. But I can't shake off this fact that I did harm to this girl after realizing the harm that occurred in my own childhood. The trauma my own experiences have caused me is the last thing I would wish on my enemies and I stay up at night thinking about what I might have done to this girl.

I would really like to reach back out and sincerely apologize. I honestly would not care about being publicly demonized or 'cancelled' for being a sexual harasser, because I probably deserve it, and I also realize that it's selfish to reach back out to someone and apologize in a way that might cause someone to relive their own trauma. 

This realization has taken a serious toll on my life (in addition to the trauma of my own childhood) and I'm not sure what I should really do about it. I don't have access to a therapist or anyone I can really talk to about this matter so any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",25Jun2020,1
66,"My mom gets mad very easily. For the past week, every morning has begun with her yelling about what I did or didn’t do. We have our ups and downs, and we’re in our “downs” right now. They’re so severe that having bad arguments with her made me recognize the possibility of me killing myself. And when we’re in our “ups” I don’t believe she loves me anymore. 

I recognized that I could kill myself because she told me to do it a few years ago. Since then I’ve told her about two of my attempts because they happened in the house and I was suddenly scared I would die and she would find me. Both times she got more mad. I assumed that since she’s still a mom that she would be upset about it after, but she never expressed it and only brings it up in later arguments, saying “Why don’t you take those fucking sleeping pills again, properly this time” and stuff.

I’m posting this because I’m at my last straw again; I’m honestly mostly venting. She saw me struggle to fit a pillow into a pillowcase and went on a long rant about how I “take everything for granted” and “can’t do a single thing right” and how she wishes I would “do something right ONCE a day. ONCE a day”. I feel useless and because of COVID I can’t even leave the house to hang out with friends or just go relax somewhere.

I really want to die, but I don’t really. 

TL;DR: My mom’s told me to kill myself, gets furious at my minor shortcomings, and I can’t handle it anymore. How do I calm down and stop wanting to die because of it?",25Jun2020,1
67,"Tried to post on r/Covid19positive but didn't meet the 25 karma threshold, anyway here goes.

I currently work in a restaurant in Texas where we have had multiple people test positive for Covid. We've had 9 so far. I was tested and came back positive. 

My wife and I just had our first child after we tried for over 5 years to have a baby. He is now 1 month old. I fear of him being infected.

The real questions I have spawn from my job telling me I have to come back to work even though I just tested positive. I need to provide for my family, but by doing so I am putting them at risk. I already sanitize myself, shower, and strip my clothes in the garage in order to limit what I bring in the house. 

Can my job require me to go back so soon? Is Quarantine a requirement or just a suggestion from the CDC? If I refuse to go back to work, will I lose the possibility of unemployment benefits?

Any help or advice you all have would be greatly appreciated.

71,"I am a home owner and recently bought a new house 8 months ago. I live with my wife and two teenage sons. I have two suites downstairs that I rent out to one guy and another suite I rented out to a young couple. 

A few months ago the wife of the couple told me that she is selling scissors for hair cutting. And she has been selling them for the past few months. Random people would often pull up to our home and come around back to buy her scissors. But my kids have been telling that they’ve noticed the wife acting suspicious around the people selling scissors. 

Recently, my kids have been telling me that they have noticed random people pulling up to our house around 2-3am. And I just told them it’s just people buying scissors. But the more I think, why would people need to buy scissors at 2 or 3 in the morning. Then I’ve noticed on my camera recently that people have been walking around back into our backyards to meet with her around 3 and 4 in the morning. This activity has been making me feel very suspicious. 

The husband asked me a few weeks ago if he could open up a small online business using my home address and without thinking I signed off on it. But as you can tell I am having a lot of regrets and suspicions. 

When I interviewed this young couple to see if they were eligible to rent our suite, they said that they’d be more than happy to pay 4 months of rent in advance and they also showed me their bank account and there was well over $80,000 in his account. And of course that might have not meant much back then but all this evidence is leading me to have other thoughts that some shady business is happening in my home. 

My suspicions are that they are selling drugs or doing some sort of illegal activity. And I don’t want to raise my kids around that and I have fears that something dangerous could happen in our home.

I am pretty sure that I am straight, as I get aroused (sorry for the terrible wording) when I see insta posts of attractive girls I know or stuff like that, or especially  if I am next to one in class, then it gets kinda hard (no pain intended I promise!) To concentrate and stuff like that. 

However,  when I am out and about if a girl is attractive I don't really care, and I don't seem to be particularly interested in topless women when at the beach. I dont rly get an erection or  feel any attraction. (We love in spain rn) 

Do I just have a rly low libido or is it something else?

75,"Hello this is my fist time posting on Reddit and apologize if this post isn’t structured like a normal Reddit post. So on Monday it was raining very heavily. After about 10 minutes of raining, we noticed the roof was leaking in our kitchen, to the point of the wood becoming water logged and bubbling paint. So we immediately took pictures and video of the leakage and sent them to the property manager. In response to that, the maintenance guy was sent yesterday, and then roofers today. Fortunately, the roofers were able to seal the leak. Interestingly enough, the roofers informed us that this wasn’t their first time fixing the leaking problem on this house. Coincidently, that same day, we received a text message, from the property manager, stating that the house was put on the market and that people will be coming by next week to look at the house. About an hour after the message was sent, the matainence guy showed up to put a lock box on our door, along with a new lock to our glass door. The reason behind replacing the glass door lock was because they claim nobody has a set of keys to open it. However, we have a set of keys. So my husband messaged the property manger to express how uncomfortable he was with having our key, in a lock box, outside the door. The manger attempted to reassure us of our safety and that not many people have the code to the box. Now we’re told that a realtor and the owner will be here in the morning. I understand that the owner has every right to be here, however I feel inconvenienced and violated.

For fear of possibly losing my home and just having strangers interrupting my life, or coming into a place I happily isolated my self in. My question is, what are my rights as a tenant? What if I chose to not stage the home in a way that’s ideal for showing potential buyers. Could I get in trouble if I mention the leaking roof? What are my options? What do I do?

76,"And I’m scared! I’ve been living with some of them since I was 18 when I first moved to college, I’m turning 22 this summer. They’ve all either dropped out or graduated, I’ve got one year left. 

I’ve found a new place, and new roommates. They seem nice enough and I think we’ll get along, but they’re an already-formed friendship group and it’s always awkward to be the new person. 

I’m mostly scared because I did everything with my roommates, they were pretty much my only friends. I’m kind of ashamed to admit it but I really became socially dependent on them. I’m introverted and I have anxiety and depression so I struggle with forming friendships. They were extroverts and took me to parties and gatherings, had me meet people, planned to do activities. I just tagged along with them, and it was fun but now I don’t know how I’m going to manage without them. Even if they left the room I’d feel so awkward and anxious I’d pretend to be on my phone until I found an excuse to leave. 

I feel like people weren’t friends with me, they were friends with my friends and I was just always there you know? Like a filler-friend, my absence was probably not noticed. I’m scared that I’m going to end up isolating myself and withdrawing and being lonely and depressed for the whole year. 

But at the same time I’m so scared and anxious about really minor things like... like what if people don’t actually wanna hang out with me? What if they don’t like me and me inviting myself over to their house annoys them? What if I can’t tell when it’s my queue to leave and I overstay my welcome and piss them off? How do I even ask them to hang out... what if they think I’m desperate? 

I mean I’m boring and awkward and shy so I get why no one would want to be friends with me. Like a lot of people know me (through these friends) but none actually KNOW who I am. I feel like a fraud. I’ve had “friends” use me to be friends with my friends, then hang out with my friends and not rlly contact me.

78,"Seeking advice since my best friend is currently upset with me and I have nobody else I can talk to. We have been best friends for almost a decade and this is the first time she’s ever been mad at me. Here is some context for what is going on. 

Last summer I had a friend group of coworkers that were super tight and we’ve all remained friends to this day. Two of them started hooking up and developed feelings for each other (let’s call them Boy A and Girl A). The thing is Girl A was only here for the summer to spend time with her sister but lived across the country where her family is and where she is going to school. Fast forward a couple months after she left for school.. Boy A and my best friend start hanging out and eventually start booking up but it’s just a FWB deal. Boy A still had feelings for Girl A (which my best friend friend and I knew), so anytime he would bring Girl A up I would tell my best friend. After warning her numerous times that he still has feelings for Girl A, my best friend tells me to let her be happy and not talk about Girl A (which I did, because I just want her to be happy). 

Now a whole year later, Girl A has come back for a month to visit her sister again (who is having a baby) and Boy A still has feelings for her. If you haven’t already put it together my best friend developed some feelings for Boy A since they’ve been hooking up for months now. Last night I get a text from my best friend saying she feels betrayed by me for not telling her that Girl A is back and not even checking in her to see how she feels. I feel like crap for not telling her but I tried explaining I didn’t know Girl A was coming back until days before she arrived and I didn’t feel comfortable even bringing it up unless it was in person. Boy A did tell her that Girl A was coming but I don’t know how much he told her. 

What should I do? She’s never been mad at me before and she has said for now she just needs some space from me. I get I should have at least sent a text letting her know Girl A was coming but at the same time I feel like as soon as Boy A tole her she could’ve come to me too and we could have talked about it.

Anyways, I bring up a cool fact and I guess I wasn’t holding the bag straight or something, but all of a sudden he goes “Can You Hold the Fucking Bag Open?!”

Sometimes he does this, with a smile usually,like he’s just kidding but this felt extra malicious. I guess it’s how he and his friends used to talk or whatever.

Now I don’t want pity, but I just want to set the record straight, I don’t really have any friends or anything so my social interactions are extremely limited, so I talk to people when i can, including my family.

Maybe it wasn’t the right place to bring up a conversation, but we were alone and we usually talk about cool things when we’re alone.

Anyways, getting back to what happened, I stopped what I was doing and told him I didn’t like him talking to me that way, he just disregarded it and was going on with the garbage.

He took the bag and spread it out violently, keeping his bad tone, and I told him again that I didn’t like him talking to me that way.

88,"# BACKGROUND:

I'm a 16-year-old Filipino teenage boy living with his Father &amp; Stepmom, we just moved here in the United States (specifically in Alaska) I have 6 Sisters (3 half-sisters, 2 step-sisters, and 1 full-blooded sister),

 I'm the Middle Child and the Only Son. and my Biological Mom abandoned me when I was 7 to leave my Dad because my Dad uses to violently beat up my Mom in front of me growing up, I grew up in a very dysfunctional family story is too long to tell, My Dad had an affair with my Mom's Cousin they only lasted for 3 weeks then finally separating, so my dad has numerous girlfriends before meeting my current stepmom (which is a total disaster and a bitch.)

When we're in the Philippines, my dad makes sure that they will have access to our social media accounts and block any relatives from my Biological Mom and Relatives from her Side. And my dad made a rule that we would give our phones to them every night (9-10 PM) and check our phones. I tried breaking the rule but they told: **""You guys just hate being disciplined.""** This rule still exists in my household.

 My Stepmom is very manipulative and she has an attitude, and she gets mad very easily and would cut off contact with me and my relatives in my father-side like my Cousins, Siblings, Grandparents, and Uncles. My Dad actually believes everything she says never asking our side of the story, and my Dad never asked us about how we feel because he thinks that ""I'm a Provider so that's enough"".Fast forward, after being emotionally abused my Dad finally finished our papers and everything just to move in the United States.

&gt;I don't know about My citizenship (we went through the legal process but I don't know if my Green Card is now valid or been done because I know there specific rules about getting that and my parents are the only ones who know about that.)

* **WHAT HAPPENED?**

This happened just an hour ago...I'm currently suffering from severe body acne for years now, and my mental health, self-esteem, and confidence declined and even lead to several suicide attempts (I haven't told anyone) My Dad is working out of state and we had an argument on the phone...So this how the conversation went...

&gt;Dad: Son use this product for your acne.

91,"Sorry for the details and length I might be giving too much information but not sure what is useful and what isn't. TIA for any feedback. 

About a year ago a new woman was hired on our team and started a lot of drama with our supervisor who wound up leaving. One our supervisors last day some people went out for drinks, i did not attend. The new woman proceeded to tell me how pretty much everyone there was talking crap about me. These people are not on our team but they were confronted about it by a mutual friend they denied it, cleared the air, bygones. 

I decided to keep my distance from this new woman as I don't like drama. After a few weeks she would complain to me how she doesn't feel like a part of a team, i felt bad, started to talk to her more. We became pretty good work friends.   

Like most places we had some gripes with our manager and would vent to eachother. The woman would get talked to often about mistakes she made, we all do, and complain to me. I would try to make her feel better as I had the same struggles. I would also go to her when I had issues. 

The more and more our manager would call her out the more confrontational and weird she became. She states that she was told she asks to many questions and needs to figure things out in her own, so she just stopped asking questions  and would leave emails unanswered resulting in me picking up more work. 

She got lectured about another task and decided she just wouldn't do it any more becuase she didn't want to het in trouble and made it seem like it wasn't her job to do them. 

The team started getting in trouble for late email replies and I got in trouble for rushing my work due to the fact I was picking up her slack. Meanwhile she would complain to me that she was so bored and didn't have work. 

Last week we were alerted about something new we had to watch out  for. So any time this thing came we would send them back. We then learned that we can approve them but just reach out to the person and let them know the new rules. 

When we were told this no one wrote anything down and the meeting was not recorded so there was no actual record of what was said. 

We got in trouble for sending the items back instead of just emailing them.  I told my manager I did send them back but once she told me they were okay to approve and to just contact everyone and with the more recent ones I did just that. 

Now my coworker freaked out that we got talked to about it and I guess wanted me to team up with her an confront my manager. 

I didn't want to to do that as there was no proof and was just like take the comment and move on. Then she freaked out on me saying I was the reason behind all the problems on the team and to never vent to her again. She was rude and made me cry. This is actually the same thing she did with our old supervisor as well. 

I never told my manager that this woman started problems as soon as we were hired or that she was making my job harder or that when I would suggest she do something she would do the opposite. I did not want to get her in trouble. 

Now one of our other teammates (whose sister is friends with our manager) told me i need to talk to our manager becuase the woman went to our manager and stirred up a bunch of drama about me. 

I wrote down some things to say to our manager but I feel awkward going to her because I don't even know what was said and I feel like it might look like i am guilty of whatever this woman is saying about me. Even though from my perspective I did nothing. 

If there was a problem with me wouldn't my manager confront me about and then we could talk? I just feel really weird bringing it up. 

Also the woman started talking to me again like nothing happened. I am polite to her and answer any work questions she has but that's all. I am an adult and she is on my team so I am not going to play those baby ""don't talk to me games"" but I won't have personal conversations with her anymore. 


Our manager is not implementing assigned mailbox days so she can see who is answering what and training days for us to go to her with anything we might want to learn or have questions about. I feel like that would elevate the problems I had with this woman work wise, aside from the drama.

So i guess what I am asking is should I listen to my coworker and tell our managet everything even though it is in the past now? I feel awkward bringing it up out of nowhere especially now with the new procedures being implemented. 

I nevet had to deal with work drama before and I hate confrontations so I really don't know what to do i just don't want to get fired becuase some woman was talking crap about me and my manager believes her.",25Jun2020,1

93,A man in his 80's moved next to my parents (this is in Alabama) and at first everything was okay. Then my parents started noticing that when they would talk to him about certain things he will get himself all worked up and angry about it most of the time it was about his son. He would accuse his son of doing all kind of things. One time he told my parents his son (who lives in the same town but not close by) came over to his house and snuck in while he was sleeping and stole his keys to his truck but those weren't the right keys so he had to sneak back in. His son never stole his truck btw just the keys.  He also got into with my parents and decided to wanted to put up a fence. He hired a surveyor who put stakes in the ground. My parents saw this man and spoke to him but later the neighbor claimed it was his son. My parents have met his son and knew it was not him. Then he called the cops on my parents because they along with his son were plotting to steal land from him. The story about that is the people who lived there before him gave my parents 10 feet of land for helping them with some work. They have proof but he gets confused. Another time while telling my parents he could shoot who ever stepped foot on his land and when she asked him about it more he pulled out his gun and and kind of pointed it at her. My mom called his son but apparently they do not want to help at all. We do not know anyone else in his family. We are concerned about his mental health.He said Alzheimer runs in his family (his mother and sister died from it) and we are also concerned about that. My mom hates the way he acts but feels so bad for him and wants to help him but we are worried because of how he gets mad and we do not know how to help him. Any help would be appreciated,25Jun2020,1
95,"So a little background, me and my girlfriend started dating and have been together for 6 years. After the first year the living situation we had fell through and we decided to get a place together.  Her friend had been living there and had no where to go but back home to his mom and we felt bad and offered for him to move in with us.  We thought he would find his own place as to not wanting to live with a lesbian but boy were we wrong.

Here we are 6 years later and he has since declined majorly.  His dad passed (due to cancer)and he was working for his company which shut down, and since then (from last year) has not held a job.  He has never been late with bills and saved a good bit and probably lived off inheritance.  He has had a lot of job opportunities but doesnt take any of them.  He just wants to smoke weed and wont do anything he doesnt want to do.

His mom also has cancer and has been fighting it a long time, when covid hit our state pretty hard we retreated out to the country to rent out her guest house to help her out financially.  

Literally me and my girlfriend have felt like this is getting way out of hand and may end ugly but is there any way to make it not? We have given him opportunities to get his life together but I just dont see it happening and he feel more of a burden now then ever.",25Jun2020,1
96,"Worked in restaurants 8 years, finally landed a job making $20/hour (high pay for our area) with full benefits. I worked in insurance as an agent at a call center. It was incredibly stressful but, not wanting to be a disappointment to anyone, I toughed it out. I made it 9 months, and I sincerely tried to deal with it, but working over the phone is something I'm just not cut out to do. I love helping people, but the demands of a call center ruined my mental health. Additionally I felt like I had very little support from my supervisors.

102,"So my (19M) last name comes from my dad's side of the family. However, since my mom is closer to her family than my dad is to his, I always grew up really close to my mom's family too because we visit each other multiple times a year. I do really love a bunch of family members on my father's side though, but tend to see them a lot less. 

Just under two years ago, my father and I had a falling out after ten years of me being emotionally traumatized and manipulated by him. He would belittle me and intimidate me into submission and he tried to control every aspect of my life. he's just a really aggressive guy. Since I haven't really had access to therapy since, I still have quite a few scars from this. 

After standing up to him and leaving him to go live with my stepdad, I told him off about a few things, and he was very quick to take the bed out of mine and my brother's room after I left. I basically kept no contact with him after that. 

My grandparents on my mom's side have since asked me to consider changing my last name to my mom's side's last name. Since my mom is the only kid that my grandparents had that had kids themselves, and since my brother (16M) is still close with my dad, I might be the only person in this family that will carry on my mom's family's last name. 

I really do like my mom's family's surname, few people pronounce my current last name correctly anyway. However, my mom (who I very much trust, she knows me well)  has been letting me know that in the future I might really want to repair my relationship with my father. I trust her, but right know I am so numbed by all the pain that he caused me and am just holding onto the feeling of being safe from it, I truly cannot see myself ever wanting to communicate with him again. I'm not filled with hate towards him, I just have halted all emotional investment in him because what he did was constantly draining emotionally. 

I really love my mom's side of my family. I identify with them so much and I love how close we are. I would absolutely like to show them that and would like the name for myself too. My issue is that if I change my name I don't want it to be taken as a ""fuck you"" to my dad's side, and I also would worry that if I did change my name, I would sever the chances of ever having a relationship with my dad. I truly feel that I could never do that, but based on what my mom and stepdad are saying, I would be very hesitant to burn that bridge.

106,"Earlier tonight she was feeling pretty bad and fainted. After she called, me and my mother went to her place as soon as possible, and she was very distressed - extremely nervous and afraid of some kind of stroke happening, since something like this has never happened before. While we waited for the family doctor to arrive, she broke down in tears and got everything off her chest. She talked about being afraid of having a stroke and dying alone with no one besides her, about how lonely she has been due to being stuck at home for the past 3 months, with no one to talk to, and about how that loneliness made her dwell on all of the past abuse she suffered, both as a child due to violent parents and during an abusive marriage. She's also not a very extroverted person so she doesn't have too many friends she can talk with, other than family members, and other than her sister, my mom, and me, the rest of the family lives quite far away. The worst part is how we had no idea how deep her suffering really was - she bottled all of those feelings up saying she doesn't want to be a ""bother"" to anyone. I don't know too much about her medical condition, but like most people past a certain age, she has some trouble walking and some other health related issues, but nothing serious enough to be hospitalised for. The doctor thought her fainting was related to stress, as well. She's also 70, which is far too young for a nursing home - she can still take care of herself well. We ended up going back home after some hours and making sure she was feeling better, but she still seemed to be really afraid of being alone - the whole fainting and losing consciousness thing left her quite a bit traumatized.

Before Covid, I would go to her place to have dinner one or two times per week, and she would spent most of her day outside, which probably helped alleviate her sadness. But now things are different, and will probably remain like this for a while too, which just makes me worry her situation might get worse. I also feel like an idiot for not realising sooner and making a bigger effort to be more supportive before things got to this point.

This is more of a ""get it off my chest thing"" than anything else, but if anyone else also went through a similar experience, any words of advice or ideas would be appreciated.

I told her that we could buy a newer version of the same washer for almost 400$ if we could forego the 300$ payment and she started saying how she needs the money.

118,"I had new roommates move in last month, so altogether including myself, I have four roommates. On average, the utility bill is around $25-27 a person each month. This includes the admin and delivery fees that are the same each month. I am the person who’s name is on the utility bill and I pay it after everyone chips in for it.

A couple (bf/gf) moved in a week after the utility bill period started, and when I got the utility bill at the end of the month, the bill showed a 20% increase. After only three weeks of them living here! When I looked at the graph for each day’s usage for that period, the usage showed an increase a day after the couple moved in. 

Notably, the graph does reflect their usage: blasting the AC, doing laundry four to five times a week, washing all dishes by hand, running the shower for hours to muffle their arguments, and having countless electronics and appliances on throughout the day. Myself and the remaining roommate do not have these usage habits. 

Currently, everyone has a flat rate they pay for utilities, and I don’t find that fair, because then I pay for overages. I also don’t find it fair to split the bill evenly and have myself AND other roommate paying more just to cover this couple’s usage needs. 

I have considered splitting the delivery and admin fees equally, then splitting the rest based on usage or some kind of percentage... but I can’t micromanage or monitor the couple’s usage, so I don’t know how to make splitting of the bill fair - so I came here for ask for advice.

One time I was changing my rabbit cages and she caught me by the dumpsters and was going in and I said ""hey I'm trying to throw away this bag of poop I gotta go"" and she goes ""Oh Yeah I meant to ask you about how your rabbit is doing, what does she eat etc"". Another time I just said I have to go im in a hurry and she goes ""Oh do you have plans later?""

 I have a nice garden on my patio and lots of times she stops to talk to me there. I work long hours and I was in a hurry to get everything watered so I could go to bed so i told her ""hey I'm in a hurry, I need to get this done"" and starting working on my garden and she literally stood there silently and watched me work. 

I know they are old and I dont want to be rude but politely ending the conversation doesnt seem to work. What can I do?",25Jun2020,1

126,"My S.O. (F) recently went to the doctor with dizziness, back pain, and intense abdomen pain. The problem is the doctor suggested it is either pregnancy or ovarian cyst(s).

The problem is we are both not ready for children. Both financially and mentally. We use protection every time and I am very anal about using protection. The condom has never broke before. That is my biggest fear. 

Her biggest fear is the ovarian cyst because she is afraid it may be cancerous or may have to receive surgery. The symptoms have lasted about 5 days. We are both terrified. 

She is more terrified than me. She has been crying non-stop, and it has affected her depression immensely. I have tried working with her with suicidal thoughts but they seem to have come back. She has shut down a lot of communication with me since she feels like a burden. 

I want to help. I am scared and panicked and my emotions are not helpful whatsoever. I try to be calm in high stressful situations to make it seem like it's under control so she doesn't get so worried. I'm not so sure this time. I'm legitimately terrified. I have no idea what to do. And it feels even worse because I don't know how to help her. We are both extremely poor. If it weren't for the generosity of people I know, we'd both be living out of our cars right now. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know where to start. It feels like it's all too much and I'm failing her. 

We have an ultrasound referral that we are going to call. We are also going to pick up a pregnancy test to confirm. 

Her period is supposed to begin next week but the stress of everything is killing us.

I don't know what advice I'm expecting. I don't know what I should be asking for. I'm really sorry for the inconveniences, but if anybody could offer any sort of advice I'd be glad to hear it.",25Jun2020,1
127," So 2 weeks ago I started a new job and basically I'm working in a live excel sheet all day with 2-3 other people also working in the same sheet at the same time. Each row you enter a specific document number to track what document the information in that row relates back to.

Today when I was checking my work at the end of the document I was verifying (basically they want you to check all the rows related to that document and make sure you have the same amount as are in the actual document), I found that I had an extra row whose information did not belong to my document, but somehow got the document number I was working with entered incorrectly for that row. I managed to figure out whose row it actually was, and immediately this coworker asked if I was sure I had entered my document number in the right cell (I had not said anything about it being anyone's fault at this point, I just said I need to know what document number this row actually belongs to so I can get this fixed). I said that it was possible it was my error, but I was being very careful and was fairly certain that whatever had happened, it wasn't me. Also, and I didn't say this to the coworker, but If I *had* entered my document number in the wrong row, then one of my actual rows would be missing the document number, which was not the case. 

I have no idea what did cause this error (potentially it was an accidental use of autofill, which would explain why none of my rows were missing the document number), however I checked the edit history on the cell and the only change made was the input of my document number - so I didn't write over my coworker's document number, if anything I entered my document number into a blank row by mistake and they then put information from their document into that row, which would be their mistake. But anyhow I told the coworker that I didn't *think* I had typed it in wrong and hopefully whatever had happened was a one-off and that I would try to be extra careful to not put my doc number into the wrong cell. Anyhow on the next doc I complete, I have the same issue. It ended up being the same coworker who had their information from their document with my doc number. As I was trying to get the document number from him to get it fixed, he insisted that I must be entering my document numbers in wrong; I said well, it's not impossible, but I really don't think it's me (I didn't explain why, but having looked at the editing history on the cells and having checked all my other rows, I was 100% sure I didn't type my document number into one of their rows). The coworker then became agitated, rudely insisting that I had to be entering it in into the wrong cell. I said nothing and avoided speaking to him the rest of the day. 

I left work pretty upset today. I am always paranoid at work about making mistakes, so that's why I am so careful, and until I checked the editing history on the problem cells, I thought it was probably my fault. But whatever was causing my document number to be entered into those rows, I was not typing it into the wrong cell and ultimately my coworker failed to ensure their document number was entered into those rows at all; if they had, it would have showed in the editing history for the cell. On my way out the door, I tried to apologize to said coworker (I didn't mean to cause tension), but he waived me off in a very rude way. I'm hoping I don't go into work and get a lecture about being careful working in the sheet tomorrow, because I know I was being very careful and it was not my fault. 

How could I have handled this situation better? I think I did get a bit defensive when my coworker insisted I must have typed the doc number into the wrong cell, but I did maintain that while I didn't think that was the case, it wasn't totally impossible (trying to be objective). I also think potentially my coworker thought I was trying to blame them, but ultimately I just didn't want to take the blame for an issue that I knew was unlikely to be my fault (and that I was taking the time to fix).

I have decided that tomorrow I am going to create a separate sheet in the workbook and put my entries in there, then carefully copy/paste them to the main sheet. My supervisor already told us we could do this, I just hadn't been because until today I hadn't run into this kind of issue.",25Jun2020,1
128,"So I'm 5 years post undergrad with a B.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies, mainly in cultural studies, race studies, and the arts. I was also really interested in Business Administration, but I got this degree because I wanted the flexibility to work across more than just one discipline.

After I graduated, I ended up going into the social services field. If I'm being honest, the first job I got as a patient coordinator in a psychiatric clinic didn't require a bachelors and I just took it because I needed employment. A year later, I got a position with a foster care program for unaccompanied refugee minors - which I loved and that put to use the education I'd earned from my B.A. I ended up leaving because of my daily commute and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program where campus was really far from work.

For the past 2 years I've been going back and forth about being a Social Worker. I even applied at a different school and backed out before settling into this one. I'm afraid of what it will look like financially for me in the next few years if go through with this. I've heard from most people that you don't make that much money as a Social Worker especially in the first few years as an MSW without a license.

This is pretty much the one setback I have about being a Social Worker. I've always been passionate about being an agent for social justice and social equity and developing the wellbeing of society. I especially love working with youth and communities of color, immigrants and refugees, and that's where I'm hoping this path will take me.

But I also really want to make money and aspire to a certain lifestyle, which is why I'm also leaning toward an MBA. There's an online program at the same school that can land me an MBA in 1-2 years with prereqs. I'm not necessarily interested in being an accountant or business manager but I have an entrepreneurial spirit and I'm very creative. I just started an online business selling my own art printables and trying to make some passive income. Granted, I haven't sold anything yet but it's just a matter of time. I freelanced as an SEO and copywriter for a little while. I'm a decent writer - I've written successful grant proposals before and I've written two novels attempting to break into publishing.

From what I've seen and heard, Social Workers tend to be overworked and underpaid and this terrifies me because I'm trying to get out of where I am. I'm trying to leave the place I live in a way that won't burden me too much financially.

My reasoning for being a Social Worker is about empowering people who—like myself—come from vulnerable and marginalized communities. My reasoning for wanting to switch and go into business is about empowering myself.

I don't know what to do. I've already started my MSW. It's only the first quarter. I don't mind what I'm learning or the career itself. It's the return on the investment of the next three years that terrifies me. I feel like at 18 years old I was pushed to go to college too soon and just picked something that sounded interesting to me, without really thinking about what I wanted my life to look like long term. I feel like I should have spent more time working and exploring different fields before I went to college. Now at 27 I can't help feeling like I'm doing the same thing all over again. I've only shadowed Social Workers as an administrative assistant or patient coordinator—I've never actually done the work myself in order to know that this is what I want to do. But everyone has been encouraging me and telling me this path is just ""right"" for me. Me, I'm not so sure.

I'm scared, walking through a dark tunnel and just hoping there's light at the end of it. I don't know what to do. Do I plough through and get my MSW or switch to an MBA? Pursue both at the same time? Or quit altogether and figure out what the hell I want to do with my life?",25Jun2020,1

we would get into stupid argument and it’d usually end in someone apologizing the next morning but one of them was that i felt like she never talked to me about anything like relationshipwise (throughout the whole time we talked not just now) and felt like she just wanted to be friends. But she told a week or so earlier that she wanted to try and be more then friends again but just go slowly. So we didn’t talk for a good 3 days then i texted her and just said “so is this it” and she responded “yeah” and we haven’t talked in  about 2 months. she just texted me now saying hey and i’m not sure if i even want to get back into the whole situation. and the part in embarrassed about is we don’t even live by eachother ( she’s on west coast and i’m on east coast USA) i feel stupid that i actually liked her because we probably would never meet and it just feels like a dumb kid kind of thing to do and i just don’t know if i want to try it again. I know some people might say just find a new girl in your or somthing along the lines but i’m not really the guy to go find people to date, and i don’t really talk to a lot of people so i miss the attention but i miss the feeling of someone caring about you.

137,"A few months ago, one of my friends that I've known for a few years took her own life. I was shaken and the whole school community shifted drastically in response, peppering students with mental health resources. Not long after, another suicide by a closer friend. Following this, I collapsed. Isolated myself from friends and family, couldn't deal with school work, watched my 95+ average slowly decline. I felt trapped and overwhelmed. Exam season came and went, and I cried every hour, struggling emotionally. Fortunately, I maintained a mid-90 average, although it felt a million times harder to do so. (The reason why I bring up makes so much is because my school is very competitive and concerned about university acceptances)

As if the world wasn't done slapping me in the face, my grandma was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer (terminal), and was given six months to live. Fortunately, she fought the odds and is alive today, but her condition is deteriorating. As a result, I'm responsible for most of the shopping, chores, cooking, etc. in my household as my parents deal with work and caring for my grandmother. My grandma and I are very close, regardless of a language barrier, as I'm her only granddaughter and she's always spoiled me. I haven't seen her in months, as her weak immune system means that she can only be in contact with my mom, her primary caregiver. I cook food/make gifts for my mom to bring her, but the guilt of not doing more/being there for her is weighing on me.

I started seeing my guidance counselor and school psychologist privately, keeping it from my school friends. After seeing a doctor, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I'm only 17. To this day, most of my friends are unaware of how bad of a state I was in, and I feel bad about bringing it up because it seems attention-seeking.

I had ""tantrums"", heavy mood swings, was pessimistic. I had suicidal thoughts and self harmed. Thus, right before the quarantine, my bf and best friend of multiple years broke up with me. He claimed to need to focus on his own life and happiness, and called me too immature and sad for a relationship. Regardless, he cut ties for multiple months after without any thought of checking up on me, and asked another girl out a mere week after the breakup. In all honestly, I wasn't devastated by the breakup, it's just high school, and I assessed the red flags that he showed during the relationship. Throughout the whole relationship, I thought that I was at fault and a burden, and that I was undeserving of friends. He further encouraged that indirectly, and provided little support, regardless of knowing my condition. It took me until after the relationship to feel like I wasn't in the wrong for struggling, but I still feel insecure. 

On May. 19, 2020, my grandfather (my mom's dad) suffered a heart attack and passed away. He was in great physical shape, was only 70 something, and no one expected it. I felt like I needed to be strong, watching my mom sob for weeks, and have to deal with legal paperwork. Thus, it took me a long time to process and grieve. 

A blessing in disguise, I've improved a lot without my bf, with my best friends, and with a less stressful environment (online school provided less work) during the quarantine. 

 Thankfully, I'm in a better mental state now and feel supported by my peers. 

Uncertainty for the future and university is also there, although I'm prioritizing my family right now. 

I'm hoping for support and advice on how to deal with this mentally, as I feel overwhelmed. I chose to write here anonymously because I feel weak due to all of this, and I don't want be mistaken as seeking pity. I'm not expecting much response, though.",25Jun2020,1

142,"So background, I (25M) have been talking to my crush (27F) for about a year. We knew each other in college and admitted feeling towards the end of school. She ghosted then apologized during summer 2019 explaining why she did it. 

Over the course of a year we’ve been talking but have only gone out a few times. When we do go out it’s me her and her best friend. We haven’t made anything official. I’ve tried countless times to set up dates and it’s always the same answer. So we haven’t been able to go out just me and her.

I have given her outs a lot of times for her to tell me that she isn’t interested anymore but her answer is always yes she’s interested and wants to go out. Well still here we are a year in a not 1 official date other than a virtual date. I saw her this past Friday and gave her her birthday present. She loved it kept on saying thank you. Everything was good. Well the problem is I haven’t heard from her since. She is an awful texter and when I say awful I mean awful. Most people forget to text back for maybe a few hours but she takes a few days even up to a week. When she does reply I get a response back then again don’t hear from her for the next few days or week. 

I’m not sure if I’m an asshole or not but it’s making me lose my feelings for her. I had strong feelings for her and yet now they are going away. I was thinking of sending this so her on Friday cause that’ll be a week without getting a response with her and was seeing if this is good to say:


“Hey I just want to lay this out here cause I would like to communicate how I feel sometimes. I sometimes get into my head whenever I haven’t heard from you for a while. I know we get busy and it slips our minds but it makes me overthink when I don’t hear from you for a few days. I get afraid that I said something wrong and that goes with what I have dealt with in the past with abuse from relationships. It seemed that once summer began we don’t talk as much as we did during the school year and only hear from you once every 4 or 5 days. I really would like for us to go on a for real date just you and me. You can come over here or I can go over there; we can drink wine and watch movies. I would like it to be us and only us. I hope I don’t come off as crazy, I just wanted to lay out what I’ve been feeling. I really like you and would want nothing more than to pursue this.”

143,"Tl;dr: I have all I could ask for yet I feel like life is a chore to live, I don’t know how to change this about myself. 

I find myself constantly unhappy and there really isn’t any other reason than the negative lens I have clouding the way I see the world. 

I objectively know I have so much to be grateful for; a nice home, loving family, an amazing boyfriend, friends that care for me and the opportunity to pursue an education in a field I love (and that my parents are paying for). I truly am beyond lucky and aware that I have a ton of privilege.

Yet I constantly feel like doing everything is a chore, that living life is a chore and that I want to curl up not talk to anyone, be left alone and sleep away the rest of my life. 

I feel that I lack the motivation and discipline to enjoy life, for example I am in university studying something I love/that interests me but I feel burdened by it. Every time I have to do work I’m filled with dread. 

The same goes for other aspects of my life, I feel that talking/spending time with people I love is a chore. But I truly do love my friends/family/boyfriend!! I feel so frustrated with myself for not utilizing the time I have with them. Instead I avoid quality time with them, even though they make me happy. 

I don’t know where to start in changing this about myself, I want the people I love to know how much I care for them, I want to pursue my education without feeling burdened by it.

How do I change? And also make the change in my attitude a long-lasting and sustained change? I appreciate any advice anyone has to offer, thank you for reading.",25Jun2020,1
144,"Long story short I’m a biracial, 24 year old female from a predominantly white town. Since the BLM movement has blown up after the unjust death of George Floyd, I’ve been very vocal online about my support. I’ve spent about 5 days each week protesting for hours. But that’s not why I’m exhausted.

I’m emotionally burnt out. I cry every day thinking about the state of the world and how so many marginalized people (not even just the black community) are living in constant fear or oppression when all that has to happen to change that is quite literally people CHOOSING to be better people and CHOOSING to change as a society. Because quite literally nothing is keeping us living this way except ourselves. Almost everything we do is based on a human’s idea- paying rent, working 40 hours a week, etc. I feel like NOTHING i am doing is changing anything. I’ve talked with police departments and the council. I’ve done more than march with my sign and try to educate people online. I’ve been trying my best to make even a nudge of a difference but I just feel defeated all the time. And I know my feelings are valid but also, I see other people living carefree like nothing is happening right now and it hurts because it makes me feel like they don’t care about ME. I wish I could go on pretending nothing is happening but i don’t have that luxury. I have to fight not only for me but for sooo many others whose existence matters just as much as mine. I’ve cut off many friends I’ve known since middle school for not voicing support for the movement because it’s quite literally a fight for MY civil and human rights as a BLACK woman. It hurts reading things online from people I loved opposing my freedoms and supporting my oppression. It hurts realizing these people I have always adored and supported have been thinking less of me this whole time because of the color of my skin. I am crumbling. And no amount of self-reflecting can tell me what the right thing to do is. I can’t take this anymore. I can’t cry myself to sleep every night and put on a brave face tomorrow watching videos of people who look like me and the people i love being murdered. I can’t get online and see entire thinkpieces about how myself and my black brothers + sisters are “thugs” or “animals”. I know despite these ignorant people, the world is still progressing in little ways but it doesn’t feel like it enough... I don’t understand how anyone could support the unjust treatment of any human regardless of gender, racer, sexual orientation, etc. We have ONE life. Why shouldn’t we each be able to live it how we want without the constraints of judgement from others or even worse, systemic oppression. Realizing how many people are just hateful for no valid reason is quite literally killing me...

Anyways, I’m bipolar and was THRIVING mentally before this started but now I have regular thoughts of suicide again. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to exist in a world of hatred. I dont want to feel inferior or live knowing people around me think see me that way. I’m exhausted and I really can’t do this anymore. I feel I need to move out of this town and maybe i’ll find more like-minded people. But I don’t have the money (or social skills lol). I was laid off during covid which was a blessing in disguise because i realized i hated my career (waste of 4 years of college) and i needed time to breathe but I don’t have a job to keep me busy so I spend most of my energy at the gym trying to at least feel good about myself which isn’t working because my self-esteem is eternally in the garbage no matter what. I don’t even want to hang out with the few friends I have left because I just don’t have the energy. And when I do hang out with them, all I have to talk about is protesting because that’s all I’ve been doing. And I know that’s not enjoyable for everyone. I’ve made a few new ones but my social anxiety makes me terrified I’ll disappoint them when they get to know me or they just won’t like me. It’s all just a lot at once. It’s mostly the world stuff that’s bothering me (i think) but all the other everyday shit on top of it is just so heavy i haven’t gotten out of bed all day except to stress eat.

I know I sound dramatic because I know it’s a global movement and it’s WAY bigger than me but the reality of it is, it affects people like me personally. On an individual level. At first I was hurt. Then I was angry. Now I’m just... sad... I don’t want to live in a world like this anymore🥺",25Jun2020,1
145,"I'm 22, and in one month I will be homeless or confined to a living room where I'll have no privacy, no safety, and no way to keep my belongings safe. I live in a narcissistic, toxic family. My brother, who had a mental illness, took his own life 1 year ago partly due to the callousness, harshness and selfishness of my parents, it's always about THEM and what THEY want. They can never be wrong.

I'm tired. I have fought my whole life. I've never been great socially, I've never had confidence due to the bullying, put-downs and humiliations my family has put on me throughout my life. I thought my mother was my friend but she has betrayed me. She has decided to selfishly, and coldly, move to a smaller apartment where I'll have no room to myself. I have reasoned and reasoned. She will not listen. SHE wants to move, I am have to ""suck it up"" and deal with it. **She doesn't care about my mental well being and that not having an escape, a private room, will drive me insane.**

Without a sanctuary, I can't go on. Without privacy and security, I can't survive.

Things like picking me last (and groaning when they got me), and constantly glaring at me, especially when I missed a shot. To make it clear, I wasn’t the best, but I definitely was not the worst. Anyways, it got to the point where they would rather pass into a crowd of people than me standing maybe 2 feet beside them. 

After a while I realized it wasn’t anything I did to them, and after I got cut I always blamed it on them. In a way I still think it was partly their fault (if the team members don’t like me, maybe there was something I did etcetc, to be clear I did not speak a word to them before like the first open gym), but I still find myself holding grudges. 

I find myself like pointing out stupid things that I usually wouldn’t if that makes sense. I don’t really know how to explain it, but I get happy when they fail or do something wrong. I would never actually do anything to hurt them physically.

Any advice on how I can let go kinda? Like I just want to move on and not think about them anymore.

tldr: two girls borderline bullied me, and i find amusement in their failures. theyre moving and i want to just let go of the thought of them.",25Jun2020,1

ok so tonight we talked about how we both hate being single and we talk about sexual shit sometimes for funnies.

 we’ve both told each other that the other is good looking but I told him first so him saying it to me might have just been reciprocation??? though he told me twice so idk. 

he also mentioned he finds it hot when a girl comes on to him so that might’ve been a hint????

I just graduated this Spring with a BS in Neuroscience. I was initially interested in psychology so I worked as a research assistant in a memory lab for 2.5 years at my university. It helped me realize that I hate research. 

Now that Im at the point in my life where I need to figure out my next step, I am soooo confused. I have no idea what my passion is. I am literally ALL OVER THE PLACE in an attempt to discover what my interests are. 

I considered pursuing a masters in dietetics (I love reading about nutrition and coaching my family on ways to eat healthier). 

Right now, I am interning at a dental office and am considering being a hygienist but I have a horrible back from doing gymnastics and don’t know if I could physically withstand a job that requires me to hunch forward in the same position all day.

I took many animal behavior classes for my major and love animals so I considered becoming a veterinarian or an animal behavior researcher. (But then again, I hate research and just enjoy the IDEA of studying animal behavior). 

I’m not opposed to continuing with something in my field either as long as it’s hands on!

dislikes/ weaknesses:

Reading scientific journals (My ADD definitely  interferes with this), critical thinking/problem solving


Strengths/interests: 

hard working, people friendly, hands on interaction (which is why dental hygiene is an interest of mine), health/ fitness, animals, psychology

Does anyone have any (good paying) career suggestions and or advice for narrowing down my interests without wasting too much of my time ? 



TLDR; Just graduated with BS in neurobiology. Don’t know what I want to do with my life now. I’m interested in psychology, dentistry, nutrition, and animals but don’t know how to narrow things down and pick a high paying career I’m passionate about.",25Jun2020,1

158,"TLDR at bottom.

I work part time in retail, which while not very physical does involve a lot of standing, walking, movement, etc. part time hours are agreed to be 15-20 hours but my boss has been scheduling me for 27-34 hour shifts the past few weeks. I have scoliosis which has also cause one of my shoulder blades to shift out of place, which means that doing these activities for too long hurts. It isn’t intense and I can work through it, but I know in the long run it isn’t good for me, and it makes me miserable. 

I filled out a change in availability form stating I can only work 20 hours max because of my medical condition, and he said that was fine. The next weeks schedule was posted and I had 27 hours. I approached him and asked about it, thinking maybe that schedule had been made before I had gotten the form to him. He said he’d look at it and got me down to 24 hours that week. The next week again, 29 hours total. I posted 2 shift for someone else to take and managed to give up one, but he did nothing when I asked him about it this time.

I thought he’d finally worked it out this week when I only had to work 13 hours, but next week’s schedule has again, 29 hours on it. I hate confrontation but I don’t know how much being polite is doing for me here. I can’t just quit, I need the money and out of all the retail places I’ve worked this has been the best so far. But I’m not sure what more I can do.

162,"TL;DR: I have a fandom blog that has 5k~ followers. In an interview to become a digital media intern, I was asked to show off the work that I do on my blog which consists of fic writing and shitposting. How do I send them an example  of those things? 

Today I had an interview to be a digital media intern. I’m really excited about the opportunity, and I think I did okay in the interview. The only thing is, it came up that I had a tumblr blog that has gotten decently popular (I don’t put this on my resume and I don’t talk about it and I’m not even sure how it happened that we started talking about it) and they asked for some samples of my content from it.

I would be thrilled for the chance to hype myself my talking about my blog, because I am a littleproud of it, but it’s a fandom blog where I write fanfics and shitpost. I think they were expecting that I monetized it, which is not the truth at all. I run my blog in such a casual way and in truth it feels like my followers and I are all just friends who chill together. It’s kind of fucking me up, because my blog is such a safe and private space for me and it feels like that’s been completely violated. I can’t really tell them no, because I can’t help but feel that my future rests on being able to get this job.

I can use fancy words to describe it but there is literally no way I will send them a sample of one of my fics, and it would be completely inappropriate to do so. I don’t do promoted posts, so I can’t send them one of those. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How do I go about this?",25Jun2020,1
163,"When I was younger there was a boy named.. let's call him Cole. He was a neighbor. He was my childhood friend's Big Brother, in reality he was only a couple years older than me because I was older than my friend. When I was at my friend's house, cole used to bully me, pick on me, call me nasty names, chase me on our bike rides(almost get wheel to wheel called rubber ducky) my friend treated it like it was a joke and it was funny, I literally got traumatized... I came home crying every time I left their house, I still went to see my friend, for years I didn't ride my bike around the neighborhood by myself in fear he would chase me and bully me. 

Fast forward time about 10 years, we've grown up and are adults. I'm 23 and he is 26. My friend betrayed me for other friends years ago, silently thank God, that was a weird family. He doesn't bully me anymore.. Their parents still live in the neighborhood ,Cole does too.
Few years ago my ""friend"" had a graduation party, I went to be nice. Cole was there. He wouldn't say a word, he would only look and smile at me shyly. I swear he looked like ""holy shit she grew up and is beautiful"" lolol I can hope. 

Now you have gotten the story. I need the actually advice, we are adults and we live in the same neighborhood. EVERY TIME he drives by my house, he squeals his tires, revs his engine, does something loud in front of my house as he drives. Sometimes I catch him looking at my house and smiling.

168,"Hello hello. So I guess I'm using Reddit for relationship advice now. Anyway, here's my problem. I've been dating a guy for a little over 4 months now. Our relationship was great the first I'd say 2-3 months. Even though I already knew we had different political views, we never really talked about it. Till now. Recently, we've been struggling with keeping a conversation going. It's always so repetitive and whenever I try to start a conversation, he ends it within a few seconds. So, we started talking about politics. And now we just argue about our views and we even insulted eachother yesterday. It has been getting so toxic and it has been taking a toll on our relationship. In the past month, I've been so focused on school and my boyfriend that I didn't respond to my friends texts for 5 weeks. I didn't mean to do that. I genuinely care about them but I've been way too obsessed with trying to keep my mental health stable, catching up with schoolwork, and keeping the relationship as healthy as possible. My relationship has been putting all of my friendships at risk and I just realized that today. And obviously, I've failed at keeping the relationship healthy. If the only problem was about political disagreements, I would be fine but I'm starting to realize that it's more than that. I'm the type of person who accepts everyone for who they are and respect their opinions. The fact that we can't even keep a conversation going isn't even related to politics anymore. But, whenever I think about breaking up with him I always think that I'm just twisting it to something bad and that it's all just because of our political views and I should accept him for that. I overthink every single thing that might happen in the relationship and I often blame myself for the things he does (ex: Today, we were talking about something other than politics \*surprise surprise\* but then he said brb. After 4 hours, he came back and didn't apologize for leaving me with brb for 4 hours while posting things on his social media. I know that's not a big deal and I'm definitely overthinking it. But i saw that as my fault because I'm not interesting enough. I know it wasn't my fault and I shouldn't even overthink it but i still do). I honestly hate forcing a conversation, or anything tbh. This just keeps going downhill but i know that if i try and end it with him, he'll either convince me that it's just my political opinions affecting my emotions or that I'm gonna regret it right after.

My mom in general is a very private person, and very hard-headed. Maybe deep down she doesn't want to deal with any potential bad news, but I also think she never really felt comfortable with our current doctor to begin with (I also began seeing this doctor after I finally stopped seeing my pediatrician, and I see where my mom would be coming from). She is willing to see the dentist, an optometrist, even the Gastroenterologist, but she is of the mindset that doctors in general just want to take people's money and move on to the next patient.

172,"Man.

I have no idea how to type this out. I became a new father 9 months ago in September when my son was born. Leading up to his birth, I had been in the state forr only 3 months with my son's mother.

Long story short, she was moving away and we were emotionally connected. So we said our goodbyes and she ended up getting pregnant. I saved money and tied up loose ends in the city I grew up in and lived in for the last 27 years and followed her to rural Ohio.

Before and after the birth, both of us were under immense stress. My career didn't exist where we lived, she dealt with multiple health complications, I was barely bringing money in and hated the work I did, she had further complications after birth. We began to have an ebb and flow of fighting. Sometimes a little. Sometimes a lot.

I still have not made a single friend here.

We broke up recently. A fight culminated into her calling things off. I felt numb to the whole situation, but also a small part of me welcomed it. 

I was, and still am, world weary. I feel like my soul needs to rest.

I am now in the situation where she publicizes every negative thing I have done on social media, with most of it being just her shaping things that happened between us to fit the narrative best for it. Her family, of course, eats it up. Trust me reddit, I am no saint, but I would never stoop to slander her. Up to this point and still going forward, I want the best for her (but I want nothing to do with her). I want my son to have his mother and I will never, ever take that away.

But today. Man. My son is having bad diarrhea and it is immensely irritating his skin and sometimes causing him to bleed. He cries in pain after every bowel movement. So I video chat with his pediatrician for 45 minutes right as I got my son's grandfathers house. My son's mother was there. I arrived under the pretense that something was majorly wrong with him and it could be heart related (it wasnt), so I am on edge, naturally. I regurgitated the info the doctor gave me, comforted my son and left. I run an errand while the prescription is being filled. Her father (my son's biological grandfather) calls me up and tells me my son is in pain after a bowl movement and begins treating me like absolute dogshit when I try to explain what to do.

Its so hard to give all the context here, because man, I could write a fucking book.

But I was royally pissed after that conversation. I got the medication, went to pick up my son and take him home. 

I sat and suffered this self-righteous man who could never be wrong and his daughter could never be wrong for 20 minutes while my son was being prepared to leave and go to my house.

The reason he was at his grandfathers in the first place was because his mother took him there to be watched because I couldn't because I had to

1. Sign a lease on a new house I had to find immediately
2. Furnish the house.
3. Get utilities on the house.
4. Move my things to the new house (barely have anything anyways) via a tiny Integra.
5. Clean the house.
6. Buy duplicates of everything I would need for my son.
7. Deal with the contractor allegedly fixing the plumbing in the house (its been a week).

To begin to sum things up, the whole family is becoming extremely hostile to me and are gas lighting me into thinking I am having extreme reactions to all the shit they're doing to me.

This is the same family who - I went to my (at the time girlfriend's)sister's house to remove a heroine addicted pos abusive boyfriend from her home because she has 2 small children. My 'at the time' gf took it upon herself to go over there herself and resolve that whole mess while 8 months pregnant. POS bf has a friend with him who didnt want to end party time so he sucker punched me in the face and gave me a massive black eye.

You know what this woman tells me?

Nothing. Other then it was my fault I got punched.

I tried to remove a heroine addict from her children's home and it was my fault I got a black eye.  That sums up their attitude towards me.

I am seething mad right now that I feel like I can barely get my thoughts out. I am going to a divorce/family lawyer tomorrow to begin protecting myself from her and her family.

But I feel like I just need advice or input on what to do. I want my son to have his mother, but I want nothing to do with her or her family personally. I have no support here. I have no friends. I feel like I am fighting one gainst a hundred. I feel cornered. I am scared. I burst out crying in the middle of the night and sometimes I feel like I even know why. Or in the car.

I dont even know if I need advise or more to vent it out.

When I was 14 I spread around a copypasta about this guy who was so in love in bread he,, well..shoved it up his anus. It was very dumb, definitely, but my brain isn’t rational, so I keep thinking how i sent it to someone younger than me, I really don’t know their exact age, but they may have been 11-13(I REALLY can’t remember). I guess we were close friends because for some reason my dumbass thought it would be funny to send it to them, I know this all seems silly but the anxiety of whether or not this could mean I am some sort of monster like a pedophile who exposed children to NSFW stuff is genuinely stressing me out to the point where I’m considering suicide. 

I don’t want pity I just want to know if this is illegal or evil or something. Sorry if it seems stupid or like a joke I get it but it feels scary and real to me.",25Jun2020,1
176,I realized I care too much about my friends girl and always want to join the conversation when they talk. Like sometimes I unintentionally butt in their conversation and I feel like an asshole. Me and her have a good relationship but I don’t know I feel like I want to watch over her and protect her even tho my friends supposed to do that and it annoys me on how much of a pest I am. So how do I clear her off my mind and not needing to know every movement / action she’s doing. Because we had a habit of FaceTiming her and my friend every morning because I was bored and the boredoms coming back because she only does it with my friend now. Not saying that’s wrong but I just want her off of my mind. Barely have any other friends to talk to.,25Jun2020,1
177,"Ok so this is about my current job right now I feel like it’s time for me to go. I’ll give a quick synopsis and I would absolutely love to hear what you have to say, I’ve seen some very brilliant people on here, I need to hear some advice, I’m in need right now I believe in good karma. 

So I currently am in college and just turned 21, and have about 15 classes left until I get my engineering degree. I am also a part time Licensed realtor for about 7 months. And I have a full time job at a retail store. Not going to say which just to be safe. But it’s a solely commission based position, that has dental and eye benefits. I’ve been there for about 1 year and a half. And it’s beginning to really bug me there. The people who are “old heads” or seasoned seem to continually complain about little things I do. But I feel it is because I am doing so well at my age compared to themselves at my age probably, they may feel envious. 
But, I need a sales job for at least 2 years according to my loan officer to get a mortgage to invest in real estate, so that is why I’m holding back on leaving this “retail job”, I plan on developing and investing in real estate, in fact I actually am closing on an acre of land I just bought all out in cash the other day, that I want to develop. That is my main goal in life is to be great at real estate and not have to work and obtain financial freedom. But Every day I dread the going to that retail job, and it’s literally the easiest job, it’s just the people there and culture is horrible. 
Furthermore, I am trying my hardest in real estate and I managed to sell one house so far. It is a very saturated market for real estate where I’m at, so that is my biggest fear in leaving the security of my retail job which is paying the bills. I’d hate to say I’m going to have to take a leap of faith soon, but it is really beginning to seem like I’m going to have to. I feel like the toxicity at my retail job is hindering my capability of unlocking my full potential in real estate as well as finishing school quicker. 

Please after reading my situation, any bit of advice would be great. I am looking to actually be happy in life, what steps would you take in my situation?",25Jun2020,1

179,"TL;DR: I have a fandom blog that has 5k~ followers. In an interview to become a digital media intern, I was asked to show off the work that I do on my blog which consists of fic writing and shitposting. How do I send them an example  of those things? 

I’m 18M and I live in the US. Today I had an interview to be a digital media intern. I’m really excited about the opportunity, and I think I did okay in the interview. The only thing is, it came up that I had a tumblr blog that has gotten decently popular (I don’t put this on my resume, I don’t talk about it, and I’m not even sure how it happened that we started talking about it) and they asked for some samples of my content from it. My state code prevents them from asking about or obtaining my url, but this is as far as I am aware, a legal thing to ask code. 

I would be thrilled for the chance to hype myself up by talking about my blog, because I am sort of proud of it, but it’s a fandom blog where I write fanfics and shitpost. I think they were expecting that I monetized it, which is not the truth at all. I run my blog in such a casual way and in truth it feels like my followers and I are all just friends who chill together. It’s kind of fucking me up, because my blog is such a safe and private space for me and it feels like that’s been completely violated. I can’t really tell them no, because I can’t help but feel that my future rests on being able to get this job.

I can use fancy words to describe my content but there is literally no way I will send them a sample of one of my fics, and it would be completely inappropriate to do so. I don’t do promoted posts, so I can’t send them one of those. I’m also extremely hesitant to send them any of my political or resource posts, because of how far left-wing I am as well as my sexuality, both of which are very apparent in my poltical stances. I really do not want to lose this chance simply because of who I am. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How do I go about this?",25Jun2020,1

184,"My mom was cleaning my brother's \[14M\] room while he was away at school and found a nude picture of me \[23F\] printed on copy paper. She felt really uncomfortable about finding the image in his possession so she tore it up and threw it away. Her and I are really close so she told me about this as soon as I got home. I was confused because I have never in my life printed a nude picture of me, so I thought maybe it was just a girl who looked a lot like me. She went on to describe the way the picture looked and that was when I realized exactly which picture she was talking about.. It really was me. The picture was only ever saved onto my laptop from 2016 until 2018 and it was in a hidden folder. He has always known my password because I felt like I could trust him. So he must've snuck onto my laptop, snooped around, and printed the picture himself. The image is possibly the worst one he could have found too, it shows *everything*.. 

I am worried that he may have taken a picture of it with his phone and still has another copy of it saved. I'm also worried wondering if he has shown the picture to any of his friends. I am in disbelief that my own biological brother would steal this picture from my laptop. I am incredibly disgusted and I feel so uncomfortable. I feel like I should confront him but I don't even know how. Any advice on how to address this to him?

185,I was getting out of the military and was kind of directionless. Drifting from place to place. I end up in my hometown. For a short period of time. My sister brought her friend around and from the moment we seen each other it was love at first sight. Possibly lust I’m not sure. But she was one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw. Anyway let’s just say it was on. From what she told me she was living with a man and it was kind of off and on. Basically off at the moment. Long story short she ends up pregnant. Tells me it’s not mine. That it’s his. But I just can’t shake it. There both white and I’m brown skin. The baby a beautiful girl is born and she looks like me is brown like me. I don’t want any trouble. Last she told me was if I contacted her again she would get the cops involved. The kid looks like me I can feel it and see it. I want a dna test but I don’t want her to be mean to me. I’m sure she’s mine but not completely certain. I don’t have money for a lawyer and all the other mess that comes with it.

Ive tried braking up with him multiple times and i told him that we could be roommates until the lease is done (in about a year) until we can save up and go separate ways. He says it does not work that way and that i cant break up with him unless both of us agrees and he doesn’t want to break up so it doesn’t count and were still together according to him.

188,"I’ve been thinking about this for months now. I’ve had 3 friends over the past 5 years who I considered to be my best friends. There was a clear peak in all 3 of the friendships but for some silly reason or another, they’d become less and less interested in me. 

I know it’s not my fault. Analyzing what happened right before we started to fall out, it’s easy to see the reason why and it usually just has to do with other people. I got an apology from one of them too. 

Problem is, for the past year, I’ve been so mentally distraught by just constantly having to attach and detach all the time. Attaching feels like gorilla gluing your hands together and detachment feels like ripping them back apart.

I’m off to college soon so obviously I’ll find new friends there. Question is, do I “learn from my mistakes” and not be attached in the first place but risk missing out on them possibly wanting to be attached and/or not feeling as involved in the friendship or be attached and risk whatever happened before?",25Jun2020,1
189,"Okay so a bit of a lengthy post. 


The whole thing:

Basically my situation is this- I’m currently working from home with my work computer I brought from office. My mom is ill in another state and could have anywhere from months to decades to live (she has the same condition my grandma had and my grandma passed a few months after she was diagnosed - she was also a lot older and had a lot more damage so the docs don’t think that would be the case for my mom, they’re still trying to figure out how bad my mom has it and won’t know until September). 

I brought up working from home in the other state with my work (so that my mom can have someone because I know she’s terrified and needs all the support she can get) but they said no. It’s a 6 hour drive from where I am now. 

I was on the phone with her today and she acts strong but she started crying and I felt awful and selfish for not dropping everything to be there. 

What I want to know is- If I take my stuff there anyway and use a vpn to make it look like I’m working locally- will my work find out? 

I’m worried about our gmail location, our logmein software, or any other possible thing my work could have installed in the computer ratting me out. I’m blessed to have a job in these times and don’t want to jeopardize that but I don’t know what else to do. I feel like an awful person and contemplate quitting everyday. 

Thanks for reading, and any advice is appreciated. 

Also sorry if this is posted in the wrong location.",25Jun2020,1

191,"Sooo I like my friend. It’s been a year since we’ve been friends. And decided to not text him for a week. And I felt so much better, it’s a boring feeling when texting him at times. And i recently felt like not texting him and it makes me feel sad and desperate but I realize that I’m happy rn and if I text him I’ll feel like shit. 
He did tell me “If you want to talk, just text me and I’ll answer lol” he says that. But not the way I thought. I think he only said that cuz the amount of times he saw me typing but I stopped. 
I did that cuz I wanted say stuff but I didn’t wanna bother him. And he is dry with his responses anyways. There’s so many times I just wanted to delete him and I’m even having  dreams of him deleting me. Which gets me scared tho so idk what to feel. I want him but in the way I want. Not like how he’s acting. When I’m down I think about him and texting him and I feel better. But when I actually it today. I was in a good mood I texted him and he thought me down. Not what he said, but his vibe and the way he was texting back. We are friends but this...no. 

I don’t know why i felt this way. I deleted the app which helped me not text him and it felt good but my desperate ass made me text him again. I’m hurting my self and I’m trying to to stop but the other half won’t let me. I would wait a week for him to text me first but nothing. I told him before he can hit me up if he wants and he said okay. But never does. Idk if he’s shy, busy, sick or what. But he made the excuse saying he has work. He just got a job 4 weeks ago and he still barley hit me up. So he’s using work as a excuse. And he said vidoe games. He would text me first like once a month but it wouldn’t be evey month. Like it’s random. I’m the only doing most of the work again. I didn’t give a shit but now

197,"Is it weird to go visit an old high school teacher at her house? I just graduated (meaning I am no longer a minor and a student at the high school), and I never got a chance to say goodbye or tell her where I am going to college, which is all the way across the country. After I leave in the fall I will not get a lot of chances to visit again. I found her address online and knows she lives very close to me. She has told me before the general area of where she lives and also where she works outside of school, and she said that sometimes old students would get her address before and contact her. I still meet up with my middle school and elementary school teachers twice every year and have them on social media. However, this teacher is not on any social media and I don't think I'll get very many chances to visit her. Even during school, she was hard to find since the teachers there move classrooms a lot. I always bring my favorite past teachers gifts (like food and gift cards) and have been continuing to bring her gifts too. I always give all my current teachers gifts twice a year, but I only go back to give to my favorite ones once I move up a grade, and she is one of them. She wrote my college recommendation letter and has been helping me quite a bit these few years, so I wanted to see her again before I leave.

She also said she promises next week we will hang out and she feels really bad if we don’t hang out. 

I said to not worry about it and that it’s cool. And we conversed a bit. But this woman never in my life no one has ever made me feel this way before.

210,"Quick back story. My father isn’t a good dad, most of my memories of him is him doing drugs, ignoring me and my brothers and never wanting us to be near him unless he wanted something. Because of this My parents have divorced and my father doesn’t live with us. Now, he no longer lives with us he’s suddenly a good dad and is doing things he’d never do for us. Right now he’s been aloud to stay with us for a bit.

And it was fine at the beginning he was nice and said if I ever needed anything he’d pay for me. But he doesn’t know that I’ve been molested at 5 by my uncle and that  the police are involved but my mum/ mums side of the family are hiding it from him/his side of the family.

A few days ago,  I was with him in the morning I  hugged him crying about how much I missed not seeing him. Idk what happened but I could feel him try and press my chest into his and He started talking about the way I had “grown” and “changed”. I had a horrible gut feeling about this but I ignored it choosing to stay with him since he’s my father and would never do anything to me. After a bit, he started caressing me in away that made me feel very uncomfortable. I just made up an excuse saying I was tried and left him downstairs. I’ve noticed he doesn’t look at me like he looks at my brothers, it feels ominous and it reminds me of my molester. 

Well, today me and him were home alone. I was just going up stairs and the stairs are very loud so he knew I was coming up. He left his room in his underwear and asked if I knew where the towels were. I looked down visibly uncomfortable and said no, he then proceeded to follow me when I was going to my room and kept asking the same question saying I knew where it was and wasn’t telling him. I just kept saying no I don’t know where it is.  He got really close to me and I hated it. When I got to my room he asked if I was hiding it in my room and I told him no , quickly slipping  into my room and closed the door before he could come in.

I don’t want to believe this. Now I feel like he’s trying to give me thing so he doesn’t feel bad about his actions just like my molester would do. I’ve been sexually assaulted by other family members before so now I don’t know if I’m being paranoid . I really don’t want to believe my father would do something like this but I have such a horrible feeling about this, he’s really scaring me and I can’t sleep knowing he’s in the house.  I just don’t feel safe and I feel like the memorise of the incident keep resurfacing every time I see him. I don’t want to stress out my mum or ruin the month for my brothers.

211,"Long story short, after 7+ years of university and several years of hard work, I received an offer today for my dream job working at my dream organization, with people who are like family to me. I am beyond happy and excited. I was thinking about commemorating this event in some way, but I'm not sure how. I have read some literature on how material objects have advantages over experiences (because they become a physical reminder of that time/space in your life), so I'm thinking of purchasing something that will bring me joy and that will last.

212,"so i work at a popular food place in my town. the last few days ive been picking up extra shifts. ive worked 4 double shifts in a row now, so 12 hour days. ive worked 5 double shifts in the last 6 days. 

but i feel like im subconsciously doing it. i don’t even think twice before picking up the shift. i just do it. i don’t feel tired, i don’t give myself time to think if i’m tired. 

i just want to know why i’m doing this to myself? i think i’m using work as a distraction from my personal life. but also my “old” self would’ve never worked this hard. so what could’ve caused this change? should i keep working? should i tone it down a bit?

i am getting a lot of attention and praise for it which motivates me to keep at it :/",25Jun2020,1
213,"Okay so this is kind of a complicated situation. My younger brother who is 20 just graduated college and wants to move out of my parents house. He wanted to move somewhere by himself, but he is extremely immature and doesn't know how the real world works to say the least. Me and my mom figured out a plan for him to move in with me, my husband and our 3 year old son. We were going to teach him how to drive and teach him other real world skills that he just doesn't have right now. He was excited about the idea at first but then changed his mind mind and was going to try to move somewhere else. We convinced him again to move in with us (this was today that the plan went back to this). We felt that this would be best for everyone involved, as it also helps us with money and we can't imagine him alone in a city without even a license. ANYWAYS today I was looking for his TikTok and I just typed his username into the search bar and WELP an onlyfans account with over 200 posts popped up under the same username (what an idiot!) and it was definitely him. I also found an XXX twitter account that was his as well that he has tweeted very recently on. I purposely didn't look at pictures, but they're on there for sure. In his onlyfans bio, he also mentions the possibility of being an escort, which really shocked me. Obviously, I can't stop him from doing stuff like this as he is of legal age but I definitely don't want it in my house, especially with our son. The main problem is that he doesn't really want to live here in the first place (probably because he wants to be somewhere he can further produce his XXX content), so it'll be hard to give an ultimatum of ""you have to stop or you can't live here"" because he'll just say okay I'm going to move somewhere else, but if we then say to my parents ""okay he doesn't have to live here/we don't want to live here anymore"" it's going to be majorly suspicious after we put up a big stink to get him to come here in the first place. I don't want them to find out about this because of me, as I don't feel like it's my place to reveal that about him (although all the pictures/videos were in my parents house, which is EW). I haven't even told my husband about my findings yet, I don't want it to turn into a huge thing but it is kind of a huge thing (lol). I also should add that my parents are going to pay for my brother to live with us or to live where ever for at least 10 months, and I think it would be gross of him to live off of my parents money while doing onlyfans/porn type things on the side. They definitely would not condone that and it just seems very slimy to me. Anyways, I just don't know what to do or how to go about any of this. TIA!",25Jun2020,1
214,"I work a minimum wage, small, local business. My boss won't put up a plexiglass barrier, nor do they believe in masks. They say it actually makes things worse, that somehow Coronavirus will get on the mask, and your breathing will push it out into the air. As a result, I'll be the only one wearing a mask in an environment full of people where it is almost impossible to keep 6 feet apart. Given everything going on, I don't feel safe, and I don't think the customers are safe.

After a couple of weeks of almost no rules, and people coming in and out without much guidance or restriction, I brought up my concerns to them. They have done essentially the bare minimum in response, and while I certainly appreciate the measures they have put in place (hand sanitization stand at the front door, a sign that says ""please only touch products you're going to buy"" and physical distancing stickers on the floor), I get the feeling these were put in place to satisfy me, and are not enforced when I'm not around (I can't confirm this, it's just the feeling I got when we had a talk about safety measures. They gave the impression it all seemed more inconvenient than anything). 

I objectively love this job. I'm good at it, and I enjoy it. But ever since the new owner took over, my comfort there has just gone way down. I feel bad about leaving, because it's just me and one other employee there, but I also don't want to compromise my integrity by working in an environment that  doesn't prioritize customer and staff safety.

219,"I (17, F) have an older brother (19, M) and a best friend (A:17, F). Now, the three of us have a very close friendship: we hang out often, FaceTime often, etc. Nobody's really left out. But A and I had a conversation (not gossiping) regarding my brother's behavior when we hang out. He's driven to the parks/coffee shops we hang out at and he's very controlling about what A and I can or cannot do.

It was a summer day, over 85 degrees outside, so I tried to turn on the air conditioning, but he complains about how it lowers his gas mileage (I don't know the exact terminology, sorry). So I tried to open the window, and he says that's also lowering his gas mileage and rolls the window back up. He only allows us to play his music in the car and if I try to change the music, he gets really angry.

Later that day, we went to a park and wanted to take some cool aesthetic photos by a bridge. We were there for 10 minutes taking ONE picture because he was trying to line up everything. I'm trying to be patient, but it's difficult. He deleted maybe 5-10 pictures for his Snapchat story because they weren't good enough. Like, its a picture that barely 75 people will see for 24 hours. They're not going to criticize that A and I weren't standing at the direct center of the bridge. He didn't even put up the picture because I was ""showing some skin"". For reference, I had tied up a t-shirt and my skin was mostly covered by my arms. I felt frustrated that we took a chunk out of the limited time we had to hang out to take a picture that he didn't even like.

At another location in the same park, there was some nice sun so we tried to take golden hour pictures. He always complains about how people never take pictures of him, so I offer to take some or I ask him if wants to be in a selfie with me and A, but he declines. He's in 1 selfie. When I insist on taking pictures of him, he says that ""nobody can take pictures of me like I can of other people"" and that I don't know things about lighting and other photography basics. Sure, I'm not photographer, but I can take a decent picture.

When we were driving back that day, he went 30 mph in a neighborhood. There was a dad outside, telling us to slow down, because his 2 toddlers were on the front lawn. He's like, ""whatever, f\*\*\* that dude"" and I'm like ""that dad had perfect reasoning to tell us to slow down, I mean you were going 30"". My brother starts yelling at me, saying that he has a license, I don't (I have my permit, been driving for two years, and cannot get a license because of the cost of teen insurance). He tells me to get my own ride next time, if I'm so bothered by his driving. I don't understand why my brother is blowing up, when I didn't yell at him in the first place.

Another time, when my brother took pictures of A and I two years ago, he didn't give us the pictures until one year later. Every time we asked him about it, he would say that they were his pictures, even though it was pictures of A and I. He said that he has to edit them and out mediocre editing on VSCO or our editing apps wouldn't do the pictures justice.

There's been other times that his behavior seems egotistical or narcissistic. He told me and A about a situation when he was biking. He saw a couple trying to take a selfie on the bridge and offered to take a picture for them. The woman gave his phone and he took several pictures. The woman said ""Thank you"" and after looking at the pictures said, ""Not bad"". He got offended about how she wasn't being thankful enough for taking a good picture. A and I were confused, saying that she did say thank you and was pleasantly surprised, not that she was judging his photography skills. (My brother has an interest in photography, by the way). I also told him that he was the one who offered to take the picture in the first place.

Another time my brother, A and I were hanging out and he was driving. I was putting on this lip tint, and my brother goes, ""Stop being so high-maintenance"". Thankfully, A stood up for me about how it was just lipstick and he's taking things too far. I was irritated because why should it bother him?

My brother, A and I are in group chats on Instagram, Twitter and text message. Every time we don't respond to something he says, he always talks about how nobody replies to him and always leaves him on read. I've done that to other people, I've had it done to me. A said the same thing as well. I just send things in group chats because they're funny, not because I'm expecting a response. The thing is, we don't always leave him on read or something. We respond to his messages. I don't understand why he's nitpicking the couple times we've not responded.

Now, according to his therapist's report, he has slight anxiety and OCD issues, but nothing that would require medication. He's had therapy for 6 months or so, and has just stopped going to therapy last month because his therapist thinks he's doing okay.

However, my brother has told me and A about times when he feels impulsive, like he wants to veer off the road or what if we just got into a car accident and died. Questions/situations like that. After thinking about how he quickly reacts to situations with anger or gets really defensive and has impulsive thoughts, me and A are a little bit scared to be in the car with him. Not only that, we feel tired/frustrated after spending time with him. Especially that day we went to the park with him. A and I hang out often, when he was away for college and we both feel energized/hyped to hang out and don't feel exhausted after spending time together. But, it's getting more and more frustrating to be around my brother.

Are A and I worried for no reason? Are we not being patient or accommodating him? Should we be doing better on our end? Should my brother go back to therapy?",25Jun2020,1

222,"I feel like I know the answer to this question, but it also seems that getting it off my chest to strangers may be the best way to wake up.

Though not even trying, I recently connected with someone on reddit. It was a sizzle and crack kind of connection. He was hundreds of miles away. Even though I felt that it was mutual, we exchanged very little information outside of general locations, first names, and some pictures. 

After two weeks, it felt too good to wake up to a message from him, I was still getting a rush from seeing the icon pop up that he had sent me something silly or he was checking to see how I was. I knew that nothing could come of it, but I was really starting to have feelings for this...avatar.

So, early morning I wished him the absolute best in life, cancelled or deactivated anything we shared and walked away thinking it would be that easy. Now, I cant get it out of my head. I'm still expecting messages or pictures from his day. It makes me dizzy with regret.

He has deleted his reddit and deactivated or blocked me and I have no way of contacting him. I know, I need to just let it go but I dont know how.

I have been warning him for the last 5 years that it’s going to happen whether he likes it or not and that he had better start mentally preparing for it. This only makes him more angry.

I’m 24 years old and he is 25. We have known each other for years and were friends in high school. He heavily pursued me for years and I finally gave in and we dated for a couple months recently ( I was head over heals for him) and he was telling me that he knows I’m his wife and that he’s never felt this way about someone and he suddenly tells me he decided he’s going to move to Pennsylvania (we live in Oregon) for a career and he wants to go alone, so we broke up. Well two weeks later I found out I was pregnant and he is trying to pressure me to get an abortion. He keeps saying he’s going to support my decision, but constantly brings it up even though I’ve made it clear I don’t want an abortion and that it’s against my beliefs. What’s mind boggling to me is that he said he had the same beliefs when we dated and did not believe in abortions and now he’s asking me to get one? I don’t feel justified in getting abortion at my age when we both have good jobs. I’m an RN, he works at a bank and has his own business. We are not unfit to be parents and I feel I can give this baby a good life, but I am not going to pressure him into doing something. I’ve told him over and over again that he can still leave and he says “no, if you’re having it then I can’t leave, but I’d like you to get an abortion” and he continually brings it up.

226,"Bear with me, I’m a reddit virgin.

My fiancé and I have been together for seven years or thereabouts.

Our relationship is mostly very strong and close, and generally very happy.

We went through a very bad time a few years ago - there was a sort of perfect storm of job disruption for him, arguments, a lack of support on my part and underlying issues of emotional abuse from me (I have deep rooted issues from childhood and at the time was responding to him with impatience, lack of empathy and withholding affection - it took me a very long time to realise this, but the bad time we went through helped me to properly focus on it by myself, recognise it and change things I wanted changing) (this isn’t me blaming myself for what happened to us then, just recognising the part I played at the time) - and the perfect storm led to him having an emotional affair that lasted a few weeks/a month or so, and also a one night stand with the same person - someone we both knew and he’d lent on when he was having a bad time.

Not a fun situation. I moved out for a bit, then we decided to try and make this work as we believed we had too much good underneath all the f*ckery - and we put the work in, both of us. We rebuilt trust and we both worked on stuff that we disliked about ourselves, and somehow we came out the other side a bit better and kinder and stronger together.

Fast forward a few years, our relationship is in the best place it’s ever been in. We’re in the middle of organising a wedding and we’re genuinely happy together - we love each other’s company and know where we both stand.

One thing we’ve always been absolutely shit with is money. Our saving for the wedding (or anything) never quite went to plan, but our fallback plan was to spend a small portion of a fairly large sum of money on the wedding that I have coming to me at some point this year. The rest we would put down as deposit for a mortgage. That hasn’t come through yet (it can take a relatively long time) - so the other plan B was to take out a loan. Around £15,000. (I know I know I KNOW, we should have got our shit together and not planned a wedding without saving for it and paying for it with money that’s ours. But shit happens, and we’re both at fault here.)

Everything in our life (as I’m sure with everyone’s lives) has been upturned by the global pandemic. I have been working throughout, but my fiancé has had to be furloughed due to the nature of his job (not something that can be done from home either) and so happy found himself lacking purpose. I was very worried for him at the start, as his work ethic is very strong, and I knew my mental health would suffer if it were me with nothing to do for months on end.

He did okay. He’s walked the dog, he’s cooked, he’s taken care of stuff round the house more than he’d be able to when working (he works much longer hours than I do) and he’s spent a reasonable amount of time filling his hours with video games like FIFA. He’s generally been very calm and positive (that’s his general demeanour anyway - he’s just a very sound person) and I felt reassured that this wasn’t going to have too bad an impact.

When the government started loosening regulations on lockdown, I asked him to look into the loan we’d planned, as my money still hasn’t come through. Last night, I asked him if he’d done that, and he sat and confessed to me, in tears, that he’d taken a loan out a month or so ago without telling me. His intention was to have the money there for the wedding and not have to worry about getting one nearer the time or waiting for my sum of money to come through, but then he’d frittered on a few things (we’ve both always been bad for that) - and (here’s the big bad nugget) he’d spent thousands of pounds on FIFA packs. 

Thousands. Completely unbeknownst to me. He’d hidden our last bank statement for the joint account. His payments to FIFA were in multiples of £32, £80 and so on, sometimes a few in a day, spread over the whole lockdown period. He said he’d felt addicted, he wasn’t thinking straight and he thought he’d be able to top the loan up when it came to needing money for the wedding.

I cried and threw a chair on the floor and shouted and thought about leaving and then realised that is completely not possible for me - I love him and I need to fix this and help him and move on from it. Anything else feels out of the question for me.

So we sat and looked at account statements and passwords and I’ve taken over his FIFA account so he can’t make any purchases on it - it’s all passworded to me. We’ve agreed I will take control of the remainder of the loan (just over half is left) and will regularly check every account statement and monitor stuff closely to make sure he’s not frittering elsewhere or that he’s lost his head and made a new account of anything. I need to find the right balance of controlling the financial aspects of our life, but not taking all his privacy and rights away - I feel like we’ve done this in a way that will work and that we’re both okay with.

He is going to pay back the portion of the loan that he spent, plus interest, by himself. When my money comes through I am going to use some of it to pay the portion of loan off that we spend on the wedding, so that will reduce his monthly repayments slightly, and so that is the plan.

My question is how can I get past this in my head? Trust has been damaged now a couple of times, and I don’t want to dwell on this forever. Am I doing the right thing here? I just needed to ask someone about it because I don’t want to reach out to a friend or family member that knows my fiancé, for his sake. I just can’t do that.

Thoughts? Thanks.

TL/DR: my other half cheated on me once a long time ago, we rebuilt, and then he went behind my back with a loan and spent thousands on FIFA. I want to help him and trust him properly again - how can I do this?",25Jun2020,1

I get really stressed out, starting running out of breath and feeling as though I'm gonna vomit. However, I do want to get better at this.

This got mixed in with me not being receptive to people who I dont find attractive. Which isn't always true but I do get put off by other people's behaviors. I scoff at some of the groups admittedly because they're always inactive on stuff like Meet up. And there's barely any one there. Some of them also feel too nerdy.

230,"I was setting up my platform office lamp, and while I was adjusting it carefully, something cracked inside and the support for the bulb just broke. The bulb is still functional, but the lamp to support it broke, ´´probably for being too old´´, I thought. (I was sure that we got that lamp for at least 5 years). The sound wasn´t very loud, so I continued scrolling around the Internet for around 30 minutes, stopping every 5 minutes to see if I could reconnect the support for the bulb again...all in vain.

When I told it about that to my mother, she became upset, because she says that ""things are taken care of, and they can live 100 years, like us human beings, like that picture of your grandfather"", to which I mentioned ""mom, this Lamp is not a human being, nor is it a photo, it is a thing that receives electricity and wears out over time"". She started shouting to me like twice again while I retired to my room to let her try to rebuild the lamp, and then went to sleep.

231,"So first of all, I’m the only non adult (tho pretty close) in my family. Also important to note I have OCD. 

Last week I had really bad cellulitis and by Saturday night it had developed into a massive abscess (about the size of a US half dollar and apparently the pus was bright yellow and shot out of it 6-8 inches). I went to the ER and I had to be given IV antibiotics, sedated, and have my abscess drained. I left the hospital Sunday morning. 

The sedative was pretty rough and made me feel really sick. I’m still recovering this week (been 3-4 days since ER) and feeling kinda icky from meds and still fighting infection. My mom had a minor (no cutting) surgery scheduled for today and last night I was feeling sick and just really emotional for some reason. I told her I was sick of having adult responsibilities and having my issues never being important/coming in last. Also FYI I was not referring to her surgery, but to my brother and father’s attitude towards me. I can give specific examples if you want, but it’s a long story. 

So the next morning I wake up nauseated, choke down my antibiotic, and my mom is off to her surgery. She returns this evening very very out of it and my dad basically drops her off and says I have to watch her (does not ask or say pls). I have a 19 year old not sick brother he could just as easily have asked. I’m not feeling great and my incision hurts, but I help my mom to her room. 

My dad leaves to go get her meds and us dinner. I have to sit in a room in pain, watching my mom moan and groan in pain. Then I have to help her ito the bathroom where she promptly barfs (hearing my mother barf - big OCD trigger) and walks out and grabs me for balance with her unwashed hands (um, hello? OCD?). Later she goes to the bathroom again and I ask this time if she washed her hands. She yells no at me and I almost broke down right there. 

Currently my dad got back. He came in and was like ‘oh did you want me to watch her?’  No shit Sherlock. I can feel something around my incision and i haven’t checked if it’s bleeding or I’m just sweating. Here’s to my not so healthy recovery!",25Jun2020,1

234,"Hi everyone, to start this off, I’m gay and the guy I was speaking to, I met through tinder. We matched and started chatting, almost instantly I realized the conversation wasn’t as boring as other matches I’ve made on tinder and I decided I wanted to meet with him in person. He invited me over to his apartment, we talked for a little while, then made out and did some other things that I won’t describe in detail XD. He seemed like a really cool guy and we hung out a few times after that. He’d text me first and even let me know that he was starting to like me. 

He started being distant one night after a deep convo we had, to which he dismissed his lack of regard as “being emotional”, “very busy at the moment” and apologized for it. Next night we hung out, he was okay but still a bit more distant. The next day, I broke it off with him as I said “you seem like an amazing guy but it’s clear to me that you’re distancing yourself so maybe we should go our separate ways?” to which he replied that he’s been “too busy” and “he’s sorry I feel that way but if I do, then maybe we should go our separate ways.” He then said he hopes I find someone who deserves me and I replied I hope we can still be friends, to which he agreed. 

Anyways, I’m gay. I’m 18. I understand that its very unlikely that I will find the love of my life at the age that I am at right now, but I’ve had many meaningless sexual encounters, and I swear nothing meant as much as it did with him. There were little things about him that ticked me off like his inconsistency + inconsideration (little things like he’d wait for me to open the door for him, didn’t mention when I got a haircut etc... (like i said little things)) but other than that, we bonded and it was genuinely different compared to other guys that Ive met either in real life, or on any dating platform. 

I guess my final question is, what could possibly have been his reasoning for acting different? For barely even putting up a fight when I asked to break it off? Was I wrong for breaking it off? And was there anything that I could’ve potentially done wrong? 

Because let me tell you, it’s disheartening enough knowing that I’ll have to go back to the pathetic world of grindr and tinder forever looking for Mr. right when it feels like he doesn’t even exist :/ 

Disclaimer: I guess my attachment to him could be attributed to a desire of wanting to be with someone, but he truly was different and it hurts me knowing that I’ll have to start the whole dating/casual sex thing all over again.",25Jun2020,1

236,"I’m still a minor, so take it easy on me.

TL;DR: My gf is friends w/ a p_do, and I oddly hate her for it. I need help with what to do.

My girlfriend is friends with an adult who sent pictures of themself to me, and I to them. I really hate it, and I wish it never happened. She doesn’t know, because I don’t want to tell anyone, but every time she talks about them or plays games with them infuriates me to the core. We only know this person online, but she really looks up to them and really likes them. She’s known them longer than me. Every time she brings them up, I want to break up with her. It makes me cry whenever I see them on some server together on discord, MC, or some other stupid platform. I hate her for being friends with this person, and I feel terrible that I hate her— she just doesn’t know. I tell her that I don’t want her to bring this person up anymore, but she does anyway or refers to them as “the person you don’t like”, which bothers me more. 

I think the reason this really bothers me is because I don’t have anyone to go to about it. I talk to her about my problems, but I can’t with this one. I feel like she’s going to hate me. She’s an “kill a p_dos1!1!” type of person, but when I brought up the fact I sent pictures to an adult, the same energy just,, wasn’t there, and that’s why I avoid bringing it up. We weren’t dating when this happened, by the way. It happened way before that. 

I just don’t know what to do, so I hope someone can maybe just talk to me? I’ve been like this for weeks and even typing about it makes me cry.",25Jun2020,1

241,"Okay so this is going to be a long one.

I was with this girl, we'll call her Y. We were together for 8 months, and shes my first girlfriend. She has serious mental health issues. She had a ""good voice"" and a ""bad voice"" in her head, and reguarly had episodes of having trauma flashed to her.

I supported her through everything, I got her to stop self harming, through all of this and at times had to even communicate with these voices if they took contorl of her. I was always there for her. It was diffiucult. and quite a few times I tried to end things because it was too much for me, but ended up staying due to her begging and crying at my feet. 

We were in love and things were good, even if they were difficult at times.

As she is studying abroad, we had had the conversation about Visas and what would happen once it ended. We had talked about how in the 3, 4ish years when it ended, We could think about marriage as an option. Althought it feels like were really young to do it, I loved her and wanted to spend the rest of my life.  To be clear this was not a relationship for the visa situation.

One night she told me she didn't want to do an internship anymore, which meant it would be another year shorter. I wasn't really okay with that, and she couldn't understand why I wasn't comfortable with it. Mid argument she decides to tell me shes going to stay the night at another guys place, who I knew she barely knew but due to covid was the only person around. I had only met him once in passing and again funilly enough did not like the idea of her disapearing off with some other guy when were in a big fight. She then actually tried to end things with me and threatened to call secuirty on me if I didn't leave, but clearly didn't mean it. At that point I was done and properly ended things and thats kinda where things went bad.

She had a huge breakdown, that bad voice took control and was harming her and talking to me, and she was laughing and calling me abusive (which I never have been, I've always tried to help her) and saying how she was going to die now and that I had killed her. I was terrified and tried to film as much of it as I could as I was terrified of being accused of murdering her or something. at one point she was going to smash a mug on her head. if I called for help she would bite her tounge, This lasted from dinner until 6 in the morning. I eventually managed to call the police, who she took the phone off of me and lied to. and then threatened me again with the tounge biting if i didn't play along. I managed to mouth help me to police without her seeing and they separated us and she snapped out of it.

I collected MOST of my stuff, and my brother picked up me and took my home and Y was left with the police. This was the last time I have seen her in person. I found out she had been left on her own which I still do not understand, and she started sending me clearly suicidal messages which scared me, so I immediatly called the police again and the university to get to her. They found she has taken pills and alchohol and got her to the hospital. 

We talked a little after this but I wanted space from her. She clearly was shaken and genuinely seemed to be doing much better, and for the first time trying to get better herself instead of expecting me to fix her. She really seemed to be working hard. A few weeks passed and I still loved her at this point and was ready to shrug off that night as a breakdown from the start, as she had had a really rough week. We talked a little and talked about the idea of getting back together (which is lunacy for me to think after all this shit) and mid that conversation she decides to tell me she thinks shes still in love with this dude from before we dated (I had known about him in the past as someone she used to love, and that she had never actually had anything with) At this point I was done, it was just the same shit again. I was pissed and told her I didn't want to talk wiith her anymore. She was desperate, talking about how much she loves me and saying things like this, which I didn't respond to. She then tried to guilt trip me about not being in the hospital with her which really pissed me off and she knew when she wrote it it was a mistake, which was the only thing I had responded to here. 

This comes back to the part of I only collected most of my stuff, as I wanted a lot of it back, 5 weeks after not speaking with her I send her a message saying 'hope your okay, I was wondering if we could talk about getting my stuff back now covids not so bad. 

She never replies

okay I assume maybe she missed it as its a platform she could have easilly missed it on, so send it on instagram

still no reply

Today I sent another message the day after asking if we could talk about this. And she says she will mail it and asks if theres anything else I wanted to say. I said how she broke my heart with the stuff she said to me, and she responded by telling me how when she saw my message she froze up and paniced for an hour, and shes been doing really well since and has lots of friends now (when I knew her she had close to none) and was dating people (great...). She started telling me how she wants to tell me she hates me and that she basically blames me for everthing that happened and that im a terrifying thing in her head and how she almost died because of me and that shell never forgive me. how she remembers all the good things and it disgusts and terrifies her. And that I lied to her because I said id be there for her and stuff. And that when I had doubts I should have just left instead of trying to help her and be there for her.

I got really angry here. I didn't show it too hard but I kinda had a full on breakdown. I've always been there for her, always tried to support her and she acts like I was this asshole the whole time for trying to help her. I stormed out my house in the middle of the night in a rage I've never been in, full on screaming and raging for over an hour. My friends and my family I live with kept calling me but I was too angry to answer. I ended up walking about 4 miles until I had calmed down enough to answer my mums phone call and my dad found me. I'm not someone who ever gets angry. Like literally ever and I completley blew off the lid tonight. 

It sounds selfish but I just don't understand how she gets to be happy, and finally seems to be good with her mental health, and is dating again while I'm left as a depressed mess for the past 5 weeks, having panic attacks because of the trauma of that night. And just hearing that she was dating again broke me. I'm so angry at her and hurt and just sad and I just don't know how to be okay. I tried to help her, I spent so long trying to be there for her and doing what I can to make things better for her and it ends up like this. It just feels so unfair. I feel like I did everything I could. I'm more writing this out for me than anything. 

I just don't know how to be okay and move past this.",25Jun2020,1

Currently I’m completing my undergraduate in political science, and working 30 hours a week at my part time. My life basically revolves around work and school. I have zero free time to myself and my life is kind of just on autopilot for the time being, eat-sleep-work/school-repeat. I have no social life aside from talking to my coworkers. 

As a result I have almost zero social life, no friends or anyone to talk to. I have a gf, but she’s about the only person I speak to, as I rarely speak to my family (burnt bridges). It’s kind of taking it out of me tbh, as my life is pretty lonely, and I’m having depressive episodes.

He hasn’t gone to any appointments and even if he was choosing too I don’t know if I could do it or see him. Am I being selfish? Does that make me wrong? He doesn’t even care... he says he’s happy it happened because I made him miserable and he didn’t want to be with me. That he’s glad it happened so he can be with her. Why? How could he do something this awful to me and not even care. Not even have any remorse or sympathy towards me. Even more so.. why do I love him. Why do I keep hoping he’s going to want me back. When he clearly wants her. What didn’t I have that she did. I held his hand through everything. He got into a motorcycle accident, I was there everyday. Then moved him in and took care of him. He went through not one but TWO psychotic episodes and I was there everyday at his visits. I loved him more than I loved myself and I guess that was the issue. Was this whole time I thought he loved me too. I thought he wanted me. I thought we could have our family. He said that his new girl can help him take care of the kid. Like he just wants me to not exist and not be involved in the picture. Like he’s trying to get rid of me. I’m so heartbroken. On top of that he kicked me out.

248,"I broke up with my bf the other day and I’m confused about how I’m feeling now. We have been together for nearly three years, I am 23 and he is 26. We didn’t see eachother for 3 months (because of COVID and social distancing) and I didnt miss it, we would talk a bit throughout the day but it was mindless basic conversation.

We both dont have much in common anymore so when we hangout it’s hard to find things to do that we both like. I was feeling like I wanted to just be alone and figure out myself and what my goals are because when I’m in a relationship, I’ll always prioritize the relationship.. like I wont ever even consider opportunities that are far away because I know it would mean long distance etc.

I was in denial that not hanging out and not wanting to see him during that time is normal but it’s definitely not right..

So now I’m just reminiscing and feeling sad because he didnt do anything “wrong” and we did have alot of good memories together and I pretty much grew up with him there. We didn’t argue much and we both had similar mindsets and things in common where it mattered, but our music taste and interests were just so different now. His family loves me and I got along well with his friends. I don’t know if im just missing him because he was a part of my life for 3 years and now hes just gone, or if I actually miss the relationship. I still have so much love for him and at one point I could really see myself marrying him soon. I know that he would’ve supported me in everything I chose to do, even if it meant studying abroad or working far etc, but I feel like I could never do that because I would feel guilty leaving him behind here.

Also, I don’t want to settle down when I’ve only had one other relationship that lasted barely a month. I was just worried that I would end up bored in ten years because we have nothing in common and I missed out on my 20’s in a relationship, only staying because it was comfortable and we connected well together.

I still feel like he is my best friend and we know eachother best. However, I want to travel and explore the world and he isn’t interested in that. He would still come with me because I wanted it, but I know that he wouldn’t enjoy it and I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it then because I would feel guilty for “dragging him along”. Vice versa, there are things he likes to do that he doesn’t force me into because he knows I am not interested. I feel like this is the time for me to explore and figure out who I am and make mistakes, but at the same time I’m in so much pain and I miss him so much.

250,"So far, I always thought I was straight but recently I was thinking that I might be asexual. Ive had a boyfriend before and it was fun at first, but later on I was just sticking around for him because he was suicidal and didnt have many friends so he really needed me. But after awhile I got tired of it and broke up with him nicely. It went a lot smoother than I thought.

Reasons I could be asexual
- Im not interested in porn or masturbating and I don't really get turned on in a sexual way.
- When I like a guy its usually just personality and I care for them, so I might just like them in a friendly way.
- I know Im not gay or bi since im not interested in girls, and I didnt know asexual was a thing until late middle school. Maybe I thought I was straight by process of elimination.


Reasons I could be straight
- I consider some guys cute and I have crushes sometimes, not currently though.
- I like guys better than girls in general. Ofc theres good and bad in both genders, I just seem to click with boys better.
- Maybe Im not very sexual because im 14 and im just not grown up enough yet.

260,"A little back story to this:
I (20F) got my dog around May of 2019 and have given her the best life that I could possibly give (side note, she is registered as my ESA and is very important to keeping me active and busy). Mid-January I had asked my parents to watch her as I was going out of state for a college conference. They agreed to watch her for the week I was gone and I planned on getting her back immediately afterwards. Once the week was over, my dad called me asking if he could keep watching her until midterms were done. I agreed as I struggle with mental disorders and thought it could be good for both of us since it would give her some extra attention as I would be busy with exams. I was then told that my parents registered in classes since she was “behind” on training (which in my eyes was not true because she was very well behaved for a 9 month old puppy) so I accepted their offer to keep her for longer. Within this time, they didn’t ask me for money to help with vet bills, grooming fees, or anything. I even offered a few times and they decided they didn’t need my help.

Recently I moved back in with my parents because of the whole COVID situation and have gotten to spend more time with my pup. This is where things got rough. My stepmom decided she was going on a camping trip and told me she was taking my dog with her, no big deal because my dog and her dog are inseparable so I didn’t mind this. The problem arose when I asked for my phone number to be put on her tag so I could be contacted if she were lost and my stepmother denied this request. I was then dealt the reminder that she was the one who took in my dog and helped her become better and kept her up to date since she was “behind” on her vaccines too, and that I was abusing her. I am completely at a loss of what to do in this situation. She even said that her name is on my dogs medical records, so it sounded as if she was saying she owned her? 

I’ve discussed this situation multiple times with my dad and he tells me that I just need to have better communication, but how am I supposed to communicate when she won’t listen and makes me feel like the villain? I have no idea how or what to say in order to take my dog back. I appreciate their help so much (especially with the vet bills. since I’m paying for online classes now, that money saved has really helped). Is this a lost cause or should I fight back? I really don’t want to lose my dog, but I feel so irresponsible for letting this happen.

261,"My boyfriend of 4 years has always been very social compared to me, he constantly makes new friends and is always chatting to people (he streams on twitch). I’ve always been fine with him talking to other people because I’ve never had a reason not to trust him. Last night after I work I came home and he was asleep. His phone was on my bedside table plugged in. I had opened it to set an alarm as my phone was flat and I didn’t want to wake to find where his charger was. It opened on his messenger account where he had been messaging a girl he went to high school with. She is also currently in a relationship (3years). I didn’t meant to read it but a word caught my eye (vagina). I then scrolled up to the top of the conversation and read it. Before you all comment, I know that I shouldn’t be reading his private messages and I feel extremely guilty about violating his trust. Okay so here we go. I will post some of the quotes and I’ll leave it to you all to determine whether or not I should be concerned. So I’ll start with some of the tamer stuff.
“You are a strong women”.
“You are a beautiful women”
“You are amazing and I love you” 
“Anytime you have a bad day, you messaged me I’m here. You truly understand that, I’m not going anywhere. I cared for you when I was younger and I always will”
He then Proceeded to write a list of things he like about her. “You’re funny, you’re attractive(body!), you are nerdy, expressive(tattoos, emotion), family orientated, healthy(body!!!), open minded. 
She then replied with a list about him. He then commented on how he loves that’s she’s short and petite. She then talked about how she doesn’t like certain things about her body. He said “the body is a big thing. Do you like your feet, your vagina, your lips, your boobs, your butt. She then said that she’s really good in bed and that her boyfriend loves her vagina. 
It goes on and on and on. This is just to get an idea of the types of messages. There is also another a girl but I think I’ve wasted enough of your time for today. Thanks for reading. Sorry if it comes across scattered and disjointed, just have a lot running through my head.",25Jun2020,1

A girl she was friends with before I dated her seemed ok and we got along (or so I thought).

She told my gf I was taking all the time away from her and that I was stealing her. She became distant and went back to hanging out with questionable people and doing hardcore drugs. She eventually became suicidal again and started to make my gfs life a living hell. She started telling randoms at her school about my gfs rough upbringing and secrets she didn’t want to get out. She started stalking her at school and eventually threatened suicide if my gf didn’t leave me and go with her. They don’t talk anymore. My gf blames herself for the leaving of this girl and to a point blames me. She even told me that part of her wishes that she never met me so this didn’t happen. Friend number two was this gay troubled boy. He was a terrible influence and that was agreed upon by me and my gfs entire family. He would always get into legal trouble, do drugs, and put my gf and her older sister in dangerous situations. One time he got them to take him in my gfs car to get pods and she brought a girl who they knew was trouble and lied about her identity to get them to let her in. While my gf was driving, the crazy bf of this mystery girl chased her and almost killed and ran my gf off the road over this girl. She eventually stopped being friends with him and she partially blames me. She realized that this kid was doing nothing but using her acceptance to his advantage. The last kid was the dealbreaker. He was a lower key friend of my gfs but was obsessed with her. He would always text her and talk to her like he was her bf. I had no problem him until he started to tell my gf that she needs to be with him and that wasn’t shit. Dude didn’t even know me. He would always comment hearts and shit on her more risqué finsta posts and save the photos. He would constantly try to “take her out for ice cream and a movie” when “the devil wasn’t home”. When he was around he would also do things like dump water on her in the shower and take her towel in hopes of seeing her nude. My gf didn’t like it either but didn’t want to say anything so she didn’t lose him. And I made it well known that I didn’t like this kid. He recently told Hanna that “life was tearing them apart and that she needs to rid of the bad things (me) to make it right”. I got mad recently when he commented “thicc hotty I better behave myself tn” on her finsta when she posted her first bikini pic in a while”. I know that they were friends so all I did was ask her to ask him to tone it down a notch because it was making me uncomfortable and upset. So she did. And he flipped out on her and told her that she deserves better and when we break up to text him. So now I feel like I am the reason that she lost everyone. But I also feel like that her “friends” were not just classic bf doesn’t like gfs ambitious friends, but they were totally those people I should have a problem with and should just do nothing about it. WHAT DO I DO? Do I deserve to lose my gf or am I right? Oh yeah also she is upset because I asked her to stop talking to a known creep who won’t stop asking her to move in with her and was caught with a pair of my gfs panties that he stole from her bag during a band trip.",25Jun2020,1
263,"So for the past few months I’ve been constantly seeing posts saying that if you’re questioning your gender identity that you’re most likely trans, and seeing these always puts me in a panic. I’ve been questioning my gender identity for the past 5-ish years, switching between pronouns and then getting nervous about them and just going back to the pronouns of my biological sex. But it’s still something I always think about. So what I’m asking advice for kind of is basically how do I really know if I’m trans? How do I tell the difference between dysphoria and dysmorphia? I know I don’t feel very confident in myself unless I present myself in a very masculine way but there are also times where I’m okay with femininity, but I’m starting to question if that okay-ness stems from being forced to be feminine my entire life.

It's getting hot, so they were in their swimsuits playing around with water guns or something. I wouldn't have even noticed if he didn't point them out. He made the comment that he was glad he had a son because he doesn't know what he would do with a daughter, and that those kids were only like 11 and their mother shouldn't let them go out like that. I didn't know what to say so I didn't say anything. It really didn't sit right with me and the more I think about it the creepier it seems.

269,"So while I was at work today, my brother left for a party. I was worried right from the moment I learnt about it when I got home.

Here's a little portrait of the situation: I work, see friends and girlfriend (with who, I'll admit, I don't always respect social distancing guidelines) but don't get out of the house otherwise. I have mild OCD and I try my best to be a good person (so does everyone I guess). My brother stays home pretty much all day, doesn't work and doesn't see friends. He also, does not care about security mesures link to the pandemic, and I think that's in part because he doesn't have a job or needs to see very many people. For me though, if I get infected, I won't be able to see my friends and girlfriend and I won't be able to work, so I really don't want to get sick. I'm being super cautious, but he doesn't seem to care.

Regarding my parents: my dad doesn't really care because he works from home and he assumes he'll get it at some point. Being infected wouldn't affect him or my brother as much as it does me.

So earlier today, he went to a party and when he came back, I asked he if he washed his hands when he got in the house. He snapped back at me and said no. He was acting as if I was being crazy about safety guidelines.

So obviously, he didn't follow safety guidelines at the party. Now I don't know what to do. He could be infected and infect me. I don't want to keep going to work and infect other people, but I also want the money and it's hard getting replacements for my job. I'm also thinking I'm thinking I shouldn't be seeing my girlfriend anytime soon either. I don't know what to do. I also hate the fact that I have to pay for his carelessness. I haven't touched him yet either and I'm starting to be even more careful even inside the house. What should I do? Should I call off work to wait an entire week? Should I talk to my brother about my issue? Could it even fix anything? I'm lost and stressed right now, anyone's help is more than welcome.",25Jun2020,1

My husband and I recently rescued 4 feral kittens (3 male 1 female) we gave 1 to a shelter and just recently caught the other 3. we live in rural country with farms and I know cats breed like crazy so I'm trying to do my part. I can't keep them outside as we have free range chickens and dont want the cats to attack them or be attacked. Anyway we caught them have them found a no kill shelter to take them in 2 weeks.. well heres my problem we kinda want to keep 1 of the male kittens as an indoor pet but we already have 3 spoiled cats (2 male 1 female) we always said 3 was enough they are up to date on shots and extremely well cared for.. so caring for this new kitten wouldn't really be a problem but I'm also 6 months pregant and feel like a new kitten a baby due is alot but totally doable. I know if we give the cat with his siblings he will have a good chance at being adopted but I also know he will have a good life living with us too.. I'm just worried if we decide to keep him and his blood work comes back positive for kitty aids or lyme disease (again hes only 3 months old tops) I would be afraid to let him interact with out 3 healthy cats to pass his disease to them.. which I know it's rare but can totally happen. So reddit people who read and feel like they can offer advice.. do we keep the kitten or let him go to a shelter with his siblings?

282,"So I’m pretty lost in life right now and I thought maybe getting some outside perspectives could help. 

I graduated 2 years ago with a BS in civil engineering. I greatly underestimated the importance of internships when I was in school so I graduated without any real experience. After I graduated I decided it would be a good idea for me to pass the FE exam before applying for entry level positions to try and make up for my lack of experience. During this time I got a retail job just to pay the bills while I worked on preparing for the FE. I didn’t have a lot of money to waste so I wanted to make sure I was really ready before taking it. A few months passed and I felt I was ready to take the exam. I ended up passing and I was pretty excited at the time. Around that same time I was contacted by an engineer that I had worked with for my senior capstone project(he worked at the firm that sponsored my project group). He said he had moved to a new firm and they were looking for an entry level engineer. He sent me some information about about the firm and projects they’d worked on and told me to email him back with my resume if I was interested. I was very excited by this and was already picturing the day I got to leave my miserable retail job. Unfortunately he ended up not getting back to me until a month later and when he did it was to inform me that they had a project go bad and were no longer able to hire anyone. This really discouraged me at the time and had me questioning if the real reason for rejection was my resume with a lack of experience. Feeling defeated, I decided to accept a supervisor position at my retail job to at least make a little bit more money and have benefits. This only made it harder to focus on my job search. Being a manager at the store I worked at was very physically/mentally demanding and combined with the lack of a consistent schedule(part of the week would be closing overnights and part of the week would be opening 6am shifts that would change weekly) I felt like I had no time/energy left for anything else. The further it got from my graduation date, the less confident I felt about still being able to become a civil engineer. Every time I even thought about applying somewhere I would think about how I had no idea how I was going to explain this gap after graduation in a completely unrelated field. When my store recently shut down for quarantine it gave me a lot of time to think(and worry/stress) about the fact that I was at a job leading me nowhere and not any closer to getting into the field I actually want to be in. Shortly after my store opened back up I made the decision to quit. My plan was to take some time off of work to give me the opportunity to do some review before applying for some entry level civil engineering positions. This brings us to the situation I’m currently in. It’s been 2 weeks since I left my job and I’ve been studying civil engineering basic topics, taking some online courses to get better at autocad, and reviewing interview interview practice questions. I’ve been getting pretty worried with the low number of entry level positions I’ve been able to find openings for. I’m even more worried about the fact that I don’t even know if I have a chance of getting hired anywhere with my graduation date being so long ago. I feel so lost and worry I’m going to be stuck in retail for the rest of my life. 

Any advice for steps that I could take at this point would be greatly appreciated.

291,"Ok so there’s a lot going in to this, so bear with me. 


Backstory: my “friend” let’s call her A, is in love with this celebrity. also, within the past week i told my friends about when my brother was sexually assaulted (they made a comment about the guy who did it, there were a ton of rumors when it happened 2 years ago, but no one knew it was my brother, so i told them abt it) she made some insensitive comments, like asking what the guy said to my brother (1. how would i know? id never ask my brother to tell me that?? 2. why would i tell her?) 

present day: 
my other friend sends a twitter thread saying there were sexually assault allegations against the celebrity A really likes. the rest of my friends in the group chat are all like “ew, cancel him, etc.” and she responds with “Bro tf I still believe in him and honestly Idc he can sexually assault me if he wants” (literally copy and pasted word for word) 

of course me and my friends are all like, tf?? like do you not realize what you just said? so we all respond with variations of like “A what?, A no., you can’t say that, that’s so insensitive” 

instead of being like “oh my gosh, i said it as a joke, that was super insensitive, i’m so sorry” or something of those lines, she respond with “what why? that’s 100% fake he’d never do that” 

so my friend responds with “you don’t know him, you only see the good sides of him” and i basically go off. i say (paraphrased) “sexual assault is a very real issue, you can’t just say you want someone to sexually assault you. you don’t know who he is, you only see the cute boy on tv. read the f*ing room did i not just tell you within the last week that my brother was sexually assaulted??”  to which she replies with “🥺”. yes, just the emoji. 

at this point i am PISSED. i thought there were multiple times she should’ve apologized and owned you to her mistakes, but then she sent that expecting an emoji to suddenly fix everything and make it all ok. i responded “no. you can’t read all of this and reply with an emoji thinking that’s a great response”. and my other friend chimes in stating how her friends have been sexually assaulted, and it’s not ok to joke about that. 

so my friends and i start facetiming (without A) and we’re all pissed of course. one of them tells us A created a new gc with her and is mad at me for being rude. A is playing the victim card saying she’s crying and how her life is sooo hard (side note, me and my friends moms have both had cancer and the friend she created the chat with’s dad died a few years ago, so in comparison, no her life has not been hard. especially when we tried to call her out peacefully to begin with). anyways, A’s wining about how now she has to write an apology note and sends a draft to my friend. the gist is “i’m so sorry guys that was super insensitive of me, i’m sorry about your friends and your brother, but you shouldn’t have been so rude [my name]” (the friend in the chat with A was reading the message to us on facetime) 

of course now we’re even more pissed because she only wants to apologize so we’ll forgive her, not because she’s actually sorry; ie. she’s sorry she sent it out, not sorry about what she said. 

she eventually sends a long apology over an hour after the original text, the end reading “i feel so bad about your friends. i hope at some point you can forgive me, but i completely understand if you never want to talk to me anymore. i deserve it”. it sounded sincere at first, but knowing about how she wrote the original and how she was basically asking my other friend to help her write an apology (gave me like youtube drama vibes where the celeb is fake crying and stuff, that’s how i feel abt her) also, she victimizes herself AGAIN here, and never apologized abt my brother, just about the friends. 

there’s other insensitive things she’s done before too that we’ve kinda called her out on which she never really listens too (she’ll just not respond and then send a TikTok an hour later, basically ignoring what we’re trying to tell her), none as nearly as bad as this though. 

so.... do i still stay friends with her? or do i basically cut her off?

obviously i’ll go with my other friends on this too as i don’t want there to be tension if i cut her off and no one else does (though i think my other friend, whose friends have been sexually assaulted, is in the same spot as me and both of us kinda want to cut her off and have thought abt it for a while). i don’t want drama but i also feel like she never listens and i’m kinda over her.",25Jun2020,1

I feel like it has been taking over my life. I barely even know what my hobbies are. Recently I watched a film that is very nostalgic for me and when I watched it it took me back to when I was younger and I actually had hobbies. One of these things was film. I used to have a ginormous interest in film. I’ve tried cutting back on watching political content by doing other things but at the end of the day it’s still what I’m interested in. It’s very hard for me to explain but what I’m trying to get at is I have a huge interest in this thing but it is taking over my life and I wish I would also focus on other things. Sorry I feel like this was very vague please feel free to ask questions. Also I would prefer not to reveal my political views but I will say I have been on both the left and the right.,25Jun2020,1
295,"I am a 16 y/old male who has been platonic best friends with a girl since we were in kindergarten. I, personally, believe that I've done super good for myself, and am on track to be valedictorian. However, my friend is on a much different path.  She got into alcohol a year ago, and when the pandemic started she got into puff-bars, which is a type of vape.  She got them from a guy who gave them to her for free because he is the biggest simp and thinks she likes him. About a week ago she broke all contact with him, and I thought she was trying to stop vaping. Today I found out that they were hanging out at his house, and he forced her to have sex with him. He also tried to make sure that she got pregnant, but she managed to sneak away later and go to Walmart to get the emergency pill.  She's acting now like nothing happened and is saying it's fine and that she's not worried about it, but I see right through that and she's not doing well emotionally. She hasn't told anyone else and has told me i can't tell anything to anyone or she'll stop talking to me. Neither of us can afford to lose the other one in our lives, and i don't know what to do. I honestly want to hit the kid with my car. Any words of advice helps. The last thing I want to do is have her be another statistic for females that have been sexually abused like that, and have lived their lives not telling anyone because she's ashamed.",25Jun2020,1

298,"Last night i parked my car, illegally, in the parking lot of a homeless shelter  next to my apartment building. (I don’t have enough money for rent and a parking pass, and the lot is usually more than half empty). In the morning when i left for work there was a sticker on my windshield, drivers side, that read something like “violation: you have parked illegally and are subject to towing and impoundment”. My initial thoughts were no big deal i won’t park here again and thanks for not towing me. Then i went to peel the sticker off and it did the classic thing where it started to rip and i was only able to peel the edges off and the rest of it just stuck and I wasn’t able to get it off. I work as a delivery driver so it was more than mildly annoying having half a sticker right in my field of view for my entire shift. Afterwards i got it off with some rubbing alcohol. I did some research and I’m almost positive what they did was illegal, not to mention unnecessarily bogus. I definitely don’t want them to get in trouble with the police, however, i mean they’re like the last organization that deserves to have the police harassing them. I do want them to be reprimanded in some way though because that shit really pissed me off. I also wouldn’t want them to do it to someone who wouldn’t have a problem with calling the cops on them. Not sure if i can do anything or what i would do. I feel like a total dick confronting them about it as they’re an objectively good organization but I’m still pissed off, because there’s still some goop left over and it’s fucking with my windshield wiper. This is definitely a super insignificant problem but the shits just buggin me.",25Jun2020,1

She thinks that someone will track me down and try to kidnap me, I am not exaggerating, she has told me this. She doesn’t seem to understand that gamers are normal people and I could just block or ignore someone if they were bothering me. I have been playing a few shooters in secret, but this is very hard because my parents walk into my room and look at my monitor every hour, to see what I am doing. I still can’t use a mic because my walls are paper thin. I know that this is really stupid, but is there anyway I can convince her to let me play shooters and multi player games?",25Jun2020,1
301,"Right now I’m going to sophomore year of high school. And currently in a school I don’t like very much, and none of my friends are there. And I could go to the school we’re all my friends are at. Easy choice right? Go to the school with your friends. How much I’d love that.

Well in 8th Grade, I did something fucked up to a girl, not touch her or call her names. Something I’m too embarrassed to say. Well, it got out and the girl turned out to be popular, so the whole 8th grade knew what the fuck I did. And their friends were planning to jump me. (They didn’t because the girl told them not to, for their sake not mine). God bless my friends for staying with me. 

Well I got so Embarrassed and bullied that I moved schools. (Great decision in my opinion, was MUCH happier) but I feel I betrayed my friends. I didn’t tell anyone goodbye in fear the word would get out and they would jump me. In the end I did tell them a much proper goodbye. And we’re still in touch

Now the high school I want to go to has some of my friends (three main ones) the rest I met that are beautiful people, half of the people that went in my 8th grade go there now, and I fear that I haven’t grown as a person that much, and haven’t dressed well enough, and haven’t looked better enough for me to go there. Also I fear that they will start spreading rumors again and I’ll fall. Or those weird looks again. I honestly don’t know if they’ll reject me or it’ll just be “awkward” 

I’ve made new friends in my new highschool but not enough to make me want to stay. Sorry for being a bother. Just had this on my chest for almost a year. My dumb ass actually worries about going outside and looking like trash in front of the people I haven’t talked to and the fear of my ex’s seeing me like “ew he still looks like that?!” And people with the same reaction. Sorry again. I wish you all the very best",25Jun2020,1
302,"I've always been a depressed individual on the inside. Always kept up a mask with a smile and the class clown act. 

I graduated college September of 2019 and have been trying to find a job ever since. I've gotten 0 responses from the applications I sent out and failed all the interviews I've gotten from referalls. I have a sub par GPA so a Masters program won't even give me chance. I tried so hard to study for interviews and apply to jobs but it's just rejection after rejection. 

If theres one thing in my life that's amazing, I would say it's my girlfriend. She is so amazing and kind and she deserves someone better than me. I told her how I felt but she freaked out. If I die, the world moves on. She will find someone who can actually take care of her or who isnt weak like me. My friend committed suicide and no one even remembers him.

So I've given myself 2 years( or basically when I hit 25). If I dont have a career by then I'll just kill myself in the forest nearby. I just dont know how to tell my girlfriend because she'll obviously stop me. I'd appreciate any advice. I just want her to find someone better.",25Jun2020,1
303,"As of this year, I’m beginning my sophomore year in college. I’m a very reserved person unless I’m around my friends and I have super low self-esteem and confidence. This spurs from me looking like a 14 year old even though I’m 19. Everybody jokes about it and I even joke about it, but it really puts me down sometimes. 

I’m left out of my friend group nearly every night as they’re all going out to party and I just sit at home on my ass. Joining a frat and living that kind of life just isn’t my personality at all. And yes, I love my friends. We’ve all stuck together since high school. The only thing holding me back from having fun with them is myself. But I know what the outcome will be if I ended up joining the frat. 

All my friends look their age and I hear all these stories about them hooking up with women and all these fun times at their frat, (which I’m too afraid to join) and it really makes me envy their lives. I feel as if I’d get made fun of or just ridiculed by all these college kids wondering why such a young kid is at a college party. And no, I’m not the type of person who wants to hook up with every single girl I meet. I just want to find the right one.

This also makes my love life hard. I usually distance myself from anything pertaining to dating or girls, (unless the girls are my actual friends) because I just don’t see a point in even talking to them. I mean how am I going to attract a girl my age looking as young as I do? Not to mention, whenever I do find a girl attractive, my friends always belittle me about my choice or how I go about talking to them.

311,"My goal of opening a Wildlife Park, am I doing the right thing?

I don’t usually talk too deeply about my dreams or goals, but if I’m ever going to accomplish these goals, I’m gonna have to start somewhere!

So first off, I’d like to give a basic rundown of what this facility is, it’s mission and goals, the animals and environment it houses, and the human aspect itself!

This park is based around rescue and rehab, captive breeding, and habitat restoration. It would most likely be located in the [Trans-Pecos Region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pecos) of Texas spanning multiple square miles and containing a plethora of wildlife and wildlife habitats! If you’re expecting Giraffes or Tigers, then I’m sorry to say that this park isn’t focused on those animals! This park is focused solely on native wildlife and locally extinct species. So while the typical exotics may not be around, do expect to see things like Deer, Wolves, Bison, and even Jaguars!

Let’s start basic, The adventure starts at the welcome center, this contains your basic, go-to stuff! There’s a gift shop with cultural and educational stuff, as well as birdhouses, feeders, baths, native plants, etc! There’s a food area with water (gonna need that!), and some environmentally healthy snacks (plenty of plant-based food!)! And there’s many displays talking about the park, the history of the land, etc!

From here, the park can be split into 3 distinct areas, there’s the permanent resident area, the captive breeding area, and finally, the restored nature area! Let’s start with the permanent resident area! Along with a botanical garden for native plants and fungi, and a “micro zoo” for bacterial life!

This area is highly inspired by the [Trowunna Wildlife Sanctuary](http://trowunna.com.au/wildlife/sanctuary/) in the vain that the animals have free roam of the area, though I obviously won’t have things like rabbits and eagles in the same area (because that [TOTALLY ](https://images.app.goo.gl/xUpgodhEgsbioiMeA) sounds like a good idea)! 

Anyways, this part of the park is home to non-releasable wildlife in need of a home, the enclosures after more like a home base for the animals, who are free to go off and do whatever they want, really! But they will be fed at their enclosures, so most yours would be done around that time! There’s also an animal hospital where you can watch surgeries, check ups, and even a little nursery and nutrition area! So if you want to see orphaned babies or learn what the animals are eating, this is the place to look! Though don’t expect the babies to notice you, there’s one-way glass being used here, and they’re at a distance! If you want an idea of were I’m going with that, have a look at [this facility!](https://buschgardens.com/tampa/zoo/animal-experiences/animal-care-center/)
The human goal here is to teach people about our effects on wildlife and the environment (expect some displays on habitat degradation and such). And who better to show this then the survivors of said issues...

The second part of the park is the captive breeding facility! This is were some serious stuff goes down!

This area also used One-Way glass, but contains animals being bred for release into the restored nature area or elsewhere! Here, you’ll find animals that are either locally extinct or are endangered! In order to maximize genetic diversity and to take pressure off of already strained wild populations, I’m going to be integrating animal from [SSP’s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Survival_Plan) organizes by AZA Accredited Zoos! The goal here is to slowly return them to a more wild-like state (this will also help address a little [issue](https://www.conservationmagazine.org/2014/12/the-little-known-downsides-to-captive-breeding-programs/) in captive breeding)! This process will occur in 5 phases

Phase 1: this is essentially the beginning of this program, the animals are still fed, watered, and cared for, but they’re being exposed to a more wild-like environment. The breeding here is selected based on genetics and [Mate Based Choice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159118305781), in order to optimize for success and welfare! (This is the only area that is visible to guests, but it’s very limited)

Phase 2: after a generation or two, we then move to this phase, we’re the animals begin to learn things like hunting, territory making, competing for mates, etc. is learned! Human interaction is slowly rolled back!

Phase 3: after a few generations, this is the part we’re we begin to instill fear of humans into the animals and prepare them for a far more wild life, and do things like protect territories and deal with other predators! This part isn’t pleasant, but it needs to happen! 

Phase 4: after one or two generations, this is were the ultimate test begins! The animals are then released into the restored nature area, and are more or less wild! From here, they begin to form their own territories, breed, and fight to survive!

Phase 5: after one or two generations here, the animals are tagged, collared, and released into a protected wild area! Completely wild!

Now of course, this may change from animal group to animal group (Birds can skip Phase 4, and reptiles and amphibians can skip Phase 3). 

For things like Jaguars, thoug, this process may be a bit... [tougher](https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/animals/2008/01/predators-captivity-habitat-animals) then hoped. But even the link has potential solutions to help with these problems and success with animals like the [Iberian Lynx](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317278807_First_captive-bred_individuals_released_in_the_Iberian_lynx_reintroduction_programme) and the [Mexican Grey Wolf ](https://defenders.org/wildlife/mexican-gray-wolf) (who will actually be involved in this project) give a possible guide into how to prepare animals for this kind of life!

For some animals, like Grizzlies, we’ll skip straight to phase 3! As there are no captive populations to pull from!

There will also be breeding programs for endangered plants, fungi, parasites, etc! Because they [deserve love](https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/407701/) too!

The goal here is to show what captive breeding is and how it works! But there will be important messages about how in order for these to work, we must also [protect habitat!](https://time.com/5817363/wildlife-habitats-disease-pandemics/) Speaking of which...

Now onto the 3rd area! The restored nature area!

This is were the heart of the facility is located! This part is pretty simple. It’s multiple square miles (end goal is 150-200 square miles) of restored habitat filled with forests, grassland, scrubland, river and lakes, mountains, etc! The goal here is to attract large populations of naive wildlife as well as a place for nuisance wildlife (a bear getting into your goods? Why, call us and we’ll give a resort to live in)! The goal here is to encourage wild animals to breed and begin filling up the area! Some animals can be released or relocated here, and all Phase 4 animals can be found here as well! There will be areas to drive through and walk through here! With underwater viewing areas for major aquatic areas (think something like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/vVmiTWrndY7oJBx96))! The goal with people is to show them what a truly wild Texas could look like and to encourage them to help make this a reality for the entire state and beyond! The concept for this area was inspired by the concept of an [“Unzoo”](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263470731_The_Unzoo_Alternative), created by a pair of zoo designers and colleagues! Though no feeding allowed! For [obvious ](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/sa_program_overview/ct_dontfeedwildlife) reasons!

For the human aspect of the park, I want to encourage locals to get involved! Maybe set up A ranch (not a bunch) on the side of the Restored Nature areas to help teach about how to reduce Rancher-Wildlife conflict! I’d also host a few small local events, cleanups, etc.! Plus, it could offer a place to talk about environmental issues and such (I plan on addressing climate change and whatnot)! But most importantly, I want to get the descendants (or local tribes if any exist) of [Jumano Indians](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmj07) in on the project! Who better to help steward the environment then the people who have been doing it for thousands of years! Plus, by offering jobs and positions of power within the facility, it could also give a platform for people who [could definitely use one!](https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2020/06/08/native-americans-want-be/)

So everything seems good so far, right? Well, this is where the problems begin.

While captive breeding programs have helped a lot, they’re not always [perfect](http://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/wfb224/Snyder%20et%20al%201996-Limits%20of%20captive%20breeding.pdf) and have drawbacks that must be carefully considered!

While this facility is looking to take a new approach, many of the animals are still not 100% “free”. And there is still captive wildlife involved. Which not everyone [agrees with](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/zoos-great-education-and-conservation-myth) (even if there’s sometimes a good reason for it), even people that I like (Joe Rogan). And if [curtain laws](https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/news/2013/8/130805-costa-rica-animals-zoos-environment-world) come into play in the US, where will this facility fall?

(Now before I go on, I have no quarrels with Most accredited Zoos and Aquariums! They’ve been a huge inspiration throughout my life and helped me truly realize my potential and urge to work with animals! Plus, I owe many of my interests in conservation and values thanks to them! And some zoos like the Belize Zoo and Jersey Zoo really do deserve their high statuses! Though that doesn’t mean their perfect! Plus Steve Irwin and Gerald Durrell are major inspirations for me! But then there’s all those roadside zoos, [practices](https://wildwelfare.org/pink-flamingo-day-2018/) that I’m shocked still happen, and things that could [use some work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/zoo.20066) (seriously, we need to address stereotypies and abnormal behavior and work towards minimizing them as much as possible!) but I digress!)

Plus, how do I know the public wants to be involved? Or if it will take the message I’m trying to share, no matter how much they may need it? Plus, am I curtain that the local Native Americans will want anything to do with this? Considering a less the pleasant [history with this sort of thing...](https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/human-zoo-for-centuries-indigenous-peoples-were-displayed-as-novelties-xzic286HEEiwgWX6P4wn7A)

In the end. There’s still a lot of unknowns here. How should I go about it, SHOULD I go about it? And am I truly doing the right thing for man and nature?

Also, there was something I was building in fiction that’s kind of like what I’m doing here, but it’s built a little more like the traditional zoo with predators and pray being separate for obvious reasons. But it’s in Florida and focuses on endangered Thai Wildlife! It’s that okey too? Considering fiction?",25Jun2020,1

So my best friend is a really great guy, but recently I feel like he doesn’t really care about me or value me that much. Every night we text, but it's always about him, his crush and his problems. He has a lot of friends, a good family, he's athletic and smart. Me,  I am barely holding on to life. Either he doesn’t care about me or is extremely insensitive. I’ve also been trying to get him to watch anime for months now, but he's always “too busy” or “lazy”.

315,"So my friend is very passive aggressive it seems and then makes me feel like a jerk for bringing it up.

Unfortunately, the next year I was a teacher assistant to both the teachers who helped me through it all. One of them lost their husband in a tragic car accident at the age of 34. The other lost her mother suddenly, (prior to corona virus). Seeing both people who got me through the grieving process also get loved ones ripped from them so suddenly caused a chain reaction, and I have been terribly anxious since. It doesn't help that I have lost an aunt to corona, and I have constant dreams about it these days, and get near panic attacks when my significant other drives without me.

I (27F) have a family member I’m really close to. A cousin (27F). We generally talk everyday through text at least. Sometimes we talk through text while always sending eachother messages on IG, Snapchat or FB about something else we’ve seen throughout the day. 

The month of June I have struggled a lot with my anxiety and depression. At times I have gotten jealous of her hanging out more with another family member or have taken things personal that maybe I shouldn’t have, but I never really spoke on said feelings. Only once did I bring up something and she listened and then told me that possibly talking to someone professionally may help more. 

We generally hang out a lot. We went from roommates to living separately, but still have hung out a couple times a week at minimum during the pandemic. The last week and half leading up to this week we spent a lot time together, nearly every day really for various reasons like our normal hangouts, really small family get togethers, etc. 

Since over the weekend we have barely talked. When we have all I’ve gotten is one word responses. I asked her was everything ok between us and she said “yeah,” but still not much dialogue beyond that the last few days. She’s also said that she’s feeling fine when I asked if she was ok. The only time she has initiated any conversation was her asking me a general question and then the responses faded once again. She has only sent me a couple post on social media and hasn’t responded to any of mine or comments about any she’s sent. 

She’s had moods before where she just wants to be to herself and regroup, but that usually only lasts a few days and then things pick back up. It’s been about a week. 

Idk how to tell if I’ve done something wrong and she’s distancing herself from me or if she just wants some “me” time. I don’t want to bother her by asking again if she’s said we’re good before, but idk. Idk if this is just my anxiety making me overthink things or if there is an issue I’m missing. How can I tell? 

TL;DR: My cousin hasn’t been communicating with me nearly as much as she normally does. How can I tell if she’s trying to ghost me or if she just needs “me” time?",25Jun2020,1

! TRIGGER WARNING FOR MENTIONS OF ABUSE/SELF-HARM/SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ! 
(it's not graphically described at all, but it is discussed)

For some background, me (13M) and friend (13MTF, hasn't transitioned) have known each other for about a year at this point. She moved to where I am in the UK over last summer, but it's only this year we've really gotten closer. We call each other 'best friends' a lot so that's about where our relationship stands. She's really lovely, a totally amazing friend, but up to the beginning of quarantine our conversations never got this heavy.
When quarantine started, everything seemed fine. We facetime each other at least daily (still do), often more, and we would talk about whatever. Non-important stuff like hobbies or stories. But later on it was pretty easy to notice a drop in her spirits, especially because her voice is usually super expressive. I had asked about it a couple times but she dodged the question and just kept the conversation moving, so I figured it wasn't important or something. June eventually hit, and she confided in me that her parents have been acting abusive to her (only child) for as long as she'd been living with them. (6~ years)
From what she's told me over text or through tears on facetime, it's mainly manipulation and verbal abuse. Like, they'll act kind and loving one minute and be screaming at her for something like eating too much the next. There's also emotional abuse where her parents hate her displaying any emotion that isn't happiness. They do not display this behaviour outside their home, which has her doubting her own word and over the years denying it's abuse at all- just 'discipline'. 
What's even worse is that it's getting worse as quarantine moves forwards. Most of our conversations now end in tears on her part. From what I can gather, the lines between verbal and physical are getting blurred. She's literally scared to leave her room because of her parents being outside it, her mental state is deteriorating fast, and I'm really scared of the possibility that she's starving to death. Most days, the most she'll eat is a small snack. She describes the hunger as constantly gnawing, it's stopping her from sleeping but at the same time she feels really tired and her movements are shaky/clumsy. She can't find the energy to do anything, so she basically just stays on her phone all day in bed and neglects schoolwork, though she's been in tears about how much she wants to but can't find a drive to do it. I'm also scared she's relapsed into hurting herself or possibly having suicidal thoughts. She has told me that she's had both before.
So here I am, with no idea what to do. I'm so, so pissed at this. She doesn't deserve treatment like this at all. I'm asking for advice on what I should do here because I feel so conflicted. On one hand, she's told me this in unspoken trust that I won't say a word along with the possibility of the situation worsening if her parents find out she's been talking about it, but I'm also really scared of what will happen if I leave it unsaid both in terms of what they can do to her and what she might do to herself. We can't meet up to get her out of the house- my parents are strict about me going out during quarantine- and school isn't likely to start back up again anytime soon. I've suggested therapy, but it's very expensive where I live and there's no way her parents will pay. Please help me, anyone. I'm lost here.",25Jun2020,1

328,"I started going to therpy a few months ago and from the very beginning my therapist has been pushing me to take medication for depression (to be fair, at the time I started therapy I was suicidal and she did a bunch of tests to see if I was actually depressed and it turns out I am). I want to get better but I feel like taking medication is only a temporary solution and I want to take the problem out by the root. During therapy I feel like we never solve any issues, I just talk about my problems and she just keeps asking me more questions and then concludes I should take meds. 

The reason I feel iffy about meds is that I read that they have a bunch of side effects and some can be permanent, and also I don't want to be numb to my pain, I want to tackle the issues that make me feel that pain in the first place and I don't know how medication would help with that. Anyways, should I take meds? What has been your experience with them?

Also this is not the main question but should I switch therapist or am I being too stubborn? I had two other therapists before her and they sucked, she is better but I still don't feel I´m making much progress. 

Some additional details: my depression and anxiety are caused by social phobia. I have a really profound fear of being left alone and I have trouble making new friends and deepening existing connections. Also I got out of an extremely emotionally abusive relationship before starting therapy. I just want to be normal and happy and have deep fulfilling relationships.",25Jun2020,1

335,"Hello internet strangers, this is my first time on reddit because I really need unbiased opinions on my personal life because I have no friends. So, the story is my boyfriend is trying to convince me that my parents are emotionally abusive towards me but I'm naturally kind of wondering if that's really true or not because I always doubt myself. Anyway, I love my parents, they're great and loving people that I'm relatively close to on the outside, they have given me a good outlook on life and I feel like they raised me well, the only issue is the time I had in middle school and the guilt tripping that's happened my whole life. So for backstory I've had anxiety all my life, I started to notice it's appearance when I was about six or seven when I had my first panic attack and was so deathly afraid of the feeling of being relaxed when I went to sleep that I thought I was dying and had to sleep with my parents until about nine or ten. In middle school, I had a bad circle of friends who weren't necessarily bad people, they just loved to shove names under their belt and put all kinds of labels on themselves that really negatively influenced me. For like a solid two years I was 100% convinced I was trans because of these friends. At the same time during middle school I was also starting to get into a really big anxiety and depression slump which made it really hard for me to make new friends, interact with people, understand how to make good friends (which is why I got sexually assaulted), etc., and it made me start failing classes. I'd say middle school was one of my darkest times, but my parents, particularly my mom, made it so much worse by being hostile towards me for my behavior. She told me she wished I wasn't her daughter at one point, would mock me for having anxiety and would try to make me get into situations that make me anxious on purpose to fix me, belittle my problems by saying others have it worse, and things of the sort (importnant note: my sister also struggles with anxiety but not as much as me, so my parents were under the impression that it would only last for the summer like it did with my sister and then I'd be back to normal again (side side not: she still has issues with it and it didn't go away after a summer)). She also didn't accept me for my self inflicted transness which made me feel really unwanted at the time (although now I very much see why I was being an idiot, I am so not trans, I have nothing against trans people though). She did take me to therapy however, but she expected it to have the immediate results that just don't happen in therapy and thought she was wasting money on it. Eventually, after a year and a half, we made up about it, although that ""making up"" consisted of my mom getting angry at me for portraying her as a transphobic mother (even though I told my friends not to tell anyone about what was going on, although they did anyway), and ignoring me for a few days straight until we both apologized for our actions and I thought that would be the end of it. but my mental health issues persevered and more misunderstandings occurred and more yelling over why I had to be different, yet they would say I could always come to them with issues with my mental health. That stuff confused me a lot. I have a permanently damaged relationship with my parents because I can't tell them about my struggles because they tell me I need to make more friends or go out more or do things that normal people do that just make me feel like they don't understand mental illness at all, which they don't, and have openly admitted to. I feel like they don't know me because I can't really tell them about what I feel. I don't know if that's just me having a ""you don't understand me mom"" teen moment or if it's serious. But the real point of this story is the guilt tripping. During middle school they guilt tripped me too, in order to try to get me to do things against my will, or to make me go out and do things that give me panic attacks. They always use guilt tripping to ""get me to do the right thing"" and they have for pretty much everything. I've kind of always been a door mat because I was always the ""good kid"" compared to my sister, and before and after middle school all my grades were great and my parents would praise me a lot, so it made me want to continue to seek that validation and do everything that was asked of me. I'm kind of a people pleaser to my parents, so I have always sought praise and validation from them for my grades in school. But anyway, my parents recently guilt tripped me when I tried to refuse going on a vacation because I wanted to stay home and be with my boyfriend who is also mentally ill and was struggling with coming to terms with his abuse. They told me they expect me to do the right thing (going on vacation), then there will be the consequences of not being able to see or talk to my bf. And there are just many other smaller instances of using guilt tripping to get me to do even smaller things like household chores, stop liking my first girl crush, and other stuff I can't remember. My bf thinks the guilt tripping and sense of no self control over my decisions is directly correlated to how my parents guilt trip me and make me feel like things are my fault. They do make me feel bad for being mentally ill for sure, and as a result I'm extremely good at not showing panic attacks on the outside and hiding the mental breakdowns I used to have weekly before I met my bf. But this is getting uber long, I apologize to whoever reads this whole thing if anyone. The backstory is pretty much over though, so on to the reason I created this account in the first place and am posting this: today my parents told me that we're going on a camping trip (I live in US btw so the virus is pretty bad here, we're in one of the worst states), and obviously I don't want to go. I'm not only terrified of diseases and germs to the point of where I still have an issue with washing my hands so much I damage my skin to this day, but my bf is also at very high risk so I want to maintain social distancing so I can still see him. In my parents' defense, I spend pretty much all my time with him when I can, and they actually did try to guilt trip me into not seeing him so much before just saying I had to spare at least one day out of the week for them, which I find totally fair and I enjoy spending time with my family to an extent. But my mom right when I told her started in on how I don't care about my family and how I only ever seem to care about my bf and no one else, which made me feel super guilty for asking. I feel like I'm just trying to keep my loved ones safe during a pandemic, and also trying to keep myself safe, and on top of that we're visiting my grandparents so I don't want to give them anything. I told my bf about this and he's super mad at them and for everything he's seen them do and everything he knows about them from what I've told him, but I am still unsure of whether they're abusive to me or not. Maybe I'm too empathetic, but I understand why they want me to see my family and prioritize my family, and I can understand that they don't understand mental illness. So reddit, are my parents abusive for sure or am I just being an oversensitive teenager?",25Jun2020,1

337,"I’m an actor and had a very dissapointing thing happen. 
So a pre Covid I auditioned as a minor role in a pilot. Months later I get a phone call and an email that I’ve been booked as a series regular on the show and it’s been picked up to series. I’m going through all the paperwork completely excited because this is my first big gig! And it’s a series regular! I didn’t even audition of it. But they prefaced the phone call that I didn’t audition for the role I’ve been cast in. Then after calling my mom and family and trying to organize my fall for the shooting schedule I get another email with paper work. I realize it doesn’t have my name on it. They emailed me and called me... by mistake. They later cast me in a guest star role. So instead of 5 months of shooting I will have two days.

They said they would have cast me in the lead but I was too young and that I was their number one pick, but the romantic opposites lead was too old, so they had accidentally emailed me.

Honestly I’m completely devastated. I would have been so excited for getting a guest star role if that had just been offered it to me first but after having a taste of that and seeing the numbers... it’s just so difficult to comprehend and be excited for the minor role.

Basically I’m losing sleep over this which feels ridiculous but I had to get it out somewhere as it’s been 2 weeks now and I’m still not okay and hardly want to look at the character they’ve made for me even though they said they is opportunity for the character to become reoccurring in the next season. (we aren’t shooting until November for that character).

Side note: yes this should have gone through my agent but I was invited to audition by one of the producers because I had worked on a project with them in the past so they wanted to contact me directly and would be getting in touch with my agent after to negotiate cost.",25Jun2020,1
338,"So I’m just gonna make this short cause I wanna watch the rest of an anime 😔. Earlier today I posted a joke on my story. It was along the lines of “Malcolm X could step on me and I’d say thank you.” 

Reason behind the post: Earlier this week I had read his quote about the knife in someone’s back, and I really liked the meaning behind it. 

A couple minutes later this dude from my school texted me. Here’s a simplified depiction of how the conversation went:

 Him: Malcolm X is anti-Semitic. 

Me: it was a joke chillax

Him: exposed anti-Semitic Jew hater.

Me: I don’t hate Jews??? 

Him: *sends a YouTube video exposing X’s views*

Me: tf I never said I hated Jews 

Him: you support someone who does

Me: I didn’t know that he was against Jews

Him: Internalized anti-Semitism

Me: I literally didn’t know

Him: ok nazi.
Sending this to ADL

Me: What why?

Him: You’re a nazi

Me: you’ve misinterpreted my statement, plus you could have just educated me. On top of that I’m from a line of Jews. I have Jewish family members. I just haven’t adopted the religion.
Fine just send it

Him: if you’re Jewish where’s your yamaka?? 
Stolen valor

Me: as I said, I have ancestors/ family member who are Jewish. I haven’t adopted the religion 

Him: many of your beliefs go against the orthodox Jewish religion 

Me: I just liked his knife quote, that why I posted it

Him: I’m warning you, please don’t ever disrespect the lords people ever again.

Me: I never meant to disrespect them. I don’t hate them.  you’re calling me a nazi when I’m not???? I think the religion is beautiful. If I had known he was anti-Semitic I wouldn’t have posted that.

Him: you think it’s beautiful?

Me: You’re gonna use my words against me aren’t you?

Him: I think if you knew one of their main beliefs you’d disagree.

Me: that Jesus wasn’t real and that he was a crazy man??

Him: No, that homosexuality is forbidden in the Torah.

Me: I mean that’s what they believe. That’s fine. I just don’t agree with that.

Him: anti-Semitic.

Me: how is that anti Semitic?

Him: I don’t understand how you come from a line of Jews and are against them. 

Me: I’m not against them. I didn’t know he was anti-Semitic.

Him: sure nazi

Me: oh my god

Him: don’t use the lords name in vain

Me: can you just stop. I get it. I didn’t know he hated Jews, and that’s a fault on my part. But I don’t know why you’re calling me a nazi because of it. If I had known I would have never supported him or posted the joke.

Him: do I need to explain myself again?

Me: fine

That’s basically how it went. I am a mixed Mexican, Puerto Rican and Native American. My dad has given me Jewish heritage. It’s not a lot, but I do know family members from that religion. I’ve never been against them, I’ve always supported them, and my parents have raised me to respect everyone no matter what.

I have actually reported people for saying things actually anti-Semitic, such as “burn like the Jews” or “hitler was right”. I’ve told many people about this encounter and all of them have said that he was an idiot. It really hurt my feelings to be called this because I know that I’m not a nazi. I’ve never held any hatred for any group of people and I am actively against intolerance. 

I was in many debates about the BLM movement, donated to petitions, and I’ve spread awareness. I almost even snuck out of my house to go to a protest. And yes I know this doesn’t prove that I’m not a nazi (even though I really am not), but I just wanted to show how much I’m against discrimination.

I just wanna know what you guys think about this, am I in the wrong or is he?? What should I do??",25Jun2020,1
339,"I am 19 years old f and bi. I need help getting away from my parents.

I was raised in a small cult who controlled everything we did. My family founded it in the early 2000s. I don't want to get too into it, but I was physically abused for a few years as a child before I learned how to shut up. 

They controlled everything I did. I couldn't have friends who weren't pre-approved. In my 13 years of school, only 3 friends were ever approved. 

I've only been to a college therapist a few times before the whole quarantine situation, but i've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, EDNOS, and a substance abuse problem.

When I was 15, my parents decided I needed a husband so they arranged a marriage for me to a local (non-cult) boy. He was 19. We dated for just a few months but he repeatedly cheated on me and abused me. They never told me of the arranged marriage and I only found out myself when I was snooping in my mom's phone. 

I tried to kill myself by not eating or drinking anything after I found out and almost succeeded. Obviously that didn't work, but as a result I can no longer have kids so my marriage was called off. 

I was ecstatic because this meant I would be able to go to college, something I otherwise never would have been able to do. My dad graciously offered to pay my way through. He helped me through the whole process.

What I didn't know at the time was that he was actually doing ALL of the work for me. I didn't know what I wanted because college was never even an option for me. He chose my path, my dorm, my dorm room. EVERYTHING. Paid to him, emailed to him. I didn't even know. 

My roommate ended up being homophobic and racist. My stupid mom outed me in front of her and as a result my roommate ( who i didn't want to live with in the first place) was harassing me constantly. For finals week of my first semester, I lived in the library. Only leaving to get clothes and to shower. 

My parents graciously step in and offer to buy a house for me to live in and rent out to a few friends. 

They now use these costs that they took on themselves as a way to control me and keep me tied down to them. 

They never taught me how to be my own person. I've never been allowed near a bank, i don't know how to get a job or pay rent or utilities. 

I know it's a lot but I have nowhere else to go. I'm sorry if this is rambling but please help me.",25Jun2020,1

It's in a really tight space and I have to use a box cutter to file it down.

She also said to me that she married my dad for money but then she said she liked him after they married. (Arrange marriage) my mother was never really religious. She seems very materialistic, but she wasn’t always terrible. She would sometimes smother me when I was little. She always had a nick name for me, she openly told me I was her favorite. And she is legally mentally retarded. She has a iq of 50 and she comes from a very snake like family. They are all selfish and only care about themselves. And I think her growing in this environment made her the way she is, self absorbed. Then my father and mother had a divorce. Was a nasty one they were both fighting over custody. She would buy me food and other things to try to convince me to go with her. I lived with my dad throughout the whole thing. She eventually gave me and my sisters up to my father. Me and my older sister hated her we called her names and openly said we hated her to her face. But my little sister still loved her she was 5 at the time. But she gave us up for $20,000
Then my older sister when to go live with her for some reasons and said that she’s not that bad that she only gave us to our father because we never wanted her. But then why didn’t she fight for my sister? My older sister changed her Mind a moth later and came back and hated my mother again. My mother has tried talking to me but I keep pushing her away. I don’t know if I’m at fault for calling her all those names. And making her cry. Or if she’s just lying and trying to hurt my dad again by visiting. Like she’s just trying to make him jealous that she’s getting married. And using us as a excuse for her returning and tormenting my dad.

344,"I’ve considered the fact that I’m asexual, but I’m confused as to what it actually means to be “asexual.” I understand that every person is different, and there are many ways that people are asexual and all that, but I don’t really understand it still.

Im almost 17 and Ive been taught about inter course etc... from the age of 11. But it never really gave me a spark or grossed me out either. 
I’ve been in a serious relationship once that lasted almost 2 years. But I wasn’t interested in being sexually active, it wasn’t a feeling like “I’m not ready” but more of a, I just don’t want to. 

I was more into the bond, like talking, hugging and I guess kissing from times to times but doing anything sexual I would just be like “Uhm, pass.” 
I do also make a lot of sexual remarks and jokes, but I just find them funny like a normal teenager lmao.

I’ve also previously masterbated a while ago to “experiment with my body” but it never satisfied me, and thinking about it now just makes me go “😐” 

I was curious about being asexual, mainly because I had no interested in being sexually active at all and that I’m not really the “I’ll kiss you the entire time you’re over” type. But because I was in a pretty long relationship, and I was romantically attached to my ex, it put me off thinking I was. Especially since my friends told me I was straight because I always make sexual jokes and stuff like that~",25Jun2020,1
345,"My friend and I coach an indoor sport together. Due to the covid situation, there was an extended break but it will soon be returning. 

I suffer from mental health issues, and have been very anxious about coaching from the start (covid wasn't around at this time). I expressed this to my friend early on. Now with the covid situation, I am even more anxious and my mental health is declining. Sport is not essential to my life. I don't want to put myself or family at any risk. 

Am I letting my friend down if I do not return? Or is he letting me down if he doesn't be supportive and understand? I'm sure he will understand, but I know I'll feel like a terrible friend. Sometimes you have to take care of your own mental health though don't you?",25Jun2020,1
347,"Hi people, I’m sorry if this isn’t a big problem like the other posts but this has been affecting me for quite a while, and I hope that i can find some solutions.

I feel extremely awkward when someone says nice things. Be it complimenting, or saying thank you, or even “i love you” from my parents, i am at a loss at what to say. My mind will go blank while panicking and takes a long time to register it. Usually, I end up ignoring them and I feel so bad because i’ve been rude. When someone says something that isn’t so nice to me, although it is small, I will feel extremely sad about it, and can’t face the person anymore. I aim very high like getting all As in my exams, and although most of the time I get it, except for maybe 1 B, i still don’t feel good. I feel that all of the scores I get are all by luck and have low self esteem. Am I just being too sensitive? What should I do?",25Jun2020,1

i arranged to meet with my friend and her boyfriend for friday, but i just found out they’re trying to get me to meet a boy. when i found that out i just got a bad feeling in my gut. 

he (the boy they want me to meet) said that i’m ‘way out of [his] league’, and stuff like that makes me uncomfortable? i’m not sure how to explain it but i just feel awkward when i know people have said that about me. 

i’m also not looking for a boyfriend, so if he actually wanted to go out with me i’d have to turn him down and that’d make me feel bad. i think it’s better to just not meet him, but i also don’t want him to text me. it’s not me being bitchy, i’m just not interested. 

i’m not looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend at the moment, and even if i had to go out with one atm i’d go out with a girl (i’m bisexual). 

i’ve texted my friend who i originally made plans with, she said that ‘oh, don’t worry he’s just a friend.’ and i don’t want to come off as some narcissistic big headed twat who thinks everyone likes me, i’m not. 

i’m notoriously single and i really don’t want to change that, it’s so much easier. want i need advice with is this: what do i do? am i overreacting?

Hey doods, this is gonna be long so if you read the rest and give your thoughts it’s much appreciated 👌🏼 anyways, so there’s this girl I knew when I was in 8th grade and when I was in 7th grade and during that period she had a boyfriend but I still continued to shoot my shot because I really liked this chick she was cool and I thought she was pretty at the time. Anyways we eventually date months later where we lasted about a week and from there we continued to date and break for 5 YEARS. While we were broken up I dated a few chicks but never got super serious or intimate with them besides kissing and butt grabbing. I couldn’t bring myself to full on have sex with them because I still had feelings for her. She would often say that we break up because I always wanna walk away but it’s her who drives me away by never wanting to talk to me. So we broke up Early 2017, fast forward to mid 2018 I hit her up because it felt like this time things would be different but it’s the exact same thing with her pushing me away by never wanting to talk and when we did talk it would be fun until she started talking about other guys in her life like “friends” and other dudes. Regardless somehow the conversation went from the norm to her admitting that she let her guy friend and her ex boyfriend from 7th grade go down on her while we weren’t dating. I was depressed for so long it hurts even now typing it. She made it seem like it wasn’t a big deal and I’m in the wrong for being upset (We weren’t together but even i couldn’t do that to her) We never got intimate once so it hurt knowing that. That being said I stopped talking to her after that and lost my virginity the very next week at the age of 18 😏 Fast forward again to today 2 years later things have changed ALOT since then, got my first 2 jobs and I’m currently employee of the month lol, got a car, got a small apartment now, met many new people, got rid of my stupid mullet 💀and picked up a hobby in mma! That being said it just sucks that it happened I only wanna go back to just smash but I’m afraid that I might buy into her bs and fall for her again. What do you guys think?

It’s bad.

355,"This is mainly focused at work. So within the team I am always the one to hype people up, if they’re feeling down or need to vent i am always happy to listen and make them feel better.

I’ve always gone out of my way to help my colleagues. Whether it be driving across country to deliver something my colleague forgot to ship for an event or helping people grow in their careers by teaching them what I can do.

I’m in marketing but I can also design, and that’s a skill I’ve been teaching to two people who are aspiring to be in the same position as me. 

This one lady (34f) in particular is admin for our team, but she wanted to get into marketing. For a year I’ve given her tasks and stuff, taught her how to design, pushed her forward and the company is giving her more marketing responsibilities, and have asked me to continue my support for her.

Yesterday I vented to this lady as we normally do about a task that I had had to redo three times because management couldn’t make their minds up. And she was really sharp with me and said “they’re your managers, you need to not complain about them giving you work” which threw me because she’s complained about stuff that’s even more trivial before and yet me complaining was suddenly wrong. 

I always just listen and support her whenever she needs it, even if it’s just to complain. I responded back to her in a joking way and then I haven’t spoken to her much after that. 

It just made me realise that this is kind of a reoccurring thing for me. I always stretch my neck out for everyone, but that is never reciprocated. At the end of the day none of these people would do the same for me.

356,"I’m a 17 year old boy. I think I’m bisexual but I tend to feel more attracted to guys sexually, and more attracted to women romantically. I struggle from very low self-esteem, and constantly resort to fantasizing about myself as a flawless better person, sometimes impressing people in those fantasies. 

I’ve been watching gay porn lately, and where ever I ejaculate, I start to feel ashamed... So sometimes what I think I do, is I start to fantasize about myself as a very straight boy and running into the pornstar in “real life” and him finding me attractive. I don’t even know how to explain it, i wish I could because it hurts me so much deep down and I want to get over this. I have a therapist but I don’t feel comfortable talking to her about something like this... it’s just too much. I know it roots from my low self esteem. And it’s not that I look up to gay pornstars, but I fantasize about getting their attention. Them finding me attractive instead of vice versa. I fantasize about discussing my straight sexual experiences with them or talking about women I find attractive. I feel like I do this fantasizing to cope with the shame. 

I do this a lot. I feel better when I fantasize about myself as a better person. In a world where I have zero flaws, and I’m straight. I wish I was straight because it would be so much easier. Other people accept me for who I am, but I’m not so sure I do. I don’t know if this makes any sense at all, what I’m trying to say here. All I know is that I frequently find myself softening the blow of reality with these fantasies. They’re pornstars! I wish I could just nut and move on with my life!

358,"I have some pretty strong political beliefs. If you want an idea, go ahead and view some of my Reddit comments; but know that my views that I display on Reddit are, to an extent, a bit more aggressive than those I display in a non-anonymized setting. While watching the Trump rally in Tulsa, I was fed up being in a Discord server with a group of people who voice support for literally everything that comes out of Trump's mouth, who support police actions during the protests, claiming COVID numbers are overcounted and call me a commie for not thinking the exact same. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not 'triggered' by this kind of stuff. I'm not an irascible person, but I lost a lot of respect for them and considered them extremely uninformed at best, malicious at worst.  
There are a couple of older members, 24-25 years old who absolutely should bear the responsibility of being an informed voter if they hold such strong political views, though most are still teenagers who can't vote. I remember being a stupid teenager with edgy views myself, honestly worse than theirs, but I have incredible trouble separating the ""meme"" from the real-life consequences. I can absolutely hold my own during a verbal debate, in fact I'm probably a better debater than I am a gamer, but I don't go out of my way to argue politics in a Discord server full of gamers. I'm also the only person who's participated in higher education.  


I silently left the server and unfriended those people on Steam. I'd known those people for 3+ years and would have considered them my best (and only) online gaming friends. I didn't leave cursing everyone on the way out, I just left. The one person who messaged me, a 16-17 year old who I would have considered by ""best"" friend in that server, was told why I was leaving; I told him that I don't consider this a meme and that real people's lives are affected by this. He said ""We can't be friends because we have different political views? That's stupid."" to which I replied ""don't message me until your brain finishes developing."" and blocked him. I'm wondering now if I overreacted and let my emotions get the best of me. At what point is it taking politics too far? Is it possible for me to co-exist in an echo-chamber of Trump supporters I so adamantly and fundamentally disagree with who I would otherwise consider good friends? I don't know.

We hadn't even talked that day and she just started slandering me with insults.

369,"Dear Reddit community, 

I have a friend that I know since kindergarden. She has  some serious family and mental health problems and at this point she just doesn't know what to do anymore and we both are afraid that it gets worse. Maybe you've got an advice what she can do. Let me tell you her background story first, she allowed me to write about it here. It began when she was 6 years old. Her parents divorced when she was 3 years old. Nothing really special. Her mother took care of her and her little brother and she could see her father sometimes when he had time for them. Her mother found a new lover, her step father, when she was 6. At the beginning they were a happy family but with time everything changed. Her step father started to   blame her for everything and insulted her as stupid and other things.  Her mother just watched and didn't do anything, she was on his side. The only attachment figure she had was her grandmother. Her grandmother knew everything and defended her but she lived too far away. When her real dad started bullying her brother for his overweight, her mother blamed her for it. Back then her brother was her mother's favourite and she was the black sheep of the family. It didn't matter who made the mistake, she was always blamed for it. Her friends and me were always there for her when she didn't want to stay home. Her mother was really strict. Her mother's punishments looked like this: either she was put down, locked up in her room or beaten. When she was 14 she had a boyfriend. It was her first true love but the relationship didn't last long 'cause he moved away.  She got really depressed and started self harming. She  scratched her arms open, didn't eat anything and  when it got really bad, she choke herself. It was hard helping here because she didn't took any help and rather hid in her own fantasy world. Her step father and her mother had another kid and thereby it got even worse. My friend had by the way also found a new lover. Now she had to take care of her brother and her sister, she basically raised her. Her sister saw her as her mom. Since her little sister was now there, her brother wasn't the favourite anymore. When her boyfriend broke up with her she got quiter and quiter and harmed herself even more. It wasn't just her arms anymore. And when my friend had a big fight with her mother it got worse. Her mother found out that she was suicidal and she said that all suicidals just got luxury problems and that she should just kill herself if she wants to. If I hadn't been there for her, she wouldn't be here anymore. Her mother saw how bad it really was but she still didn't want to take her to a therapist. Her mother just continues putting her down  and blames her when she fights with her husband (my friend's step father). 
My friend goes to work and there she has also some problems. Her mother always tells her that she should push her opinion through but when she does, her mother gets angry. Meantime my friend has outbursts of anger just like her step father and she destroys everything around her and  pulls her own hair, so that she won't hurt anyone else. I'm really worried about her. What happens when she hurts someone who is important for her? She can't move out 'cause the money she earns as an trainee isn't enough and she's afraid that her mother would outcast her and  that she could never see her siblings again. Her siblings are really really important for her...What should she do? Thanks for reading ♡",25Jun2020,1
370,"I have a mother who has, issues, I dont know what specifically, but its putting a toll on me, her attitude and her beavior is unnatural, she is psycho, she is an alcoholic pot head, and I just cant more of her shit, she even tried to stab her wrist in front of me at age 12, she has hit me, and said so much shit to me it fucking hurts, she even tried to kick me out of the car because I got sad when we had to get rid of a puppy with issues, she is a animal abuser, with every pitbull we get, she kicks them and hurts them to such an extent, I have seen her do this and is was horrible, I dont know what to do, this shit is just fucking me up, I just need any advice or help I can get, to get away from her, I have delt with her shit for 14 years of my life.",25Jun2020,1
371,"I did some fucked up shit some years ago including bullying, I acted as a piece of shit but I feel haunted every night about the shit I've done. Everytime I watch on the news that some kid killed themselves, or I read how bullying has ruined the lives of so many people I feel like so remorseful I cry. Because even if I didn't take it as far as bullies from those other cases, I never hit anyone, I still spread rumours and insulted them... and I feel that I belong with those abusers because what matters is not how much damage I did but that I hurt people like them.

Wanna know what's the worst part? I apologized to them, I showed them how much I regretted it, I even asked them if they hated me or if they felt uncomfortable about me and yikes, they said no. They even said they wanted to be friends but we never talked after that again, obviously. But why did they say no? Why did they say something about being friends? Was it out of pity, for seeing me as a broken mess? Was it because they felt pressed to do it? Was it because they believed my apologies were genuine? 

I feel I didn't apologize enough and that I'm never going to make up the shit I've done. My face burns when I go out because I feel ashamed of myself and even if no one knows what I did, I do. And the anxiety is eating me from the inside.

Do they feel about me, the same way I feel about my parents? That haunts me. And I'll never know because I don't want to talk to them again after the way I treated them back then.

372,"I'm in a dilemma and I really need some objective help. I've been dating my boyfriend, who is a 34 year old professional for about 8 months now. He has a slight disability which is not a concern to me because it is not an impairment. I fell in love with him because of his kind heart, his maturity and how he treats me. He has always been there for me during my darkest times and I finally decided to say yes to be in a relationship with him.

The thing is, prior to us entering a relationship and also during the relationship, he told me that his only ever romantic experience was with a girl he used to like but she rejected him and all he did was kiss her on the cheeks. He told me he hadn't had sex before and has not been in a relationship before. This was believable to me because he was not a good kisser and I taught him how to kiss etc. I also went on a staycation with him and we slept together. He was not very good and I thought nothing of it.

Now, 8 months in, as we were driving by a red light district, he told me that he used to visit massage parlours before. I was shocked - I probed further and at first he said that it was purely a massage but after a while, he admitted to getting hand jobs. After more probing and crying, he admitted he slept with prostitutes! Different prostitutes each time in the massage parlours...about 5-10 (although I cannot be sure if he is telling the truth anymore!). I am so shocked and shattered. He told me he felt lonely and that he was in a dark phase of his life where he was 30 years old already and hadn't had sex. He said he thought because of his disability no one would want to be with him so he had no choice. But in my mind, if that was the case, he could have just gone once to experience sex and never go again. But he went multiple times over and over again. And he maintains that the girls were not naked and that they sat on him. Then he says actually he was on top of them as well but he never touched them and they kept their bras on. I find it so hard to believe! I am going crazy - I do not know what is the truth and what is the lie anymore. I love him and I know he did it before we ever got together (or at least he says that) and he assures me that he would never cheat on me or do it again....but I keep imagining him doing it with them. I have told him that Im going to move on from this and I forgive him but yet...every morning when I see his last seen is at 4 am, I wonder what he is doing up so late at night...and why he doesn't like sharing with me what time he sleeps. I wonder all the time what he is up to when he is in the ""office"" till late. I don't know if I can ever get past this! He is suffering from depression and we've been having quite a tough time lately.

Being 34 years old, he is quite an introvert and a workaholic whereas I am 24 year old bubbly girl who loves to go out and meet friends and do stuff! So I find it so hard to believe that someone like him could have fucked so many girls! He even discreetly went to check himself for STDs before we slept together! Imagine if he hadn't checked for STDs and I naively slept with him \~ He could have infected me if he had it !

Please help! Should I just leave? I love him and what we had when we were together was beautiful but his past is just so shocking to me!!",25Jun2020,1

382,"I hate my flatmate. It starts with his racist and contemptuous attitude towards women. That alone is reason enough for most people, but he goes one step further. 

He talks badly about all things and not because he finds everything bad, but because he likes to hurt people with it.

Example:
When he asked me a year ago what my girlfriend was studying, he said without knowing her: clear that a future unemployed is looking for a computer scientist.

As a computer science student with 2 jobs I have a stressful everyday life and I am currently sitting at the PC and working at least 8 hours a day, after which I do something with friends, my girlfriend or do sports.

it is currently the case that, I only have peace of mind almost only when I cook.  My roommate knows that and because his room is next to the kitchen, he notices when I go into the kitchen and decides, if he has nothing to do, to annoy me while cooking.

He's bad about everything about my life.

To be fair, I'm not a good roommate either.

He is very often in his home country and I have often used his groceries, initially because I knew that he was throwing away food whose best-before date had expired. Then it became normal for me to eat his food.

I am the main tenant of the flat share, because when I moved in, he did not want to be the main tenant, but the apartment needed a new one.
I can cancel his lease, but why don't I do it?

At the beginning of my studies I had problems finding an apartment that I could afford. I even temporarily stayed in a student association.

After many cancellations, he then brought me to this flat share because I knew him fleetingly from partying.

He gave me a home that I hate because of him, but does that give me the right to take his?
Should I cancel his rental contract? 

As information, I'm 23 and from germany. 

As Information about my flatmate he is wealthy, so he would have no problem finding a new apartment.",25Jun2020,1

My parents force things onto me too much, I feel like a failure to them because I try but they don’t realise that I’m not perfect and it’s difficult to do everything.

2. My best friend constantly uses me as an emotional dumping ground for talking about her baby daddy problems and disappears when I want to talk about mine.



3. My parents do the same, where they call me on the phone to mediate their arguments. Its ridiculous and I end up absorbing all the negativity. I can't ignore them because my anxiety kicks off and I imagine the worst. I told them to keep me out of these things.


4. Some friends comment that I am a pushover and I've told them that's insulting. Funnily enough, they don't get on with many leople.

They don't change the way I see these people as I know they are thoughts, but they are still really disturbing.

I got a girlfriend. Im 14 years old and a male. We been together for a few months. I really like her. I love her but I'm soooo young ): I can't because we both are mature ish. Its a mature relationship for real. Well my definition of mature, Im just saying I'm scared to commit. She is a person to invest good time in. But i don't wanna mess up and lose my chance. I have so many questions on what is okay and not okay in a relationship. We set up boundaries but idk she sometimes breaks the boundaries and it makes me uncomfortable. Imma go and list them: No boy or girl best friends. (Why? because not once have I ever not liked my girl best friend. but here is the thing a few days ago she was RATING one of her ex's. I got uncomfortable because he treated her really badly but they ""made up"" the dude is a cool dude we played apex sometimes. Well anyways she was being really suspicious for instance really distant, really dry, and she just started talking to her ex. I got pissed and really petty. So we got in a fight her girl best friend started screaming at me and said really really hurtful things. To this day I have been so insecure over the things she told me. Me and my girlfriend fixed the problem and decided not to rate and have boy bestfriends. The weird thing is, when I talked to my really really old friend who is a girl she got mad because I told her that she texted me to see if Im okay. That was a one time thing, She was all sad and I had to reasure her that entire night that she is the only girl i have eyes on. BTW the girl that texted me lives in ny and i moved). Honestly, that's all i can think of for now.

I got one. So basically she was mad abt something and said she wanted a break. I was like okay (but i was freaking out she didn't even explain to me why she just left me on delivered for the entire day) the same day she posts a thirst trap. I got really really hurt one of our boundaries were that i feel uncomfortable when we post a picture that is too revealing and she felt the same. I got so upset and the next day she apologizes for saying she wants a break and said she didnt know what she was saying. She thought that it wasn't a big deal for posting the thirst trap. she made some bullshit excuse abt why she did nd now I'm just sitting here. idk what to do i talked abt it with her she said she wont do it again. but it really really made me uncomfortable and sad. she has a lot of good things abt her. A lot like a lot a lot but i just don't know abt this. I don't wanna break up i just don't know what to do.

In general, it makes me uncomfortable when she talks to other boys because usually all of them hurt her in the past. If I was the one talking to other girls the way she does she would be mad. I explained that to her and we resolved the issue but IDK. I'm okay with guy best friend depending on the intentions. But what her friend said literally hurt. Idk why she was even involved.

Rather than respond to my email, he addressed the issue in an email to the entire class stating that if the file doesn’t go through within the deadline, it’s on us. I have proof that I completed my exam hours before it was due, the app shows the time I took pictures of the document. I don’t think he’ll give me a second chance though.

407,"I moved to this apartment last fall, and for as long as I've been here, I can hear the kids next door screaming and crying nearly every night for hours on end. I'm not exaggerating. There is rarely ever a night when they aren't screaming their heads off. I know I'm not making it up either, because my roommate has heard it too, and sometimes it's so loud and distressing that it makes my dog shake. I'm positive they aren't screaming with delight either, the cries sound very anguished and distressed.  


For a long while now, I've been debating myself over whether or not I need to call CPS to come check in on the kids. The thing is, I have nothing to go on besides the screaming and crying. I don't really interact with my neighbors at all, definitely not in the dead of night when the crying occurs. I live in the US, and my state is known for its shitty foster care system, so if I do call in an anonymous tip and I'm wrong, I may have caused unnecessary stress and trauma to the family. Even if I'm right, if the kids are put into foster care, they may wind up in a worse situation than if I had done nothing at all. But there's also the possibility of things being better for the kids than they would have if I had chosen not to intervene at all.  


I'm also paranoid that I'm overreacting because I myself am a survivor of parental abuse, and to add another layer of complications to the situation, my neighbors are Black and my state is among the more racist ones in the US. So if I am wrong, I know that there will most likely be negative consequences for the family regardless, especially when taking current events into consideration.   


I keep telling myself that I'm overreacting, this is the only suspicious thing, there are a myriad of explanations for it, it'll cause more trouble if I said anything, etc. But what if I am right? Do I call CPS? Or do I mind my own business and assume my suspicions are wrong?",25Jun2020,1

416,"I'm not sure if a non-gamer will be able to relate, but I need some help. My three friends and I were playing unranked Valorant, basically a tactical competitive shooter. One of them is very competitive when it comes to stuff like this. I'd say I'm an average player whereas both of my other friends are much better than me and the only reason I play it is to hang out with them, I'm not worried whether or not we lose or win whereas he does and it sometimes feels like he prioritises winning more than me and his friendship. Since I'm not as good he tries to give me directions. Sometimes he tells me what to do, other times he says don't follow me and do your own thing, sometimes he says why aren't you in this area and other times he's giving me way too many directions at once, something like ""He's on B, go through mid, he's to the left of you, kill him, I SAID THE LEFT NOT RIGHT, HOW DID YOU NOT KILL HIM HE WAS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU."" Sometimes I try to make sense of the situation and ask him somewhat silly questions like, ""Are they on B?"" and he says something like ""Obviously, you can see that they are from the minimap"". You can see how it all becomes very confusing quickly and because of that, I perform even worse which in turn makes him have a go at me. It becomes a toxic and stressful environment very quickly. He's a nice guy outside of this and a great friend, but whenever we play this sort of a game it becomes very hurtful and it makes me feel like I'm not enough. We were playing unranked in the first place so we can eventually play ranked. Ranked is where you get placed on a certain tier. For example, a good player will have a rank of like diamond or something whereas a bad player would be bronze and it all depends on how well they perform and the number of matches won. You can see how with them being good and me being average I can drag down their performance because I'm not as good as them and in turn affects their rank, so even more so there will be a pressure on me to perform and I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it. It sucks so much because I want to play with them but I just impossible in that sort of environment, it becomes very hurtful, toxic, stressful, and pressure. It's a bit of a dilemma because if I decide not to play this game with them anymore or call my friend out on how he's acting we could grow distant from one and other. I don't want to lose a friendship over something as insignificant as fake internet points that mean nothing and sometimes it seems like he values these pretend points more than our friendship. I just need some advice on what to do or what to say to him in order for me to play. The thing is I want to play with them and the game is really fun but in this sort of an environment, it's not enjoyable at all.

My wife and I had a baby a bit over 10 months ago, everything was hard at the start obviously. My wife is a vegan and I'm fine eating plant based but sometimes will eat some meat. 

Anyway we did a surprise wedding, which the food was vegan. This we just over a year ago.

Little boy was born we are all excited and what not. Mum was a little intense at the start and wife has a little post pardum? Then nan wants to have said child which causes a riff between the two of the as wife isn't ready to let him go for a few hours without her. 

Anyway fast forward to let Sunday night dinner. First birthday is on the horizon for little boy, my mother asks if we are going to cater for everybody, wife says no we are doing all vegan which im fine with but mum takes some offence as she caters for wife, but nobody else in the family does or seems to even think of her when doing salads or vegetables. Anyway a small argument happens about it and they both say things they shouldn't have, I agree with my wife as I dealt with the aftershock in the car she balled her eyes out. I then send mum a message about it today as I've been working away and say we need to talk about it. She replies with how upset she was with how wife spoke to her ..

I’ve posted this in legal advice, but I think something is up with the post there.
I work in healthcare at a sub acute nursing facility. Amid COVID-19 our facility quickly became understaffed. It is not uncommon for there to be 2 CNA’s between 80 patients. Those of us working in the COVID-19 quarantine unit (me) are frequently unable to get any PPE and are forced to work without it. Nearly everyone has caught the virus and many of us worked through it as long as we only interacted with other positive patients although due to low staffing that’s hardly a reality. Our hazard pay was recently lowered from its original amount despite an increase in infected patients. Our boss promised the pay would go up again now that we have more, but has since gone back on that. 
Many people have already quit due to the terrible conditions. Many have also talked about combining our cases.

442,"before i go into this : here are the important people :

- stepsister (f13)
- me (f18)
- sister (f20)
- my dad (m51)
- step sisters mom (f50)
- step sisters dad (m - somewhere around 50 but passed away late 2018)

so, my stepsister was obviously (&amp; is still obviously) very upset from her father passing. it’s very traumatic for her because she was there in the hospital room as he died (from cancer). ever since then, here are some things that have been happening :

- her mother telling me she wants me to parent her child
- her mom not caring what her daughter does
- her mom &amp; my dad shit talking her father constantly
- my dad trying to adopt my stepsister to change her last name &amp; use her for tax purposes

my step sisters behavior has been concerning too : 
- having sex (including losing her virginity at 12 in a movie theater)
- drugs (weed, lsd, shrooms, &amp; cocaine)
- testing positive on a drug test for the above, and for meth (she said she never did it so i have no idea if something was laced or if it’s a false positive)
- choosing to not use protection because she “finds condoms weird” (when i confronted this she said she wants a mini her)
- getting drunk often
- having 21 year old men buy her drugs &amp; alcohol because they want to sleep with her (she did cocaine with one of them)

she told her mom about having sex, even in public. her mom didnt care, but she did say “yeah the movie theater was just wrong because there were children around” but didnt go into how thats illegal or do any sort of parenting

she also told her mom she swallows (sperm) ((i have NO idea why but i guess that was important to a 13 year old ????). her moms only response was “well at least you’re doing it right”

she has also shown her mom her nudes (literal cp) &amp; her mom didnt care, didnt say how thats illegal, nothing

she told her mom about smoking weed &amp; drinking alcohol. her mom didnt care even though alcoholism runs on both sides of my step sister’s family. her mom DID however care that she used to smoke weed in the house. so her mom would rather her 13 year old get high/drunk outside of the home !?!?

even when my step sister has told my older sister about this stuff, my older sister responds with encouraging statements (“oh i wish i was doing that when i was your age”, “good for you !!”, etc.), but then will talk so much shit about her actions &amp; the shit her mother allows whenever my step sister isnt around

her mom has ALWAYS parented my sister and i more (and more strictly) than her own daughter

i genuinely dont know what to do anymore. she barely listens to me &amp; i feel like telling her mom wont do anything since her mom already doesnt care. and my dad literally doesnt give two shits about her (he told her he would let people kidnap &amp; sex traffic her when she was 9 ... they dont have a good relationship). my sister thinks she’s lying about everything &amp; so does my mother

So I get into work next day and get a call from the people that I worked for on the job and was informed that someone who tested positive to covid 19 was present on a upper floor at the same time as me and most likley used the same elevator as me, I was a bit worried and offered to work from home (which we have done before and have recently came back as ""things have died down"" - don't think so but ok) and get tested just to be sure that I was OK, I was quickly shushed by my colleagues and boss and they used the analogy that if upstairs (in our building) have covid that doesn't mean we do, I disagree as I know it spreads by coughing and germs that the person leaves, also the fact that we all use the same entry and exit, so long story short, am I in the wrong for wanting to get tested and a doctors note to say I'm uncomfortable working on Site and at the office if covid is a big factor and risk in my life? It never bothered me too much until now but I have been at risk and almost became a statistic which makes me kinda mad when taking into account how UN affected we are stating ""it's just for publicity"" - in terms of the company letting people know that they may have been in contact with the person who tested positive. let me know what you think and if I should do something or just ignore it and keep doing my thing,

449,"*possibly NSFW*
I just got out of a 2 year relationship around 1 month ago. I slept with a guy who I had a huge crush on during Senior year 5 days ago. When we met up I had the only intention to have sex and that was all. So it came to the day and we got along extremely well, spoke about a lot of interests we had and overall we had a lot in common. He took me around and showed me all his clothes and cool items he’s collected from thrift stores and even showed me his artworks. We had amazing sex twice and it was all very comfortable and enjoyable. After we were listening to music we love and just chatting. I left there happy and satisfied both sexually and mentally but It seems along the way from leaving and getting home I started to care. Now I seem to have him constantly on my mind... why isn’t he texting, checking to see if he’s seen my Instagram stories and all of that stupid BS. I realise myself how stupid it is but I still can’t help it. 

I obviously thought we shared some sort of connection and was hoping for him to reach out and maybe want to meet up again but I got nothing. I left my sunglasses there and when I asked him about it he was dry and didn’t seem bothered. I hate how deeply this has affected me and I’m not to sure how to deal with it. I’ve muted all his posts and instagrams to get it out of my face. I’ve been seeing friends, trying to stay active and not think about it but I can’t help it. To me he is probably the guy I’ve always wanted to find in my life, genuine, different, likes good music and films. But now I just feel stupid because to him this was just sex and get out even after meeting up. He never made any sort of move to make it feel like it was ever anything more than that so one part of me completely understands that and then the other part of me wishes it was all different. I was wondering if anyone has any advice or has been in similar situations? Thanks :)",25Jun2020,1

a couple years after highschool and I reached out to him a couple days ago just to check in. We lost touch because I went cold on him as we were going to different universities and we weren't going to be in each other's lives as much. I know it's a dumb reason I do regret it. I just thought it wouldn't be that big of a deal and we could catch up some time in the future y'know considering we were close and knew almost everything about it each other, hung out at school, after school and texted everyday.

Anyway, going back to the story, he did respond to my messages at first but then just stopped. I couple days went by and so when I asked what the matter was he sent me a link to a yt video about how guys and girls can't be just friends, because the guy will always want more from the relationship. I found his response completely random and not really answering the question so what I'm asking is I can't tell if he's just trying to give me a lousy response bc he might still be upset with how I cut him off or he's just done with me and telling me to buzz off and leave him alone essentially.

I would appreciate some thoughts on where anyone thinks his head may be at.",25Jun2020,1
452,"I'm the only bisexual in a family that is only barely starting to accept me after I told them 2 years ago (which is fresh air for me). My first drink of alcohol was at 17 and 8 years later, at twenty five, I find that it's a problem. I went from once a month, to once a week, to three times a week...and most of those times I'm not drinking with anyone else. I love working, I love school, I love the idea of a career, but that damn alcohol. Then this January, I decided to quit alcohol and I got 2 months into it, then COVID-19 really began to effect the states. Nothing traumatic really...until it infected my grandmother, grandfather, auntie, and her daughter (my cousin). PLUS an additional 11 of my family members including myself were infected. 

It's been two months. Both my grandparents and auntie passed away but my cousin barely made it out alive. In fact, she was the worst out of all of them for a week, and shes only 27. And ever since march I've been drunk more times then the past year. I remember when we said goodbye to them over a video chat. I remember my family standing six feet apart from each other, in masks, watching that video chat. And I remember their funeral. The military salutes and honours for my grandpa, the great amount of flowers and scriptures for my grandma, and the amount of art given to us for my auntie. I remember it all but I dont remember much else. 

I'm sad, it's been two months and everyone tells me that's okay, I'm mourning. But I've never been this sad...ever. With my sexuality being an issue, and my downfall of life goals because of my alcoholism, I'm just broken. I'm seeing a side of myself I haven't seen before, I've known depressed people all my life, is this it? Is that what I'm feeling? Am I JUST sad? 

I might be but I wish I could just put down the bottle and feel like myself for a bit. Even for just a second.",25Jun2020,1
453,"Hi everyone I want to make this a short post but it won’t be one. 

So I’m adopted, but it is in-family adoption but I still separated from my real parents at an early age. I really don’t advise giving up your child for a better future because I ask myself so many what-ifs. Although separating from my parents didn’t affect me on a conscious level I guess it did affect me without me knowing. And for that reason, I am very emotional, observant, and a people pleaser.

So when I went to college I met this great group of friends, we did everything together and I would practically live in their dorm every day. It was a sweet taste of freedom and also being with people who care about you. But I don’t know when it started to turn a bit sour. I met this boy who I really liked and introduced it to my friends, but two of them (who I still very much like) decided to go to visit him in his dorm even though he told them not to go, and that kind of broke up our relationship that never started. But O just got a little upset and moved on because I knew they were good people at heart. Then came they rest. I noticed that I had to make an effort to feel like I fit in, let it be making snarky comments to get attention or other things. I think I’m being too sensitive because although I knew they preferred to hang out with some other people in the group they were still nice and understanding to me. I don’t know how someone can stand a whole group of people being in her dorm but M managed to because she has a big heart. K is this other friend in the group and I would say she is closest to me because we hanged out a lot after COVID. She is smart, caring but she won’t say it, and just. But sometimes I can’t stand she pointing out my logical fallacies, especially the tiniest one. So today after we zoomed as a group and something happened that made me really want to spill out my feelings I told her that I noticed that she and M are best pals and pointed out two other pairs of best pals in our group. But I think she didn’t get what I was saying because she said she don’t think anyone is her best pal. And then I said not best pals but people you just feel like you connect closer with, and she just kept focusing on the word “best” and it really broke a nerve so I snapped back at her keep calling me out because of the tiniest logical fallacies. Today it was about discussing if IL is the most corrupt state and I said “IL is one of the most corrupt” but she was like “One of the most corrupt?!?!?! It’s the most corrupt.” I really don’t appreciate getting called out in front of others. So I told her to give me a break with calling me out. And she got mad and said she will. Then afterwards I texted her bf because I felt upset about this whole thing and asked what’s the best way to talk to her and he said that she don’t mean to call me out but that’s just how she is because she doesn’t like the tiniest logical fallacies. That’s completely fine because I am very emotional and when something happens that I don’t like I will express my feelings right away and don’t give two shits about anything else. and that’s very selfish. Then I texted her that we are different people and friends accept each other for who they are. Today was just my bad day and I let your remarks get to me but I should have known that’s just who you are like me being blinded by my selfish emotions. But I guess I came off the wrong way and now she is even more mad because she thinks I am putting the blame on her. What should I do? Now I care about how she feels more than my feelings.",25Jun2020,1
454,"CW: Ableism 

Hi all! This is a long one so please bear with me 😬

I was laid off and am busting my ass to find a new job. I was given an offer yesterday but am not jazzed about it for a few reasons:

- The company is a 100+-year-old apparel business that used to do all of its business by selling wholesale to big box stores like Macy’s. Because commerce is changing, they want to try to drive traffic to their online store instead. I have lots of experience in marketing and e-commerce, but they have ZERO marketing efforts or employees in place so I would be responsible for website development, graphic design, copywriting, social media, paid media, and a lot more. It could be a fun challenge/opportunity, but I’m not sure that I feel like I know enough to be top dog at this point in my career. I really value mentorship and having creative collaboration with my coworkers.

- The company is a bit old school. Being spoiled by millennial-focused workplaces in the past I am used to flexible hours, remote work options, generous PTO, etc. This place would keep me at 10 vacation days a year until working there for 5 years. Travel is a huge  passion of mine and my biggest investment and 10 days a year doesn’t leave much room for that.

- The company is made up of all white Catholic males. Obviously not a dealbreaker in and of itself, but they’ve mentioned the “Catholic connection” between them a few times and as a Jewish woman I’m afraid to “out” myself. I also think diversity is a necessity, not an option, so this is tough.

- The gentlemen I was speaking to today used some ableist language during the interview (I was explaining a concept to them and they said they had never understood this concept before and asked if I had experience in special education). Working somewhere with people who are compassionate and empathetic toward others is important to me and this didn’t sit right at all.

The only reason I feel like saying saying yes to this job might be a wise decision anyway is because I’m (obviously) unemployed and the money is goos. I also know so many people are out of work and would probably like to be presented with any opportunity right now and I am privileged to have this decision to make in the first place.

Sooo if you are a saint and read this far, should I:

- Take the job. It’s better than unemployment and you should be happy to have work right now.
- Take the job and hope that, once you’re settled, you can bring up ideas for encouraging diversity and maybe sensitivity training.
- Turn it down but keep it simple by telling them you still would like a mentor at this point in your career.
- Turn it down and mention the mentor thing and your concern for ableist language.

I am 100% open to hear your perspectives and suggestions, so let ‘em rip! Thank you, wonderful humans ❤️!",25Jun2020,1
455,"I'm a girl (in a young age, don't think is important) and same with my girlfriend. We study at the same school and i really like her, and thankfully, she told me i was her crush.
We are both bissexual: I first came out to my friends as bi last year, but they were part of my whole journey trying to understand myself. My parents don't know about my sexuality, they say a lot of homophobic stuff and i get scared to tell them.

My girlfriend also isn't open about her sexuality, but with friends and people she knows online, she says we are a couple and all that things.

BUT, yesterday something really scary happened (btw, right now I'm going to explain using only what my girlfriend told me by message.)

- Her mom started talking to her about ""conversations"" she has (using pejorative terms for the word lesbian)
- They also started arguing about other stuff in her house (in quarantine she argue a lot with her parents, but never about sexuality)
- Her mom asked her if ""my mom knew about something""
- And today she is going to talk with her father.

I'm extremely anxious and i start shaking only thinking about my parents or her parents knowing about our relationship. If they actually discover, they will probably took our phones or make something to end our talking.

Here were i live, it's predicted to us to only go back to school on 2021, so basically i will only see her next year. If we actually stop talking, I don't even know what I'm going to do.

I'm not used to post on reddit, so I'm sorry if what I'm about to say is boring.
So, the thing is that I live with a foster family since I was 15 (I'm 22 now), and I trully love them and I'm very thankfull for what they've done for me so far. It's just that my ""mother"" is the really conservative, controlling type, and when I was younger I'd just do things as she said, but as I grew up, I just like to do me, and do my things without having to be always asking her for permission. She just doesn't get it: it's like I'm still a kid and have to tell her everything and ask to go out with my friends or just do anything. It's annoying because the years I spent in college were the most precious and I treasure freedom so much that now that I'm back home I feel like I'm in prision.
The situation with this pandemic only got worse, because she got even more controlling and paranoid and won't let me get out of the house almost anytime, even though in my country we're not in quarentine anymore.
I've been planning to move out to the city with a friend, because I just need to be far from her, and start making my own decisions and planning my own life, something I feel I cannot do near her. I don't know how, but she found out my plans before I got the guts to have a real conversation with her, and she just told me I was dishonest with her, and a liar, and not loyal at all. As if I should be some kind of obedient pet, when all I wanted was to plan things carefully and on my own, so I wouldn't be called irresponsible and naive. I feel like I can't communicate with her anymore, as long as she keeps thinking she's always right and she deserves to have the autority, because in the end I know I should just feel gratitude towards her and I own her a lot.
I think I just gave up on trying to talk to her about how I feel a long time ago, because it doesn't really matter. 
I was just venting 'till now, I guess, but the truth is that I'm the worst at conveying my feelings, and even more in situations I know I'm being trully heard.

464,"This story is somewhat complicated but I hope you'll follow.  Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I recently moved in with my aunt in new city due to problems at home, and I'm staying here until the borders open and I can leave my country again (I was studying overseas and had to come back due to covid).

For the last couple months that I've been in this new city, I've been tutoring people online and have made a bit of money that way, but not as much as I need to move out. 2 weeks ago though, I applied for a job at a local cafe and somehow landed it. The problem is that I have no prior experience in hospitality, the owner knew this however when she interviewed me.

My first impression was that the job was alright. It was hard work and the hours were long but I didn't hate it. My coworkers were very friendly and understanding.

Today, shit changed. It was my fourth shift and second week working there, the owner sat me down at the end of the day and asked me what my plans were going forward and essentially asked me to reconsider working there. I was confused, I thought she was gonna stick into me a little bit because the day before I had to correct my roster for that week (to fit my other job in) but now she was basically asking me to throw in the towel (in a really indirect way). She explained to me that even though I had been there for four shifts now, the rhythm still didn't seem to be ""sinking in"" for me and that mistakes in hospitality end up accumulating and costing everyone time, money and energy.

I do ask a lot of questions on the job, especially when I'm at the till. I asked someone else to run two coffees that day because my hands were shaking and I was afraid of spilling them. That morning, I also stuffed up by sending a wrong order to the kitchen (nobody told me that deleting the order doesn't actually prevent it from being printed, even before the customer pays), then delivering it to the customer. So that's what she was probably talking about, along with me being slow at the till. The problem is that my coworkers didn't make me feel like I had made a mistake, but that I was learning during my first week of work. So while I was careful not to repeat the mistake, I wasn't beating myself up as maybe I should have had they made that clear to me. 

I didn't think this was a signal to the owner that I was unfit. I didn't think I was dragging people behind or costing everyone. I have no experience and nobody ever trained me, they literally threw me in and expected me to get it right. I get that she's running a business and I am ragging on them but I just feel like it's unfair to hire then fire me two weeks later. 

As if she needed more ammo for the claim that I didn't have it in me, I began to cry. I don't know why. It was the end of the day and I guess I was just tired but I know all the employees in the back could see me (and were probably discussing it). I don't know why she would ever want me now. 

It seems stupid because it's only been two weeks but I'm devastated and embarrassed and doubting myself. I'm 18 and not really professional in anything I do yet, but I was really excited about that job because I was finally meeting people having spent months alone in the area. Now my first instinct is to never show my face there again. I don't know whether I should rise to the challenge and keep going with it, or quit and move on.",25Jun2020,1

There’s a lot to unravel but, I’ll keep it as short as I can. It’s worth noting that the area we live in is rather expensive, even for smaller apartments. It’s myself, my wife and our daughter as well as my father and sister. We live in a single family home and I’m certain we’ve overextended ourselves. Our monthly rent is $1500. In early June, we worked as hard as we could to come up with $1,000 dollars assuming my father could come up with the other $500. Well, we ended up giving him $250, with the expectation that he’d pitch the other $250. What really happened is, he paid the $250 we gave him and nothing else. Bringing our total to $1250 out of the full $1500 owed. Fast forward a week without him saying anything about it, we got an email from our property manager that said if he didn’t have the rest of the money by the first, he’d move forward with an eviction. My wife and I scraped together enough money to pay them. Now we’re moving into July with no money for food, bills or rent that will be due on the first.

I’m sorry for rambling, this has been a daily stress for me and I’ve confronted my father about it but, he always says they won’t move forward with an eviction. I’m at a complete loss for what should happen next. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading",25Jun2020,1

My poor step dad cannot even buy a good fucking pair of shoes! The shoes he wear atm is worn and the sole is thin therefore uncomfortable. I had an argument with my mom about this cuz i just can’t stand it. Every time I win the argument, she tells me I only side with him because he gives me money which is my monthly allowance. And I just can’t find a good comeback to that idkw.... whenever I side with my dad, she says that. Any advice on how to deal with this??",25Jun2020,1

475,"Disclaimer: This is a long post, it's best to read everything since every info is essential

I (17F) will be 18 in a few months. This summer is supposedly my last one in my natal city and I wanted to make the best out of it. I live with my mother (40F) and my stepdad (41M). My biological dad is not interested in my personal life or has nothing to do with me, except paying for my school and clothes. 

I have always been a super shy person who would stay indoors all the time and never go out, not even to buy sth from the market. Years ago, my parents would force me to go outside and socialise even if I was going through a major depression caused by my stepdad. Who, intrusively, stole my phone and looked through my private conversations and then they punished me for about a month. I didn't have my phone and I had to ask permission to use it, and I would only use it with one of them in the room. I had a very big trust issue from that moment and I started hiding everything. I put a passcode on my phone and I started hiding the truth that they wouldn't like to hear and I would only say what they wanted to hear. 

Last winter, I met on facebook through a mutual friend from school, a boy. He is 2 years older than me and he went to the same school as I do. We talked online and with time I started to trust him and to understand him. Then we were supposed to meet together, after quarantine, and hang out. I didn't tell my mom, I just lied to her that I would meet one of my girl friends. We went together and hang out until 23:30, we chatted about games, movies and memes. But when I got home, she started yelling at me, asking me if I drank or what happened. I didn't respond much to her but the next day I told her everything about him. She punished me for a whole month and I couldn't go outside, I just spent every day at home.

Then, when the punishment finally ended, she told me that I would always have to be at home at maximum by 20:00, I restarted meeting him, I would get at home on time and everytime it was okay. But three days ago, when I met him again, I came home late at 19:30 (I was also tired and I couldn't walk fast). She came home at about 20:10 and started yelling at me and asking me when I got home. I told her the truth but she didn't believe me. 

Now, I can't go outside. Her reason? That I could be sold on the black market. And I do see her point, my country is known for this and a lot of girls get sold on the black market daily, and they never come back. But, at the same time, I look at my friends and how happy they are. They meet up with their friends and they hang out until 2am. I have a lot of friends who are girls and they hang out only with guys, and nothing happens to them. I just don't understand why I am the one who can't have a social life and meet up with people when everyone else is doing this. I could have been invited to a sleepover party but I didn't because of my mum. Because of this my depression spiked and now I feel worse than ever. All I do everyday is study or do my homework or anything for school, and I had only 2 days a week when I could meet up with my friends. I don't even have that anymore. It's so sunny and beautiful outside, finally after such a long time of rain and cold weather. They even mentioned that my phone shouldn't have a passcode and that they should get access to it and see what I do there. 

Please, help, what should I do? Am I in the wrong here or they are? I am so confused and scared.",25Jun2020,1
476,"So I've always had a thing for drawing and art. Infact, I learnt how to write and draw before I even knew how to speak! 

When I was 2, I used to have few sheets of A3 paper, sit down by myself and doodle whatever was playing on the TV. My mother told me I spent 1 or 2 hours a day doing this. I've been doodling landscape pictures, comics in my free time throughout my childhood. I've been taking art classes in secondary school and got very good grades at it. It's something I love (used to love?) and something I am naturally good at.

However, in these past few years my family decided to move countries due to some personal reasons and begin new life elsewhere. I was kinda lost at how sudden things had changed and I was just ""floating"". Inevitably, my interest in art slowly died down.

It was until this morning that my mum found a few old drawings of mine in a suitcase and she told me that I really need to reinvigorate my love for art again as it would be a shame to see wasted talent.

Here's the thing, I still know all the techniques (cross-hatching, tone, composition blahblahblah) and if I pick up my pen and paper again, I reckon I can still be kinda decent at it. But is it too late to restart? It's been a long time since I done anything related to art and I'm afraid that I might have lost my touch and love on my former pastime for good.",25Jun2020,1

Success is making a decision that you’re going to get there and move towards it. Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal and how can you achieve it?

1- Act as if : How would you act if you were already the successful and rich person that you have always dreamed to be? Many people don’t realize that if you behave like a poor person you’ll always be poor. Thinking and acting as the person you want to become will not only change you mentally but will make you a [successful person](https://lexuravie.com/motivational-success-stories-of-famous-people-pubg-nike/?utm_source=redit&amp;utm_medium=feriel&amp;utm_campaign=post3)

2- be ambitious : Ambition means that you’re hungry for that success you want to be successful more than almost anything else. Ambition is an eager desire to achieve and once you feel that feeling nothing will ever stop you from success.
 
3-Network successfully: There is a strong relationship between how many people you know and how much successful you are. To network successfully the simple strategy is that after you meet a new person ask them what they do, ask for their business card and then see if you can find something you can do for them and the one thing that people like the most is if you can send them a costumer.

I developed feelings for her a month or so ago and asking her out was the hardest thing I have ever done (I have anxiety). She said she did not expect this and would need time. And also said we didn't know each other well enough.

So we kept talking after that, opened up to each other about our pasts and the stuff we've been through. During this I fell in love with her. 

A few days later she tells me that she isn't over her ex and didn't want to keep me in the dark. I thought I could still remain friends with her because she's a great friend and I felt we are really close.

A week later she tells me that she and her ex are going to give it another try, but she would still like to hang out with me.

I still talk to her, meet her everyday and spend time with her. It hurts. I don't want to stop talking to her because she is the one person who understands me.

This is my first post on this and I am not even sure if I should do this.

Now I love this job, I'm responsible for many people, I'm learning some stuff on the side and I'm  getting paid a lot.
Now with Corona going on I'm working from home and it works ok-ish. 
The only problem I have is that I can't bring myself to do the simplest tasks, even when not doing those compromises me and I'm risking to lose this apprenticeship.
Just an example: I can't be bothered to sign in my hours. It's completely on trust and I get paid by month and the hours don't matter for my pay.
It went so far that I didnt register my hours for 2 WHOLE MONTHS. I got in a lot of trouble for that, but sorted it out. And now I'm doing it again.. I just can't bring myself to do it and I don't know what to do. I postpone and postpone and postpone and I can't stop.

483,"During this pandemic, I have no choice but to go back to live with my Asian parents again. They literally asked and pressured me everyday about my undergraduate thesis. I have explained to them that me and my advisor already agreed with 1 zoom meeting per week. I have also explain that my advisor still have to teach several classes online and he's also being an advisor for several other students than me too, so he can't spent anymore time than that. And honestly, 1 meeting per week is also what I can manage too because it allows me enough time to balance working on my thesis and taking care of myself and my mental health. Working on thesis hasn't been an easy task, it takes toll on my mental health but I fucking persevere with whatever willpower I have left.

They didn't want to listen and keep pressuring me to asked my advisor to make it at least 3 meetings per week so I can quickly finish my thesis and graduate quickly. They keep asking LITERALLY ***every single day without fail.*** This makes my depression and anxiety worsen. I was clinically diagnosed with them, my parents knew about this too but they're the kind of people who think ""depression isn't real, it's just laziness"" so whenever I mention about how the way they're treating me are affecting my mental health, they got angry and accusing me that I was just being lazy and that I lied to them about my advisor's busy schedule. Then they pressured and berated me even more because they said they didn't raise me to be a lazy bum.

*Please*, I really need help. I don't have any idea left of what can I say to make them stop asking and pressuring me everyday. I still have to work on my thesis too everyday. Working on something that's already stressful plus having to face their relentless question and pressure everyday really is too much for me to handle. The number of me silently crying at night while slamming my head against the wall is already too much to count.

486,"No politics on AITA, hoping for some input here on this... 

To give some background, my wife is a marketing director and designer and back in April started a charity organization making t-shirts and donating 100% of proceed to a Covid-19 fund. She pressed 750+ shirts and donated nearly $9,000.

On top of this she's now 7 months pregnant and we have a 2 year old. So, spare time is minimal.

Fast forward to the recent murder of George Floyd and the surge in protesting, racial disparity education and activism on the national level. Of course this is a cause we support and have been active in the ways we can amid all of this health crisis and her being pregnant. After many encouraging words from friends and community members, especially POC, seeing her openly engage in difficult conversations with family and groups online, she wanted to do more.

She decided to create Black Lives Matter t-shirts and donate the funds to the ACLU of Wisconsin. What could go wrong? Well, as to be expected there was attacks from individuals who do not support the movement. Easy. Calmly engage with educational resources and attempt to bring the true merits of the movement to light. These conversations are an important part of the movement. 

What was not expected was an individual in a BLM group coming out and telling her that making a profit from this movement was disrespectful and wrong. Okay, a misunderstanding, no problem. She reiterated that this was a homemade t-shirt charity campaign and no profits were being made. Well, then the questions of transparency came in.

""How can we know that you're donating the funds?""

Good question and totally okay to ask. She shared the previous campaign communications which include all the donation receipts and explained as soon as the shirts went out we would be sharing these with the public. She even went a step further to say we could show her purchase receipts as well. 

Well, now the true under lying objection came to the surface. This individual started blasting my wife saying that she was only doing this because it's trending and their lives always mattered. She is taking away from black businesses. She claimed that she was 'putting a price on black lives.'

This, of course, has hit my wife hard as her intentions are clearly good and she is contributing and spreading support of the movement the best way she can. This is only one voice but because she is a black woman we are not looking to just ignore her and move on either.

Please, give it to us straight. Are we assholes for what we are doing or how we are doing it - or is this just one voice in the crowd that is choosing to not see what we are truly doing?

tl;dr: wife makes shirts for Covid-19 Relief , BLM movement takes off so starts she making BLM shirts for ACLU, one local woman says what she's doing is just a trend and taking from black businesses and putting a price on black lives. 100% profits are donated and well just want more perspective on this",25Jun2020,1

We have a history of mental illnesses in our family, not very severe thankfully, but it has been there for a number of years anyway. 

My dad is single, almost 60. He works hard and is a great grandfather. He lives on his own, and has said he isn't interested in a relationship. Due to covid I haven't been down as much and I feel guilty about it. 

I asked him if he wanted to go out to lunch and he declined saying he was too tired. I asked him why and he said he wasn't sleeping well and that he had no energy or interest in doing anything. At that, alarm bells started ringing in my head because it's a sign of depression. 
Now he's never been a good sleeper, he's having trouble with leg pains and he has to be up very early for work, so his body clock is accustomed to waking early.. but he says he wakes several times during the night and I worry that he is awake because he is overthinking things . 

How can I help him? I have depression myself but I am on medication and most of my days are good now. I feel guilty for him being by himself, but I have my own job and child to look after too..

499," 25M.  For most of my life I've wanted an easy, stress-free life but right now  it feels like I'm in no mans land. I don't know if this is just a  common feeling for my generation but I've been feeling stuck for ages  and not sure where I want to go or who I want to become. Bit of  background first.

I haven't felt  great recently after - and I'll admit this may not have a bright idea -  looking to my past and feeling sad because nothing happened. I only went  out 5 times through high school, didn't really socialise at uni because  it was so far away, a lot of time spent gaming &amp; at home because I  was fine there. I was an alright student, my grades were above average,  but it got to the point where I didn't really feel like learning,  especially after I graduated. Didn't go out travelling a lot.

Work  wise I've been mostly a restaurant delivery driver since I left high  school &amp; had to fight for every dollar. Upside is I've been somewhat  frugal and never used loans or credit cards for reckless purchases. Had  a couple of other jobs in a warehouse, a digital marketing firm run out  of a house which I hated (and was eventually let go) &amp; at a liquor  store for not a long time. Not exactly high paying jobs &amp; haven't  earned more than A$40k a year. And people still ask me what my degree's  for. I'll admit it's just to get a degree since I wanted to [drop out of my first course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/382ycx/think_ive_wasted_2_years_at_uni_not_really_going/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

I  still don't know what to do. I'm in the application process of an entry  level marketing role and the interview made me feel so out of my depth.  Makes me wonder how the hell am I going to get out of warehousing &amp;  hospitality when those are easier to get into. Don't have an interest  to learn stuff after a day or so &amp; I'm just relying on my work  experience &amp; I can work most of Adobe Creative Suite, but I don't  know how it'll benefit me.

I don't  know what to do or who I want to be at times, I wouldn't say I've felt  this way just in the pandemic period I just have been looking for  comfort really. It's just any hint of discomfort I get anxious and never  really wanted to do something unless I had to. Just chill on my own,  and I don't really talk to my family even though I live with them. Also  sometimes I lack patience in some areas, whether it's money or what my  future self can look like or relationships.

Socially  I'm a little better but don't really have a huge interest in people or a  need to express myself, 'cause most of the time I'm not sure what I'm  feeling. I just ""tick the boxes"" of a daily routine, and all I can say  is thank god gyms have reopened recently. The challenge of weight loss  begins again.

I don't have  anything immediate to push me out of this. Someone asked me ""If you were  on my death bed at 90, do you wish you spent more or less time in  comfort?"" which gave me anxiety wondering why. And I read somewhere  along the lines of ""Never get comfortable in life"" but that memory's a  bit fuzzy. But why? Why would people think this way?

How would I see the benefits of this way of thinking when there's stuff I don't feel like doing?

The only thing I could think of that qualified with the above was physical therapy. But the more I experience of it, the less I feel like it is what I thought it was. I feel like 90% of it is customer service, and only 10% or less of it is actually helping people. But nursing or becoming a doctor or surgeon is out because I don't want to deal with bodily fluids. Are there other options I'm not thinking of? I've already completed my 1st year as a doctorate student and I feel like it would be a waste to not complete the next 2 years. 


There are also new things I've learned about myself recently that I feel like I need to take into account as well:

* I enjoy that exhausted feeling after a hard day of physical labor (not painful, but just that feeling like you worked hard and you just flop in bed and fall right asleep)
* I like to help others be healthy


I should probably also list my end goals in life:
* Travel the world as often as possible
* Own a yacht and use it to travel across the ocean
* Have enough money to be able to give plenty away without worrying about how much I have


I feel like all of the above involves significant amounts of money, which is another thing that makes me feel I am going in the wrong direction. While physical therapists make a decent amount of money, the amount of debt that gets taken on in college is very high and the salary is not high enough to make up for that. 


I currently spend my extra time doing the following:
* Gaming 
* Selling old things to make a little bit of extra money
* Worrying about life (and feeling depressed)


I think I could be doing more to figure my life out and was considering hiring a life coach, but that costs money. And as you might guess from above, my wife and I are in debt and doing our best to keep up with the bills. How do I make changes in this situation? Should I be making changes? I'm a fairly book smart (As and Bs throughout college without studying) person but I feel like I lack in the wisdom, organization, and planning department.


I'm sorry for the rambling and poorly organized post, I guess it reflects the state of my brain. There's more I could write, but I feel like this is long enough. If you have any questions or any sort of advice please feel free to comment and I will try to reply.

501,"Idk, is it wrong for someone to break up with you, tell you that you're too difficult to date and then keep messaging you as if nothing ever happened? Honestly I'm not good at this stuff, I'm very black and white when it comes to relationships (as in we're either together or we're not) and need someone to explain this social situation to me. I'm seriously in pain because of my ex dumping me and I'm recovering sure but shes still texting me at least once every few days and its beyond painful? I feel bad for ignoring her  90% of the time but I really dont feel like texting the one person who I wanted to have a future with and who I still have feelings for but can't date because she told me she couldn't handle it. I'm so confused, like is she texting me to just rub it in my face or is she texting me because shes hinting that she wants to get back together or what's going on? Like I really dont know how to feel or how to act. I'm fine with keeping in touch with her and maintaining a friendly bond but I'm not in the mental state to do that right now and I don't really want to have anything to do with her until the romantic feelings I have for her have died out and I dont know how long that's gonna take.

I know it sounds pathetic but I really struggle with reading certain social situations and especially when I get emotional my judgement gets clouded. Thanks for any tips in advance~ :)",25Jun2020,1

504,"About a year ago I had a traumatic experience on discord, where I was almost doxxed. I'm very confident that the people on the server don't actually know who I am, however they told me enough info to scare me (which they did). Although nothing happened of it, and there's really nothing they can do about it, it still extremely bothers me and was the worst moment of my life. As a result left the server and ive been way happier ever since. However, the doxing experience is still very traumatic for me and does consume a lot of my time with constant worry and irrational fears that probably dont exist.

One thing they constantly mocked me about in the server was my comic book collection. It became a server""meme"" you could say, and it really bothered me. It was about 10 people who mocked me about it.  I'm currently considering selling my collection (which goes for a lot of Money). By selling my collection, Im removing all the negative associations of the server from my life. I really like my comics, and I dont need to money, but im trying to remove everything related to the server out of my life. When I see my comics, a part of me seems to always think about the discord server and it sucks...

Am I overthinking this/making too big a deal out of it? should I just try to move on? I've thought about trying to create new positive associations with my comics to replace the bad associations with good ones, should I try this?

I'm apprehensive to selling my collection because then I feel like im letting this one little thing take over my life. Please help me out, thank you.",25Jun2020,1
505,"I have gone outside 4 times in the last 5 months. Each of the 4 times were around half an hour. I can't stay in this room anymore I can't. I can't stay in this bed anymore. I have stayed in the same 4 walls for the last 5 months. I'm not even asking to go out in public I just want to sit on my porch, or stand in our backyard. But I can't. I'm not allowed to. Before you ask the reason I'm not allowed to is because my mom has ocd and she thinks that if I go outside.. even in our fenced in back yard, that I will get corona.

It hurts much when I see all of my friends going and hanging out with each other and going to the beach and bonfires and birthday partys. It's just not fair. My 16th birthday was spent alone in my room. I couldn't even get a birthday cake. I had to put a candle in a cinnamon roll instead.

I'm not allowed to sit on our porch but they can go and be a teen and do whatever they want. It's not fair. What did I do that I have to be stuck in the sane room everyday for months with parents who scream at each other almost everyday and consider divorce constantly. My dad has very bad anger issues and has been violent. My mom has ocd and will scret at me if I even try to go outside or if I do anything that she seems 'wrong'. She literally screamed at me for setting down a gallon of milk on the table, then proceeded to throw a temper tantrum and make fun of me for needing to take medication. They are not well and they are dragging me down with them. What did I do to deserve this. There is no way out.

My mental health has been falling apart. My depression had come back and is really bad rn. My intrusive thoughts have come back. I have started cutting again. I have been dissociating like crazy lately. I need help. I really need help. When someone is depressed you would usually tell them to take walks and get fresh air right. Well I can't. I have not been on a single walk in 5 months. I can't leave.. ever. I really need help. I am hurting so much and i so so isolated. It doesn't help that they take away my internet when they see me acting depressed.. like yup taking away my only access to talk to anyone outside this house is going to fix my depression.. thanks parents. I haven't been able to see my boyfriend in person for 5 months and it will be at least another month before I can see him.

I am just so unhappy. I cry almost everyday. I am literally crying as I type this. I need to leave these 4 walls. This is enough to break anyone. I am so miserable. I stay in my bed depressed all day everyday. I can't sleep. I can't leave. What did I do to deserve this.",25Jun2020,1

507,"Hey everyone
Has anyone else had the feeling before, that they'd always forgive and rationalize other people's behaviors whilst feeling hurt or other negative emotions?
To me, I feel like it has come to a point where I don't trust my own thoughts anymore. I question my sanity like if I am just overreacting. For example my father smacked me as a kid until I was 14 because I indeed was a difficult child and he himself has been abused by his father, but on the other hand I know there is no excuse to smacking your daughter for a door that fell shut because of a wind draft while being around 7 years old. Maybe that's a bit of a drastic exampel.
Another maybe more 'greyish' exampel for me is a 'friend' of mine, which I somehow always feel kind of uncomfortable around and like I'd be walking on eggshells, but can't really name why, just said to me and my new haircut that I'd look like I cut it myself. I know some are now thinking 'well that's no big deal is it', and you are right, it isn't. But it just states the exampel of which confusion and disorientation I'm experiencing. Because on the one hand because I actually don't feel like she is a supportive friend and generally tends to be mean, It didn't come across as maybe roasting a good friend and just joking with each other, which I actually really enjoy, but you know, with friends I actually trust about just making jokes.
But on the other hand in the group of friends we are in we do joke about each other some times, so I don't really can't tell myself where to draw a line, and where I rightfully feel disrespected or hurt from her words and actions. Usually if we joke around in the group, we joke about stuff that is so obviously exaggerated, that it is clear to anyone that we are joking. But when she jokes about me, I feel like she genuinely tries to implant things she really thinks about me or dislikes.
I'm really confused about how to make clear boundaries myself, what to think about how I myself feel about situations like this and how to be vocal about my insecurities.
Maybe someone else has felt similar? Maybe even overcome it and could share some advice?",25Jun2020,1

511,"Maybe the title sounds stupid or mundane but bear with me. Tl;dr at the end but you'll need details.

My best friend and I have have been friends since middle school. At that time she used to be a bit chubby and I was skinny, due to some health issues. I was also a late bloomer so puberty hit me hard and I started getting curves at the end of high school. I am not overweight now, but not skinny anymore, I don't wear extra small or small sizes. My bff on the other hand started going in for sports and healthy lifestyle and lost a lot of weight. She's very slim and ""sporty"" looking now, goes running every morning, knows her calories, carbs etc.

But every time we go shopping together or just start  talking about clothes, body weight, she says she wishes to be as skinny as I am. It's as if she's fixated on the past image of me. I told her million times she's slimmer than me now and she even wears smaller sizes than I do so it can be objectively proven but she just won't quit telling me I am very skinny and she wants to be like that. And it's not that she's fishing for compliments, she is necer satisfied with what she hears from me about her body.
It got to the point where I wanted to give her a shirt that I bought online because it didn't fit me but she refused to even try it on claiming she's bigger and it won't fit. 

I know there might be some trauma she's dealing with and she can't get over it without professional help but I don't know how I should react when she says sometime like this. It really annoys me because she sometimes forms statements that I am skinny in a negative way but still complains she can't be as skinny as I am. I can't even stand being called skinny, especially when I no longer am.

512,"First of all, I am not a native English speaker so please excuse any possible mistakes I've made. I love learning but I'm not posting this with the main focus on improving my English. Also, spoiler, there are a few controversial things mentioned in my post. If you feel uncomfortable about online dating and/or age differences you might want to consider to stop reading. 

Now my actual post. 

My mother recently got divorced from my dad and has since been trying to find a guy to possibly spend the rest of her life with. She has been going on numerous dates and that has made her and sister think it might be a good idea for me to do the same. They want me to have a boyfriend and are planning on making me a dating profile in the summer. For all they know, I've never been in love or had a boyfriend. This, however, is not true but I have no idea how to tell them. 

This is probably going to be very controversial but I met a guy online who I fell in love with. I understand there are a lot of people who believe this is impossible but there is an entire subreddit     
( r/wemetonline and r/LDR ) proving it is possible for others. I met him when I was 16 and he was 21. Yes, I am aware of the big age difference and it definitely creeped me out at first but I want to adress a couple things that made me believe it's not as bad as it seems. The only reason the age difference seems big is because we're both young and still developing. If we were 33 and 38 it wouldn't seem as inapropriate. There are 3 more big reasons why I'm convinced it is not inapropriate. 

1. I am quite mature for my age. Due to a shitty childhood I was forced to grow up quicker than other kids my age. Both my sister and I had to learn to take care of ourselves, and our little sister, from a young age. I had always been 'ahead of the curve' in maturity. My sister has always told me she thinks I'm very mature and often has to remind herself of my age because she says she doesn't notice it at all when we discuss/debate (e.g.) controversial topics. 
2. I look quite mature for my age. A big part of looking mature is probably because of the way I present myself. I'm also tall (6'ft) which automatically makes you look older. Aditionally, my clothing style has also proven to make me look older than I am. I often surprise people when I tell them my age. Quick explanation of another reason why I believe the first 2 reasons matter so much. If he was genuinely a creep and attracted to teenagers for simply acting and looking young he probably wouldn't have been attracted to me since I'm neither of those things.
3. I am asexual. I believe the main reason age differences seem inapropriate is because it is usually old men that are in relationships with very young girls for sexual reasons. The same could happen for a guy in his 20's and a teenage girl. The guy might think she's 'easy' and won't have to put in much effort to get her to sleep with him or to receive nudes. Since I'm asexual that is simply impossible. He is not asexual but he has told me he has a very low libido. In the years that we've been together he never asked me for nudes. We also live very far apart so if he just wanted sex he wouldn't have been around for so long. So, if he has bad intentions they're at least not sexual.

When we met online, we initially just talked about our interests. We had a lot in common and could talk for hours without it getting boring. We quickly became good friends. Before we knew each other's age (never came up in a conversation) we had seen pictures of each other. When we eventually shared our age, we were both quite surpised. I looked older than I am and he looked younger than he is. We felt uncomfortable at first but both realised there was not really a reason to feel that way. We had fun talking to each other and the rest just didn't really matter. I also turned 17 around that time and it felt less weird knowing it was only a year untill I would be considered an adult. We got very close very quickly and realized it was getting to a point where we were definitely getting closer than just being good friends. We, at the time, also regularly video chat(ted?) and/or had phone calls. 

The way he makes me feel is something I have never experiences before. He makes me laugh like a donkey, makes me smile when I'm sad and makes me relaxed when I'm stressed out. Since I met him I've been much happier and much more productive. He has genuinely made me a better person. He is incredibly sweet, caring, understanding, intelligent, respectful, loyal, funny, ambitious and hard working. 

He's honestly a great guy and I wish I could tell everyone about him but I'm very scared of their reaction simply because of his age and the way we met. My mom comes from a very traditional family and only recently personally discovered the online dating world. My big sister is younger than my boyfriend and that just sounds so wrong, yet I still believe it is not. They want to make a dating profile for me to find guys online (Tinder). Even if I was single I wouldn't feel comfortable with this. Due to my sexuality it would most definitely not be a good experience. I have no idea how to tell them I have a boyfriend. I think they would be very grossed out by knowing we met when I was underage and he was still 'interested'. I feel like the best option would be to lie and act like I recently met him or to act like I met him in person when I was 16 so it may not seem as creepy. However, I also really dislike having to lie to them. I would love to tell them the truth but I'm terrified of what they might think. They might try to make me break up with him but just I really want them to like him and see him the way I do.",25Jun2020,1

On top of that, the first semester will be conducted partially/wholly online and a  decision will be taken at a later time about the next semesters.
I am also reluctant to take a loan because the amount is just too high. The nature of art school is such that immediate income after completion is not guaranteed and I am apprehensive of the risk.

517,"Is this baby fever or something more than that?

I’ve always known that I wanted to go to school, get some degrees and build my career, before starting a family. Didn’t matter to me if I was or not married, I’ve always wanted to have kids, after I finished school, had a good job, and stability both financially and emotionally. Well, anytime I feel insignificant, I get this sudden baby fever. I can be self destructive and at times I wonder what would happen if I were to bring a baby into this world? Not sure if I want validation or what. Lately I’ve been jealous of pregnant women and the attention and care they receive from the public. I’ve also noticed how some women who’ve had children have a superior complex where they think they’re better than those who’ve not has kids. I don’t even know why any of this is bothering me. I’m only 21 and I am not in a position to have a baby, heck I don’t even have a partner to have one with. All I know is, I want a baby for all the wrong reasons.

520,"Was told to post here about this. 

I’ll try keep this short. I’d just like to know how to approach this. I’m F25 my boyfriend is 27. 

Last night I couldn’t sleep because it was too hot and the neighbours were super loud. 

My boyfriend had just fallen asleep so I text his sister. His sister and I have a really good relationship and she said it was cool for me to come over. She welcomed me with a blanket and it was lovely. I stayed on the sofa cause I knew my boyfriend had work early and didn’t want to wake him. 

When he walked in this morning his reaction was completely unexpected. He saw me, said “Oh” then went straight out the door to work. I text him asking what’s up and he has completely snapped on me. He’s saying I’ve broken his trust completely. He’s saying I knew he wouldn’t like it but I still did it and I’m selfish. The thing is, he told me earlier that day if I wanted to come over I could cause I got some pretty shit news about a poorly family member. Plus I thought he’d be excited to see me in the morning as we had plans today anyway, and when he came in at 9am he’s technically only seeing me 2 hours earlier than we planned. I profusely apologised saying I’d never do it again, but he’s still so angry I doubt he’s going to speak to me again today. I asked him to calm down and talk to me later as I felt he was overreacting, I said I’m not invalidating his feelings but I’m surprised by how hostile and nasty he has been. I’ve admitted my mistake and he has been quite nasty and it’s become a bigger problem. 

I’m speechless and now it looks like our plans for the day have been cancelled and he doesn’t want to see me, I understand I’m in the wrong for not asking his permission first, I shouldn’t have assumed, but his reaction has worried me, he hasn’t asked why I’m here either and I understand I’ve upset him but I could be here for an emergency. 

My boyfriend had said earlier that day I could come over since I’d had a bad day anyway, but it seems because I didn’t ask him first he’s severely pissed off. I’m confused as fuck right now. How can I fix this?",25Jun2020,1
521,"hi all! hope everyone reading this is well and just to let you know that if you get to the end of this god damn you are amazing and I appreciate it a lot. So, just as a heads up before you start reading just know that this is going to be long! 

Background info you need: me and this guy dated in school, when I was 15 and so was he. He suffered with a range of mental health issues: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and would have fits of anger. the mental health issues run in his family with his brothers all having ADHD, Aspergers and autism. the reason why I broke up with him when I was 15: he was relentless, made me miserable over the tiniest things, was very toxic and put me through hell. 

inevitably, he still isn't over it. 

for the first few months after our breakup we were both on very bad terms and my whole school knew about it. he would say horrible things about me behind my back, shame me, make me feel awful just for breaking up with him. I ended up having to block him on all forms of social media. the last straw there was when he admitted that he would be physically violent towards me. my parents knew his parents at the time as we would visit each others houses and so told them about his behaviours. for over a year while I was at school he was there, but it didn't do anything to me, I had gotten over what had happened and from what I knew at this point he was in therapy and I didn't want anything to do with him anymore. we didn't talk for two years.

I left sixth form and started university. At this point I had other things on my mind and wasn't in school anymore, so the past was in the past. He had created a new account and had requested to follow me. I accepted it since I was at uni and an instagram follow was just a follow and he was a someone in the past. my problem? I am too forgiving. He messaged and we started talking as friends again, what had happened was a good three years ago and he seemed to have got a lot better since he had been in therapy etc. we didn't speak much, rarely if that. I was comfortable having him as a follower that could see my feed etc. ultimately, I had moved on and gave him a chance bearing in mind my sensitivity towards mental health issues and believing people can improve. 

Skip forward 4 months into uni, I bumped into him in Westfield. Bare in mind I am a completely different person now. I am at uni, so my social life is buzzing and I will talk to just about anybody because I am like that. He asked me if I wanted to sit down and have a coffee. I said yes sure no worries and we caught up about uni. he was away and I was staying in London. admittedly the catch up was nice and it was just like two acquaintances catching up.

fast forward again to my birthday which is 2 months later, we were still in contact as friends and still spoke occasionally. He was on a low and me being a good friend wanted to cheer him up. he asked me that night whether he was attractive or not. me being me, the friendly person that I am told him that he was attractive and even said some things about his physical appearance that I found attractive about him. it didn't mean that I liked him, I was giving him answers to his questions and yes I did find these things attractive about him. and then shit, he asks me out, tells me he wants a relationship with me, another go if you will. tells me I can trust him now and that he has changed. I tell him straight that its a no and that I didn't want a relationship with anyone at that point. 

for a few months later he was really cold and spiteful towards me, he felt rejected and hurt I get it. he would throw a lot of shade, tell me that I had no heart, that I lead him on in saying what I did. in having coffee with him that I had apparently also lead him on and that he has classed it as a date, when the whole time I was only aware that he was a friend/ aquaintance to me and that on that day we were merely catching up as mates. he even told his family that we were on good terms again. it was satisfying for a while to know that I had accepted and made up with my past that I was so afraid of. but this is the latter. 

after he got over me rejecting him he became more normal again, he would sometimes drop subtle hints at the fact that I was 'too good for him' or that he would 'never be good enough' for anyone' he would talk about his depression getting in the way of him being happy. often saying that the only time he was happy was when he was in his last year of school. while this was all pretty saddening to hear, I couldn't help but feel like he just needed to get out of my life. it was becoming too tiring, almost draining listening to this all the time, nearly every day at this point. he would make fun of some of the personal things that I had told him, even years ago when we were in this silly school relationship to get back at me and make me feel rubbish. its all quite spiteful really. none of his intentions seems clear or pure. 

So, here we are, for those still reading, we have reached the end! He is still being an ass even now. Something is definitely wrong with this guy. Last night, again he asked me what is 'wrong with him' and why he isn't good enough for me. so now im just at my whits end with it all. I want him gone and out of my life for good. how do I go about doing this? He is constantly direct messaging me, I have been ignoring him for days. I really just want him gone... just what do I do? The past is the past right? shouldn't it be kept there? I thought things were better now but clearly they aren't and I am just ready to move on from this small aspect of my life that isn't making me live my life to the fullest. 

any advice is appreciated. honestly thank you all for your time x",25Jun2020,1

526,"It's safe to say that I, along with more than a few other people on here, aren't exactly social butterflies.

Don't get me wrong, I have an easy time talking to people, making them laugh and keeping them interested and I'll usually be able to get along with someone so long as they dont have a pre-existing bias against me. I'm generally interested in people and if I'm not, I'm more than capable of feigning interest.

My problem, is that whenever I break down or have a bad moment, I vanish.

That is to say, I don't leave any messages, no notes, nothing, I just vanish. Then, when I settle down again and feel comfortable talking to others again, it's been two weeks and all my messages are ''Where are you, whats going on?'' or ''Wow, I never thought you'd do this, you know what, im happy that youre gone, stay gone!'' which makes me crumble in on myself out of a mixture of guilt and awkwardness.

How am I supposed to approach them again after I just vanish?

By this point, I haven't spoken to anyone outside of doing groceries for months, maybe even longer. No matter who or what, I always end up self-sabotaging and ruining my relationships.

Which wouldn't be so bad if I also didn't care about them, even to this day. I still wanna know how Clad is handling his home situation, how Sam is dealing with the divorce and how this have been going with Sebastians new girlfriend.

Yet I cant fucking bring myself to message them, or to talk to anyone anymore - I'm so god damn tired of it all. Is there any place or any way i can seek help with this, with this self-sabotaging bullshit?",25Jun2020,1

534,"Hey folks!  
I'm a queer individual with a vagina and up until now I've been able to avoid needing birth control, but my current situation requires it and I'm feeling very lost and overwhelmed. 

In the past I've tried the pills but they wreck me emotionally. Uncontrollable crying, unreasonable anger, depression.. nope. Don't want to do that again. I think of taking pills again and I just feel sick.

I'm around 23 and very small (about 75-80lbs) so I'm concerned other forms of hormonal birth control will also be too much, they all seem to be ""one size fits all"" doses. (Why is this a thing we accept, shouldn't something as sensitive as hormones be an individualized dose?) 

TMI: I don't think I can do an IUD, penetration hurts a lot. We're also having trouble with condoms causing pain as well, which is unfortunate. It is surprisingly better without, which is how I've ended up here.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what options may work best? I don't care if it kills my period or if I gain weight. I'd like to keep my sex drive and emotional stability. I still think it's crazy I may have to barter either of those things just to avoid a pregnancy. I was looking into the shot or the ring on The Low Down, but I haven't seen peachy reviews on those.

538,"I usually get flashbacks about this event. It started when I tried to kill myself last year by taking a bunch of pills when I managed to end up in the hospital in a very “high” state. I don’t know what medication I took , but it sure made me feel like I was “drunk”. So when I was in the hospital , I was spouting weird stuff and vomiting yellow substances and etc. Not a good situation to be in. Later that night the Nurses questioned me why I tried to do it , I wasn’t comfortable on telling them the true reason why so I just said the things I’m comfortable with , telling them how my friends dumped me and how I have issues with my mom. That night it seemed like a dream so when I woke up in the morning , i was shocked to know that it wasn’t. I have this thing where I’d stare at the wall and not even realise it. So I was doing that when a group of Nurses started documenting other patients when they arrived at my area and starting making fun about me , their laughing broke my out of body experience type situation and I just decided to close my eyes and fall back asleep. I Guess that after that , I felt like the Nurses would gossip about me as they always look at me in the direction of my hospital bed and how when they talk to me it seemed like a fake smile. Like a fake friend sort of vibe. Idk about it but until now I had flashbacks about it now and then and it would ruin my day, I’ve overcome depression but still unable to overcome flashbacks from the past. But apparently in my theory , they probably thought that I was faking it the whole time as I did not know the amount of medication I took to kill myself, I don’t understand why they asked me that because IM TRYING TO KILL MYSELF , Why would I count the number of pills I’m taking? Or another theory whereby they are unaware that I tried to kill myself and just thought that I felt sick and took medication pills to overcome my sickness. Idk after the suicide attempt it really made me traumatised, not by the pain but by how people reacted to it.",25Jun2020,1

My current boss is fairly poor performing in his duties. I have been fighting with him for over two years about needing more money. Recently I was given a decent raise that put me where I’m at now, the raise system here is garbage. We receive a raise annually, usually around 2.9% and it is by no means guaranteed. Just yesterday I interviewed for a government job and within four hours they notified me they would like to offer me the position. I currently commute for my job 94 miles a day. The new position I would also have to commute for roughly the same distance. The only problem is they offered me $16.38 an hour, when I told them I needed to start around the same pay as what I’m at now they told me there was no way and they were only going to give me the $16.38. The medical benefits are very good and it offers a lot of room for advancement, however I’m not sure I would be able to afford my bills with the new pay as my wife would have to stop working as much because my hours would change and we CANNOT afford daycare for my child.

542,"This is a long one but please bear with me:
early last year I, (21m) had started hanging out with a good friend of mine's younger sister (19f), we met up doing work for one of her family's friends, and things had gone smoothly, we shared the same interests, taste in music, views on romance, the works. We had grown insanely close, going on drives through the back roads and canyons of our town, singing music in the car, travelling together, cuddling, she often modeled for my photo shoots - nothing raunchy- even made out once, and I felt like we had a genuine connection. after a few months of us being together I had decided to move away to South Dakota with a fellow tradesmen, later into that year I had found out my grandfather had fallen ill and passed, so I bought a ticket and flew back out to cali to make preparations for the funeral and pay my respects, while I was there she had stayed by my side the entire time, and I confessed my feelings to her, she promptly rejected me and I went on with the proceedings and flew back home to Sioux Falls. I thought I was happy with how things were but after slaving away doing labor there I decided it was time for me to move back to my hometown and spend what little time I might have with my grandmother. She and I began to hang out more and more again like we used to and I had put things behind us and tried to make the best of our relationship as good friends, but things starting bothering me that I hadn't noticed before, she started acting weird and more depressed than usual, so I would take her out somewhere, we'd go get candy and stuff like that and just hang around and enjoy each other's presence.

A month later that changed, she stopped asking to go places, and I really should have let things die out like that but I was raised to give people effort in good faith, so that's what I did. from then on I started to feel like an accessory, we would go hang out with one of her guy friends and the two of us would always hit it off like crazy, usually nerdy guys like me that were super into PC games and stuff like that, or even jocks that somehow had a penchant for anime, random people like that, but whenever there was somebody else around I always got tossed to the wayside, and fell into a rut. She ended up giving me signed pictures of us for my birthday with lines like ""I love you my firefly"" written on the back, and i thought that maybe, just maybe, we could make things work, so we started hanging out with more people again. I ended up wrangling her and a buddy of mine that I considered to be my younger brother at the time together and we all went for a drive, she ended up sitting in the back with him, so I was kind of stuck up front attempting to vibe to music, when I heard something, so my dumb ass looks in the back and this girl - who I would have gladly taken as the love of my life - was making out with the guy I had trusted with everything.

After that I had stopped talking to both of them, I didn't want to feel that vulnerable. I put a backpack in my passenger seat because seeing the empty seat just put a void in my gut that essentially ruined my day every time i think about it, I had to fold the back bench up and put my tools in the car so i didn't get reminded of the two of them back there, but sometimes when I'm driving for work or just going about my day running errands in my jeep I think I hear that sound and I just go right back to that night and I feel so small and insignificant. Last month she contacted me saying she wanted to make things work because she didn't want to see me like this, and I essentially told her that her texts weren't worth shit to me and that if she really wanted to apologize she'd bring me to the side the next time she was me, look me in the eyes, and apologize. the long and short of it is she never did. My marine buddy who knows the both of us invited me to go get dinner with the both of them and I was fine with it, I really wanted to make sure she was doing alright, and at the end of the night i brought it up and got scolded for it.

So now I'm sitting here with nothing but reminders of this toxic relationship all around me, and I know I can't just forget about it and I really thought I had matured enough mentally to come to terms with it, but I just can't, I wake up in the morning, and the first thing on my mind is her, I go to bed at night, and the last thing I think of is her, she's in my dreams, I even picked up plenty of hobbies to take away from it and make new experiences, I got back into art, went camping, started playing my old n64 stuff and all that but she just haunts my every waking moment and it's such a huge toll on me to be reminded of everything in a huge wave whenever I don't have something to actively do. is there any way I can fix this? or come to terms? I don't think she even wants to talk to me anymore or even acknowledge half of the things that happened, I just want to be able to stop thinking about her so I can find someone new.

555,"Yesterday I went to a dealership with the intent of purchasing a car I had spoken with a car salesman about last week from their website. When I looked at cars there last week my dad had come with me, but this buying process I was determined to do by myself (young adult female) 

Now this is the dealership where I had gotten my precious car but at the time I was in high school and my parents did all the legwork for it. We hadn’t had any problems with them in the past. 

Originally they told me the car wasn’t detailed yet but when I showed up they had it fully cleaned and ready so I was stoked. I had my list of questions answered and felt good about the car so I continued on to the financing portion. Now here’s where it gets iffy.. 

They told me it would be 10 minutes to a half hour wait, but I knew it would be longer because car dealers always take forever with things, so I didn’t question when the one hour mark came up or even the hour and a half. I started getting dismayed when I saw that people who were walk ins came in as I was sitting there and ended up test driving a car and financing it all before I had a turn to go in there. At the 2 hour mark another sales person came out of the financing room and told me it should just be another 10 minutes but they ran my credit and got better rates than they were expecting so my payments would be lower so that gave me some comfort. At 2 and a half hours with only one other group in the store the finance guy came out and took them to his office. At this point I was getting upset I was the only one left at the dealership and supposedly it was supposed to be “my turn” next. 

At the 3 hour mark (again I’m the only person in the dealership now besides the sales man and the finance man) the finance guy comes out pulls up a chair and says “I don’t know how to tell you this.. but we don’t have the title for the car” so they couldn’t sell me it. 

1. I know i shouldn’t have gone alone but I wanted to do something by myself and frankly I know more about cars than any male in my family. 

2. How is it possible they wouldn’t know they didn’t have the title to the car? If you can’t buy a car without the title how did they even acquire it and why was it on the website to even be looked at ? 

3. I told this to my coworker today and he believes they knew they didn’t have the title but wanted to run my credit to make me feel like I needed to buy something from there because of it 

My family thinks I should demand some sort of deal if I go back there because of what they put me through but I’m not even sure what would be appropriate to ask for 

Do you think I got scammed or does it sound like an honest mistake? I want to believe the best in people but after hearing all these opinions from people in my life saying how they must’ve taken advantage of me makes me feel bad. Everyone’s saying I shouldn’t go back to that dealership but at this point I’m too scared to go through a whole process again

556,"(Throwaway account because obvious reasons for having one)

Hi! As the title says, one of my dearest friends is going through transition and we’re all very excited for them and are supporting them in any way we can.
We’re learning about what not to do and say and vica versa, we’re trying to use as many gender neutral pronouns as possible, but here’s the catch:

Our friend hasn’t been in transition for that long, I believe they came out about a month ago so we haven’t been deeply learning about it for that long.

It happens one too many times for our likings that we accidentally say something that isn’t a correct way of saying or asking it and that they instantly feel attacked and feel the need to silence our words. (ie: they aren’t letting us explain how we messed up in saying that. They just scream
over it about how inappropriate it is to say it) 

For us, the friends, that hurts. Because we are doing everything to make their transition as comfortable as possible within our friend group but if a tiny little misspeak can cause such a explosion of words and screaming, then I don’t see the point in it.

What I mean with that I dont see the point for it: 
If my friend continues to behave like this, while we are trying to help in any way possible, I dont know if I want to stay friends anymore.

557," I've been struggling with writing a proper one for days, even weeks if we include my initial drafts.

I'm doing a research proposal on Media and Society (topic).


My current hypothesis is something along the lines of:

""YouTube plays a strong role in influencing teenagers to pick up vices"".

I don't have to prove or disprove my hypothesis so that's a relief, but I'm worried about whether ""vices"" is too vague? The module chair said that I didn't have to elaborate on vices for my hypothesis and leave it for another section, my teacher however tells me to include examples.

I'm so damn confused. My friends also have conflicting opinions. You're free to introduce me a more feasible hypothesis if you're generous enough but please help. :(",25Jun2020,1
558,"I have much smaller than average ears and have never found a pair of ear buds that have stayed in my ears or even fit in general. 

The plastic hard ones don't even fit inside my ear and the ones with silicone inserts will fit, but they always slip out.

559,"I have anxiety, and I went to therapy pre-corona. All day, everyday I'm on edge, and it's gotten so much worse.

I've tried this over the counter thing and I stopped taking it because it just made me warm and uncomfortable. I was on fluoxetine until my parents took it away because they think it might be causing insomnia.

I been have trouble sleeping for 5 days (I think, I don't know at this point), I didn't sleep the first night, and the second night I slept from like 5am to 1pm and every subsequent night I've been sleeping for at least an hour. I used to stay up late on my phone because that was the only time I got to relax. I stopped doing that for obvious reasons but I still can't sleep.

I've been twitching like crazy, I have this stabbing pain in my chest, and I can't stop tapping my fucking leg. I'm scared that this won't go away and, not sleeping causes serious health problems. I've been taking sleeping pills and over the counter medications and nothing's working.

Being around my parents is so, so stressful
I miss going to school. I miss getting out of the house and I hate this quarantine.

My mom's one of those people who believes everything she reads on Facebook, and she thinks she's smarter than any and every doctor imaginable. She read that lemons cure anxiety, and so she put a fucking lemon in my room. 

She comments on anything and everything. My weight (both when I was overweight and when I got skinny).
She laughed at me for cutting myself, she told me that the only reason I shouldn't kill myself is because God will never forgive me. She says that I'll never find a job and I'm a failure.

And she thinks everythings a simple and easy fix. ""Just sleep, just stop being anxious! You have nothing to be anxious about anything. You're too stupid to know anything.""

My dad's another story. Screaming, punching walls, deciding to take away my door, calling me stupid and a waste of money, and general homophobic coments. Just the cherry on top of a shit sundae. I've generally tried to avoid him but it's impossible.

560,"I'm a 26 year-old graduate mechanical engineer. I graduated last year and had been looking for work for couple of months till March. I had an offer from a company as in Graduate Trainee position and I accepted it. They told me that they were going to send me the contract in a week and then this corona virus outbreak started and the company stopped all their recruitment until further notice. Now they are saying that they have even had to let some staff go and their all operations are at a standstill. They are not expecting to get back normal soon.

So I've started looking for other opportunities again but there isn't many, to be honest. Especially if you don't have experience. Of course something will come up eventually but realistically, in this situation, I gotta be really lucky to get something soon. I was doing waitering in a coffee shop before the outbreak as a temporary job to have some form of income till find an engineering work. Now I'm thinking to start doing some temporary jobs again but all industries are literally devastated. There are also still strict regulations in the country where I live in. It's almost impossible to find a job especially in hospitality industry because the borders are still closed and the business is not it used to be.

I was thinking what else I can do as a temporary job and I ended up thinking about my future in general. I don't hate engineering but I also don't have passion for it. The reason I chose to study engineering was because I literally didn't have something in my mind for my future at that point. I did never think about something like ""This is the job I want to do!"" so I just thought rationally and decided to study engineering because I'm good at math, psychic, etc. also I always wanted to emigrate somewhere else and engineering is one of the most universal jobs that you can do almost anywhere in the world. As I said, it's not something I hate but I've never felt like ""I wanna be an engineer!"". Plus I'm thinking about how this virus will change the world. We still haven't seen the real impact of this crisis on the global economy yet. They are expecting that it will be the biggest global crisis of last 100 years. A lot of businesses will die, lots of people will lose their jobs but on the other hand, that means there will be new opportunities. I'm thinking perhaps I might be a part of those opportunities but I don't know which sectors I need to focus on.

I'm also thinking about the things that I'm passionate and have good knowledge about. There are two things in my mind: cinema and tennis. I've been watching movies and TV series since I was about 12-13. I finished all IMDB top 250 movies by the age of 17 and I also watch any kind of movie from any country. I love art movies such as the movies of Tarkovsky, Bergman, Lynch, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Haneke. I watch their backstage videos. I read about their techniques, their ideas. I write short movie reviews and score movies in a website. I have probably watched more than 1000 movies and I see cinema as a piece of art. I analyse every part of it, pay attention to the cinematography, the narrative, etc. So I'm thinking perhaps I should do something about cinema but what can I do without any qualification tho? And I don't know myself, to be honest. Am I more like a critic or a director or an actor? I don't even know which part of cinema I should dig in. The other thing is tennis. I love watching and playing tennis but obviously there is no way to become a professional tennis player after this age. I also write comments about tennis players, techniques, game styles, etc. My tennis level is pretty good. I'm also thinking maybe getting a certificate and becoming a tennis coach in a tennis club but I don't know how easy it is to do that and is that something I want to do for the rest of my life? Not sure.

On the other hand, I'm thinking realistically and there are millions of people who are working in these industries. So what makes me special to get a job in these industries? Most people fail in these sectors, it's very likely that I might become one of those and I might waste my time instead of getting experience in engineering field and if I decide to do engineering again, it might be too late because there would be a huge gap on my CV between my graduation date and the date I decide to do engineering. I'm also thinking what kind of industries I can find a temporary job till find an engineering work during this corona virus crisis and lockdown.

There are so many things in my mind redditors.",25Jun2020,1

569,"So some context, I have always been lightly poly with a main partner and others are around but never my main focus, like I may see someone for a hike for example (poly doesn't always mean sexual, you can have intimacy without being physical) like once or twice a month.  She has had a boyfriend for about 4 or 5 years now, and they aren't as serious as they used to be but are also still in love.  

We have been dating for a few months now, and have recently fallen for eachother, hard.  It is so much better than any relationship I have ever been in for the most part.  She is gorgeous, intelligent, and thoughtful and kind.  Our sex life is off the charts.  Really I could marry this women and I know she feels the same way.  But things initially were winding down with her other boyfriend about a month ago and she asked me if we wanted to make our relationship official, to which I happily agreed.  

Up until about a week ago, it had seemed likes things were simmering down on her other partner, but I think things have totally stabilized there (he and his wife are poly, they all3 lived together for a few years).  She was only seeing him once or so a week, but lately she sees him just about as much as me, he was there two nights ago, I was there last night.  The back and forth pushes me away for some reason.   I think it is the title of boyfriend/girlfriend is messing with me, I guess I just want to be her primary source of intimacy and right now I feel like I am a boyfriend and not the boyfriend, even though I know she feels so in love with me.  

Just kind of struggling, leaving today with a hangover after a fun night and letting the dust settle I just kind of wanted to cry.  It is becoming very hard for me at times while I am over the moon other times, and I am considering asking to remove our title as I don't feel like her boyfriend, but a boyfriend.  

We communicate excellently and I have no doubt we can iron this out, but I do think she will be really sad if I say that.

My roommate made some cookie dough about a week ago and separated it into cookies but didn't bake them at that moment, and she put them back in the fridge. She said I could have two of them because I like cookie dough.

I've been busy the whole week and never got a chance to eat them, so now we're here. Today I got high and as you do I got really hungry and started eating stuff. I knew that the cookie dough was rather old and that I shouldn't eat them, but I gave in and picked one up and took like 3 really small bites out of the cookie. 

I didn't even finish like half of one cookie, but I'm suddenly very paranoid about salmonella or other food poisoning. My biggest fear is literally throwing up, and me being high isn't making me feel any better either, I'm really paranoid.

I just want to know: is it possible to get food poisoning from such a small amount of food? I've also eaten other things today, so it isn't like it's the only thing sitting in my stomach or anything. Not sure if that matters.

Also, I eat regular raw cookie dough all the time and I've never gotten salmonella. Yes, I know I'm an idiot. But I've never gotten it before, so...?

She also refuses to let me visit him (or vice versa) even though we’ve both been self isolating and quarantined for three months because she says she is worried I am asymptomatic and asks him why he wants to kill her just to see me. 

I know he should be independent and able to make his own choices since he’s an adult but he doesn’t have a job or a car so she controls him financially and can be very manipulative. Even if he tries to stand up to her she just calls him unappreciative and spoiled.

I'm 19 years old and living with my parents. I'm also Dutch. 

We've had a dog for about 4 years now. In the past 2 years or so she's been barking a lot at anyone that comes in, even ourselves, and running up to them growling. She's bitten someone before too, the mailman, after he kicked her. I've been insisting my parents had to train her to not do these things, but all they do is shout at her. One time, my mom slapped her with a newspaper in front of me, right on her nose. 

Since she started ""misbehaving"", my parents bought a collar with different settings, sound activated. One setting was a beep when Pip starts barking, the second is a louder, more pitched beep, and the third is a shock. I was horrified and pissed off when they told me they'd shock Pip if she barked at someone, but I couldn't do anything because I'm up against my parents here, and I didn't know what could happen to Pip.

They stopped using the collar for a few months, but just now they put it on her again because she ran up to someone coming to buy something from the dairy shop my mom runs and bit them. I got so mad, told them they should've trained her and could do something else besides shocking her, but they said ""oh she calms down from the collar"" and refused to take it off her. It doesn't ""calm her down"", Pip knows she'll get shocked if she makes a sound, and is scared.

I went upstairs to calm down, and googled if the collar was illegal, or if it counted as animal abuse, or anything. The first page was filled with news articles about the collar being banned in the Netherlands from the 1st of July, 2020. That's next week. It could cost up to a €20.000 fine if you were caught using it on your dog.

I'm so angry at my parents for hurting our dog like this, my 8 year old sister cried when they said they'd shock Pip if she barks. I want to call the police and report them for animal abuse the same damn day the collar becomes illegal if I see it on Pip again. 

Should I report them to the police or would that be wrong towards my parents? I hate how Pip's being treated because she wasn't trained properly and want to do something and have my parents punished for this.",25Jun2020,0

579,"A little back story to this:
I (20F) got my dog around May of 2019 and have given her the best life that I could possibly give (side note, she is registered as my ESA and is very important to keeping me active and busy). Mid-January I had asked my parents to watch her as I was going out of state for a college conference. They agreed to watch her for the week I was gone and I planned on getting her back immediately afterwards. Once the week was over, my dad called me asking if he could keep watching her until midterms were done. I agreed as I struggle with mental disorders and thought it could be good for both of us since it would give her some extra attention as I would be busy with exams. I was then told that my parents registered in classes since she was “behind” on training (which in my eyes was not true because she was very well behaved for a 9 month old puppy) so I accepted their offer to keep her for longer. Within this time, they didn’t ask me for money to help with vet bills, grooming fees, or anything. I even offered a few times and they decided they didn’t need my help.

Recently I moved back in with my parents because of the whole COVID situation and have gotten to spend more time with my pup. This is where things got rough. My stepmom decided she was going on a camping trip and told me she was taking my dog with her, no big deal because my dog and her dog are inseparable so I didn’t mind this. The problem arose when I asked for my phone number to be put on her tag so I could be contacted if she were lost and my stepmother denied this request. I was then dealt the reminder that she was the one who took in my dog and helped her become better and kept her up to date since she was “behind” on her vaccines too, and that I was abusing her. I am completely at a loss of what to do in this situation. She even said that her name is on my dogs medical records, so it sounded as if she was saying she owned her? 

I’ve discussed this situation multiple times with my dad and he tells me that I just need to have better communication, but how am I supposed to communicate when she won’t listen and makes me feel like the villain? I have no idea how or what to say in order to take my dog back. I appreciate their help so much (especially with the vet bills. since I’m paying for online classes now, that money saved has really helped). Is this a lost cause or should I fight back? I really don’t want to lose my dog, but I feel so irresponsible for letting this happen.

586,"Basically I've been seeing a girl for a while. At the start of it all we were supposed to meet up but on more than one occasion, the day would go by and I heard nothing from her - essentially wasting my day waiting. I asked her about it when she eventually got back to me and she put it down to her anxiety and being nervous to meet me.

A couple months went past and we've been seeing each other (socially-distanced of course) and we were supposed to see each other last Saturday. We never did because once again she went quiet and i ended up waiting all day. (Some context about me, if I know I'm going to do something later in the day I don't really start anything else so that I don't miss what's coming up).

I left a message for her on Sunday morning saying I had enough of the stress and was ending the relationship, deleted her number and that was it......until today.

Lying in bed on my break I got a text from an unknown number, which I instantly knew was her, saying she hadn't been messaging because she had to go for scans for something at the hospital and they still don't know what's wrong. My main issue with the whole debacle isn't the fact I wouldn't see her; it was that she never explained to me what was going on and left me in the dark.

I reinstated what I said (on a few previous occasions) in my reply, that the issue was she never told me! If she said she was in pain and couldn't see me that would've been fine. I wished her good luck and said I hope whatever the problem was, she would get better soon.

I find the timing a bit odd and the fact it would've taken less than a minute to say she wasn't feeling good. I'm not so naive to not know that if she wasn't replying she probably didn't even want to see me, but why keep that secret too?

I'm coping with the breakup really well and that text didn't ruin my day as much as I thought it might do.

I'm interested to know whether I did the right thing in just wishing her luck or whether I should've been more sympathetic towards her? Or would anyone have done anything differently?",25Jun2020,2

588,"We suspected that my next door neighbor criminally trespasses into my backyard by jumping my fence. After a few days of suspicion, we installed a camera in our backyard and we have him finally on videotape, but his face is covered by a ski mask in the video. I do not know what he does in our backyard. In the video, he was crouched and walking near our backdoor. He fled when the camera turned on. We know it is him, but we know it cannot be verified due to the ski mask.

Should I report this to the police? I am afraid of retaliation from the neighbor and his brother if the police questions him. He will know it was me. We are two young women living together in a house. We are afraid.

What can I do to protect myself from this neighbor in the future?",25Jun2020,1
589,"Hi all, 

A little background on me and then I will get into the issue at hand. I am a 22 year old male who will be starting grad school this fall. I graduated college this spring and will be going back to my alma mater for my grad school dream program. I mention all this so you have an idea of my age, future plans and current life situation - feel free to ask for more information. 

So as all young people, I am really worried about who I am now, and who I will turn out to be in the future. This is what I mean by this - I feel like when I read posts on reddit I project them onto myself, even if they don't apply to me at all. I take the stories of bad husbands, close-minded people, bad co-workers, bad bosses, poor friends, weak-people, etc, etc. all so...personally? What is do is I think I am like that or I will become like that - and it really does a number on me. 

I feel like a result of this habit has made my insecurities grow, made me hyper-aware of my shortcomings, and made me feel more jaded and sad; overall it really just sucks. Here is some things:

I see posts about coworkers who are bad and share too much and then I think I was like that. The same applies with people who complain about their friends. 

I see posts about bad boyfriends/husbands/partners and think ""what if that is me in the future?? What if I end up like that?""

I read posts about people who don't do enough for causes and I feel like I have to burden all the worlds problems if I don't then I am bad. 

I read posts about people who don't listen enough to people and think ""what if I am close minded?"" even though I consider myself fairly progressive and I really try to consider issues from different dimensions and perspectives. Then I find myself disagreeing with something/someone and wonder if I am ""progressive enough"" - I can be a tad bit conservative but not that much really. I want to be open minded but not to point where I agree with everything; the flip side is people say I am not forward-thinking enough and such. Then I get jaded and think that they are close-minded because they think anything is okay as long as people agree with them. 

It is a long rant - for that I am sorry and I hope you stuck through it. Please help me - this whole thing has done a number on me really. I don't want to grow up unhappy, dejected, jaded, beaten-down or anything. I really want people to look up to me, I want to be a leader, I want to be there for people, I want to have good friends and a loving wife, and I want to be happy and content. 

Additionally, none of this actually transpires in real life - I have always said my piece with respect, dignity, courtesy and in a non-condescending manner. I talk about issues with friends in a moderate manner, and only share what I am comfortable with and what they are comfortable with. But I swear the internet just really fucks me up and I have a hard time accepting myself as in individual in a world where individuality is growing, and people just don't make an effort to acknowledge differences and choose to bond with people despite that.  

**How do you deal with finding your place, knowing that people will look down on your values? How do you practice being open-minded but still following and living your values? How do I not project this stories onto myself EVEN THOUGH SO MANY OF THEM DON'T APPLY TO ME? How do you be your best self?** 

I honestly think reddit has a big role in this...should I reconsider deleting reddit or simply just unsubbing from subs that bring this? To be fair those subs don't usually have such content that I do this with - well at least not all the time.  There is a bit more to this but I think this is enough for now - if you'd like to know more I can tell. Thanks.",25Jun2020,1
590,"going through horrible break up.. my fault. Would like advice

i’m 21m. my girlfriend and i broke up a few days ago and i’ve never felt lower about myself. my ex gf was going through some mental health things and reached out to me for comfort and wrongfully and idiotically i hid it from my current gf at the time and she found it herself while looking at my phone unattended. unfortunately this wasn’t the first time it happened but it was never more then her reaching out while she was feeling low and needed some help. I know it wasn’t my place at all and i really shouldn’t have cared but it’s hard for me to sit back and watch someone battle a fight in their head and not try to help. my gf left me. And from what i’ve seen has already moved on or found someone else is what i have heard from some people close to the both of us. she removed me from some social media but not all.. weird, but i’m assuming so i wouldn’t see any posts on the specific apps at the time. She won’t talk to me but i would literally do anything and everything for this girl because she means the world to me and has truly made me like such a better person in life and as a bf and even in my career. i feel like a failure and like i disappointment right now and i don’t know what to do. I want her back so bad and i don’t know what to do how to do it. i don’t want to seem crazy or anytning but i just don’t want to believe that our story was supposed to end this way. does anyone have any advice on things to do? To try? i guess maybe ways to just help myself.. Please don’t bash me as i already know i’m in the wrong and i’ve beat myself up for it plenty already. sorry if this post isn’t allowed. if anyone wants more info on the situation feel free to ask priv. thank you

It started with me being obsessed with getting breast cancer (I'm 20 and have no signs whatsoever) when I saw a post about it on Twitter. I calmed down and then freaked out I have skin cancer based on a mole I was born with that I got checked and has never changed and doesnt look remotely dangerous. My other moles have always been there and look totally healthy, like exactly the same as the healthy examples I've seen online, but still I freak (bare in mind I live in Ireland where it's rarely more than 60°Fahrenheit and I always wear sun cream if it is). Today I started panicking about when I occasionally get a single heart palpation when I'm extra nervous, so maybe like once every 2 or 3 months and that it means I'm in danger of having a heart attack?

I tried searching around on my corporation's website on their tattoo policy but it seems they don't have one. However, it is kind of a progressive school. I know of at least one other teacher there with a tattoo. It's sort of small and on her wrist. She never keeps it covered and it seems fine. There's also two other teachers there who have pink hair and another who was talking about getting purple stripes in hers! So they seem relaxed on these kinds of things.

595,"I'm in a dilemma which I was hoping you guys could help me solve.

I'll be referring to the two colleges, as 1 and 2 , 1 being the current and 2 being the potential future.

College 1

Pros
1, Im a Day Scholar, enjoy staying with my parents.
2, Course is dull and not challenging.
3, I'm a Cadet (similar to ROTC in the USA) with potential to do well and achieve things.
4, No drugs/partying culture.
5, Reputed

Cons 
1, No exposure. 
2, College doesn't offer placements for my course.
3, No social circle.
4, Monotonous
5, Not enjoying the course.
6, Not many options for extra curricular activities.


College 2

Pros
1, Lots of diversity and exposure.
2, Very good placements.
3, City is vibrant
4, More options for extra curricular.
5, Decent reputation.
6,Good course with specializations (Which I believe I would enjoy) 

Cons
1,Heavy drugs/party culture 
2, No cadet corps (Which is the only thing that's still making me consider staying)
3, Away from home (not really a con but might be)
4, Lose one year as a result of dropping
5, Not as reputed as college 1.
6, More expensive ( But my parents are willing to help)

My seniors in the Cadet Corps feel that I can do really well and that's the only thing that makes me want to stay. But if I stay it would almost certainly not do me any significant favours with regards to my future professional career unless I want to join the Army.

See, from the outside things are great. My dad and stepmom are happy, their kids are happy, everything's great. But I'm not. I'm just sick and tired of these people. I don't know why.

I just can't. I hate my stepmom. I had an abusive mom. Sure, maybe I'm projecting a bit of my anger onto her, but I also despise her. She's not a good parent.

599,"TL;DR Mum thinks taking care of many cats will guarantee a way to heaven but at this point, she's just hoarding and imprisoning them.

This is gonna be a long one but, here's the details:
So my mum had just recently gotten religious because she's getting old (I don't want to judge people who are doing the same thing) but there's one thing she's misunderstanding.
I'm not sure whether this is true or not, but owning cats will guarantee you to go to heaven in Islamic teachings. At first, we didn't have our first cat because of religious reasons, my brothers just wanted cats real bad. About 2 years ago, we finally got a cat and a little ways down the road we got another one and then we had like 11 cats by the end of the year. We used to put them in those plastic cages that you can carry anywhere (I'm not a cat person so I don't know the terms) but we let them run around in the day time.
But then, maybe like half a year ago, we bought these big cages that can have like 3 stories(?) for the cats. By the time we have it, the cats produced more kittens and in total, we had 23 cats - a handful of which were given by her friends. I never took part in taking care of the cats because I didn't agree on getting one in the first place so in my head, I didn't need to contribute. Yeah, shitty attitude, but that's just how I am.
The problem on having this many cats, is that my brothers didn't ask for a second one. They were happy with just one. Unfortunately, my mother who had her eyes on making money off of selling kittens, manipulated them to agree with her. We didn't have much ground to stand on since she's so stubborn that the best thing we can do is agree or else we're gonna get ratted out to her friends and my grandmother - there was even an instance where I argued with my grandmother about the cats and I realized that my mother had manipulated her aswell in some way. Of course me, my father and brothers silently agree behind her back that the 22 other cats were not our cats.
I don't know how it lead to this or when this even started but we started to get blamed on for making her waste her money on cat food and she always makes a big deal about it. She also always made a big deal about this to her other friends whenever she could sneak that in. No, I'm not assuming. Whenever she does this, I can always hear it since the phone is in the same room as all of us.
Okay getting sidetracked, sorry. In present time, we rarely let the cats out since it's just too much of a hassle to get them back into the cages. And not long ago, she started attending prayers and really get obsessed with religion. Now she's justifying imprisoning the cats as ""taking care of them since they can guarantee us to get into heaven."" She told this to my grandmother and of course I heard it since I was sitting right beside her.
Now you may be wondering and getting angry at me for not contacting the animal support or justify my case to my bigger family or her friends. Problem is, I can't. They're all wrapped around her fingers and believe her words more than they believe mine. And I'm just a no-life teenager who can't express himself to others since I was locked inside the house since kindergarten. It doesn't take an idiot to realize that this is animal abuse. My siblings and father all agree that this is animal abuse but you have to understand, she's so stubborn to the point where anything that comes out of our mouths is gibberish to her. 
I don't even know where I should begin with this, so what should I do? Do I just let it be until all the cats die or somehow tell my bigger family about this?",25Jun2020,2
600,"I’m a 26-year-old single man currently living at home outside of New York City, about 50k to his name.

I graduated in 2016 with a major in Psychology and minors in Cinema Studies and Education. I was never a kid that knew what he wanted to be when he grew up, and psychology was the most interesting major to me, so I picked it. I definitely did not want to go to Grad School, because I did not want more debt to pile up, especially with no job guarantee. I also didn’t want to pursue teaching, because I feared being in debt for life due to low teacher pay in NYS (coupled with the need to go to grad school).

Out of school, I got accepted into a certain Japanese clothing retailer’s Manager Candidate Program, a program designed to train individuals onto a retail management track in 1 year. They told me that my background in psychology and education would be a perfect fit; needless to say, it wasn’t. The job was basically just retail, and I was being exploited for labor with the promise of “promotion” that never actually happened for one reason or another. I only got to Assistant Manager Level and stayed at that level for 2 years, while others in my class went on to corporate or manager level. I told myself that by the point I paid off my student loan (~$35k), if I wasn’t a manager, I would quit. I paid off my loan in full, and 3 years later to the day I was out.

Which leads me to my current working situation: after applying to over 100 jobs and seeing no success, I had a family friend who referred me to his place of work, Northwestern Mutual. I passed the “NYS Life, Health and Accident” exam, interviewed, and got in, basically because I blindly needed a job. Little did I realize that this is soul crushing life insurance sales (100% commission) under the guise of “financial planning”. All of their training materials are for people with a large warm market, which I don’t have (all of my friends are 20-somethings with no need for insurance), so I am stuck cold-calling.

It started out okay, but now I’m at my wit’s end. Over the course of this career (about 1 year now), I’ve made ~20k, but my biggest issue is that I have no real horizon for how I’m going to grow. I call 300 people a day to reach like 20-30 and book 2-3 meetings, which has about a 35% chance of actually keeping, and a 10-15% chance of closing (don’t even get me started on how infrequently they’re willing to give referrals). I look at others that are successful in this field and feel like they are sleazy assholes who have no work/life balance, and I don’t want to be like them. I’m not motivated by money, but at the same time I feel like shit when I don’t get a paycheck, because it feels as if my work is all for nothing.

The worst part has to be the fact that I hate what I do, but I can’t tell if it’s because I’m not seeing results, or because this career really isn’t for me. I was told from the beginning that I wouldn’t make much in my first year, but I have no idea if I will actually see success and end up enjoying it if I stick with it, or if I’m just wasting my time.

Is it so hard to just find a job where I go in, do what I have to do, go home, and get a paycheck every two weeks? Why is it that I can’t find any job that seems interesting? It seems like the only jobs I qualify for are food service, retail, or pyramid schemes. I feel like I have no transferrable skills, and time is running out. Part of me still wants to be a teacher, because I love public speaking/performance and educating others, but I don’t want to go back to school. The only job I’ve ever enjoyed was being a camp counselor as a teenager.

I do still have fun and experience joy, but I’ve grown incredibly distant from all things that used to provide emotional stimulus. I try to act normal, so I don’t concern my friends, but the constant effort required to be empathetic, or emotionally available is leaving me more and more exhausted each day. 

Ever since I went through a tough breakup and lost a lot of friends through the process, I’ve felt myself become more and more cold. At first I thought I was getting better because the sadness and hurt was fading. My invulnerability gave me confidence and had totally transformed my life in seemingly positive ways. But now, I’m starting to feel that this is all a reaction to being hurt and that I might need to go back to therapy. Is my emotional armor putting too much distance between me and the people I love and have loved. Does anyone have any experience with this? If so, is it something that’ll go away on its own? Is this lack of vulnerability a bad thing? I can’t feel pain these days, but my joy and ability to relate to others limited (maybe).",25Jun2020,1

In the last 20 years, I have caught my wife having an affair. However, she claimed that she didn't sleep with either of them.

However, about a year ago my wife got mad at me and left the house and stayed in a hotel until the next morning. I had no clue where she was at.

I didn't believe it at all, but I let it pass because I have 3 kids and I really love this lady and couldn't imagine my life without her.  A few weeks ago we get into this big argument and she was packing her belongings up to get her an apartment.  While I was telling my 18-year-old son about her leaving me for no reason at all. I told him about the things she had done. I told him in front of her about her having multiple affairs and I emphasize the reason event where  I’d believed she was in a hotel having sex with a man all night. Then, her response was, ”Yes! I sure did and the sex was good too”.  Now that we have worked out the issues and she no longer desired to move out. She now is saying everything she said was just to make me mad. I don't believe her. It made me really go back and evaluate her actions with me in the bedroom and how she so easily want to give up on the marriage now over any little thing. In fact, even when we have sex now as she is giving me foreplay she never really looks at me. And while I am doing her she keeps her eyes close. And for the first time in about 15 years she pulled up porn on her phone while we were ready to have sex, My wife hasn't watched porn since we were much younger. Moreover, I have asked in the past for us to turn on some porn. Nevertheless, she would forcefully reject the idea. What is going on? Please ladies help me get a better picture.",25Jun2020,1

I’m torn between three things; 
1. A nice camera and lens, I don’t do much photography but I’ve dabbled in film making and I’d like to continue to pursue it. 

2. Upgrading my PC, I have a good computer but I could use a new cpu (GTX 1060 is what I have atm) and 8 more gbs of ram. I spend a good bit of my free time gaming or using photoshop so it makes sense to upgrade what I have. 

3. A good pair of headphones+ a mod mic or yeti mic. I already have ok headphones, SMS Audio Sync’s, but they’re kinda old and the microphone on them blows. 

I’m terrible at making decisions (I spend like 20 minutes at the grocery store debating between different types of chocolate ice cream), so I figured I’d see what the internet has to say about all this.

We took the conversation to snapchat and continued to talk there for three months with some flirting but nothing more.He’s really really attractive,social,and confident. He’s really that guy that all the girls want. We met up once a few weeks ago after he’d requested to see me many times before and we just talked (I made it clear that we would just talk and I wasn’t okay with things getting physical for personal reasons plus Coronavirus). Generally our text conversation is a bit boring and dry to be honest but I enjoyed meeting him in real life. I thought it went well, but since we met things felt a bit too real and the conversation was really dry from both sides and eventually we stopped talking completely except the occasional conversation here and there whenever I post a cute picture of myself. To be completely honest, he’s a bit shallow and he thinks of himself too highly; he gets all the girls he wants. We also don’t have that much in common.I know that he’s not the right man for a relationship(and I don’t think he wants one), but I’ve gotten really attached as we’ve been speaking everyday for three months straight.

622,"I am hoping for some advice on what to say to our neighbors about their children I will preface this by saying we have had issues with all the neighbors around us since moving in 2 years ago. They were all disappointed we didn't have kids and have been rude/standoffish to us since. Despite my husband trying to befriend them. They all stand in the road near our front door and anytime we go out there they stop talking and stare. So we try to not hang out in our own front yard. 

Our backyard was our little sanctuary, playing with the dogs, and using our hot tub. Our backyard is enclosed with a 7-8ft privacy fence. Our neighbor has recently put in an above-ground pool near our fence and built a ""deck"" on the side touching the fence. So now the children climb up and turn and are able to peer over into our yard and watch us while we are outside. They are out there nearly every day for hours and as soon as we go out there they start peering over. My husband used to sit outside and talk on the phone, sometimes using curse words, but feels awkward doing so with the kids peering over. 

Should we say something to the neighbors about their kids or just ignore it? I know this might sound stupid to complain about but we have had issues with all the kids around us. Playing in our driveway, doorbell ditching us, riding bikes through our side yard, and throwing trash into our yard. We just feel trapped in our home.

639,"Im not sure if I'm depressed or anxious or scared. But here are some of the things that have happened throughout my 3 month quarantine that have ripped me.

1. I started feeling lonely.
2. I hate my body and I feel like I'm so fat. 
(I was bullied as a child and young teen about my weight it took me to depression and I somehow managed to lose 10kg. Now I feel fat again and I legit hate myself so much. Ive hated myself since I was 13 and somehow now its worst than before.

3. Im admitting this, I puke out stuff I eat. I know some of you might think im disgusting but Ive tried dieting and exercising and I can still feel the fat in my face and ppl still comment. Ive tried to stop and i am purge free for 5 days but my mind is trying to tell me that i should do it again. I know its bad but a voice is telling me to do it.

4. I found out my dad is still cheating on my mum.
I found out my dad was cheating when I was 14 it hurt a lot then and it made me more depressed somehow i slowly ignore it. At the bank the day before yesterday I saw a call from someone very familiar on my dad's phone and I remembered it was the woman who sexted my dad when I was 14.
That night I snopped my dad's phone and found it the cheating was still going on and found other disturbing stuff too.

5.I love my mum and Im not sure if I should do something or love her. My mum who is mean to me a lot got diagnosed with heart problems and undergone stents last year. Although she's mean I still love her and I dont want to break her heart. She's already weak and I know that telling the stuff i found out to my family is just gonna break us up. My mum mighy die due to stress and depression mainly because she brags that her arrange marriage was a success and learning the truth might kill her. Plus my parents pays for my brothers education and telling this might cause tension and stop my brothers education. There's so much guilt building up in me because of this secret.

6. I'M GOING BACK TO BOARDING SCHOOL IN 2 DAYS AND IM FAILING. I wasted 3 months of quarantine watching TV, feeling bad, purging and thinking about uneccessary problems. I used to be an A student in boarding school (i went there last year when I was 16) but now quarantine has made me stupid. My teachers finished the syllabus and I'm clueless. Im in the first class due to my previous rankings with 15 students so u can estimate the amount of competition. Im scared im not gonna cope and I literally feel like screaming and crying about going back. I used to want to go back to school just to run away from my family problems but now Im having doubts.

642,"TL;DR: I’m 18. My parents don’t want me to take on campus classes this coming semester. I want to because I need to get out of this house and this toxic environment. They’ve threatened to kick me out if I don’t comply. 

This post, as I’m typing it, may or may not be long and it may seem convoluted but I guarantee that everything connects to one another to contribute to the context of the situation. 

My parents have never been easy to talk to, especially my mom. They’re very stuck in their way of thinking that it’s radical if somebody has a different opinion than theirs. They’re also very antisocial and I’m very people oriented. They don’t find value in friends and to them, family is 100%. To me though, family isn’t family if you don’t feel like you can be emotionally or physically comfortable around them. But to my knowledge, they don’t know to the extent how much disdain I have for them.

I’ve been homeschooled since the 4th grade. Because of the isolation, I grew very lonely. I was home 24/7, surrounded by my family. As the years went by, and puberty kicked in, I started becoming my own person with my own thoughts. To my knowledge now, nobody has really stood up to my mom or dad regarding their feelings, especially if they felt it differed than them. I believe my mom was aware of how lonely it was. My older brother asked my younger brother how his friends were holding up during the quarantine. My younger brother retorted saying he didn’t have any friends. My mom butted in saying, “You used to be homeschooled, you know what it was like.” This is important because it indicated she knows how lonely it can be, but she never has really done anything about it. All I know about how I feel is that I feel like I’ve missed out in life. I know I’ll experience everything in college but nobody seems to understand why or how I feel, especially my parents.

My mom forced me to talk about my faith, even after I started crying, and after she didn’t approve of my opinion because I was “too young to decide” (16), she got me books to sway me. Since then it’s sort of cooled down, but there are slight moments they still make a little jab at me because I don’t share the same faith as them.

I came out to my mom when I was 12/13. When I first came out, she had initially said that I was, again, “too young to decide.” Ever since I came out, it’s never brought up again nor anything LGBTQ+ related whether it’s a movie, real life events, etc are talked about. 

When I got a part time job, I was making quite some money. For some context, I don’t have a car payment because it’s paid off. The only bills I paid was phone and car insurance. Anyways, because of the lack of bills, I did treat myself at times. Note that I’m not a reckless spender and I value money. One day, when I came home, my mom wanted to talk to me. Apparently she looked through my entire transaction history and was very disapproving. She calculated I spent 44% of my total income since I worked. A lot of the “purchases” were me getting cash back at cash registers so I can buy things without getting traced by my parents. It’s not illegal things, they’re just nosy and controlling as fuck. I was hoping the cash back transaction would fly under the radar. She seemingly overlooked that I doubled my checking account since I got the job. The end of that conversation was her saying she’s going to keep a close eye on my transaction or she’ll take my card. (Note this was before I was 18)

We’ve moved a lot in my lifetime. But currently, this is the longest I’ve stayed in one place at nearly 8 years. You can assume I’ve grown up here. With the minimal amount of socializing I’ve done here, I’ve met some people who I consider are good friends. I’ve also made connections here professionally. I have a job here. And I’m going to college here. But all of a sudden, my parents want to move to Memphis because my mom is “sick of *city name* and the neighborhood noises” which she’s referring to yard services and kids. My dad got approved to be able to telecommute in Memphis. My parents biological kids (my sisters) live in Memphis and they also graduated and raised their kids in Memphis. Maybe I’m sounding selfish or whatever, but I’ve made a life here. And they’re going to uproot it, assuming that I’ll drop everything I have to whisk away with them. I don’t know when they were going to tell me because I had to ask them one night. The only reason I knew was because my younger brother told me that our parents told him. I’m arguably one of the ones that’s most affected due to my situation. My parents don’t have friends here. My dad’s telecommuting. My mom is a stay at home mom. My younger brother is homeschooled. And my life was just getting started. 

They’re wanting to move by the end of the year. Recently I’ve been scouring for perhaps a roommate and a new higher paying part time job when school starts. Expenses will pile up, but it won’t be as bad as some kids have it. My first two years of college is free. The only expenses in education would be textbooks but I’’ll probably find some way to reduce the costs of those or just find them for free. My car is also paid off entirely, so I’d just have car insurance. That way I have more financial flexibility for rent and utilities, phone bill, internet bill (if not included in potential apartment), food, and the bare necessities such as toiletries and cleaners. I fully understand that expenses pile up and it’ll probably be more than expected. But at least I have some comprehension on how much things will cost.

Before I returned to work, my mom requested I work 2 days a week rather than the normal 3. Her reasoning is because of the virus and she didn’t want to get sick, which is totally understand. I cooperated but this week, I picked up somebody’s shift which made my work week 3 days. This upset my mom because she felt I disrespected her wishes. 

She also requested I take all online classes this semester but I’m at a crossroad. I was planning on taking partial on campus and partial online. That way I can finally get out and meet people, and taking that opportunity to potentially find viable roommates to get to know. But after they heard out my plan, they were furious. They think I don’t ever go to them because I’m some kind of arrogant person. No, it’s because everything with them is some big ordeal which I don’t find any interest in fueling the flames. That’s why I make decisions and do things on my own. 

People seem to think the virus is a death sentence. Yes, it’s a dangerous virus, but the current deaths aren’t just solely because of your age. There’s many factors into why that patient unfortunately died. According to the CDC, adults 65-84 have a 4-11% death rate and 31-59% hospitalization. COVID-19 has an 89% recovery rate in the US. NOW, I don’t think people should just go do whatever. Precautions are vital, but there are situations where you have to break quarantine. And although taking some on campus classes isn’t vital and is more of an option, it would be beneficial for my mental health because I would get out of the house and get exposure to more of my peers who are in the same stage in life. But all that would be at the low potential risk of exposing the virus to my parents.

After I told them I how I feel they like to assert their control in everything I do, they essentially implied they don’t see me as an adult. They said that if I don’t comply to their wishes, I can just move out. Initially my dad said that they’ll let me have my car but my mom responded to him “oh will we?”. Near the end of the conversation my dad said “it’ll be tough without your car”. The context of the car was my parents bought it for me to accommodate for my minor disability. I don’t have any other family here so I can’t go to them for any help. 

So here I currently am. Not knowing what decision to make. I want to move out, but I need my car. My dad seemed just a tad bit more sympathetic to the whole ordeal but he always sides with my mom in the end. I want to go take some on campus classes so I can finally experience the real world instead of being cooped up in this toxic environment. I want to be able to have control of my OWN life and be able to choose where and how often I work without being questioned and told outright no. I’m 18 and although I am legally able to make my own choices, I want to have the security of a plan. I don’t know how long I can last in this household, without any control in my life, unless I want to deal with my parents if they don’t approve of my decisions. My parents broke me yesterday. I don’t cry often, but I went on a walk after that and just started crying. But I believe that they’ve been chipping away at me ever since I started homeschooling and now I’m just shattered into a million pieces.",25Jun2020,1

644,"So my natural hair color is veeeeery dark brown, almost black. I started trying to dye it in college but I never ever wanted to bleach it. After an extended period of time I was able to get it a nice golden brown color which I still maintain to this day. 

But I’ve always wanted to dye my hair an unnatural color (I would LOVE dusty pink or rose gold but I doubt that’s ever gonna happen) and I figured now being in quarantine and not having a job would be the best time to finally do it since I don’t have to worry about it being against my workplace’s rules. 

I’ve been scouring to find some answers online and the only dyes I’ve found for dark hair seem to be ones that either work like hairspray and get stiff, wash out after like one shower, or just don’t show up at all unless you bleach your hair which I really don’t want to do if I can help it.

All my life I had told my friends at that time the issue I had, but no one ever has been able to help me with anything. Gradually the problems became bigger as my age did, and still no one was able to help. What is the point of asking help if nothing is going to come out of it?  I never ask for help anymore and it's working better, I feel nothing/ like shit but I felt the same when no one could say anything to make me feel better. (Ironically, I am asking for help rn, to strangers, it's probably bc I'm bored and really think that no one will read this or have the ability to help me with this problem, but deep down I have hope that someone will help, I have thought of not posting this so much, but northing will come out of not posting, nor doing it but there is a slim chance that-)  
 But I am the same, I'm not able to help anyone and pretty much useless, but everyone is, I can't feel that some are more important than others, not even personally, why  ?  
All my friends left, and now I am the one that leaves people right when we start caring for each other. It's like I am unable to feel love towards them and act very weird anytime someone does. And right after that I disappear. I want to put enfasis on I can't feel love, I really can't, but I'm not a psycopath, I hate my empathy, I literally felt empathy for Trump once even though he is a scum of the Earth. I feel empathy for my parents even though they are manipulative and literally think all the abusive things they do are normal and when I try talking to them they don't listen b l a b l a. See? That's one of the reasons I can't talk to anyone, I have so much shit that everytime I want to talk about something, I end up telling all my life story without the real reason of my issues. (I live in south america I can't leave when I turn 16 or even work, so 18 will have to do ;0) Not feeling love is the main reason of why I push away, I don't deserve love if I can't return it and it hurts when I stop receiving it, that is why I intentionally stop reciving their love, so that they can't do it. No one should love someone that can't love them back.

  
Not one of my issues have been resolved, the only thing that has kept me here is accepting them and that there is nothing I can do about it. It sucks but it is reality. I hate this mentality but what can I do? Nothing. Is there anything anyone else can do? Until now I have been proved not.   


Anyway circling back to the thing I actually wanted to talk about, why can't I feel love? Or feel that I do? There is not one thing in this world that makes me feel it. But I don't feel as if I didn't feel, for what I know my mental health issues are nothing but minor, however why is it so difficult to do anything else apart from crying, why is it that when I'm with people I seem fine and have to force myself into looking sad or no one will ask how I'm doing,- 

I could keep writing so much more but that's basically about it with this one. In one sentence, 

Why can't I feel love?",25Jun2020,1

648,"So as the title suggests, I am between a rock and a hard place. I won't divulge the specific career that I am entering, but it is quite physically intensive. I devoted the past year of my life applying for this job, and just last week I finally said goodbye to my previous workplace of 3+ years. This job in particular demands full transparency from me, and as such, there's no chance that I would be able to see a doctor or be admitted to hospital without notifying my employer.

Two or so weeks ago I started experiencing mild chest pain. Not a sharp pain, but a dull pressure on my chest. Sometimes on the left side, sometimes on the right. It would get worse at night while lying down, and generally subside while standing, walking around ect. Some days the pain would disappear, and some days the pain would be slightly worse. I have noticed slight dull pain down my left arm. I have also noticed that the pain gets worse whenever I am in a stressful situation.

I am quite young, and very physically healthy. I have run probably 40 kilometres (25 miles) in the last week or so, and could run a half marathon no problem. I was also a laborour in my previous job, and thus I have been extremely physically active over the past several years. The application process for the job I am about to start required several physical tests. All of which I scored the highest out of all 30-40 applicants I tested with. I have consumed I would say standard/average amounts of alcohol for a male my age, and no drugs within the last 12+ months.

So basically I don't know what to do. I left it these last two weeks hoping that it would go away. It hasn't. Has it got better? Some days. Some days it's slightly worse. On average it's probably about the same. As I said before, I am 90% sure that if I am admitted to hospital, I will be deemed not fit for the job, and be kicked out. You can sympathize with the unfortunate timing of all this, considering that I literally left my previous employer a few weeks ago, and will thus be left unemployed.

I recognize that everyone's first instinct will be that obviously you should seek medical advise for a condition that could be life threatening. But put yourself in my shoes and ask yourself how long you would wait before going to the hospital, when it meant the difference between starting your dream career and essentially losing that possibility forever, and becoming jobless.",25Jun2020,1

650,"I've always had extremely low self confidence due to my height-weight ratio (180cm 46kg 15yo). 

Ive always been a quitter, no matter what, I always want to quit.

I feel as if I'm not good enough for anyone.
For example, say I'm playing a videogame with some guys I just met. If I'm not automatically amazing at the game, or carry the whole team, I feel like they'll never want to hangout with me. 

I never go outside in the summer because I don't want anyone to see my disgusting body.

I don't think I'm ever going to have someone outside my family love me.

But it's strange. Sometimes I'll go outside in a t-shirt and shorts, and not even think about the people staring. Other times it brings me on the brink of an anxiety attack to even think about going outside in anything less than long pants and a hoodie.

I think I have BPD, mostly because of previous segment, also because I almost completely lack that of remorse.

I can't talk to my parents about this, they would never take it seriously.

Ive always wanted to be special, no matter what, and I don't know why.

I lie a lot.

I'm scared, I think someday I'm going to do something that will destroy my life. I've never really had anyone to steer me in the right direction. 

Last thing on my list of how stupid I am, it's impossible for me to cry. I feel like maybe sometimes I should, but I just can't. Sometimes fake it but I'm not very good at that.

I don't know if I need help or what kind of help. I know that I'm not going to get a diagnosis from this, but I hope someone might be able to give me some insight into why I am the way I am.

Thx.",25Jun2020,1

He has a tendency to be creepy in other ways like when he told my sister’s fiancé “Well, at least you’re not a pedophile” when the fiancé told him that he’s out of work.

There's also a chance that he may have molested my sister, but I'm not comfortable asking her that flat out yet. She was always lashing out as a teenager and threatening suicide. And once when I was 10 had to go to the hospital for a head injury that my sister caused me, he told me not to disclose to the hospital the truth about how I got the head injury. I think he was afraid that the hospital would contact CPS and he'd be investigated by them. What was he trying to hide? I'll never know. In her adulthood, my sister admitted once that she feels like her childhood was robbed.

I'm moving across country in the upcoming weeks and am attempting to deconstruct all the furniture my partner built. He has already moved and thus cannot help me.

656,"I’m asking for some advice because I’m in a hunch and need to figure something out.


I’ve been without a car for a couple weeks. I work 13 miles away from home, so I’ve been getting rides from my co worker who (thankfully) lives only 5 minutes from myself. 


I’m trying to get my car fixed right now at my dealership - we have the parts, and we had a guy working on it until he tapped out due to the rusted bolts. He said it for what they’re paying him, it’s not worth it to fix.


I offered another one of the mechanics more to do this for me. I really want this car in my life at this point, so I’m doing whatever it takes to get fixed. 


He’ll get around to it maybe tomorrow, but probably next week. Which means more time I am without a vehicle. I’m losing my patience! 


Anyways, I’ve got $1000 to my name right now. $900 will go to rent on the 8th (which is also when I get paid next), and that will probably be my whole check so I’ll have this $1000 to my name for a little while until the car is fixed.


My question is, would it be worth it to start working on my side gig more, and invest more time although the return is unknown at this point, or take up a second, nightly job? 


I need some extra income *right now* to support having this car, and I want another form of transportation too (a motorcycle or truck), and as quickly as possible. 


The dilemma is I’d have to travel to a second job on foot, and I’m not even sure if any places are hiring immediately within my area. I don’t have a bicycle even, so the further the commute the less likely.


My side gig is a marketing agency, which is going to take a lot of personal time to continue developing the website, and then prospect for clients, and continue developing the business aspect. If I treated that like a second job, I might be able to start earning income in as little as a month or less. 


Any suggestions? The car I have that’s being worked on is older, and honestly not truly worth what I’m putting in - HOWEVER - it’s a very reliable vehicle, I’ve already made some major repairs for longevity, and it’s simply fun and I enjoy owning it. I could own it for another 3-5 years probably, after having gotten these hefty repairs done. 

So in my mind, it’s actually cheaper to just stick it through now, and not have to spend as much on repairs in the future. 

I also considered fixing it and selling it, and moving that money for various things, but especially this side hustle.",25Jun2020,1

668,"Ok so this is about my current situation. I feel like it’s time for me to leave my current job.

I’ll give a quick synopsis and I would absolutely love to hear what you have to say, I’ve seen some very brilliant people on here, I need to hear some advice, I’m in need right now I believe in good karma.

So I currently am in undergrad college and just turned 21, and have about 15 classes left until I finish my engineering bachelors degree and get that out of the way.

I am also a part time Licensed realtor for about 7 months, and I am really liking how real estate works. Now, I have another job which is a full time job at a retail store. Not going to say which just to be safe. But it’s a commission based position, that has dental and eye benefits, which I am getting my cavities filled within the next month, which saves me a-lot of money (long story).

I’ve been at the ""retail job"" for about 1 year and a half. And it’s beginning to really annoy me there. The people who are “old heads” or ""seasoned"" seem to continually complain about little things I do or dont do. They are basically micromanagers, and extremely toxic, and always on my shoulder. I began to think it is because I am doing good at my age compared to other people my age. And maybe they may feel envious or jealous, but I do not care about that aspect.

So most importantly, I need sales experience for at least 2 years according to my loan officer to get a mortgage to invest in real estate, so that is why I’m reluctant on leaving this “retail job”, I plan on developing and investing in real estate, in fact I actually am closing on an acre of land I just bought all out in cash the other day, that I want to develop. That is my main goal in life is to be great at real estate and not have to work and obtain financial freedom. I feel if I had left that job, and go full boat real estate and truly believe I may do very well just doing real estate.

But Every day I dread the going to that retail job, and it’s literally the easiest job, it’s just the people there and culture is horrible, very pessimistic and passive aggressive to the point where it makes me loose sleep sometimes, I train my mind to not care about them or what they say, but it gets to the point where it bothers me still. Furthermore, I am trying my hardest in real estate and I managed to sell one house so far, which went very well. It is a very saturated market for real estate where I’m at, so that is my biggest fear in leaving the security of my retail job which is paying the bills. I’d hate to say I’m going to have to take a leap of faith soon, but it is really beginning to seem like I’m going to have to. I feel like the toxicity at the retail job is hindering my capability of unlocking my full potential in real estate as well as finishing school quicker. As well as degrading who I am as a person and my mental state. I am not blowing this out of proportion the whole time I have been there it has been pretty toxic, the money from it has basically helped me get out of student loan debt, boost my credit score, and increase my savings. But I do not want to sacrifice my happiness for something materialistic, I truly want to live happier.

Please after reading my situation, any bit of advice would be great. I am looking to actually be happy in life, what steps would you take in my situation?",25Jun2020,1
669,"Hello Reddit, I (21 f) just moved in with two of my friends (22f). Things are going fine aside from the fact that no one ever cleans. 

I let them know from the jump that I'm a bit of a neat freak and while I don't expect them to be on the same level of cleanliness as me, I still expected them to clean up after themselves.

We've been living together for less than a month and I'm already annoyed and grossed out of my skull. One of my roommates threw a party and it took her a full week to get the house cleaned and that's only because I asked her. My other roommate will constantly leave dishes in the sink for weeks at a time. Someone let the tub clog and left a bunch of their dirty tub water sitting overnight without trying to figure out why the tub was clogged or trying to drain the water. This is just the tip of the iceberg, I could go on. 

I'm seen as ""the mom friend"" but I've made it very clear that I'm not interested in cleaning up after two grown adults.

Though I condemn these comments towards anyone and will never speak to my child (boy or girl) this way we have gone through arguments on how she's condescending ever since I was in HS. 

I digress, last night I came home and I had nachos. Could I have made a better choice? Yes, but I had gone like 9 hours without eating and realized it and went to the Mexican restaurant down the street.  And also I just wanted fucking nachos. Right when I walk in I get a judgement side eye - I'm used to it. I sit down at the table where my Dad is and we start talking about my door dash experiences of the day and compressors (LOL.)

I tell them I picked up cookies again from Crumbl and my mom instantly goes (with a smirk on her face) ""don't tell me you bought a cookie?"" And I said ""yes I did but I didn't like it thankfully."" Her response was, ""oh but let me guess you ate the whole thing?"" And I said, ""Mom it hurts my feelings when you make condescending comments like that.""  


She got SO MAD! Pushed off from the table, stormed off to her bedroom and yelled ""\[my dad and I\] are the most miserable people she has ever been around."" My Dad and I were just wide eyed staring at each other blankly. I had lost my appetite and gave my dad the rest of my nachos. I asked him if I was out of line and he said he had upset her earlier with ""his tone.""

This morning she gave me a dirty look and I asked her what her plans were today with a response of silence.

However, as time went on, T told me and others that she is really not interested. She even told us some not-so-great things about what it is about A that she is not interested in.

Obviously, it's absolutely fine that she has no interest in him, but what I do have a problem with is the fact that she's continuing to act interested in him by saying she wants to see him more often and organising times for them to speak by themselves, and apparently she has said things to him that implies being interested (I say apparently because A told me this but didn't tell me what exactly). A thinks there is something there so he's trying to get closer to T so they can get closer in that way. 

T also told me not to tell A the stuff she said about him. Meanwhile I feel bad for hiding this stuff because he really thinks he likes her.

681,"My husband's family (his parents and his siblings) have serious issues with budgeting and financing. They are a family of 6, with the oldest child being 24 and the youngest being 13. Previously, they had over $40,000 in debt from living expenses. My husband joined active duty military, paid off all that debt, and brought the debt to $0. Before he moved to be with me, he made his parents promise to keep that debt low. 

However, after a few months, around the time COVID-19 hit, the oldest child contacted us and asked us for money. My husband thought it was understandable since the oldest child lost her job and grocery expenses were rising. The only person working was the father. Before COVID-19 hit, the father and the oldest child were working, so losing one source of income was stressful. 

Anyway, my husband and I sent them $3,000. Another few months passed, and the oldest child contacted us again about struggling financially. We soon found out that his family has no savings and they're relying on credit cards. Now, they are in $15,000 debt, which built up from the last time my husband paid off their debt. We couldn't send more money (because we don't have much for ourselves and we didn't want to enable them) and instead talked to them about budgeting responsibly. For example, they could cut back on unnecessary expenses and sell some of the stuff they weren't using. 

His family has a habit of spending recklessly, like eating out at restaurants frequently (before COVID-19) and buying luxury items (like a massage chair or the newest iPhone). Their monthly expenses include $400 for laundry, $80 for haircuts, $500 for cellphones. So, we suggested that they cut back on these expenses for now because they're spending more than the income they earned. 

Basically, his mother became upset. She told him that the the only way to help was send money.  She thinks we make so much money because we're able to live independently from our families. But really, my husband just sacrificed so much (while being in the army and living frugal) to get where we are, and I went through crappy minimum wage jobs. She didn't want our suggestions because they cannot change their lifestyle. My husband is torn because he wants to help, but they're stubborn to change. His family relies on him if they need money. How can we best approach his family in changing bad spending habits? Or is it this normal to be in $15,000 debt after a few months for a family of 6? There are 4 adults, but only 1 works. What can be done in this situation? Open to any advice.

Tl;dr - Husband's family now in $15k debt after husband removing $40k debt. Family stubborn to change lifestyle and only want money as help. How to make them see their bad spending ways or how to handle situation?",25Jun2020,1
682,"I have not slept well since I was in middle school. I’ve just graduated college, and my poor sleep schedule keeps me at a near constant state of exhaustion. I rarely get 8 hours worth of sleep. Since high school I was heavily involved in extracurriculars, worked part time, went to a good university, and got good grades. To no surprise, those commitments came at a price. I know it’s normalized for students to get little sleep. Yes, I had late nights studying and writing papers like any student. However, my real issue is that I’m unable to recover once I’ve lost sleep. I typically sleep 5-6.5 hours a night. If I’m tired during the day, most of the time I cannot nap, I just lay there. If I go to sleep at 2am and wake up at 7:30am, I cannot go back to sleep. Again, I just lay there until it’s time to get up. I never have those weekends where I sleep 10+ hours, I just stay tired.

Now that I will be entering the workforce and becoming a “real” adult, I know I need to fix this. It’s hard when so much of work and social interaction is now remote because of COVID-19. I was unable to put away my electronics in a different room because I live in a studio (that also has regular construction at 8am). I try to put away my phone before sleeping but I have the type of personality where my mind never stops and jumps from idea to idea. Unless I’m so exhausted I need to pass out, it takes hours to fall asleep. I do not think I have anxiety, rather, my mind simply won’t stop and I my mind will keep racing from thought to thought. 

Does anyone have tangible methods for going to sleep, staying asleep, or napping? I’m also worried about my health as I know sleep can cause many problems, especially as I get older.",25Jun2020,1

So...my 17 year old sister is ""dating"" a 22 year old dude. It's been an issue for me for a pretty long time and I honestly don't know how to approach the situation anymore.

 I'm 20, almost 21, but for before the pandemic I was in college but had to go back home once lockdown started. Prior to this my sister revealed that she had feelings for someone at her job (I also used to work at this job and had worked with this dude in the past but I never really knew him) who is older than her. She was 16 at the time and he was 21. I advised her to not get into a relationship with him because it just isn't right. I had warned her hoping she would understand and back off from him. Even then, he was the adult and shouldn't have been flirting with a minor in the first place. Once I came home from college I find out from my mother that she's been hiding the relationship from my parents for a couple of months. 

Of course being the older sibling I tried to talk to her and explain my perspective on their very illegal relationship. This only ruined our relationship and now she resents me for doubting this 21, now 22, year old MAN. I let it be as there was nothing I can really do and I didn't want to escalate the tension between my family. I overall decided to wait for my sister to tell my father in hope that he would talk some sort of sense into her. 

Some time has passed and she is still in a relationship with him. She recently told my dad and apparently my parents are supposed to meet him sometime. The thing that really bothers me about this is how my parents act like it not a big deal. They compare it to my own relationship in which I started dating my boyfriend when I was 16 and he was 18 only we had been friends in high school for a long time prior to dating. My relationship is only a 2 year age gap and my sister's is a 5 year age gap. It's just so weird to me to think that a man who's been out of high school for four years finds no issue with being in a relationship with a minor. Me being in college myself, I nor would my boyfriend and friends ever consider being in any sort of relationship with someone that much younger. There's just an obvious difference in maturity between a 17 year old and a 22 year old and not to mention it is very predatory and creepy. 

The situation just really concerns me as a sibling and as someone who's around the same age as this dude. I know I'm not a parent but I don't get why my family doesn't take my concern seriously. I don't know what to do at this point because my sister just sees me as this big bad person that is trying to demonize her ""boyfriend."" She wont listen to anything I have to say about it and it's just very upsetting.

In my eyes she's been groomed into believing this man is the only person who can comfort her. We both have depression, anxiety, and low self esteem and being that I was away from home for two years she's felt more alone and depressed. It just scares me to think she's been taken advantage of at such a low point in her life and at such a young age. 

I guess all I have to ask is what should I do? I've already lost any sort of trust from my sister and my parents aren't willing to do anything about it. Do you think I'm overreacting? Am I in the right to be this concerned?",25Jun2020,1
687,"Hey Reddit, 

My apartment has been subject to a series of break-ins and robberies. The management, while friendly, hasn't actually done much other than contact the police and send out empty solidarity messages to the community. No cameras, no extra locks, security, etc.

It happened every few weeks, severity ranging from people trespassing and blasting music, to package thefts, to storage units being raided. Recently, however, it has escalated to things like someone's tires being stolen (all 4 of them), someone's motorcycle disappearing overnight, car windows being broken, etc.. Last night, a bunch of cars had their windshields busted in and airbags stolen.

The apartment is in a fairly nice neighborhood, and requires a key to get almost anywhere in the building. I've moved my car to a different neighborhood, but I wonder if it's actually safer parked on a curb than in a locked garage, despite the garage being obviously compromised.

Ideally, I'd like to just get out of here, but I still have a few months on my lease, and the next place I plan on moving into won't be ready until around when my current lease expires. Does anyone here have experience in situations like these? How accountable is the apartment management to the security of the building?",25Jun2020,1

I've left the server and we kinda made up but I dont trust them. In order for them to actually find me out, they'd have to google the 20 names they have in a couple years Time and based off the searches it'd be obvious who I was.

701,"For some background, my bf and I have been together since high school. We broke up twice for about 6 months each time. We got back together a little over a year ago. At first, I thought things were going great. Last summer we had an amazing time together. When we both went back to college, it was still good but the distance sucked however we got through it. 

Anyways, our relationship has died. He’s my first love and I feel like that’s why I can’t let go. I also struggle with depression so I’m scared that leaving him will put me in a dark place. I feel wrong for staying when I’m unhappy tho. I just don’t know how to let go. I’m not cheating or talking to other guys either, I just feel like I fake my emotions with him. We also have the same friends so if we break up, it makes things uncomfortable and awkward for everyone. 

We don’t do anything romantic, no dates, he doesn’t plan things for us, etc. He doesn’t have a car right now so I think he feels bad since I’m the one who would have to drive to do things which I don’t mind but it’s all the time. Its like I’m the only one who plans things out for us to do. I’m bored and I feel like I have lost feelings. We go days without seeing each other and I don’t get that feeling where I want to see him like I did before. When we do see each other, all we do is watch tv. He’s very content with doing nothing. I don’t mind those days where we just chill but that’s the only thing we do. 

I’m also dissatisfied with our sex life. He always finished before me and doesn’t even try to make me finish. Now, I have expressed all these things to him numerous times... probably for the past 5 months...he always tells me that as soon as he gets his car that things will be different and he will plan things for us. But I feel like that’s such an excuses... like there’s so many things we could do that doesn’t require a car. Especially when we go to each others house. The sex is still the same... nothing changed. So we barely have sex unfortunately. 

He’s very content with our relationship and takes me for granted... like he knows I won’t leave. And I know he’s not cheating because I’ve been through his phone recently. I just feel so lost and confused. At the end of the day I’m comfortable and I’m used to him. I’m afraid to let go again. We always find a way back to each other it seems. Every time we break up, we miss each other and the cycle restarts. He doesn’t want to break up again and he wants to eventually get married. 

Don’t get me wrong, hes a great guy and there are qualities I love about him but there is no romance. I don’t feel appreciated or excited anymore. He doesn’t hype me up under my pictures. Little stuff like that. At this point I feel like he’s my friend lol. 

I’m sorry if this sounds like I’m complaining, I’m just so conflicted and I don’t know how to go about this. Do I stay and hope for change? Do I leave and if I do how do I do it? What do I say to him? Has anyone else experienced this that has insight? Looking for advice and a little guidance. Thank you for reading.",25Jun2020,1

So, I think I have made a mistake. I am not looking for this level of attachment, like I told him previously. He did not understand what I was saying clearly, because he proceeds to send me on these guilt trips, and is starting to get very sexual over text, which is becoming too much for me.

714,"For a long while now, I have been having auditory and visual hallucinations. I’ve dealt with them since I was born but they have always been very subtle and rare occurrences. Recently though they have been getting a lot worse. It is getting to the point that the line between reality and fantasy (for lack of a better word) is blurry. 

I first noticed the hallucinations getting worse around 6 months ago. I would hear my name called when nobody was around and I’d hear voices sometimes telling me something such as “go” or “you can’t” (both of which are real examples I’ve heard). My vision would start waving around similar to how your vision is when you’re drunk, even though I was sober for all but one of these hallucinations. On a couple rare occasions my vision would look like a video game running on 2 FPS. 

They started really ramping up in intensity these past two months. I’ve been seeing shadows move or dart past me. I’ve seen lights that weren’t there and even an arm reaching up to my feet from underneath my bed and no, nobody was under my bed. I’ve been hearing hearing people have conversations around me when I’m alone and even someone trying to get my attention when in a group of people.

Some of the worst ones have happened the past few nights. I seen a figure standing in the middle of my yard looking at me. I tried to make out who it was but after I glanced over at my garage, as my parents were in there, and looked back it was gone. The only reason I know it was a hallucination and not somebody messing with me is because they stood a lot taller than anybody i know. They were at least 6’5 and the tallest in my immediate family is 6ft even. 

I don’t know if I’m losing my mind or if I’m just being paranoid or maybe quarantine is getting to me. I’m not sure. I started losing sleep because of these hallucinations and the lack of sleep is making them worse than they already are.

My grandfather has always told me that I have to be better than my mom, and how I need to go to collage and get a good job and etc. I don't know how to tell him that I do not want to go to collage because I have a full belief that I will die within the first six months. My mom as of recently has been pushing me to do better. She wants to see me walk across the stage because she couldn't do that. It stresses me out, I get SO sick whenever I think about it. I've been going through a lot in my own head and I don't talk to anyone about it- truthfully I don't think anyone would care either. I'm just lost. Has anyone else / IS anyone else going through something similar? I'm just scared and to be honest I am NOT ready for the real world at all.",25Jun2020,1
717,"Got in a dispute in a discord server about a year ago. I didnt really care about the fight, but the other 2 guys clearly did. They tried to dox me based on info I said in the server. Im confident they dont know who I am, however they have enough info to scare me, which they did. They have a list of about 20 people who could be me.

I've left the server and we kinda made up but I dont trust them. In order for them to actually find me out, they'd have to google the 20 names they have in a couple years Time and based off the searches it'd be obvious who I was.

All they have on me is a lot of weird/sexual messages about a celebrity (under a username not related to my name), and a picture of my p\*\*nis without my face in the picture (long stupid story).

Is there any realistic chance that this can come back and hurt my reputation in the future? (Eg in terms of employment etc) Or am I worrying about nothing?

718,"Hi everyone, My partner(29) and I(23) decided that we would come to stay with family for the summer until we are allowed to return to school in the fall. While being here we have noticed a disturbing trend of behavior towards our nephew(14) who is on the spectrum.

For context,  I would first like to first say that my sister-in-law is an excellent mother and she does the best that she can to take care of her 6 kids; however, we see how overwhelming this is for her. Our nephew is an extremely intelligent and sweet boy but has some behavioral issues that I attribute teen angst in addition having a new stepdad and 3 new infant siblings.

All that being said the issues that we have noticed have me worried and I'm trying to figure out ways to help. My sister-in-law makes it very clear that she doesn't like her son. She will tell him directly. My new brother-in-law shares the same feelings although he more or less keeps the thoughts to himself. In addition, They talk to my nephew in a tone that even I find disrespectful. When my nephew lashes out they resort to making him seem like the bad guy. In addition, they make generalized statements and predictions that my nephew will not finish high school, and he will inevitably be in trouble with the law.  Recently, I was at their home when the stepdad told him to clean his room. My nephew went to his room and came out 30 min later saying that his room had been cleaned. All was well until I went to get groceries for dinner and returned to my inlaws house (directly across the street from his house) and he(my nephew) was standing at the door sobbing holding a torn card binder and dirty yu-gi-oh cards(cards that my partner and I buy for him). When I asked him what happened he said that stepdad had thrown his cards away because he hadn't followed instructions and talked back to him. I was enraged and went to confront my sister-in-law and her husband (away from the eyes and ears of my nephew)  who basically made the case that they are simply doing what strict parents do and that my nephew needs to learn respect. 

My partner and I have tried our best to explain to the family that they need to stop treating our nephew in the way that they have been and that the emotional harm that their doing now is going to impact his whole life. My sister-in-law went on a FB mom group to ask for advice and they all keep telling her that the kid needs ""hardcore discipline"" my partner and I believe that he needs much more than that and due to having 5 other ""normal"" kids she can't provide the things my nephew needs.

 After a long conversation, my partner and I decided that we have the financial means and would open our home to our nephew and help him get through high school and into college. He wants to be a US Navy Chaplain when he grows up and I plan to try my best to get him there. Now the only hurdle my partner and I have is to get the family to agree that he is better off with us and to get my sister-in-law to agree to give us legal guardianship. Does anyone out there have any ideas on how to open this dialogue with our family? If they do agree to let him come home with us at the end of summer does anyone have advice on where to start the healing process aside from therapy? What kinds of things should we get him and how should we set up his room to make the transition easiest for all of us? Above all, even though we may feel ready to take on a teen, should we? Would we be causing more harm than good by removing him from his home? 

Sorry for the long post there are just so many layers to this story it was hard to pick out the most important parts.",25Jun2020,1

722,"I’m a guy in my early 20’s just ended a relationship with my abusive ex girlfriend recently and have had a few relationships in the past too. 

I’m getting to the point in life where I just feel tired of dating and I’m starting to see that there isn’t a purpose in being with someone aside from them making your life more difficult than it already is. 

When you date someone you take on their problems too and you have to deal with their moods and sometimes they don’t treat you well at all. It’s like a game of chance almost in which 99% of the time you lose. 

It’s only a select few that are lucky enough to find a partner who’s emotionally mature and is willing to work through all the bs that we face in life together as a team. 

I look at the people around me too and so many of them are not happy with their relationship or are getting divorced. Which says a lot to be honest. 

I don’t mean to sound like a know it all prat, I’m just basing this off my own experiences and from what I’ve seen and heard. 

I’m not sure if it’s even worth getting married anymore. I really loved my ex to bits and one day she just switched her personality and started to physically and emotionally abuse me. It’s all great at the start but then when you actually live together things always go south. 

So I’m questioning if I should even try anymore or if I stop thinking that maybe someday I’d find someone that I could settle with.",25Jun2020,1

724,"Have searched everywhere for an easier answer on how to stop hanging out with one group of friends all the time.

My wife and I have known this other couple for over 10 years.  Lately (past 2 or so years) us hanging out has become more and more frequent.  During the Covid 19 pandemic we didn't see each other for about 2 months.  Once the government (Canada) said we can hang out in small groups we see each other every weekend!  We don't have any weekends to ourselves anymore.  Every single weekend is spent with them.  I don't mind hanging out for a dinner and then we go home but we are there for 8 hours or they are with us for 8 hours.  It's becoming unbearable.  We run out of things to talk about and it's the same old stories over and over.  

I am typically the designated driver so I don't drink much at all and stop earlier in the day just to be safe.  I am extremely bored lately with them and I just can't do it anymore.  My wife agrees but she doesn't know how to tell her friend.  Her friend is the one that always suggests we ""hang out"" and my wife is too polite to come up with excuses so we just hang out.  We would do other things like go out to the movies together or go to the YMCA etc but we can't due to Covid 19.  

What do we do?  How do we deal with this?  I am desperate.

725,"I am F19 and my mom still goes through my closet and drawers to ""make sure they are organised."" She knows I don't have anything like drugs or alcohol, but the fact that she is obsessed with the organisation of my room--that I pay for monthly--is getting really annoying. I don't keep my room a pigsty; its pretty decent. Yet she demands I keep SUPER organised ALL THE TIME and its really getting on my nerves because I feel like my privacy is getting invaded. I have old letters from friends and my writing journals in my drawers and closet, and I really don't like the idea of her going through those since a lot of my journals are used for therapy. I have sat down and spoken with her about it before, and she says ""even if you pay for the room, its my house."" I respect its her house and her rules, and I follow those rules, but I am a tenant and pay bills and don't think its her right to go through my things just for the sake of obsession and nosyness. 

What are some ways I get ask and convince my mom not to go through my stuff? I would also like to say that due to my financial situation, moving out isn't an option.

726,"I haven't worked since January and have been passively looking for a job.  I got a job offer for a 6 month contract role at a not exciting company.  The pros of taking it would be having an income and less of a gap on my resume.

The cons would be it's not a great place to work, the commute is long (once we go back into the office), and they ended the interview early saying I didn't get the job.  Then a week later they made an offer because other people turned it down.  Also, I know almost nothing about the team or position because they ended the interview abruptly and didn't let me ask any questions.  So the team doesn't really want me which is awkward.

I have about 5 months in savings.  I really don't want to work there, but it seems like the responsible thing to do.  I work in an in demand industry but am pretty bad at interviewing.

733,"Even in preschool I lay awake in bead hoping not to wake up again since because everyday was a battle with myself and everything around me. A cardiac arrest at birth gave me massive brain-damage but I never wanted to except the resulting disabilities.  I consider my life a 30 year long war to adjust and fit in. But it's never enough. I never felt like I belonged in this world, never really managed to connect with people even if they reached out for me, never really felt 'human' really. My original plan was 'out of sight, out of mind'. I purposefully withdrew from everyone around me as I got ready to go to collage. I figured that once I left I could maintain a few months of complete distancing to soften the blow of me leaving this world. But just before I left a child of one of my parents committed suicide and I heard my parents talking about how life would never bet the same for them, how they would always hurt because of it. Obviously that wasn't my goal. So I resolved to wait until after they are dead and build a life in the meantime. Got degrees with distinction, good job, own a flat, did volunteers work and activism, exercised, got hobbies, traveled, got to know new people, got involved and donated to causes I believed in, helped those around me and even started coaching others to do the same. And I've adapted. Fully functional adult and even ahead of the curve on most things that matter to me. But in the end, none of it matters. I still haven't found anybody that I really connected with, still feel like I don't belong here and I'm still longing to die, still nobody to call and have a good time. Friendships, hobbies, interests, loves, volunteering projects ... It never lasts, even when I carefully consider the effort/risk vs obtaining satisfaction. I always end up disappointed, hurt or disinterested. At this point I don't see what else I can try and I regard everything and everyone with disdain. I've gone into therapy several times, and coaching, tried several types of medication, called help lines, red articles, tried talking with the people close to me ...But I could get anybody to really understand. I don't want to live the next 30 years grumpy and disinterested.

I have tried crocheting, sewing, arts and crafts, exercising, baking, gardening, makeup, collecting, and so many more things. I'd try gaming, but my laptop cannot even handle minecraft.

I liked baking for about a month and then it got tedious and boring. I collected crystals for a few months last year because they were cool, but now I find it boring. I tried writing, but it was boring. I have been trying to learn Spanish because it was fun when I did Spanish 1 and 2 and my boyfriend speaks it, but I can't find any resources that make it enjoyable.

I have volunteered and tried out a few jobs and it is so difficult. I had fun watching shows and videos on netflix and youtube, I always have, but now I find it boring.

741,"Hello, 

I need advice on how to forgive the past with my current roommate. She claims me as her best friend but sometimes I question if she is deserving of that title from me. In the past, she has been completely cold and closed off to me. She has said extremely hurtful things that made me feel so misunderstood. It wasnt until I became distant and made new friends and became closer to our other roommate that she came around and started treating me better. This roommate that I am having trouble with was never the easiest to confront things with. If I had a problem with her, then it was just that, MY problem not hers. She would have no part in hearing my voice if it was something that was not in her benefit, she never seemed to understand that my feelings would always be valid because they are my feelings. Like you cant tell someone about their own feelings. She has always been closed off and only invested in her boyfriend and maybe one or two friends, but mostly she cares about herself and her boyfriend. I would have to fight with her and try and educate her on the most basic of things. Such as not using racist derogatory terms, but she always put up a fight and failed to LEARN. But recently she has shown me a side of her that she is tyring to be more understanding and she has completely done a 180 on her views on racism, etc. She really is growing and I can see that. However I still cary distaste for her and for the fact that it has taken this fucking long for her to be a decent fucking person and show myself and others compassion and respect. I play the conversations over and over of her being so cruel to me and it makes me want to punch her in the face but I know its in the past and our friendship isnt moving that direction but she is seriously the most fiesty and cold hearted person I have ever been this close too so its hard and i am still trying to work on forgiveness and i just hate hate hate the way she used to treat me and talk to me and yeah its better now but it should not have taken that long",25Jun2020,1

I got my offers from universities from Holland and NZ... Holland is my first preference... although I’d have to do foundation year and I had a math entrance exam to take...which I did and passed and I was all set for the university all excited and my parents were ALL ON BOARD (for Holland the university does foundation year from different agency and then you go to the university I wanted to go therefore you need certain grades etc etc and my parents knew about it) well time came to pay the deposit to secure you seat and all of a sudden my dad says nope....I need more options ...mind you this is in the beginning of June.... I have missed most deadlines to apply in Europe.... I get where he is coming from not doing the foundation program as it‘s not offered from the university itself and the acceptance rate is 10% and I am not the brightest student but I am willing to work hard for it... I get that he doesn’t wanna risk anything but I found it frustrating that he spoke a little to late.... and the course I wanted to do they closed the application deadline on January 15,2020 therefore I applied for my second option and I didn’t realize I missed the deadline for that too which was June 1st,2020... the university got back to me and asked the reason why I applied late etc etc and after 20 days they said I can go through with my application and that’s what I did last night.... completed everything they asked for....so I have everything done for the second time yes...during the waiting period for the university to get back to me I started doing research for universities in Europe and see if I have chance and can still apply while my parents looked for Universities in THE UK AND CANADA which are two places I don’t wanna go... they started sharing links etc etc and I got even more frustrated cause maybe if they put this much effort in the beginning of my senior year it would’ve been more helpful.... anyways after few arguments etc one morning my dad asks me where do I wanna settle in and I said somewhere in Europe and he goes well I did my research and the university I wanted to go to initially is “not that bad” and maybe he will think about it which is kinda too late considering....I am close to the deposit deadline nor did the university get back to me yet.... Anyways they did and filled my application and was all sorted and today my parents go “why don’t you apply in media and culture” like?????? I told them I have missed the deadline and if I apply id have to go through the same process like earlier and I can come across as an indecisive student and maybe they won’t go through my already 2 month late application.... tell me if I am wrong here and it’s not frustrating how I’ve done almost everything twice till the last minute and my parents find a way that’s it’s not good enough.",25Jun2020,1

746,"When you break down relationships and people you can always trace the motivation to do things and the affection you feel toward others to getting something out of them. Be it something materialistic like money and power, or something less tangible like attention, affection, knowledge etc....

I mean, why in the world would you want to be around someone that adds nothing to your life?

But fornme it just ruins it to realize its all out of selfishness. You always want something out of the person and once the person can't give anymore of what you want, they can just be ""discarted"" from your life.

Its like this especially in the beginning of any relationship, before you become attached to every part of that person, you want something out of him.

I think I just start to feel guilty and what arises is the thought ""if Im with this person because I want something out of it, then I should avoid it"", and thats what I end up doing because you ALWAYS want something out of it.

It seems stupid I know but I just can't get over it. I feel like this is corrupting me or something because whenever I start enjoying something I feel as if where committing a selfish act.",25Jun2020,1

I've left the server and we kinda made up but I dont trust them. In order for them to actually find me out, they'd have to google the 20 names they have in a couple years Time and based off the searches it'd be obvious who I was.

All they have on me is a lot of weird/sexual messages about a celebrity (under a username not related to my name), and a picture of my p\*\*nis without my face in the picture (long stupid story).

Is there any realistic chance that this can come back and hurt my reputation in the future? (Eg in terms of employment etc) Or am I worrying about nothing?

Tbh even if they did try their hardest to ruin me idk if they could. Advice pls.",25Jun2020,1
748,"As the title states, my girlfriend’s parents wanted to meet me and my dad didn’t take well to that. He was very unhappy due to the last minute nature of it, as I found out late Sunday night and told him Monday morning for a meeting which was intended to happen Monday afternoon. I told him that it would be without a handshake, wearing masks, and keeping a respectable distance apart to social distance. Just a meeting in her front yard. I’d go, make my impression, and be back early enough for dinner. Simple, right? No. My dad wanted to go WITH me, which is very emasculating and inhibits growth. I can’t be trying to make a good impression on her dad while my dad is either pitching in and interrupting or watching my every movement and word. As if her strict parents weren’t enough pressure. So my dad invited himself for a meeting next week, but I don’t let him because I didn’t give my girlfriend’s parents his phone number (which he asked me to do but that’s really pushing it). What do I do?",25Jun2020,1
749,"If you re-post this anywhere else - please don't mention my username as it can identify me to my sister.   

At present me and my sister who are both living together in a 2 bed house we rent together. We both still work- she is a key worker for the NHS and I work for a very local charity and do some work form home but have to go into the charity to provide an emergency service for low income and people shielding or at risk of COVID-19 can tap into for support. 

I have always suspected my twin sister is on the Asperger's spectrum but not sure if she just hasn't grown up... we are twins and although I am the younger one I have always been more outspoken, sticking up for both of us very vocal and able to express myself. My sister has always struggled to give a voice to her emotions and has had frequent anger explosions over the years and broke things when she gets frustrated and cant defend herself in arguments. She likes to spend her time 'her way' and plays on her laptop a lot and doesn't go out if not to work. She very quick to anger and doesn't care when she upsets family if our brother is visiting them at the same time as they don't get on.

I drive, my sister doesn't but has been qualified since last year but hasn't got round to buying a car due to time restrictions with her job (9-5) and having unrealistic expectations on how much she is willing to spend on a car... 

My sister feeds our 2 dogs every day in the morning before work. I do after work and walk them  and sometimes in the morning as I can start later.  

My issue being - I seem to constantly be getting into arguments with her over chores I 'do' expect her to do. We both pay half on everything but recently we have been buying more food and general spending and she has been complaining over the food bill. She has stated she doesn't like paying so much but I reason with her we need the food. The one time I bought less she asked me to make a special journey the next day to buy more as I didn't buy enough...

We both work full time still. I don't get any thanks for doing the weekly/bi-weekly shop for food and necessities and while this is usually okay, I'm getting pretty frustrated with my sister not doing her fair share of maintaining the house. 

She will use any excuse to not do something shes not in the mood to clean. We've had talks about this in the past about placing expectations on each other. Shes been to therapy over her anger in the past and her emotions and she asked me not to put expectations on her as it leads to resentment and anger. But when I ask her to rake the garden, clean up the dog mess, wash the dishes or clean up any pots and pans she has used she turns nasty. I do this regularly!!! I do what needs cleaning in the house  but get an argument or 'i don't want to or feel like it' when I ask her for help. I have even left things to accumulate thinking she will get the hint but NO! I asked her to rake the grass and she left the raked grass on the pavement - A METRE AWAY FROM OUR GARDEN RECYCLE BIN!

I always leave items clean that I use for either of us next time, its really annoying me that she will leave food in a pan for 4 days until it starts getting mold before I have to throw it out. She will leave used spoons on the side and think there is nothing wrong with re-using a dirty spoon for a cup of tea or coffee she offered to make me. She squirts toothpaste directly into her mouth and use her lips to cut off the paste from the tube - I had a fit with her over this when I seen her do it. I told her its the same as sharing a toothbrush but she can't see her dirty habits!

I leave nic nac clutter in the house and know I'm not perfect but she goes into cleaning fits where she tells me she is trowing everything out which causes an argument as its usually all my things. I tell her she is fine living in the house with clutter until something goes wrong in her daily routine then she flips and wants to get rid of everything. I have a right to live in the house as well and feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also get a running list of 'all' the cleaning she has done when she goes into cleaning sprees. (Once in a blue moon).  I don't tell her every time I mop the floor, feed/ walk the dogs or replace the toilet roll but seem to get never-ending stream of 'but I did this \*insert tiny cleaning\*'. 

I feel like I'm going insane but not sure if I'm being an A\*hole about expecting her to do the bare minimum? What if she does have some form of disability? How do I get her to seek help? Is it fair for me to do the majority even if she has a disability?  She's under stress at work - but shes had lots of jobs and unemployment over the years and always seems to hit the same brick wall with not being able to handle issues in the workplace and blowing her lid. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are both saving up to possibly buy a house together in the next few years as we don't have partners but I've told her I'm seriously considering not doing that with her as she's not 50/50 on responsibilities. We come from a big family and my older sister has said my twin is dragging me back in life opportunities and experiences as I always try to make room for my twin in everything but due to her being anti-social and 'very' blunt in how she feels about something work related or otherwise. I've had favors I've done her backfire or got a verbal tongue lashing off my twin for not doing more.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I need to be more supportive or not? I feel so tired all the time then have to do her share of everything as well when I get home...",25Jun2020,1

I was explaining to a friend that I don't have one best friend but I have multiple good friends that I associate with certain things or hobbies. For example, I have a friend that I typically like to shop or talk to but I don't enjoy going ""out"" for drinks with them or I have a friend that I go rock climbing with and we are close but rock climbing is all we do together. My friend said that I was a toxic friend and that I am only using my friends rather than accepting them as whole flawed people.

757,"I had an abusive mom, she made me feel like shit, threatened to leave all the time, gaslighted me, stole money, etc. etc. etc. 

As an adult, whenever someone abusive enters my life who violates my boundaries or treats me badly, I feel really numb around them, and I pretty much just give in to whatever they want me to do. My brother is a lot like my mom, except he’s just more clueless, but when he visits he treats me really shitty... and I let him gaslight me and just do whatever he says.

It is so frustrating because I am a strong person in general, I’ve survived a lot and accomplished a lot. But whenever this kind of person comes into my life, I respond exactly how I did when I was growing up. I isolate myself from everyone who cares about me, I let the person abuse me and become obsessed with making them love me, and I find small passive aggressive ways to get back at them.

I don’t want to be like this anymore because I’m literally signing on to be degraded by other people, but it’s frustrating because I can’t stop myself. I keep in contact with these people, I drop people who don’t abuse me out of my life, etc. 

How do I stop?",25Jun2020,1
758,"Guys, I'm at my wits end and I don't know where to go. 

My wife, who is amazing, has had a lot of trauma in her life from the treatment she has received from others, especially in school and so called friends. Not going into too much details, and not asking for a diagnosis for her, but she has some pretty bad self-esteem issues mixed in with anxiety and depression issues. She used to cycle between being awesome, to having major episodes with these issues for about a week. But, for the past couple years, it seems seems more in an anxious and depressed state than not. 

Also, again, long story short, I've been trying to get her to seek help for a long time, but based on passed experiences as a teen she assumes that there is no help to be available. When she got really bad this last early fall, she tried to seek help through a program in the university she works at. The problem is, it fell through, the clinc and the therapist she wanted to see based on her bio wouldn't work with her on scheduling and just kinda stoped responding. She gave up then, and kinda slipped out of her funk into somewhat of a normalcy after a while. 

However, with this Covid situation and other things, her anxiety and stuff has come back with a vengence. Shes very scared to go out now and is having a lot of issues with anxiety, depresison and self worth. I suggested online therapy, been seeing commericals for it and thought, why not. I guess it works mostly by texting the therapist a few times a day. 

Guys, if I could reach through the screen and choke this god damn therapist, I would. Its been 4 days, and the most she has gotten from her is basically a copy pasted fact sheet about depressive episodes, and she hasn't responded to my wife's request for feedback in over 36 hours. My wife is not doing good. She's again convinced that there is no point in seeking help, shes just gonna get ignored like she has been the rest of her life. My wife has major anxiety about money, so it doesn't help that she also feels that we've been fleeced on top that. 

I've been pretty misty eye here in my office this morning, trying to text her and keep her motivated. I just want my wife to move past the trauma shes experienced and be as amazing as she really is. I understand life has its ups and downs, but not like this. Not like this. 

Whats the best way to help support someone with seeking help? I know it needs ot be her descision, but I think we're just going to go through this cycle until she figures it out on her own or we find someone thats actually willing to work with her.",25Jun2020,1
761,"One of my best friends, almost like a sister has severe mental health problems. We only started getting close around November last year, but especially close in January. We haven’t been able to hang out as much with COVID obviously and her home life sucks from what she has told me. 

Back in January I introduced her to this medication for anxiety, not prescribed but I would take a small amount to sleep, many of the people in my friend group do so. I never knew her mental health was so bad. This medication is highly addictive &amp; can make you blackout &amp; act different without knowing, you can’t drive on them, you slur your words, etc. I gave it to her and told her she can’t take them often &amp; only take a small amount to sleep. I myself have pretty severe depression &amp; anxiety and used to take a small amount to sleep.

Things were fine until COVID happened. She started picking up the drugs from someone &amp; would text me &amp; I would be able to tell that something was wrong but not able to do anything about it. She had two days of calling me a lot &amp; slurring her words, texting me where I don’t understand &amp; just behaving erratically, again I couldn’t do anything. I made her promise to not take anymore of the pills, especially when she’s at home with her family because she could get in a lot of trouble.

3 days ago we were texting &amp; she was spelling so many words wrong, I knew something was up. I asked her if she was okay &amp; she said it was just typos from typing fast on her laptop. I thought, alright, and let it go. She started texting erratically &amp; saying her parents were yelling at her &amp; all kinds of stuff. Then she called me &amp; cried for 3-4 hours and talked about being suicidal &amp; wanting to die.

I talked her through it, majority of what she was saying was incoherent because she was on drugs. The pill is split into fourths, I would only take a fourth or a half, but she took 5 pills, not to kill herself but if you don’t fall asleep, it’s highly addictive &amp; you’ll take more and more without remembering.

I convinced her to sleep but she woke up still pretty messed up &amp; didn’t make sense until night when it must have wore off. I plan on seeing her today. Her boyfriend broke up with her over it &amp; she called again &amp; was feeling super down &amp; suicidal. I lectured her &amp; said that if she is gonna be irresponsible with drug usage then she shouldn’t be doing it at all. She took this to mean that she shouldn’t be doing it at her parents house but to do it when she’s alone is fine, which is not the case, I don’t think she should do it at all. 

I also have been encouraging her since April to get counseling, I said I would help her find someone that she likes. Her parents are supportive of her going (which is unusual for our culture) but she hasn’t taken any action. 

On top of this, I finally felt like my life was under control &amp; my own suicidal thoughts were tucked away for a bit. I went to sleep thinking how nice it’d be if I were dead, and my mindset is negative. Therapy has never been an option for me &amp; I want her to go because I’ve heard it is helpful &amp; her parents are open to it. I want to be there for her because she doesn’t believe anybody cares for her, and we have been really good friends since this year &amp; she trusts me over a lot of people.

765,"So my pickle is:
I have just quit my job because I really hated it and funny enough now a job opened up where I worked before the shitty job. Should I take it or not?

I think they would hire me again, they said so when I left.

But the reason why I left the job in the first place were:
-things being a bit weird with a coworker
-feeling that I am not good enough for that job, though they seemed to disagree
-I kind of liked what I did there, but I was not hyped about it

The thing is that I can't move from my city and there are not many companies here in my field..let's say 4 or 5 and probably they would not accept me everywhere. So if I miss this shot I might get stuck with a much worse job..or no job. 

So the options are:
-try some freelancing or startup.I have few ideas, but not great. Also I don't know if I can find the energy for that.
-accept this job, at least I know it's not horrible
-wait a few months to see what other jobs become available, though after this bad experience I worry they might all be really sucky

767,"So my house has always had a mice problem, they would go for months then suddenly come back. My mother puts down traps and yada yada and throughout our mice problem you'll never seen them anywhere except for the kitchen and living room where they would scutter around and you would watch them as they hide behind places we can't get to. Now today I have seen a mouse scurry past the front of my wardrobe and under my bird's cage I checked under it and the little shit has completely disappeared.

 I like to keep my room clean and I'm seriously not joking, I have a horrible allergy to my bird and he gives me asthma attacks, if I don't clean up constantly and consistently throughout the week (vacuuming, keeping the wind open, cleaning the cage and letting mango bathe once a week) i'll sneeze up a storm and have asthma flare ups (this also includes cleaning up any plates or cups, doing laundry and trying to keep clutter free). So when I say I keep my room clean I seriously mean it. Its spotless and I pride myself in staying in a clean environment however Recently my mum has covered up a little hidey hole the mice would hang out so i'm wondering if they're starting to stay in my room because of it?

I've never seen a mice in my room, not once and now that its happened in kinda at a loss and I don't want to sound pathetic but the thought of having something that I haven't authorised in my room makes me wanna cry (I'm a bit controlling and EXTREMELY possessive over whats mine) and I'm terrified that they'll chew up wires as I have a little gaming corner in my room that I've been working on.

Am I really not as clean as I thought? Or is it because they currently see no threat in my room? Is this a genuine concern I should have or will they leave when they realise there is no food here? Will they eat mango's seeds? (he has a lil baggie with seeds) Am I being anxious for no reason?",25Jun2020,1

770,"My mom has Munchausen By Proxy syndrome. I am female 32. Growing up my parents abused me and never respected my boundaries. My mom always believed I was dieing and would take me to multiple doctors in the U.S. specialists for illnesses and diseases I never had. She would spend hours days researching medical conspiracy theories on the internet. She spent her husband's entire retirement fund this way. My dad was absent through most of my childhood working in Japan. He always supported her and agreed with anything she said or did no matter what it was.  I was never allowed any friendships or personal freedom. I wasn't allowed to shower more than once a week for only 10 minutes in the evening only. I wasn't allowed to keep a diary because my mom would always read it. I wasn't allowed a bedroom door or allowed to lock the bathroom door. I was starved so I weighed maybe 100 pounds at 6 feet tall and what I ate was completely controlled. All my phone calls and internet communication was completely monitered screened and filtered scripted by and through my parents. The way I spoke was controlled. If I ever said the wrong thing I'd get hours of lectures over it. My earliest childhood memory is of my mom practicing with me how to talk to others, scripting me on what is not ok to say. I Remember her saying ""You can't ever say that. You don't want me to be taken away forever do you? Who will look after you?"" I was so young  at that time I didn't know about children's protection services. I assumed with dad gone in Japan that I would just be left alone at home to die by starvation. I was too little to cook. I had 0 control over what I was allowed to listen to, what I was allowed to study in school, watch on T.V, how I dressed, spoke to people, what I read, how I spent my money, or even how my hair was cut. I was never allowed to grow it long. I was never allowed to look more attractive than my mom. She always competed with me. Every summer my uncle and aunt would take me in for 2 months. I found out as an adult it was because my mom told them I was too difficult to handle. She needed a break from me. Because I was such a bad child. I was always told her life ended the moment I was conceived. I grew up trying to earn her love and never getting a high, or being told by her that she loved me. She would put on a show in front of others about how she gave up her job to look after me and what a great mother she is looking after her sick and dying child whom she loves. She would use my fake illnesses for attention. My family were upper middle class so I had to look and act a certain way. I was not allowed to know how much money my dad earned, never taught what bills are or how to budget. My finances were completely controlled. My mom was a nurse but quit nursing to look after me when I was born because she always believed that I was dying. When I turned 18 my mom applied me for disability for illnesses I do not have, and tried to get me to legally sign a form saying I am not mentally or physically capable enough to manage my own finances and look after myself so she would have complete control over me. I refused to sign it. I tried to leave them by moving into a youth shelter and live on my own while still attending high school. I grew up in Toronto. My mom got colon cancer and dad begged me to come home. I agreed knowing mom was too sick from Chemo to hurt me physically anymore. Less than a week after I moved home they threw out all my childhood possessions in a big dumpster and we moved to Pembroke Ontario Canada. There were no shelters there it's a rural town, with no public transport except for expensive taxies. I was never allowed to learn how to drive as long as I lived at home. I was brainwashed from when I was a child that I could never drive. Everytime we went in a car they would lecture mentor an hour before and after every car ride with graphic images of car accidents, and lectures about how I am to sick and dying to drive. They're show me pictures and lecture me on how that will be me if I try to drive. How I would need special training they can't ever afford if I were to ever drive. They refused to let me try and work. They refused to help me learn how to write a resume
 I had to get an employment helper person through disability to come to my house and teach me everything. They would call my employers and sabatoge every job I worked at so I would stay dependent on them. Eventually after years of saving every penny I could scrounge in secret. I saved enough money despite the charging me rent so high, that I had enough for first and last and was able to move out into an apartment ony own. They refused to help me move so I had to do it by myself completely. My mom would come by my apartment sit down on my couch and refuse to leave for hours and hours while yelling and harassing me unless I called the police not respecting my boundaries. Eventually I held a job, found a bf, we dated for 7 years, I moved in with him in the neighbouring town 30 minutes away by car. I work part time in fast food. I wasn't ready to marry him or start a family until I went no contact withy parents, because I did not feel safe raising children with my mom around. I contacted the police and they helped me write a legal letter to my parents asking them to leave me alone stop contacting me for the rest of my life. I did this 1 year ago. I tried to stay in contact with just my dad but when he met up with me for contact he brought with him a bag of pills my mom wanted me to take because she beleives I am dieing, as well as a folder with printed off internet conspiracy theories about doctors. I couldn't keep in contact with him because he wouldn't do it without her controling him this way. So I tried to go no contact with either of them. I am now pregnant and getting married to my husband in August. My mom won't stop harassing me. She would stop by our house and yell at us through the front door refusing to leave  until I called the police. I would come home from work to find grocery bags left hanging from my door handles filled with bottles of expired pills and syringes and binders full of conspiracy theories printed from the internet about doctors and diseases. Every week I'd have to call the police and ask them to remove mom from the property. I work in customer service front desk at a fast food restaurant. My mom would come through the cash and sit in the restaurant staring at me for hours. She would talk to all the staff about how much she loves me so that I would look bad to my coworkers for ignoring her.  She still does this twice a week every week at my work. Now with covid she comes through my cash, and sits outside in the car watching me for hours waiting for me to leave. She drives up and downy street repeatedly and parks near my favorite walking paths and walks them for hours hoping to see me.  My parents insist that unwanted contact is not stalking. When she persists on calling me she doesn't look at it as stalking. Stalking? She was is just trying to repair l a RIFT. My parents believe they must keep trying to contact me to let them know they love me, regardless of my multiple requests for no contact. They send texts and emails until I blocked them. They mail cards and gifts on birthdays and holidays. They believe that if they don't keep trying, I will say they love me any more. I don't understand how they do not see that just because they are my parents doesn't mean it isn't harassment or stalking? It makes me so upset. I am constantly stressed at work never knowing when they will show up and create a forced confrontation. I can never leave my house and enjoy going for a walk or swim in the river without terrorizing fear that they will be waiting for me in their car, or if I go swiming they will be waiting for me at the river's edge for a forced confrontation. I am terrified that my mom will see my pregnant body at work and take me to court for grand child visitation rights and force contact, harass me worse. My parents see my avoidance as guilt, not accepting phone calls, gifts or cards as deliberate attempts to hurt them, and calls to the police as attempts to publicly humiliate them. I don't have any social media accounts like Facebook, twitter, etc, because  they use them to harass me. They contact my childhood friends I haven't spoken to in years and manipulate them into trying to get me to contact them because they are my parents. It ruins friendships with people who can't possibly understand. So I closed all my social media accounts. My parents have never made an attempt to understand the situation from my perspective. It's all poor them and I am abusing them by doing this. When they get extended family to contact me on their behalf, or leave countless voicemail messages they act like ""What have we been doing to you? Nothing but telling you we love you."" They say ""Why should you be afraid of me? I'm a weak little old woman who wouldn't hurt a fly! How can this estrangement end if we don't talk about it?"" They never respect my boundaries and complexly dismiss my feelings like they have my entire life. My parents refuse to believe anything that goes against their idea of how the relationship between us should be. I am so fed up of the harassment and regular reminders that my parents don't respect my boundaries everytime I check my phone, email, postage mail, or go to work. I am exhausted of having to get past my internal terror anytime I want to go for a walk or swim. I live in Canada Ontario and I have started logging every time my parents show up at my work to harass me, stalk me, or show up at my house and refuse to leave because the internet says I should incase they ever take me to court for grandchildren visitation rights.  I feel terrorized by them constantly. If they ever took me to court I can't imagine how I could ever prove to them my mom has Munchausen by Proxy. She would use her medical past being a nurse before she had me, and everything she put me through medically as a child as just being a good loving mother trying to help her child. I would lose my disability because she lies for me to have it. I have chronic pancreatitis and require it for that, but when she applied as me she said I had Ehlerse Danlose syndrome and needed it for that (I don't have Ehlerse Danlose) I don't know how I could ever prove legally that she would not be safe left alone with my children. I know no matter what I do she would try to pick my kids up from school without telling me to force a relationship with them. I am living in constant fear and terror. My husband refuses to move because this is where he grew up and wants to stay here. He works as a A Z heavy machinery mechanic for a local construction company. I was going to take self defense classes, but now with Carona Virus it is impossible, and with my pregnancy, I can't see it happening. I have severe PTSD from my childhood (When I moved out of my apartment I was too terrified to go shopping alone or leave my apartment. For the first 2 years community mental health had a worker come see me every 2 weeks and help me get groceries etc. They forced me to join work shops for depression and community meetings until  I started integrating into society in my own) , and depression which requires me to be medicated throughout my pregnancy so I will have to bottle feed my child. I must learn to drive as there is no public transport where I love except for taxis. But everytime I try and study the drivers handbook I have severe panic attacks and fits of crying for hours. If anyone on here can help me legally, or advise me as to how to move forward in my life with successfully with complete freedom from my parents it would be greatly appreciated. I know they won't stop harassing me because my brother in law tried to go no contact with them for over 20 years, and they never stopped harassing him to this day by email, phone, and cards. My brother in law and sister in law's are 20 years my seniors. My mom didnt have me until she was 40 years old. I am my dad's 3 child of his 2nd marriage. My mom's only child. My dad is 75 ish and my mom is almost 70. My commonlaw husband never believed my mom was as nuts as she is until she showed up at his place of employment yelling at him for over 3 hours accusing him of taking advantage of me because I am disabled and dying, trying to give him a bag with pills she wants me to take and a folder with medical conspiracy theories she wanted him to read. He thought she just needed to vent so he never called the police on her. He came home visibly shaken beleiving me that my mom is ""A nutter"" Can anyone on here please help me? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. I am sorry for any grammer and spelling errors in this post. I wrote it in a hurry on my Samsung Galaxy phone. PS I don't feel safe around my mom because she killed my cat. Growing up when I was about 10 she would d force me to preform surguries with her on my male cat I named Herman. She told me she couldn't afford to take him to the vet and I beleives her. He would get abscesses from being an indoor outdoor cat. She would get dad and I to help her. We would wear tgich leather gardening gloves. I would hold the back legs and my dad would hold the head and front legs. Mom would have the abscesses with a razor first to remove the fur. Then she would slice him open and squeeze out the piss to drain it. Then she would use a needle and syringe filled with salt water to flush the abscess clean. Then she would Stich it closed. It would re fill and we would have to rego through the process multiple times. Eventually the car succumb and died because we couldn't take it to the vet. It was abused at home. Left outside for days and days so it's ears froze completely off during winter. I begged mom to make it an indoor only cat but she refused. I own a pet cat now and it is indoor only. My husband Matt helped me re learn what is and isn't anal abuse and treat animals lovingly so they are lovie. I hope to raise our child opposite of the way my family raised me. Full of unconditional love, acceptance, and care. My m would force me to kill wild birds and animals as punishment for being bad growing up. I wasn't allowed to cry or else I was punished for showing weakness which was intolerable. Through therapy after I left home I relearn how to cry and manage my feelings healthily.",25Jun2020,1
771,"I know. Weird question. Let me explain.

I read a lot of book series, but I've put off reading and buying books because my place has been under construction for several years. With the pandemic, we finally had the time to finish the work, but it also makes me apprehensive about making a huge book order that's worth about $700–$1,000 in books. (I should mention, I'm kind of stuck having to buy everything at once because my  ""book fund"" is being kept in an untouchable account until I pull *everything* out for its intended purchase. It's complicated…)

I was more cautious in the beginning weeks of the pandemic because I was afraid of getting a contaminated shipment, and I was also concerned about it being a dick move to shipping workers because everyone was buying everything online (especially books), at that time.

I was gonna say things have calmed down a bit with things opening up, but we also seem to be hitting that second wave. I really want to buy my books asap, but I'm still concerned for the original reasons.

Every other year i’ve only been running and fetching things anyone needed but this year im actually doing what everyone else would be doing...I can’t physically handle it though. I have asthma and eczema...so being around this much dust and heat is painful. Im always either almost getting an asthma attack or get extremely itchy or dry skin, small hives as well...I can’t handle that much labor either since im pretty skinny (120lbs, almost 6’...you can only imagine slenderman i know :( ) and not quite fit enough. It’s also what we call “contract” work, so its basically, “do this much work, and ill pay you this much as soon as you finish”. This is pretty bad for me because I don’t know much and im dying half of the time. Its only my dad and I too, so he’s trying so hard to finish even though i sometimes cant handle his pace, he’s extremely nice about it though. He tells me to take 5 mins breaks like every 20 minutes. He does tell me to “wake up” every 20 minutes too though and he personally told me that this job isn’t that good for me specifically. I never back talk him or anything, I do as much as I can but its truly not enough to help him. He said my moms the one “forcing” me to work, she kind of is. I don’t see the need though...i don’t really need money...especially not this much. All i do is just mod my car with it or save it until someone in my family needs it.

777,"I am beginning to think I have bitten off more than I can chew this summer. I am an undergraduate student doing paid research for a professor remotely. This entails doing Computational chemistry work, as well as doing weekly presentations on articles he supplies to me. This equates to 40 hours a week about. 

I am also taking an online Bio and History course to cover some requirements for next semester. This equates to about 10-15 hours a week for each class. It’s overall pretty easy but they are both discussion post based classes, and I very much overthink things when forming these posts so I try to do these early, but when I am done with them I have a mindset of “it’s fun time” when I should really get grinding away at the readings I need to do for work, which are extremely dense.

780,What Electronic Should I By Under 600 Dollars,25Jun2020,1
781,"This is going to be a pretty lengthy post. **TL;DR: I'm trying to decide if it would be best if I extended my internship for 6 more months (January 2021) OR finish school back home and reapply back next year.**

Like it says in the TL;DR, my boss recently gave me an offer to extend my internship for 6 additional months. I currently work in California for a pretty big company. I love this internship. I love the people who work here. They have been like a second family to me and I want to stay. I really do because I don't think I'll get another opportunity like this ever again. I think my future is working in this company and growing my technical knowledge within this company. However, there are a lot of caveats extending this internship.

My boss told me that they're trying to bring people back in the office (in a limited capacity) so if I extended, they'll expect me to be on site to do some needed things. The problem is that the site is in California and ""home"" is in Arkansas. If you don't know where Arkansas is, it's a 30 hour drive (roughly), making the assumption you try to drive straight with no stops. It would be impractical for me to drive or even fly back and forth every few often. While I do enjoy working here at the company, I have no friends (besides my coworkers) or family here. It's been socially barren for me living here by myself for the past 4 months since quarantine. I haven't physically spoken to another human being for a long time. It's quite sad. And I won't lie; I am getting home-sick at this point. I want to go back home and see my parents, my family, my friends, my dog. And I haven't seen them in 7 months. 

Staying here, especially in this type of environment, would be hard for me socially and probably financially too because I would have to find a new (and potentially more expensive) place to live since my lease ends next month. I think that's what a lot of my co-interns, especially the ones who are extending kinda can't connect with. Unlike everybody who's in my intern group, I traveled from, by far, the farthest. Everybody who works here lives either in California or Nevada or in places where it's a relatively easy drive back from site. Meanwhile, I live pretty much halfway across the whole country. 

As for school, I know I can just delay my graduation but I think it would be impractical for me to do so because I'm at that point in my curriculum where I would just be taking a bunch of unnecessary courses and my course path would be so messed up just by delaying. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel in my degree right now. Literally, most of my courses are electives just so I can meet the credits threshold for scholarships. 

Now, at this point if you read all that, you may be wondering why I'm even considering staying in the first place. I did list a bunch of cons to staying and it does sound like an easy decision to make. But, like I said, even with COVID, this is still probably going to be the best I'll ever get with my career. I'm working at a pretty big company that does things that I'm interested in. What my boss told me is that the company is no longer hiring externally for now since the job market is kinda rocky right now. There are exceptions. He said that if I want to be hired after graduation, they would have to go through the normal hiring process and then get approval from upper management. So, assuming they're still in the state of not hiring externally next year, my best chance to get hired back would be to maintain contact with the employees there (which I do have) and just use my connections to get in. I like to bet that by next year the economy will get better and this company will start hiring externally again, but it's still just a bet. 

And that's my situation. The only reason I'm making this is so I can get some thoughts on what you would do in this situation. The plan for me is still to go back home, graduate, and go back to work there next year. But I want to make sure that I'm not making a stupid decision and I'm just holding onto to a thread that, in the end, is not worth hanging onto. I'm just not sure on what the job market will be like next year. I would feel really bad if I graduate next year and things don't get better and I end up in a position where I can't get hired.",25Jun2020,1

786,"Some background information: I am a 31 Year old woman and my partner is a 28 yr old man. We are not married, and we ended up pregnant very early on in our relationship. We’re still together two years later with a beautiful 14 month old. My Partner is an amazing father while also working on finishing his bachelor’s this year. As a result, I take on a lot of extra cooking, cleaning, laundry, baby care, which I’m more than happy to do. 

Our issue is that sometimes we argue. I know this is healthy and normal in a relationship, but sometimes my fight or flight kicks in and I get a little more heated (never screaming, just definitely more intense than talking calmly and unemotionally about things). When I brought up my desire to have some sort of forward movement in our relationship (marriage/more kids), he said our relationship was in shambles and he could not consider those things with me at this time. For the most part, we have a lot of fun together and we’ve had a lot of quality time since COVID started. I moved intercontinentally with our baby to be with him which I thought would make everything a lot easier for us after being long distance for my entire pregnancy.  I consider myself tertiary at best in my hierarchy of responsibilities, but I do still get time to myself for painting which is my hobby, so I’m not neglecting myself constantly or anything. I had PPD for a few months after our son was born, but I’m doing well now. The completion of his undergrad and caring for our baby have been my priorities pretty much since I found out I was pregnant. I’m just not sure why he thinks our relationship is failing so hard just because sometimes our arguments get heated? Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any time I suggest maybe taking a step backwards to reassess, he refuses. I’m getting desperate for answers...I love him and he’s the first person I ever saw myself with in this capacity. 

Also, I know this is just one perspective from a partnership that includes two individual opinions on this matter, so I am trying to remain as factual as possible. This post is coming from a place of confusion and hurt, but I’m super not afraid of talking about my faults so please ask for clarification if it’s needed. Please tell me if you think I’m being unreasonable as well. Thank you for reading.",25Jun2020,1
787,"(18M, gay.)

So I have my suspicions that my friends know that I'm gay. Or at least they suspect it, idrk. See I want to tell them (I have no problem with them knowing, family is a different story LOL), but the issue is that I kinda used to engage in bromantic behavior with some of them and people that they know. You can call me crazy but displaying homosexuality is kind of a joke within my friend group (like touching other guys' thighs, weird locker room actions, etc.) and like I want to say that I was just going along with the joke but a) they wouldn't believe me and b) I don't believe me. (Idk years ago I would get pretty hopeful thinking they one of them was gay too so I sorta did that stuff for jokes yes but also because I was kinda aroused by it too).

I truly wish I hadn't done those things, but since I have I'm pretty ashamed by it and I feel that they're gonna be creeped out by what I did. To contextualize I'm on an all boys hockey team and I feel like the rest of the guys on my team would think similarly. 

Reddit, pls tell me what to do. Idk if I'm ready to come out to my friends (let alone my immediate family), but I feel like the time is going to come sooner or later and when it does they're going to feel disgusted by what I've done. I'm not at all ashamed by my homosexuality but I am by the actions that I've done because of it and ig I'm asking you all where I should go from here. Thanks.

792,"TL;DR I find it hard to motivate myself to call my father back in Russia as I am inevitably faced with condescention and unsolicited advise

My core family moved from Russia when I was a kid, calling my father on skype was a weekly routine for years. I always thought it was a responsible thing to do. Synopsis: I'm his only child, he is from a very academic family, but never went to university as he had to work multiple jobs in order to save his family from poverty, reads a lot and has a good knowledge of history. He has traveled in europe as an adult. Due to his injuries is currently long out of employment, lived with his mom all his life, alcoholic and chain smoker.

When we talk it boils down to the fact that he's pretty much just glad to look at me, which is sweet, however I am used to having rich dialogue with people and I really enjoy it, all of my relationships are based on mutual listening and offering perspectives etc According to him, he already knows everything i have to share, and it can be summarised as - of course you are a 20 years old girl who wants to start a revolution, of course you are interested in all that yoga and all that crap, and of course you will become a conservative in your 40s. Repeatedly calling me a child and saying phrases that would cater to a 13 year old. To which I often reply, look I'm fully aware that i am a child and my views will change, but why bring attention to it when I'm trying to have a conversation? 
Btw the conversation often comes down to my futile attempts to combat his mild racism and homophobia but that's a whole other story

Of course, this entire argument is old as time, and my frustration when being boxed into the category of my age is gender is probably indicative of my immaturity.

But I live alone, cook for myself, have a job and studying for a better one, I'm really out of touch of anyone trying to raise me me anymore. I understand that he is my father and he would find me doubting his role insulting, regardless of the fact that he had very little impact on my life. I understand that as a relatively mature individual, I should take a higher ground and spend time with him, as he might need it more than me.

The fact stays that any of my attempts to give him an insight to my point of view are going into abyss. As a simple example,  I've been telling him about my research into keto diet, and the little gain in that I have been avoiding sugar and bread for weeks, to hear him calling me anorexic and not seeing the idea that I may try to look after my health, rather than vanity (a bit funny I know, but he was just dismissing any point of research that I've done, he eats mac and cheese like everyday)

The only time when we reach an understanding is when I talk in cliches. I've told him about an example of a political conflict, and explained my lack of ability to give him an objective point of view due to my restricted understanding of politics, and my awareness of the bias from information sources. I got a good girl and a virtual pat on the back for that. 

I wrote a couple of things down that I may voice to him, such as 'i dont think you getting drunk during our call is respectable to my time and resources' and 'i would appreciate if you show genuine interest in my life and not interrupt me' but I am aware that all this sounds like an offended shouting teenager to him.

The point that I didnt put in and I that I would try to never say it to him was 'can you understand that I can't take your parenting attempts seriously, as a parent figure is someone who offers help and stability, and acts as a role model to their kids. I can't take advice from someone who drastically gave up on their life'

But, I’ve been applying for jobs outside of my industry back at home. I don’t know if I would like the jobs that I’ve applied for (nothing is really comparable to what I do now), but I don’t think I’d absolutely hate them. 

I guess my question is - is it better to live somewhere you hate for a job you love? Or would it be better to work a job you dislike to be in a place that you love? 

Any thoughts are appreciated. TIA!",25Jun2020,1
798,"Okay so the title seems abstract but the explanation is straightforward. I'm 22, have depression, and after lots of soul searching I've realised that my whole life everything I've done has been to impress people in one way or another. I love training and am a personal trainer. I only started training so I could get a good body people would be impressed with. I play guitar. I only started because people are impressed by great guitar players. I got worked hard and good marks in school for no other reason than to impress my teachers.

I understand that these are all great things in and of themselves and their origins don't make them any less good. The issue is that now I can't find the energy or motivation to workout unless there is someone there to impress. I can't find the energy or motivation to play/practice guitar unless there is someone there to impress.

My values are externally-oriented and so my 'happiness' is at the mercy of everyone else. I want to be able to do things for me. I want impressing myself to be enough. Maybe there's no step-by-step guide to changing my values, but I don't even know where to begin...",25Jun2020,1

800,"Hello,

I started at my job about a year and a half ago. I was part of a new team of 3 people who were all hired to do the same role. One of my co-workers was lovely, but the the other one could be a bit of a bitch. She wanted everything to be done her way, and would go in moods if it wasn't, but we didn't argue as me and my other (nice) co-worker were really too laid back to argue over petty things.

Fast forward a bit and my nice co-worker leaves. The girl she is replaced with is a lot more forceful than her and my manipulative co-worker takes an issue with her instantly. The reason she gave was that the new girl was ""lazy"", but I am sure it actually stemmed from the fact the new girl stood her ground a bit more. During this period we didn't really have a supervisor and the manipulative co-worker started dropping in to have ""chats"" with the boss. She started reporting on things the new girl was doing and portraying her in a really bad light (I know because she told me this, and I would always point out to her that actually what happened was X Y Z ... but she wouldnt hear it). She would also set the new girl up to fail by not giving her all of the information needed, and then criticizing her for not being more pro-active. For instance, she once told the new girl that there was a morning appointment she could shadow. On the morning of the appointment , she told us she was going to make a drink...but failed to mention she was going to the appointment straight after, meaning the new girl missed the appointment as she had no idea it was happening. She then claimed the new girl ""should have asked"" despite the fact that normally we would say to one another when an appointment had arrived. 

My manipulative co-worker told me recently the boss ""isnt happy"" with the new girls performance and I don't know what to do. I know I should speak to my boss, but I don't know how to approach the conversation because she hasnt asked me for my opinion on the new co-worker, and if I approach it from the perspective of ""I want to set this straight"" she may be offended that I assumed there was ever anything amiss. The other thing is, some of the things said about the new co-worker are true, she has made some mistakes but they are mistakes that my manipulative co-worker and I also make but they fly under the radar mostly because unless they have a big impact, we don't grass each other up. My boss might ask me if the criticisms of the new girl are true and Id have to say that some of them are. 

My manipulative co-worker also slacks off from work, but she makes sure she has an excuse lined up: ""I'm feeling sad because of something that happened at home"" or ""I was writing a report"" (even though nobody asked her to write that report and the work we are actually suppose to be doing is much harder). Everything she has done has been done underhand but also by the rule book. 

My employers are actually really nice and give us a lot of trust but she has spun this in her favour so that the new girl looks bad and she comes up smelling of roses.

805,"Context: I have an older coworker who is a recovering alcoholic. She got a DUI therefore has no car or license.￼￼￼ She is most of the time pretty sweet, but has some weird ideals when it comes to politics. She’s very impressionable, and will pretty much believe anything￼. But thats not the point, I guess. She pretty much relies on getting rides home from coworkers, because she doesn’t wanna/can’t pay for Lyft or Uber￼. 

Lately, hers and my shifts have both been going into the late evenings, and she has been getting off around 10pm, and I have been getting off around 11pm. We work at a grocery store, so she just does her shopping in the evenings while she waits for me.￼ The problem is, she lives all the way on the opposite side of town that I do, and it puts me about 20 minutes out of my way. She also doesn’t pay any gas money, and I feel like a jerk for asking because I know she can’t comfortably afford an Uber/Lyft, so she probably can’t afford to give that much gas money anyways. The other day, a friend of hers came in right as we were closing the store (11pm, when I get off). And her and her friend chatted for almost 20 extra minutes while I waited. I was pissed, it was so inconsiderate. Then add the 20 minutes but it takes me to drive her home and get back to my place. I’ve been having some hard days at work recently, and the last thing I wanna do when I finally get off my shift is drive 20 minutes out of my way to take her home. I just feel like a jerk for saying no, because she really doesn’t have any other options. Sometimes her son will come and get her, but she pretty much relies on coworkers to give her rides home.

807,"This is going to be a long story. sorry in advance. 

Little background. I have known my roommate for 18 years. I let her move into my place back in December. Everything was going well until she mentioned she wanted a dog. I already have two large dogs. I told her it should be fine as long as the dog was small-medium sized. She one day showed me a 10 week old pit she was going to go look at. I told her to let me know how it goes. Later that night she sends me a picture of a super tiny rottweiler. I asked her who's dog is that ans she said hers. On top of that the puppy was only 3 weeks old. 

I of course was very upset. She made an impulsive decision and had no knowledge on the breed. She grew up with little dogs her whole life. My roommate is also 4'11"". I asked her simple questions such as ""You know it's illegal to sell puppies under 8 weeks old?"" her answer - no. ""Do you also know rotties can weigh between 80-130 lbs on average?"" her answer - no. ""Do you also know that without proper training they can be aggressive/ destructive dogs? - no and starts crying. 

After talking she had her boyfriend take the dog to foster for a bit because he had the time to take care of her bc my roommate works 60 hours a week. They then broke up and she took the dog back. At this point she was 7 weeks so it was doable. She promised me that she would have her house trained and that her dog would go through professional training. I said fine. 

The dog is now 13 weeks old. She is in her crate 10-16 hours a day depending on how much my roommate works that day (she has two jobs). She is not house trained. and she still have not taken her to training even though she said she was supposed to start a few weeks ago (she has all of her shots now). When my roommate is home she is so exhausted that all she does is sleep and just lets the puppy roam the house. I have had to shampoo the carpets three times now bc of how much she pisses in the house. When she does go in the house all she does is give her puppy a ""stern tone"" and says no. So the dog does not understand discipline. Because there really isn't proper discipline happening with the pup. On top of that she does not go outside with the dog when she does let her out. This has caused the puppy to think it's okay to shit and piss all over the concrete in the backyard instead of the grass. She also doesn't pick it up. I had to ask her last night to finally do it otherwise we could be fined for stains on the concrete. She reluctantly did it. 

I just started going back to work and When i come home all she does is bark and cry to be let out. I don't blame her because her whole life is basically sitting in a crate. I am willing to help out here and there but she has not held her promises and this dog is making my house smell like piss because my roommate is not being a good dog owner. 

I want to sit down with my roommate and tell her either she needs to cut back her work hours (which she said she could do now but is just choosing not to) or re-home the dog. This is not fair to this sweet little dog that doesn't know any better. It is also not fair to me because she is not following through on her promises and I am left watching her dog a lot while she falls asleep on the couch.  I can't help but feel like I am being an asshole at the same time. I want to be forward but not come off mean. I am close with my roommate and she can be sensitive. She does have a lot going on in her life but her dog should be coming first. I do have two dogs but I make sure they are taken care of. They are also older so they are little more independent now.

810,"So my family runs a family business, and my dad who is the primary person managing the business because very sick for the past two years. 

I had been going to college a year when I took off to help with the business and it was so much work basically the rest of my life stopped. My dads business is a “small business” but it still has a lot of employees, customers and overhead like any other business. 


Anyways my social life and everything else basically died which was okay with me because I was helping my family and getting incredible work experience and making decent money. 

However recently my dad made an amazing recovery to where he is back to even better then he was before. He exercises now and never did before, etc. 

Anyways I’m free to go back to college now and I want to. The problem is I still want to have that “college experience” I never got to have when I was younger. (When I was 18 I also didn’t start right away and helped my dad instead) 

I want to join a fraternity I’ve always spent a lot of time with and go to parties , tailgates, meet girls, etc and all that college stuff a regular 18yr old would get to do just coming into college. 

But I’m worried I’ll be too old or seen as a weirdo for pursuing that stuff instead of just going to the bar like every other 25yr old. 

Will I be seen that way? Or do I have nothing to worry about? 

Also a side note: I also wanted to learn to fight and become really strong. I heard it’s difficult to get good at fighting unless you start at age 18 at the latest. Is that true also?

813,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

When I was younger (around 8 years old) my mom worked all day, while my abusive half brother (he was around 14-15 at the time) watched us. He was awful to me when I was a kid, beat me up, picked on me, locked me out of the house for laughs, and forced me to run around naked at times.

All this stuff I didn’t see it as wrong or abusive (as most dumb 8 year olds would), I just thought he was picking on me and being mean. He was always pretty awful to me when he watched my twin brother and I.

One day when he was babysitting us, we were alone in my room, he started messing with me which I thought was the usual. But then he started to kiss me, and everything immediately felt off. He told me it was just a game, and started putting his hands in my pants and grabbing me. Even as a kid I remember this making me extremely uncomfortable, and I never told anyone about it afterwards because I just felt weird about it after, and as time went by I eventually began to feel shame.

I had to live with him for years after this, he stole from me, bullied me, and was overall a garbage person, obviously.

When I was 16 I broke down one day to a close friend, and just spilled everything. I don’t exactly know where it came from but it felt nice to hear that I shouldn’t be ashamed and embarrassed about something I didn’t want at all.
My friend recommended that I talked to my mom about it, and I thought she was right. I wanted him gone and I was sick of having to keep my mouth shut for his sake, so I told my mom.
I thought she was gonna storm into his room and demand that he’d leave (he was 21-22 when this happened, still living with us) but she didn’t. She just kinda stared blankly at me and kinda just told me she didn’t know what to do while I sat there sobbing with my heart on my sleeve. It crushed me, I just wanted my mom to stand up for me and she completely failed to. I felt like a worthless joke to my mom, this was incredibly frustrating to me.

After awhile he finally moved out, but my mom kept in regular contact with him and her attitude towards him didn’t change at all. She didn’t press him for the truth, he just told her that he doesn’t remember such a thing ever happening, lol. But I had to go into gruesome detail about what he did to me to not only my family, but CPS and a detective who didn’t care about my 8+ year old sexual assault allegation.

I have no motivation for my jobs, my school work, or even taking care of myself. I was mocked by my grandmother for talking about moving out and completing my degree in the state he’s in. She thinks I have to stay home and take care of my dad (cooking, cleaning, basically housewife work even though I’m his daughter).

820,"First of all, I'd like to say that my friend is mentally ill, goes to therapy and takes her pills. It's not like she isn't doing anything to help her condition. She seeks help and I do believe she isn't to be blamed for all she did as it's probably influenced by the way she is. She herself thinks she's a terrible person and doesn't really see her broken mind as an excuse.

Before I get to the bottom of the actual issue, you'll need a bit of backstory. I consider 'Lisa' my best friend. I met her few years ago, we went to class together for a while.  Then I realized I was bisexual, crushed on her and dated for few months before we broke up. She broke up with me, but I was relieved as I didn't love her anymore at that point. I am completely over the relationship and pretty sure she is, too. But we did stay friends afterwards. 
During the relationship, she cheated on me with her ex, with whom she got back together soon after we broke up. They're together even now. My ex did apologize, but her current gf pretends it didn't happen and doesn't really like me. We used to be friends, but after dating my friend, she probably became worried her gf will cheat on her with me or something. She pretends to be my friend in front of me but talks shit behind my back. My friend isn't comfortable and tries to stop her when she does, but she won't stop.

The thing is, I tolerated it for a good year. But this spring, it changed. My confidence sank low because of her shitting on me and me not being able to get back at her, so I just stopped tolerating it and decided to  pay her back a bit. I started talking shit about her too, but only to my friends. That lasted for about a month before I eventually realized it was shitty and that I'd be better to stop.

 I also told my friend about it, and she got really mad at her, to the point where she wanted to break up with her. There was a lot more to it as the relationship was often toxic and nobody really likes the gf because she's shitty to almost everyone. There are valid reasons why she's like that, but I don't plan to go into specifics with it. The important thing is that she wanted to break up with her once she sees her in person. But this all happened during quarantine so she couldn't go and see her for at least a month. Afterwards she avoided her on purpouse.

In that time, she made a tinder account, did a lot of shit there and basically cheated on her gf. She also.later went to my house and wanted to sleep with me because she was extremely horny afrer being locked up for so long and I happened to be the first person to see her. I refused her multiple times before eventually giving in. I couldn't even get to her private parts and only sucked her tits before saying I wont go any further. I feel conflicted about it, because I now think me and her gf are even, but it's also shitty and I'm aware it's not the most moral course of action.

She also sent her gfs nudes to someone, basically selling them for free alcohol. I think this was by far the worst thing she's done.

This all would be fine, had it not been for the fact that she was oficially still with her gf. I told her multiple times that I think she should break up before doing the things she's done, but she was too scared. 

Eventually, she decided she doesn't want to break up. She told the gf almost everything and somehow they're still together. She has not told her about us sleeping together, though. I do think that she'd tell her if it wouldn't harm me. She didn't want to drag any friends into it, so nothing was said about the nudes either.

At first, when she wasn't sure if they're going to stay together, she told me that I can tell her gf about us sleeping together if I want, but that she herself won't say it for my own protenction. I thought that was valid.

But then her gf stayed with her, and her opinion changed. She doesn't want to me to tell her. I don't plan to do so, at least not for now and I don't think I ever will.

So, in conclusion, I don't think she's a good person. I told her. I said that I think what she's done is shitty, she know so it's not like it's a secret. The problem is, I am becoming more and more toxic as I lost almost more of my trust in her after this. I am negative more and more often, it's worse than it's ever been. I am not a trusting person, she was the only person I really trusted enough to tell her my secrets and all that. I don't want to tell her any more, as the idea of her spreading them makes me uncomfortabe.

At one point, I even considered taking a break from the friendship, or ending it alltogether. In the end, I decided I just won't tell her as much as I used to. I don't really want to cut her off as she's still a great friend despite me portraying her in a terrible light here. She was my first love, taught me a lot of things, helped me a lot woth my own issues and I do care about her, too. And like I said in the beggining, she has a lot of issues and I don't think she should be held accountable for all she has done. For some of it, yes. But not everything.

The thing is, I have no idea what to do. I told her that if i get too toxic, she can tell me and I will see what can be done. I don't think I will ever feel the same about her, not that I want to. I just want to stop bashing her so often, I feel like it's bad.",25Jun2020,1
821,"My friend has really overprotective (if you can even call it that) parents. She isn't allowed on Google or to download apps and her parents can track her because of an app on her phone. (She's almost 14, gets good grades, has almost perfect attendance, and is overall a nice girl) Today we met up and went on a popular nature walk. After it we were thirsty so we decided to stop at a small local shopping centre and go to one of the food shops. Apparently her dad didn't want her to go there and got pretty mad and was saying stuff about being beaten up by kids from an area that's close to the shopping centre.. This is what they said:

Friend: ""We were waiting on a bus and decided to just get a another bus to (local shopping centre) to buy something to drink and then we'll go to OP's house.""

Her Dad: Shouldn't be in (local shopping centre), can you fight a (area) teenager and win? That's what most kids in (area) do. Get that bus as soon as possible 😡""

Friend: ""We will.""

Her Dad: ""If you had told me that I would've said no, I'm watching you just off (street name) don't wait about.""

Friend: ""We're running in to get something to drink but we will go get a bus."" 

Her Dad: ""Don't be long. Big Daddy is watching 👀👀👀""

This really freaked me out, but she kinda didn't react to it. I was joking with her about it but on the inside I was kinda freaking out. I told my mum and she was laughing saying he was just messing about but he was being dead serious.

I want to clarify that this shopping centre was in no way, shape, or form, dangerous. We were walking past people with their kids. Everybody goes there and teenagers from (area) don't go around beating people up. Sure, some of them are not the nicest, but they don't go around beating people up.

822,"This really isn't much a topic prompting advice, but more suggestion.

However, due to my height -- to which I'm starting to further loathe -- I need a specific car in order to effectively see the road, such as lines ( to be more blunt, see over the hood ) -- with my brother's car, I can only see over it provided I'm using a seat cushion to boost my overall height and bring the chair forward close to the steering wheel in order to properly see, before I could hardly see lines that I shouldn't pass while turning during my practice laps in an empty parking lot, moreso when parking, I couldn't see the lines where you're supposed to go in between.   


There's really one element that is a must have for me: automatic. It was collectively agreed that automatic is more easier to learn and I'm not at that point of confidence where I'd feel I could drive a stick shaft / manual. As for cars, I haven't seen a large variety of them, as any car I see from a distance that looks small turns out to be medium or larger, so far we've vouched for anything that's a toyota echo, however I can rarely find any for an affordable price in my area.",25Jun2020,1
823,"Alright so my Mum has been in a dog rescue for about five years now and we've always had dogs but it got to 9 dogs around 2018 I would say.
.

We have about 7 or 8 dogs that we own, I love them all but I cant stand most of them, they are all extremely loud and when they need to go to the bathroom (which is about 4 times a day) I have to take them out three at a time because they all hate each other.

My mum brought home a new one who needs a lot of surgery on their rear legs (they were smashed in by their previous owner and healed weirdly or something I don't know) and they dont listen to me, when I let them out they dont listen to me and they always try finding something to eat. We had to block up anything she can get to in the kitchen and shes eaten some of my woodworking bits, my dads glasses, etc etc. I just hate this dog so much and she only responds to my mum.
.
.

I give all the dogs attention and all that good stuff but they always bark at anything that passed by the driveway, and I mean bark, as in all 9 of them fucking screeching and it's just deafening and makes me want to cry I hate it.
.
.

I have a sister who is my mums princess, for my mum shes absolutely perfect, but she doesnt do anything around the house, I have to scream at her to wash her plate and she refuses to let the dogs out saying ""I'm eating"" or ""I'm doing something with dad"" or some other bollocks like that. When my mums home (which isn't a lot) she always tries to be mummy's baby but when mums not home she doesn't even let the dogs out, god fucking love her, so much effort. She leaves it to me and my 72 year old nan to do everything around the house while she sits in her disgusting bedroom that she cant seem to keep a little clean. Even my nan has to repeat herself to get my sister to do anything. My Dad has given up on trying to get her to do anything because he knows she will refuse to do anything, and I've screamed at her, I've nearly smashed her door in trying to get her to even let the fucking dogs out. I keep telling my mum and dad (dad more because he listens to me) that they need to start making her do shit because I'm fed up with my nan and I doing everything.

I'm sorry if the formatting doesnt work and you get a wall of text I'll try and fix it, I dont mean to make it sound like I hate everything, most of my immediate family is brilliant to me and I don't want it to seem like I hate our dogs, as I said I love them to bits it's just these things I've listed that really Simon my Cowell, you know? Anyway I just need a bit of help on how I should go around trying to change a few things. I should mention that my Mum isn't a great person to talk to as she scares me sometimes and it's just hard to talk to her because she's always had a bias sort of mindset. I should mention that the dog rescue part was my Mum's idea and the whole family was dragged into it without having a family discussion.",25Jun2020,1
824,"Earlier I was making some light conversation with my mother. 

""How's *my brother* been lately""
""Good he works a lot""
""Still working with dad?"" (Dad has his own trade business)
""Yeah and little bit with R (her husband, naming R for privacy reasons)
""Oh weird. R never tries to offer me work anymore, unless it's the one day I have stuff I need to do.""
""You have only ever declined him""
""Nah he use to make plans to get me on some work with him but it never follows thru""

Boom. I poked a nerve. This conversation isn't word for word how it went but its pretty damn close. I mustve struck a nerve because she got all personal and heated. Calling me annoying and ungrateful. Saying I ""dont know everything"" just cus I said I know he must have a lot of work than just one day. I mean I have a part time job so Im not always available but I usually have a couple days. This wasn't all that happened with her.

To give some idea on my stance, it's not a big deal that R doesnt follow thru after suggesting we get work for me on his business. But this conversation somehow turned into a dick measurement contest with her. 

I even tried explaining that it's not a big deal and she continued to get rude and personal with me. 

R is always complaining about it to me if its me and him by ourselves. I'm sure he's going to get on me about it but all Im going to say back is that if he wants to take her side when she gives me the same treatment he hates so much then he's just enabling it further and the problems for him with continue.

825,"I started my IT career in a company 2 years ago after I graduated, lately, a friend recommended me in his company and they accepted me with a +21% in salary. Obviously that's an interesting offer, but regarding to what is hapenning in the world right now, leaving a stable job with possible promotions in the coming months (as my manager said) for a brand new job in a relativly smaller company seems risky? is my thinking right? is it just my mind that doesn't want me out of my comfort zone?

826,"Before I start, I want to say that I was an ass. With the help of the people accepting me for who I am and more importantly, teaching me to be a better person, I know for myself that I am not that scum anymore. I've been making amends with the people I've wronged because that seems the best thing I can do.

There's this girl I have a huge history with. Things went sour, mostly my fault. The short version is her pleading was becoming irritating so I just told her that I wanted to have sex with her just to end her pleading. It was a move done with zero rational intended to hurt her, that's the only reason I said those things. It was stupid and dumb. Here's the detailed version.

I've been in love with this girl for the better half of my life. But life kept us apart (I went overseas and we were at opposite ends in our country). Things fell into place and we're okay but not quite, she's in a failing relationship (her words). Somehow, were're okay. But then things turned to shit. Again, my fault. We met after 2 years to try to fix things and gain closure and finally move on from the catastrophe I've trapped the both of us in. I asked her if she wanted to come to my house. She came to my house and we didn't talk about the problem. We ordered food and just caught up. She was from work and she decided to take a nap on my bed. I asked her if I can sleep beside her. I asked her if I can hug her. She said yes to those two things. So while cuddling (me big spoon and my arms on her waist) my dumbass thought that it would be a good idea to slide my one hand slowly to her ass. She felt it. She called me out, said ""no, you're getting near"", and I backed off. Went back to the waist. 

The day ended, we didn't fix things but we did catch up. But that didn't fix the problem of our entire history. She came back to my house another day. We still didn't talk it out. I initiated the conversation but she was reluctant to answer so I didn't force it. On her way home, she texted me that the reason for that is she wanted our final days to be happy. I was irritated by that at the time but tried to understand it, she was still in a relationship. 

Went for a vacation overseas, visited my family. While there, we were talking on the phone. She told me that she expected me to ""fight for her"". I don't know what it really meant but at the time, I felt like she's saying that I should take her from her boyfriend, which busted the hell out of my fuse. After that conversation, I didn't talk to her for a while.

She didn't stop pleading. So I sent those words. And I guess it was only a matter of time before those feelings became feelings of hate and anger. She blocked me from every site and basically cut me off. This was 2017.

Then I tried to fix my life, currently in progress, learned my wrongs, and acknowledged that I'm the ass. I've been desperately trying to contact her just to say sorry. I got her on the phone one time and she just yelled at me and hung up. I know I should just stop contacting her because she said no, but I'm really bothered and scared.

I'm scared because I fucked up but I learned. I tried to stop doing those scummy patterns of behavior but I can't make amends. I'm scared because I'm only a viral post away from being dismissed by society due to scummy behavior. AND I'M FUCKING PISSED THAT I CAN'T WORRY MORE ABOUT HER AND I'M HERE ASKING FOR ADVICE AND WORRYING ABOUT HOW IT'LL AFFECT ME. I want her to be okay. I want to apologize and fix my mistakes. But at the same time, I don't want my past mistakes to bite me in the ass (waist slowly going to ass part) because even now, I hate the person I used to be. 

Sorry reddit, but I'm really desperate now. I don't know what to do. I know I should just stay the fuck out of her way but I can't. Yes, I see the irony of me becoming the pleader now. But are there other ways to handle this?",25Jun2020,1

828,"Tldr;  I’m beyond broke and mentally very unstable, looking for advice on how to pay my necessities. 


Before Corona hit, I had just quit my bachelors program due to my mental health deteriorating. I’d started working in a restaurant, which had to close after just a month of me working there due to COVID. 

I never got any financial aid from the government because any job I’d had before had been a side job so I didn’t qualify for support. 

I had approx 2000 in savings, which is all gone now. My rent is very low but still I haven’t been able to pay for that, my health insurance, and food etc. I’ve been bulimic for about 2 years and it’s gotten to my head so much that it’s making me suicidal. I’ve been on a wait list for psychological help with a specialized organization but the wait is long, it’s been 8 months. 

I got a new job in a clothing store but I won’t get paid until the end of July. My landlord has been emailing me about the three months rent due, which comes down to about 1200 combined. I wasn’t able to pay my monthly health insurance either this month and have been getting letters about that. 

All of this is taking a huge toll on my mental health which is hanging on by a thread to begin with, and it’s making me nearly unable to function (cried on my way to work this morning and had to bullshit something about allergies to my manager). 

I have no money, no future, and no happiness. I don’t want to want to die, but I do. Any advice whatsoever would be appreciated. 

Should I take out a loan? It’s the only thing I can think of.

829,"Hello everyone.

Yesterday I found out that my mum (diagnosed with psychosis) has sold a brand new car (cost £10,000) to a neighbour for £150.

My mum had been coerced by her ex (now in prison)  into putting the car into her name (we later found out he was using this car to carry out criminal activity); and since being put into prison her ex has clearly specified he wants the car to go to his brother.

The neighbour was fully aware that her son (my brother) had died 4 months ago aged 10 months, so they know that she is in a vulnerable state right now but persisted in buying the car for £150. When I arrived back at the house the 'negotiation' was already underway and my mum was rambling on about her being abused in foster-care while they were just pushing her to 'SIGN THE PAPERS ALREADY, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT'.

Eventually she acquiesced and signed the papers for the car.

I understand that legally we probably don't have much of a headway here - the car was sold and that's that - but I feel like I should at least try something to 'put things right' here. The bottom line is that they knew she was mentally unwell (or at least they have seen the incessant droves of police and ambulances at our door!) and decided to take advantage anyway.",25Jun2020,1
830,"My best friend routinely hurts himself in ways I cant comprehend. He can easily be swayed by his mood and that basically controls what he does. I honestly believe he has some form of bipolar disorder or depression although as of recent he doesnt believe in mental health issues such as those(I'll get to that in a min.). He has gotten mad over video games in the past and that has sent him into a destructive state. Just yesterday he punched himself over and over again until he bruised. He's also had mania episodes before as well. In middle school my friends and I played a game where the goal was to touch the other persons torso before they could touch yours(yes we are massive geeks). One day he challenged our friend who was the best at the game. I dont know why but I could see something like bloodlust in his eyes. He wanted to win badly. He smiled the entire time and got very aggressive. He was like a deluded Joker that took pleasure in people's suffering. Eventually I walked up to him and threw his jacket on the ground causing him to explode. But it did end the madness.

 I've been his outlet for a very long time. We've always had each others backs. But about a week ago I told him I wasn't fit to do this. I told him in the most caring way possible that I couldn't be his main person to come to because I might screw up and say something wrong and I would hate myself if I triggered suicidal thoughts or actions. I recommended professional help because that's the only thing I know at this point. 

It took some convincing but I managed to get him to go to his parents and ask for help(after numerous other bad scenarios). His dad talked with him and basically told him that all this was hormones and that he doesnt have bipolar disorder. He explained to him that he can fix this with gods help. The worst part is is that he bought it.

My friend now believes that all this can be fixed with god and end of story. I'm a devout christian and I dont believe he's going to get through this without god. But, throwing modern medicine out the window is absurd. The countless nights I've spent talking to him while he's crying or the scar marks or me watching him break down before my eyes. It's like all those moments have been thrown out the window with a 30 min. talk with his dad. 

I'm mad that he doesnt see what he's doing and that all I've done is being unrecognized at this moment. I'm also scared because if help doesn't come to him soon then I dont know what I'm going to do. Any and all advice is appreciated.",25Jun2020,1

I desperately need resources and info.


Bottom line Story: 
He’s been telling me the stress is too much for him. He says I ruined his life. Everything is my fault, and I make him miserable. He says we don’t have a marriage anymore because I don’t make time for him, so he has nothing to hold onto and has already started talking to her. They haven’t gotten physical yet, but he figures it will happen, and plans to move out soon. He has already made arrangements for moving back to his home country (I’m American, he is only a resident) There will be no child support. I have no money, no property, no family, no support.


We have five children. FIVE. The two youngest are still in diapers, 21 months and 3 months old. Our toddler was recently diagnosed with a life threatening disability that requires CONSTANT 24/7 surveillance to keep her alive. I must monitor her vigilantly and give her injections throughout the day, every day, or she will die. Daycare is therefore out of the question now, so my return to work has been cancelled. I got a bachelors degree back in 2004 and am wondering if online school for a masters could possibly be achieved on top of caring for my toddler and newborn... 


I am trying to be as strong as possible, but facts are facts, I’m scared. I’m heart broken. Devestated. Terrified. But that will be something I deal with later. Right now I must find a way to give my kids a place to live, bills paid, and a way OUT of this mess! I will never shy away from hard work, but must find some way to make it happen.


Most urgent concerns:
A place to live
A source of income
Credit card debt (one card, $8k)
A vehicle - current vehicle costs $800/month for payment and insurance, but I have to have room for 5 kids, so not sure of a solution here... maybe no car for a while, but I’m upside down on the loan for now so selling would cost me money too.

838,"My kid (who is a minor) just got a job at a fast food restaurant. During the course of filling out all the new-hire paperwork, they asked for kiddo's immunization records.

Before anyone freaks out, **I am NOT a vapid anti-vaxxer**. Kiddo is fully immunized, including ""optional"" (but highly recommended) immunizations.

I understand why they might be concerned or want to know kiddo's immunization history. Food service is a very common way to transmit all sorts of illnesses, whether they're food-borne or contagious. However, I've never heard of people needing to provide immunization records in order to get a minimum-wage food service job. Also, kiddo has worked at a different, and larger, fast-food chain and they never asked for records.

I've looked it up, and it's legal for them to ask for immunization records. Uncommon, apparently, but legal. So ultimately, we will probably have to provide the records if they insist it's a condition of employment. But it doesn't sit well with me because I've literally never heard of employers requesting this info unless it was a medical field. Personal medical history is...well, it's personal, and while we have nothing to hide, I'm reluctant to give that information out. On the other hand, I'm glad they're concerned because it protects the health of employees &amp; customers.

I guess it comes down to the debate about personal privacy vs public safety. I value both points very much, so I'm not really sure how to approach this. I don't want to be stubbornly and unreasonably resistant to change, because who knows...maybe this is the beginning of public safety protocol that will be common in the future.

840,"I’m 28 years old. I work an 8-5 job, have some college education, and also run a landscape side business. But right now, I’m overwhelmed. 

My whole life I have lived for other people. I have two older brothers that have very successful lives, so I felt this constant pressure from everyone, including myself, MAINLY myself, to be successful like them. The problem was that I enjoyed messing around and making people laugh instead of caring about school work. 

As soon as I graduated I decided school sucked IMO and I decided to start working. I worked a bunch of jobs and found one that  paid over 20 an hour and I thought I was set. I stayed there for four years but the mental anguish I had there forced me into rehab twice. I drank to deal with my stress. 

I eventually left that job and worked many other jobs making not nearly the same. So I would leave them all as well. I always feel like these jobs aren’t where I will or should retire from so I’m out. 

I found that having no degree makes it difficult to find a career that pays well. I mean they’re out there, but they are not jobs that I want. I’ve worked trade jobs before, and I guess this is a bold statement because I Do not know every tradesmen but I find a lot of them to be very rude people, constantly making fun of people. Sometimes I can take it other times it just stresses me out and fills me with self doubt and anxiety( my own head space is not the greatest)

I found an office job which I really liked at first in the last two years. It was different than all of my other jobs and I excel at it. I’m prompt and efficient, but I started to notice blatant racism and homophobic jokes constantly. Fast forward to the last couple months ALL it is is racism. It’s all white people who work here, which is fine, but they are full of hate for other races. Some of them say they’re just kidding, and while maybe I thought gay jokes were funny when I was 12, I don’t find any of it funny. I find it very rude and cringeworthy.

I started a landscaping side hustle last year, and it took off and I have a lot of customers, but I worry if I quit my job I won’t have enough clientele to make what I make now, if not more.

Also I’m worried about health insurance being a factor. I need it. I found out that there are some companies that pay health insurance to part timers so I am starting to apply.

I am constantly put down at work, because I’m the youngest person. Everyone else is over 40, they gave me some dumb nickname and I just finally said stop calling me that. Now they say it even more on purpose even though they clearly see it upsets me.

I find myself disgusted by a lot of people. I have quit so many jobs because I literally just can’t stand working with some people, and talking to them about their small angry world perspectives. 

As I said, when I was younger I heard gay, or racist jokes and I laughed because everyone else was.  As I got older and wiser I developed a greater understanding of the world, I have gay, trans, friends, have been friends with any ethnicity because I don’t care about it. If people are people , and treat others nicely that is what I am attracted to.

Everyday I come to this office I hear people’s opinions on race relations, COVID, “go back to your country” remarks. And I am the only one who brings up the fact that white people weren’t the founders of this country to begin with. I’m also white. I just don’t like to hear blatant stupidity.

My family is largely to blame for a lot of the truama, so needless to say I'm not on good terms with most of them. They arent supportive and tend to make things worse when I need true help. I have the random cousin or such I can occasionally vent to, but they aren't reliable. 

I've always kept my friend circle tight and small. I'm an INFJ (for what its worth) and even losing a close friend has triggered deep mourning in the past. I'm still mourning a friend lost 2 years ago. But all my closest friends live out of state, and there are only a few. I grew up in a religious cult so the whole childhood friend gang to fall back on isn't a reality for me. 

I'm Polyamorous and have been all my life but only realized the term and community 5 years ago. 2 years ago I married my nesting partner of 5 years, and best friend of 8. After the illness hit I realized I needed to shift my goals and dreams and turned to investing more in relationships. Long story short, it ended up uncovering deep fundamental issues with my partner and we have now split. I moved out a month ago. 

A year ago I met my bf, and quickly fell for him. It was a rocky road for us both, but we felt a strong connection and kept fighting. I thought we finally made it! He helped me christen my new place and the intimacy was increasingly building. He was over last Monday and we had an amazing night together. We engaged in intimate acts I'd been wanting to and he was working up to letting me try with him. I thought it was a blissful success. 

This Monday he broke up with me, via text, out of the blue. We'd been fighting, but we always work through things and I never dreamed he was done. I'm so shocked and hurt. I love him like I've never loved anyone before. The connection is insane. I've had a lot of sex and enough lovers to decently judge, and it wasn't anything he did that made it so insanely good. It was the connection. Every touch was blissful and his presence brought me peace and safety. I didn't need to be his all or everything, I just needed to be his something.  He saw me, and understood me like nobody else ever has. We've said ""I love you"" for a few months, and both waited to say it until we were individually truly certain of how we felt. He says both that he relaized he was hurting me by not being able to give me what I need and that was his basis, and also that I am ""too much"" and ""overwhelming"". 

Personally, since I know he also has ADHD and has been overwhelmed with work I think he fired off a knee jerk repsonse to thr pressure. I've tried to talk him out of it, and told him I think its a mistake. He also has agreed to meet for closure when he gets back from his business trip in a couple weeks. I'm hoping time and distance will give perspective, but as things curreny stand he is done, and lost to me. I also know for a fact that my metamour, his nesting partner, encouraged the breakup and thinks we'll both be happier separate.  Yes, there are red flags there, everyone had a say in my relationship ending except me. I still want him back, this behavior was so atypical. 

But he is what gave me hope. I know its weak and stupid, and I *should* be okay compeltely on my own. But when everything fell apart and crumbled more and more this last year, he gave me hope to keep trying. He believed in me, so I could believe in myself. And I've worked so hard and was getting so close to finding balance. I was even starting to casually date again, even though I didn't want to, to expand my circle and have other people to hang out with and cuddle with. Now I can't even return texts yet to the people I have recently met up with. I have absolutely zero desire or interest in connecting with new people. I've even retreated from all social media, and killed my porn/exhibitionist account for 3 years with several thousand followers because I am so done. 

There is almost no way I'll be able to return to my careeer. I had just made it to the point of what begins to be seen as seniority in the field, but it is active and demanding. I had already begun to work on a degree in an entirely unrelated field prior to the illness, but school was too much on top of learning to manage a new chronic illness and I had to take a couple semesters off. My (ex) bf is super smart, almost has his PhD, and he believed in me career/school wise too, and was going to help with math and science. 

I just can't do all this shit alone and I also can't even think about trusting again. He discarded me like an old rag, and I'm still just in so much shock. It's only been a month since I moved out, and now I'm locked in a lease for a year. Many would argue I needed to move out for myself, but my primary goal has always been keeping myself alive. And leaving a toxic, but safe, partner and home in these times, with no job prospects, and no social life or support network is terrifying.  

I have some great doctors (who also have no real answers or help for me....they tell me to do all the things I did religiously prior to getting sick.....) I see my mental health therapist weekly. I try to use my tools and coping resources. My medical team says I try harder and make faster progress in a couple months than a lot of people do in a year. I really don't know what more I can do, or how much more mindful I can be, or how much more carefully I can try to speak to and relate to those around me from a place of love and truth. 

But if this is all life is? I'm fucking done. Everytime I think if I just try hard enough things will get better. Everyone says I'm a ""good person with good energy"" and have ""so much inner strength"" but I'm also ""too much"" and have lost every single person I've ever cared about, from parents to grandparents to friends to lovers.  So I'm the problem right? What do you do when you've given it your all and people ""love you"" as a person (really, I don't know why but everyone likes me) yet you still are always alone and miserable. I'm tired of this stupid game. I'm tired. I'm so tired. What can I possibly have to look forward to? I can't trust anyone, ultimately, and all there is is pain. 

Everyone else has given up on me. Why can't I be allowed to give up on myself? Is there any way forward? Is there any hope at all? Because I've given up.",25Jun2020,1
846,"Hi everyone, I’m currently 17 but have aspirations to move to LA sometime in the future. I know that LA is an expensive place to live in but so is London, if not more. I am working towards building a few businesses and in an ideal world I’d love to be living there at 23. 

I have an American passport as I was born in Boston MA and lived there for a couple years before moving to London with family. I’m just curious if anyone has any advice on moving to the states, especially California, and how much it differs from London in terms of taxes, healthcare, govt policies etc. 

And if anyone has lived in both of these places, what is the one thing you wish you knew before moving?

I'm 21 living in UK and work at a very small company as a web developer for 2 years, 1 year was apprenticeship and the rest is full-time.

I never really cared that much about money as long as I'm doing what I like and having enough for my needs, but a lot has happened in the past 4 months.

I'm very certain that I'm being underpaid and the amount of work I do and the results I produce worth more than the average salary but I'm getting the minimum wage... idk but I think if my boss was able to legally pay me less he would. :l (I can go in detail what makes me believe this but this would make this post too long)

For the past 3 weeks I've been considering my options and I came up with a plan: I will quit my current job, take a 2-3 month break while still searching for jobs and working on my portfolio, learn technologies which are currently demanded in the market and look into freelance.

I'm financially capable to go 7 months without a job and just want to do what's best for me and my situation. But with the virus and economical stuff that's going on, I don't want to shoot myself in the leg by quitting and making it worse for myself.

I've been applying to similar jobs for 2 weeks just to see how it'll go but no answers so far (only a couple agencies contacted me).

849,"Hey guys! I'm a first time reddit-or? looking for some advice lol.

My 2 high-school best friends 'haley' and 'mark' (21F and 21M) moved into the same university I study in Cali and have been there for around 3 years now. Both of them were already close before they started dating so it wasn't much of a shock when they had confirmed their relationship to all of us. Truthfully, even though we had our friends from different courses we still we hung out a lot and would have cooking nights on most days lol.

Fast forward to the present, where both of them have been dating for 2 years and suddenly decided to call it quits. The break up ended up being pretty nasty and now they're no longer in contact. Both told me that they no longer saw eye to eye and were having a lot of problems that wasn't being resolved because of their lack of communication. 

Mark ended up moving out of the apartment they shared and moved into his close friend's from uni, and Haley asked me to move into the spare room (it was initially a study room). I said yes because I figured it would cut down on my rent a lot (it has lol). The problem is it somewhat strained my relationship with Mark because he saw it as a sign of 'taking sides.' I understood where he was coming from but had never thought of it that way and assured him that it wasn't the case. He then said that I stopped hanging out with him because I was siding with Haley and that i no longer cared about my friendship with him. Their breakup is still very fresh and now that I live with Haley I've seen how depressed she's become so I admit that I have spent more time with her to cheer her up. But I felt bad that Mark thought that I no longer cared so I ended the conversation with the promise that I'll meet up with him soon.

Haley overheard the conversation I had on the phone with him and has been giving me the cold shoulder lately. Tbh both of their reactions have made me anxious and I kind of tiptoe around any topics that include either of them in. I'm not too sure what would make both of them happy and would love to get some advice from y'all.

I am 30 f, living with family right now and it's an awful situation that I have found myself stuck in. I lost my job in march and have been on unemployment since. I have paid a significant portion of my credit card debt off. I still have 2500 left and 20k in student loans that are on forbearance. I have a car I owe 10k on. I have almost 3k in savings.

The last job I had which I lost due to covid I was making 18 an hour, due to the commute and debt I wasnt saving much but quarantine and unemployment actually has had that one positive.

No one ever actually gets anything done, except for me, and like one other person. There's this one kid, who keeps laughing at me when ever I actually try to contribute to what we're doing. Like do these people care at all? People in my middle school honors class were better communicators than these people, maybe their just shy, but it sure as hell doesn't seem like it. I also hate how the teachers aren't willing to actually take things seriously, and talk about serious things as if we are children. I have lowered my expectations of my classmates, when I went there during the summer, people seemed nice. I have a feeling that I will be an outsider, to all of the people who have been at the school for a long time. Their education is good, and I have read their source material and consider it through enough. Yet from just these zoom meeting, i do not like how challenging I find these teachers to be.

860,"In feb and March, I had my final year exams (for school). These marks are important for getting into my desired university. I had struggled with maths quite a bit in the past 2 years and had developed a sort of anxiety towards the subject. Well, come my final year I had done well in a few maths tests but most of them I had done poorly in, even after working extremely hard. For my finals, I literally put my everything into my preparation and i came to a point where I felt I know I can do well but still had a lot of anxiety. My past performances kept coming back in my head and I was scared and thought what if I still did poorly. My parents and teachers were amazing and never put pressure on me. But.. nevertheless I didn’t do well. Yes, there was an improvement but nothing near to what I felt I deserved for the amount of work I put in. I came home and for the first day I couldn’t properly think what had happened as I was so exhausted from my preparation. The next day I broke down. I cried for hours. I was so upset at myself. It’s been a bit over 3 months and this has put my confidence even further down and has increased my anxiety towards the subject and my future as I feel like I can miss out on my maths condition for university. I just feel like I was not good enough to do well in it and I just can’t accept that I did all that hard work for only still messing up. I can’t. I don’t know how to get over this mentality which I know is wrong and deep down I still know I can do well like I’ve done in some of my other subjects. I don’t know if this makes me dumb or stupid to worry so much about this subject but it’s really bothering me and has genuinely affected my mental well-being and my anxiety and confidence. Any suggestions are welcome.

861,"Hey guys, first time poster. So I'm gonna start this story from the beginning. Around 8 months ago, I was in a pretty bad state of mind. This was exsasterbated by my drug abuse. Long story short, my group of friends at the time ended up cutting me off, and rightfully so. I wont get into the details but they were justified.

Anyway, fast forward to a month or two ago. I start running into them in town a few times. At first, I keep my distance. Than they start being really nice to me. So, I talk to them a little when I run into them. They were nice to me first. They were able to tell I was doing a lot better, yadda yadda ya.

Then I run into one of them a few weeks back. She says she wants to chill some time, I'm like alright, bet. I hit her up, she has work, maybe after work. But it started raining so neither of us texted each other no biggie. Hit her up again few days later, she says yeah after work but then says shes to tired from working all day. This was fine. Not mad biut this.

Run into her again few days later same day. Except she was being a little weird. She looked at me like she felt bad for me and that bothered me. Gave me a super awkward hug. Next day, I'm getting food and see her, didnt say hi cause I had alot on my mind. Day after that, I hit her up to chill.

She didnt respond. I would ven said my bad for ignoring her if she responded.

Few days later I run into the whole group with some other people inwas chilling with. Forgot to apologize, that's my bad. Any ways ended up talking to this other guy afterwards, had a nice convo. He seemed to be really happy to see me again so I said we shud link sometime, he said yeah.

I did this cause a while while back he started replying to my story's and he was the first to be nice to me when I ran into them. I figured that's what he wanted. I figured that's what the girl wanted cause she literally fucking told me to hit her up.

Anyways, I hit up the guy yesterday and he never replied.

863,"Being in my mid-20s, I know in theory there’s a chance I will find someone who will want to spend the rest of their life with me, and I with them. However, I’ve always had a gut feeling that I’m going to be the spinster aunt at family holidays 20, 30, 40+ years from now. I can’t stress enough how strong this feeling is. I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship but genuinely don’t think it’ll happen for me.  Not everyone is lucky enough to meet their “soul mate”, right? 

I have dated in the past, but only one of those relationships was long term. Generally, I’m considered the single one in my social circle. That said, I had been dating someone for the last few months, and for the only time in my life, it felt “right.” I really thought that this particular person was the one I was meant to be with as we had an incredible amount of things in common and I felt we were extremely compatible. I thought he felt the same but it turned out to be a fairly brief relationship as he is moving out of state and isn’t interested in a long distance relationship. Maybe things would have been different if he didn’t have plans to move. I’m absolutely devastated, but relationship ending also reinforced the idea in the back of my mind that marriage just isn’t in the cards for me. 

When you’re young, you assume everyone has the same general life formula: grow up, get a job, meet someone, get married. On some level, I’m ok with being alone, but deep down, of course I would want to be in a loving relationship if given the option. (With someone who I genuinely love and want to be with...not someone I’ve settled on, as some people have suggested I do in the past.) 

I guess what I’m wondering is...how do I deal with the very strong feeling that I may never find a partner? How do I come to terms with the fact that while almost every single friend is in a relationship/engaged/married, it might not be the case for me?

870,"I apologize if this isn't the correct place for this. I'll try to keep this short. This girl who has told me before that she ""loved"" me blocked me on social media at the beginning of the year. We never dated so it wasn't technically a ""breakup"". But I know we shared some type of bond. Well, we didn't talk for about a month until February when I called her and she told me she was dealing with depression, suicidal thoughts, and was diagnosed with manic depression. She said she pushed everyone away. 

So, I decided I'd try to help her feel better. I would text her every 2-3 days just something stupid/funny and almost never got responses as I expected. But in the rare even she would respond to me she gave me caring actually written out responses, not just one-liners. I did that throughout the month of March and stopped on April 8. I hadn't heard from her in like 3 weeks at that point and felt uncomfortable sending the messages so I stopped. Then, randomly in the beginning of May, she texted me out of the blue. After like 6 weeks of silence from her. Said she was just checking up on me which was really coincidentally because just mere hours before I shared a photo on Facebook about moving on. Which, she still had me blocked on Facebook at that point but I had my Facebook on public then. So, she either had alt-account or was purely coincidental. 

Well, I kind of was cold to her when she messaged me. And told her it wasn't best that we talk. Because I was just beginning to get over her before she messaged me. Well, I couldn't last and messaged her. On May 12th, I had a heart to heart with her, told her I still loved her and that I missed her. Asked how she felt towards me. She told me about how things were going in her life and said this, her exact words were ""I care about you more than you'll ever know. I just hate showing how I feel it scares me."" 

Well, I honestly still felt the same about the whole situation. Her words didn't really make me feel better. I just kind of felt like nothing was going to change. So, after that, I didn't message her or check her social media (which I had a real problem doing) for two weeks. And a couple of days before her birthday I got weak and noticed that on my main account she unblocked me. She unblocked me at some point after we had that talk about our feelings. I waited to add her. I texted her a happy birthday to which she responded with ""thank you  ❤️   ❤️   ❤️  "". Two days later I decided to add her on Facebook to which she accepted the friend request really fast. I snooped through it and saw that literally the day after we talked about how we felt she uploaded a selfie saying ""best day I had in a long time"". Again, maybe coincidental but I feel like that was about because of our talk.

I thought maybe things were getting better but I was wrong. So, the day after I added her on Facebook I texted her just asking how she was doing. No response. The next day I shared a photo of a band that I like literally NO CONNECTION to her or anything and a couple of hours later BLOCKED again. No explanation. No reason. Why would she do this? Is it because she feels guilty? Does she just dislike me that much?  I feel like this is an exact repeat from when I first got blocked. The situation feels very similar.

The reason why: 

My mother gets angry easily and will hit people when she's mad. She says my life ""isn't hard enough"". She used to hit me every day when I was in second grade cause I got in trouble on the bus but I got bullied on the bus and that kinda traumatized me. I only have a computer because of school work and stuff she took my phone because she said I don't read enough. She really wants me to go to college and I don't know if I want to go yet and I get a lot of pressure to do good in school.

882,"To begin with, honestly, I have a few not so great spots on my academic history. While I was in high school, I went from super motivated to hitting a rough patch and I failed a few classes that I was taking at my local community college. After graduating high school, I didn’t attend college for a while, until last year when I decided to go back, and retook some of the classes I had previously failed, doing pretty well overall. After one year back in school, I enlisted in the Army, and now that I’m settled at my duty station, I wanted to get school started back up. I’ve done one semester of classes at Columbia Southern University, which is nationally accredited, but not regionally accredited. 

My goal after the 3.5 years I have left in the Army, is to get out with my bachelors in Psychology completed (I am a few shy of 60 credits right now, so this is very doable taking classes online part time while still enlisted), and then do a master’s then PhD in psychology. I don’t want to spend anymore time on my current program if I won’t have any luck getting into masters and PhD programs with it. But I also need a program that is moderately flexible as active duty means sometimes having to do all my assignments early because I’ll be in the field and away from a computer for a week or two at a time.

But I still get the feeling that my current feeling of love isn't the same feeling I felt all those years ago, and that concerns me to a degree.

So my question is, is it ok to marry someone you know you love, even if the love you feel wasnt as intense as you've felt before? I'm getting older and would like to start a family soon, I just want to know if this is a normal feeling people deal with as they get older. I really dont feel like I could find a more compatible and caring person than who I'm with right now, I just wanna make sure I make this decision for the right reasons.

He was house bound the same as me but has recently started back to work. He has to be distanced from other people and in a small cubicle.

My grandmother was letting people into our house before the lockdown restrictions were loosen and she even sat beside my uncle in his car.

So when my boyfriend heard that he kissed me before he started back at work and when he was back at work that is when the restriction of no house visits was allowed. So he came in and we kissed. We have everytime he comes up.

There is little to no way for me to get him sick as I am house bound with the exception of shopping but keeping my distance.I told my boyfriend in order for us to be able to keep kissing each other we needed to be cautious of what we do as I am asthmatic and I can't risk getting infected.

890,"My wife I moved about 8 hours from our hometown when I got out of college 5 years ago for work. A few months after I left my parents got divorced and my mom immediately moved in with another guy. That relationship didn’t work and now she is going to marry a different guy this summer. Our relationship hasn’t been great since the divorce but it’s slowly improving over time. 

My wife is currently pregnant and just hit 20 weeks. We just found out and announced that we are having a baby boy. We are very excited for our little one to be here this fall but are currently frustrated with my mom. When we first announced the pregnancy she took our announcement picture and posted it on Facebook and tagged her fiancé. All of the congratulations went to my mom and this guy who I’ve only met twice and my wife has only met once. We then had a talk that my kid isn’t going to call this guy grandpa as they aren’t actually related. ( Both my wife and I had grandparents remarry and we never called the new spouse grandpa/grandma) She was upset but agreed. 

Now we announced the gender and sent family members a video of my wife with the announcement. For friends we just posted a picture on Facebook. My mother took both the picture and video and posted them on her Facebook and again tagged the fiancé and not us. I sent her a text that the video was never meant to be put on Facebook and if she was going to take our picture/video she should at least tag us in them. She took down the video and just posted the picture with no one tagged. I figured she’d call at some point and we’d talk about it all. Instead I got a phone call from my dad asking what is happening. My mom complained to my dad about everything. She again complained we won’t let the baby call her fiancé grandpa and that we are punishing her for the divorce. 

My relationship with my mom isn’t great but I’m not punishing her for breaking up with my dad. Their marriage wasn’t great the last few years. The same would apply for my dad if he got remarried as well. I’m probably being petty about getting tagged in a Facebook post but it would be nice for people to say congratulations to my wife and I and not my mom for becoming a grandma.

900,"Well, I never thought I’d end up making a post like this but here it goes. I met these friends around 2-3 years ago via a mutual friend (just before junior year), it was good timing in general and everything back then was great. Over the next year I was invited to many parties and gatherings and got to know a few of them (as it was a large group) really well and became close to them. At the same time I ended up meeting a girl who was also within their group, all of them went to the same high school but I went to a different one, that’s how I didn’t know them before. I ended up getting into a relationship with this girl quite spontaneously even though she had strict parents. I won’t get into specifics but the first time we were together was just her always putting off seeing me or making some excuse.

At this point in time (summer before senior year), a couple of the “respected” or “popular ones ended up disliking me having broken up with said girl. After summer, during senior year I ended up getting close to all of them again and our final year was actually pretty good. Fast forward to the summer before college I ended up getting back with the same girl (worst mistake ever) but it again ended badly. Now one thing I’ve always noticed about this group is how harsh they can be at times, as in, they genuinely enjoy making people upset and just targeting them. I always let it slide before, thinking that this is the best group I can have. But I slowly realised last summer and then during break that it’s actually always me that gets targeted and is made to be the laughing stock of the group. Having spoken up about it, I kind of got shut down and now have distanced myself from all of them.

Another thing that I noticed was how there was almost no loyalty from their part when it came to my ex, as in, during college whenever I was on one of their snapchat stories, she’d reply on purpose, but not once would they tell her to stop or to just move on, yet when it was early senior year (before I got back with her), they would always be quick to pick up on me “not being over her” back then based on minute things, yet they never once told her the same.

Concerning their desire to annoy and upset people, it has also happened over quarantine on Xbox, and back in April I stood up for myself finally only to be made to blame etc. 

Fast forward to now, the reason I’m making this post is because I saw all of them at a small gathering a few nights ago (on their sc stories), and it hit me, I really have lost all of my friends. So I guess what I’m asking is, what do I do now? I’m 19 soon so I guess I’m relatively young. Was I right to cut them off? How do I make new friends when I do go back to college with similar interests ? one of the guys from the group ended up going to the same one as me which is why I stuck to him). A good thing is right now I have a job and am making good money, I do miss the gym a lot and can’t wait to move back and almost restart life and work on myself a lot, but I just feel lost at the same time.

- live with 2 girls from school (we are all about 22)
- one girl leaves for home during covid, 2 weeks later says she won’t be paying utilities and tries to get out of rent (independently contracted with the homeowner so not my problem)
- roommate and I are upset, I suggest getting a mediator involved, roommate wants legal action and to “teach her a lesson”
- mediation is unsuccessful, so I let roommate know I’m moving out in a month and want to shut utilities off/don’t want to pay for two places at once
- roommate is fine with that, she has her own AC unit for her room, so utilities will be minimal at that point
- Following month i start moving out and she flips, she didnt think I was serious
- I find out shes been running both air conditioning units for over a week while she was on vacation, she now expects the bill to be $200 and wants me to pay
- after harassment and being berated I finally just say “I’m wrong. I’m sorry. I’ll pay it.” 
- harassment doesn’t stop. Continues to get worse despite me no longer responding
- Im grieving my mother’s 1 year death anniversary (a suicide). roommate and I talked about it in depth when we were on good terms, and she knows I still feel guilty and like I’m the reason my mom killed herself
- roommate also knows about a recent sexual assault and a court case where I was fired for protecting a student from sexual harassment
- roommate and her BF begin to message me that everything in my life was caused by myself, I’m to blame for everything, including the other girl who decided not to pay utilities

This whole thing has put me on suicide watch and my friends who are from all over the world have been flooding me with support, but I’m still here physically alone.

The back of his car was very damaged;  my front has some scratches and dings. I freaked out; I've never experienced panic like that before.

Luckily no one was hurt, though his daughter was shaken up. He wasn't overly mad, especially after seeing how distraught I was. The police came and we exchanged info and everything and everyone left safely. Luckily we have the same insurance company so it shouldn't be too complicated. We reported it to the insurance and it's getting settled now.

No one got hurt and we both have insurance. Yeah, my rates will probably go up, but that's probably it. No tickets or anything. I've always been a super good driver, but now I don't want to drive anymore. I don't know if it was because it's my first accident, or it's my fault, or what. I just can't stop thinking about it. I know I'm way overreacting and that it's not rational to be so upset, but I can't help it. 

How to I deal with it?",25Jun2020,1
912," For the past two years I was in a language school and because I'm living away from my family, I had to cook and prepare food on my own. As a student, I manage to properly use my time to study and take care of myself. All those time I managed to keep my weight in check (average is +-70kg). Plus I also have more confident in my body because that's like the ideal weight if you count my height(180cm).

 Then everything changed when ~the firenation attack~ I graduated on February, comes home and the lockdown happen💔. I started to eat all I want, anytime, anywhere cause I've got nothing better to do and not to mention that at home, there's always food to eat also I'd almost never skipped a meal, not like my student life before. Later I realized my weight had increased like a lot. Last April it was 86kg which is already shocking but just now I checked, I'd pass the red line I set for myself, 91kg!!!

 The thing is, around September, I have to further my study overseas and I'd already bought all the clothing, suits, pants, you name it and it worries me that all those clothing had becoming too tight to wear now😥

 To avoid the unimaginable, I started doing jumping ropes 20min a day, 5 times a week, have an early dinner(preferably 4 hour before sleep), and try to have a  healthy sleep schedule. One thing that's hard to avoid is the meal. Since I'm not in control of our breakfas-lunch-dinner, I could only try to lessen my intake which imo is worrying cause without proper diet, all those physical exercise will not help me as I imagined. 

 Anyway I've got a couple of months before september and I'll try to do whatever it takes to slim down as much as I could. Do advise me however you could. I'll greatly appreciate it. 


TL;dr Before all this corona and lockdown happening, around February this year, my weight is 72kg. Today(26th June) I checked it'd became 91kg😵",25Jun2020,1
913,"okay so I(19f) have been living in my house with my mom, brother, and two sisters for a little over five years now (since i was 14). I’ll skip some things because they aren’t relevant. 

With my siblings and I all being close in age, the dynamics of the house have changed often, my brother (the oldest) moved out for a while and i claimed his old bedroom as my own, with the permission of my mother. 

we have a one-story house and my bedroom was all the way in the back, away from everything almost like an add on, with three windows on three walls, only one attached to the rest of the house. One faces the driveway, the second one faces the back porch which is impossible to see out of, and the final one is in the backyard kinda in a corner with a little bit of space between the a/c unit and the gate. 

My neighbors are nice, we all get along on both sides. One side is an elderly couple and the other ones are a large family, i never really know just how many children they have and what ages they are, but i played soccer with their son who was a year younger than me all throughout high school. 

They had their problems like any other but the mother and father would argue like no other. The walls were thin so we could hear every word. She accused him of cheating, he claims she cheated first, a whole mess really. 

Despite all the arguing and what not, he was really nice to us when my brother moved out, he would help cut our grass and do other random acts of kindness i didn’t pay any kind, but he never spoke much to me. 

Flash forward to the beginning(ish) of my junior year of high school, I was 17 and had my first boyfriend/real relationship. My schedule was pretty consistent, school, practice, work, home etc. 

My cat completely wrecked the blinds on my window, but i still had curtains to cover them, i never paid it much attention. My mom would always get on me about having my windows open, but i would roll my eyes at her. 

One night I was in my room after a shower and i heard noises outside of my window, but it was so dark i couldn’t see anything. I told my mom and when we turned on the light and went onto the back porch, a man had ducked behind the fence near my window and ran off. 

I was completely freaked out. I would sometimes feel like i was being watched or followed but i assumed i was just being paranoid. After catching someone watching me I didn’t know what to think. 

The next day my mom and I noticed much like the path of flat grass from the cars to the porch, there was that same pattern/walkway from the walkway to my window. Being as we let our grass grow out a bit, it’s been a recurring thing. 

My mind raced for a little, i couldn’t decide which was worse: having a complete stranger watching me periodically, or having someone i know and trust watching me periodically. 

I had took my then-boyfriend’s advice to ignore it and that i was just being paranoid, it’s a coincidence etc or it’s all in my head and eventually kept living life as usual. 

I had no regard for that window, it didn’t lock so i figured there wasn’t much i could do. 

The rest of junior year and then senior year flew past with a few more incidences i kept to myself and eventually put in the back of my mind. 

I left for college and completely forgot any of it had ever happened until my older sister took my room and caught someone looking into the window at night, but she actually got a glimpse of the man. 

She said his body type is similar to the neighbor’s and then it just kinda made sense. If I’m wearing a little less clothing (like pajama shorts or whatever) he always stares a little longer than he should. There’s an opening on the side of our house where our fences would connect, it’s just a small opening, there’s also gravel on my driveway-facing window so I would hear/see if someone walking along it. 

I’m not accusing him of anything, i don’t really know him, but I’m just wondering if there’s anything i should do in this situation? Maybe get a camera or light? Motion sensor anything like that? 

It’s just the possibility that he could have been watching me when i was a minor and even now, when I’ve been naked, having sex, and just so many other things is just really weird, creepy, and disconcerting. 

TL;DR: there’s a chance my neighbor /friend’s dad next door may be the one who’s been watching me through my window/possibly following me around? How do i cope with this, what steps should i take to be safer? How do i deal with the feeling of being violated on so many levels?",25Jun2020,1
914,"Hey... I just got this message today and I'm really worried...

So my godson's mother is the daughter of my godfather. They had a really bad fight and don't talk to each other since even before the quarantine.   
Now, where I live the virus is mostly under control so stuff like zoos reopened. Since I missed my godson's birthday because it was right when everything went on lockdown and I was not allowed to visit, I wanted to take him to a really nice zoo nearby. We had to cancel it already once because my car broke so I was really excited when it was fixed.   
When I wanted to reschedule, his mom texted me saying stuff like ""I don't want to drag you into that conflict I have with (her mom and stepdad). I think it would be better if you wouldn't come. You were a really great godmother...""  
I texted her back that I am not interested in that conflict and I'm not planning to take anyone's side and I don't see why it would hinder me at spending time with my godson. As I said, they have been fighting for quite some time now and before it wasn't a problem.  
She is not texting me back and I'm really worried that I won't see my godson again.  
I really love that little guy as if he was my little brother (I was 13 when I became his godmother, I am 19 now)  
I just don't know what to do now.  
I am not sure if I can call her because I feel like crying by just thinking about it.   
I have always been someone to weep easily when I'm angry or upset and I don't want her to think that I am trying too hard (I'm not a native english speaker so I don't know how to say it better...)  
Thanks to those who answer....",25Jun2020,1
915,"First of all, I am extremely uncomfortable with any kind of physical affection so I might be overreacting. 

My mother is very physically affectionate with my younger brother. They play this game where my younger brother will roll my mother around the bed while they are both hugging. While I don't have any problem with the game, my mother tends to run her hands up and down his body a lot in this game (maybe in a motherly way but I get really irked by it) and kisses him a lot. Not in a \*smack\* type of way but in a long drawn type of way on his cheeks and neck. One day, I heard them playing before I was going to sleep and was really disturbed by the types of sounds that was coming. 

She also tends to poke his bumhole a lot as a joke. She used to do the same to me as a child but I don't think she would do it to me as much as she does to him. She also has a habit of pointing at his genitalia areas and making a joke out of it (not about his genitalia but just pointing and making funny faces). My brother has a habit of changing with the door open (because he is a baby) but is very anxious about people seeing him naked so such jokes really upset him. My mother used to make such jokes about me in the past as well, but seeing it happen to my brother really irks me.

TBH, my brother is babied a lot compared to me. My grandmom and mother still oversee his studies while I had started self-studying from 9 years old. He also sleeps with my grandmom and my mother lies down with him every day before sleeping while I have always slept alone from a young age. And my grandmom and mother are more physically affectionate with him than they are with him.  Maybe that's why such physical affection seems weird to me, 

 I have tried to ask him lightly if what our mother does to him makes him uncomfortable. He says he doesn't feel uncomfortable. Besides, I have noticed it is usually him who initiates playtime with my mom. My brother tends to tell me things he won't tell our parent, so I am assuming he has no reason to lie or hide stuff from me. 

Maybe I am overreacting?  Maybe I didn't receive that type of affection at his age so that is why it looks strange and weird to me? Still wanted to ask the internet because I wanted to be a 100% sure that my little brother is safe. 

Edit- She has never taken drugs or alcohol in her life. She however, has a very complicated relationship with my father as he is emotionally abusive.",25Jun2020,1

Even when bad things happen and i feel sadness/cries wants to come out i push it back in and change the subject in my mind so it disappears. 

I did it for so long i felt numb to the feeling of sadness and even when bad things happened i didnt feel compassion anymore, just blank and i moved on easily.

Until my dog that i had for 16+ years just died. I felt numb to it and blank for a day, but as i was driving to work yesterday. A flood of sadness and tears came rushing out. I couldnt control it and my face. It kept twitching into a sad face with tears coming out. Kind of funny thinking back of the struggle trying to keep a poker face while it was twitching to a sad face. I couldnt control it. In my head i was trying to change the subject the whole time but the crying and emotion of sadness overcame me and won.

Got to admit it, something about it felt really good to let it all out. I might start crying for every little thing that happens now.",25Jun2020,1

Before the pandemic he use to go to an autism center to work on his speech and sensory skills. Now he’s at home wondering around the house doing nothing. I feel that he’s sooo depressed no one in the house is his age there is a huge age gap between us. I try to play with him but I can’t tell if his having fun or no. I try to teach him to write or draw he refuses. I don’t know how to make him happy. He watches tv for hours thats the only thing that makes him happy.  And sometimes he doesn’t give a shit about tv too. I feel like shit he’s been like this for years. Even when he started therapy he comes home and wonder around doing absolutely nothing. What can I do to make him happy? How can I understand him more? I feel guilty because I feel that we gave up on him. Everyone is busy with his own life. I want him to be happy. I worry a lot about him and love him a lot. Went to a lot of doctors and therapist but I feel like everything they say is either book based shit or wanting to get as much money as they can from me.

922,"Hello i am new here (25 female from Romania) and would like if it is alright  more points of views on the following matter. It has been going on for some days and i can not explain to myself many things. I appreciate it and sorry for the next long post.

I came home a few days ago from work .It all started with my mother saying "" i will never lend you anything ever again''-the way she said it bothered me and angered me a bit ( i had borrowed something from the house and i said i would bring it back Monday..this was like two days after- and indeed i completely forgot.I do keep my word most of the times).She kept saying about and how she always keeps her promises and i understood she was upset, i said i was sorry and started to do stuff around the house.A friend called me and said to go out  , i told her i will go and then my mother started to make reproaches  that lately i did not stay at home,that from now on i will do my own laundry (and most of the time i do the everyone's laundry and agree with what she said) and that i should buy a separate basket, then she started using all the things i told her when i had a bad day as a motive to why  things don't go at work,that i am tired, that i should iron more cause people judge the way you look and it ended with "" i just want you well rested for work and to do stuff for yourself""..she did mention other things too. I did not go and i continued my chores. I started  to wash the laundry  i put just two pairs of shows and a backpack in the washing machine. The washing machine made a weird sound and that is when my mom just ignited in hostile rage and fury yelling"" you will pay me. i do not care if it means a new washing machine"". I understood her being upset but she was very vengeful and still is. So i called a service for the washing machine they said they will come in the morning but they came at 12 in the noon and my parents had to leave by 1:30 pm. Next day i was at work extremely stressed ,i barely worked..i was worried they would not come till they had leave and than they would be even more enraged but they came before. Apparently the electric plate had burned so basically if they find new pieces it is somewhat ok ,if not i have to buy a new one. My mom calls me to say what happend and she says at a point in  pitiful way towards me ""they (the experts) even asked how old you(me) are and if you had a job. how could you be so mindless"". The next day  after work i went to a friends house to wash what had been in the washing machine and came home at 22:30 home. My parents told me to take the water out of the washing machine (the experts were supposed to and said they would but did not) so i did so until 12 am, she mentioned to mind something and i did not touch that.after i finished ,all of a sudden my mom says my name in a spiteful manner and said again i was mindless because there was water on the floor from the thing she told me to mind.I told her i did not touch that and then ,looking as if she was going to kill me there on the spot,she  started yelling at me clenching her teeth at the same time  to shut up and than i did not here the rest. I went to my room full of anger not understanding her reaction.She was so hostile and still is,even after i just had an operation at the dentist,for a washing machine that is more than 14 years old. ..she thinks i may have over-charged the washing machine..but i am not sure what happend. i was indeed just rushing  to finish and go to sleep.

I understand she is upset..but i don't understand why she is so vengeful and for what. I do think i am stupid...and i know its my fault i did not listen or was somehow reckless...But i can not understand why she is like this and i get the feeling that washing machine is more important than me..i am not trying to be a drama queen .i just can not tell what is what after all this,what is morally ok and not in this situation. I know i fucked up and it is somewhat fair to pay for something i did wrong.I don't know why all the passive aggressiveness and vengefulness. It sucked coming home today after a medical intervention and her not giving a rats ass  but still feeling that hostility in the air. It really makes me want to leave.And why do i feel angry?I don't understand why and why she says the things she says and how she says them.And to be frank i dunno if can cover the medical intervention for next month and the new washing machine my parents will pick.

Sorry for the huge rant but i really can not understand many things and would like to know what is what and morally correct and humane in this situation.I really am starting to think i am stupid,and i know i can be reckless or just forgetful..sorry again for the huge post and i appreciate your time reading this. All the best and hoping for better times to come for everyone.

930,"For starters, I'm 17 and my brother is 25. We both live with our mom.

Since this whole COVID-19 thing and quarantine, my brother has been going out and about to the park, to his girlfriend's house, to open stores, etc. My mom has not said a single thing about this to his face. However, as soon as he leaves the house, she comes into my room and complains about how he shouldn't be going out.

In fact, I recently had to get tested because I was around someone at work who may have possibly had it. Me and my mom stayed home for 3 days and both of us had to miss out on work. We we bored and stuck at the house. Meanwhile, while both of us were stressed out about the possibility we may have had COVID, my brother continued to go out. The only thing my mom asked was if he was going to get tested, and he said he was going to wait for our results to come back. Luckily they came back negative, but he still continued going out.

I was invited to a friend's birthday party this weekend, and I am stressing out about how I'm going to tell my mom because if she says no, I know I'm going to get mad. I feel like if she's letting my brother go out whenever he wants with whomever he wants, she should let me do the same. If she's not gonna be lenient with me about going out, I feel like she should do the same with my brother. At the end of the day, we are all living under the same roof and unlike my brother, I always wear a mask when I go out in public. My brother voluntarily does not wear a mask just because he doesn't want to.

In the end of the day, I'm not begging to go to the party. I'm asking for equal treatment. If my brother was allowed to go to a graduation party, I don't see why I shouldn't be allowed to go to a friend's birthday party. If, hypothetically, I shouldn't be going to the party, I don't see why she let my brother go to a graduation party.

936,"The neighbours opposite me live in a flat. It's a dad and his 20yr old daughter. They had a puppy but the dad said they needed to get rid of him cuz the daughter wasn't meeting his needs and they didn't even have a garden. The puppy basically lived in his cage. They hadn't taken him for any injections even though he should have had them weeks ago. My nextdoor neighbour told me this and that the dad didn't want anymore than he had paid for him, which was £80. I foster dogs from Romania occasionally and had just been let down by a shelter over there, so I had room for the lil pupper and I said I'd be willing to have him, and that way, the daughter could see him whenever she wanted. It made the best out of a bad situation for her. The puppy has settled in very well with us.

Well when I went to get him, the daughter told me she wanted £150. I was surprised, but had already agreed to have him. I asked them if I could pay them £50 and the rest in installments. They said no problem. This was on June 10th. I told them that I would next be able to pay some off on June 24th, which was yesterday. I paid them £40 yesterday, as promised, along with a note acknowledging that £60 was still owing. Between the 10th and yesterday, I reminded the dad a couple of times that I was paying some on the Wednesday and he was fine. I just didn't want him thinking I'd forgotten.

I have just found out from my nextdoor neighbours that the daughter has been threatening to come over and take the ""fucking dog"" back off me because I'm not paying?! I'm upset and annoyed because I have paid when I said I would, I've been letting her come and see the dog whenever she wants and I let her take him back to her flat to see the dad, even though she has the worst attitude ever. She was pissed off cuz I changed his name (she knew my nextdoor neighbours were calling their new dog Monty [not real name] and then she called her dog the same thing). We plan on socialising our dogs and having two dogs called Monty would be confusing. Then one day when my best friend and her girlfriend came for a visit, the daughter bounced over to them and snapped ""you'd better not open that fucking gate and let *my* fucking dog out of that garden!"".

I can pay off the final £60 on July 4th, but I really feel like going and drawing £20 out now even though I can't afford it and posting it with a note saying that I know they aren't happy with the payments and I'm really sorry about that, but they agreed to it and I have been paying when I said I would, and then explaining my situation taking the boys on and how it's left me short for money. And I also feel like mentioning the daughter's shitty attitude. I feel like just ignoring her in future when she's shouting at my back gate for me to let her in.

My nextdoor neighbours have explained to the dad that I'm not scamming them and that I'm not like that, but I really feel like I need to clear the matter up myself. I don't want to drop my nextdoor neighbours in shit (even though I wouldn't say they had told me, it wouldn't be hard to work out) and I don't want to start a feud. The daughter is likely to come over and confront me, possibly try to fight me. She's that type. 

My best friend isn't answering my phone, so I've turned to Reddit for advice. Should I just act like nothing is wrong and pay them off asap, or should I post some more money now with a note explaining everything? Should I also continue to let the daughter come see my dog, even though she's been making threats and slagging me off?",25Jun2020,1

938,"Hello, I (23M) feel like I'm getting to that age where I feel ready to start looking for a lasting relationship. That includes eventually getting married. I come from a family where we don't exactly date in the normal sense (normal meaning, I guess what you'd see on TV here in the US). Now my family is from India but I was born and raised here so cultural conflicts like this were likely inevitable.

But basically, the way most of my cousins and brother got married was our parents show them pictures of girls (along with some basic information, where they are from, age, what career, etc.. basically a tinder profile lol) and if they are remotely interested they can contact them via text or something like that. Note that these girls have also agreed to be setup by their parents so it's not like I'd be texting some random girl who wasn't expecting me to message. Since some people normally assume these are ""arranged"" marriages I assure you this is not the case with my family anyways. It's perfectly okay to say no to any of the girls our parents try to set us up with. The thing is that our family likes us to marry ""our kind of people"". That's not just referring to other Indian people but specifically within our community of people (essentially people who my parents have some sort of first hand knowledge of or know someone who knows someone who knows that person and so on). My parents explain this by saying that marriage is about more than just the two people getting married but also about the two families joining so they need to make sure I marry someone who can get along with my family and who's family can get along with my family (and I suppose them being Indian is the easiest solution since they would be similar religiously (though I myself am not at all religious, but that's an entirely different problem) and culturally).

Being raised in America I'd say I'm much more American a lot of my family. My siblings are the same but they don't find anything wrong and go along with things as is and as far as I can tell I'm the only one in my family who always feels out of place. Which makes me feel like I'm always wrong, though I know I'm not. I don't have any great aspirations in life but have always wanted to fall in love with someone, have them fall in love with me, get married, have kids, and live a long life and the end :D. Though now that I'm writing this I feel as though that may, in fact, be a great aspiration on its own. Anyways all that was just background so I can get some advice on what I should do? I don't want to completely say no to my parents if they ever show me a girl since (though I'm not fond of the idea of starting relationship online with someone who may liver in a different state) that girl could be someone I can have a relationship with but I also don't want that to be my only course. I have friends who always remind me that I'm 23, an adult, who can make my own decisions and I don't HAVE to do what my parents say. And though that is true the problem isn't simply that I just ignore what they say and do what I want, the problem is that all of this, all of them have made me super confused and I'm just lost, not sure what to do, not sure what's right, not sure what to think :'(.

Lastly, as you can imagine by now I haven't ever really been in a relationship and don't have a lot of experience (well, any I guess). I'm not interested in just casually dating but want to find someone with the intend of getting married one day. I've already graduated college so I don't have the option of just talking to girls in class or anything like that. I'm currently on a job search and not sure when or where I'll find a job (thanks for that COVID, not too worried though since I did graduate with my Master's in Computer engineering so am not too worried about finding a job eventually). People say go to bars and clubs and you can find people (me? Nahhhh I don't really like clubbing and am not much of a drinker). I drink socially but that's it and just going to bars just to find girls is a bit idk forced I supposed. People say do what you like and don't make finding a girl your sole reason for doing something, which is sound advice except like....what would I do? I like playing games, watching TV, and yea don't do much. Do more? Always had a hard time finding anything else that piqued my interest. Clearly I have a lot more problems that just finding girl but any advice is appreciated thanks.

Sorry for the long post I got carried away writing down my life story. But I was trying to be as honest and transparent as possible in hopes of finding an answer to my, apparently, many problems.",25Jun2020,1
939,"So, I don't ever talk about any of this because it's extremely difficult for me and this comes from the deepest part of my soul. 
So as a child, I never had much of any male influence. My father was abusive and horrible to me physically and emotionally and someone else abused me in another way when I was seven. And because of this, the only men the were relevant to my life, I hated. So... I just pretended to be something I wasn't, a woman. I wore makeup, and grew my hair out long and was very very androgynous basically. None of it was real and if I'm being completely honest; I only did it because I thought men were evil people because all the men in my life had hurt me so horrifically so I never wanted to be one so I played a character. I lost sight of who I was in the midst of all this madness. And I started sleeping around during my teenage years. I loved it and they loved me. I loved the meaningless hookups. And I loved how nothing in my life mattered to them. Who I was, what I went through, my trauma, everything didn't matter. All that mattered was the moments I spent with them, and then I left when it was over and that was all. It's like my escape from life and I hate it... I want this to stop. It used to be really bad where I was going out almost every night. Recently I've been able to stop, but it always worms it's way back somehow and I just want this horrible ailment to be gone. I honestly have no interest in sex or being in a relationship. Sex has never been loving or a passionate thing for me. I don't think I'll ever be emotionally ready for that, not anytime soon. Sex to me is nothing more than an escape. I've progressed so much in my life recently and I'm terrified that this horrible demon will take it all away from me. If anyone has any advice or light to shed on this, please don't be shy. Thank you even if you've just read this.",25Jun2020,1
940,"So I’m just gonna keep this short and crisp. I’ve had a couple of girls that broke up with me in the past and because of this I’ve always expected them to leave me in the end after we’ve dated for quite a while, mainly because “I’m not exiting enough” “I’m too boring” and “always busy” (is what they said). When my exes would finally say that this relationship isn’t going to work I get a weird feeling like it doesn’t matter. Like real Ariana Grande “Thank you next” vibes. I’m not saying I’m a player, god no. It’s just like getting them off my back and taking a break without any emotion before starting dating again. I don’t feel bad because they left me but I can’t find the word to describe why I feel this way. For the record I’m a guy and most dudes come crawling back after a break up but not me.",25Jun2020,1
941,"Where do I even start? I’m 14F and I feel like everything keeps getting worse. First I’m sorry for this long asf rant. I just feel like a massive failure, I fail everything and every single test I do at school is failed. Yet I do really try, it just turns out I’m useless. There’s no hope anymore, nothing. 

My “friends” are fake as fuck, they make fun of my worst insecurities and they leave me out of everything. They love to make me feel shitty for their joy and entertainment. I don’t even see them out side of school. It’s pointless, they don’t care. 

My parents don’t let me explain my feelings to them because they say “we don’t want to be in this situation sorry” then they leave me to cry all on my own. They force things onto me too much when I can’t deal with it all. I feel like a failure to them because I try but they don’t realise that I’m not perfect and it’s difficult to do everything. It’s hard to make someone understand how you’re dealing with something if they don’t know exactly what it feels like to be in your situation. 

Later on I found someone I loved and I thought was going to stick by me and I trusted him all my heart but he left and that shit changed me. I felt like I couldn’t find happiness again. He was the reason I was still living at this point in time. He was in the same situation kinda he was depressed so it was good to talk to him and have him there. He’s not anymore though he’s gone.

A week later that my grandmother died, the one that cared a lot about how I was feeling. She wants to hear that I’m okay right now but I’m not. She’s the one who phoned up to find out how school was going for me and hoped I was getting on alright. The one who never missed a birthday card, always brought loads of sweets and went to the beach to brighten up my life. The one who hopes I reach all my dreams and do well. My grandmother is gone forever, I still can’t get over saying that but I hope she’s looking down on me hoping I’m doing well because even though I’m finding it tough I’m trying my best and that’s all I want her to know. 

At this point who do I have? No one. I don’t have anyone. I’m questioning my self this because I don’t have a proper answer. I’m depressed and anxious about everything. I’m done. I’m suicidal. Nothing is getting better and I have no idea what to do.",25Jun2020,1

945,"I guess my request goes a little beyond whether or not I am missing something, because of my career plans and my upbringing. 

In essence, I don't really have any business connections and my family has no background in business other than production. We came from a very poor village to the U.S. so we've spent along time just building the foundation for us to stay here. My dilemma is that while I am attending a top 10 university I'm finding it challenging to build my own foundation for the future with regards to a career. 

I have 2 years working experience from the dinning Halls 1 of which I worked as a manager, and after about a year gap (in work not studies, I've been a full time student the entire time sometimes going as far as taking double loads in coursework). I landed an Internship as a Sales Associate where many of my duties extend to marketing and in a few cases managing the other sales associates. 

I'm not too deep into my major coursework but my majors are Global Studies and Linguistics with Speech and technology emphasis, I am also working on getting a Technology Management certificate from the same university. My coursework for Global Studies is very interdisciplinary so I am taking advantage of that to study Management/organization, technology, and Marketing. My emphasis in linguistics isn't as flexible, but most of what I am currently studying or have studied correlates to what is explored there, I am using it as a back up major so to speak, so that I can develop some hard skills in a research field.

I am in place to graduate next year, but the thought of graduating into a recession is pretty unnerving for me considering my dilemma, to circumvent that a little I decided to extend my coursework a little and ""Study"" abroad for a year ( going to take electives that provide me with major credit) while doing internships in those countries. During this time I also plan to apply for graduate school although I haven't figured out the logistics for that yet (funding/programs to apply for).

After all of this, I just worry that I am overlooking something, I do not come from money by any means so all of this just feels like a gamble. I am plagued with the question of whether or not I am doing the right thing and if I really am prepared to enter a work environment that I've only really seen in movies or TV Shows. I want to know if I'm not and what I can do better.",25Jun2020,1

947,"I’m going to try to make this as short as possible, although it’s pretty complicated, but I’m happy to clarify on anything. 

Last week, I (21F) went to visit my dad and his side of the family on the west coast. I currently live in the south. I have a boyfriend (21M) in the army who is now deployed and has been for about half of our relationship (together a year, gone 6 months), but he is stationed where I’m at. His family lives in the Midwest. For privacy, I don’t want to reveal specific states, but this should help clear anything up that might get confusing about the locations. 

When I was with my dad, he offered for me to move up there and join the family business. He said he would buy me a house, although we haven’t discussed the specifics of it, so I will need to have many more conversations with him before I can solidify this decision. The family business relates to what I would like to finish my degree in, so it will be helpful for me in the future and could give me an advantage in the field. There are great schools over there and I would be happy to go to any of them, so finishing my degree there won’t be an issue. 

However, for the last year, my boyfriend and I have discussed moving to the Midwest and buying a house together. I love him very much and think he is a wonderful man, but I am conflicted for a few reasons. First, his hometown is not my hometown. My whole family is in one spot and I would like to be close to them, as many are getting older and they are important to me. My boyfriend has also expressed that he doesn’t think it would work if I left, that he doesn’t see himself moving there immediately, and that he feels like he would lose me if I go. It makes me feel like he expects me to make that sacrifice for him, but doesn’t feel like he could make it for me. It would be more difficult for him though so I understand. 

I could also go to school in the Midwest. There is a really good school that I am interested in close to his hometown and if I could go, it’d be a wonderful opportunity. 

Overall, I am just very conflicted. He gets out in December. I graduate from community college in December. I either want to go to the Midwest or the west coast. I have also never lived alone before and I am wondering if should be pushing myself to gain more independence as I am so young. I just don’t really know what to do.

950,"I found a dog wandering around outside my work a few nights ago, late at night as we were closing down. He was clean and dry (it had rained that evening) and very friendly, so I figured he may have gotten away from home somehow, but he didn’t have a collar. I took him home and had him checked for a microchip the next day, but he didn’t have one. So I posted on some local lost/found pet pages on Facebook, and someone recognized him as their neighbor’s dog. I spoke with the neighbor’s daughter, and we arranged for me to bring the dog back to them. But now, after getting some more info, I’m not sure if that was best for the dog. The owner told me the pup mostly lives outside because he doesn’t do well with their indoor cats (I live in the South and it is VERY hot out right now). He gets out often, and the owner said he thinks it’s because he wants more attention. Their neighbors have complained many times about him going on their property and “messing with” their dogs, even threatening to find the dog a new home. The owner suspected their neighbor picked him up, took his collar off, and dumped him in a populated place. There was no way he could have traveled the 13 miles to where he was found on his own. I strongly suggested they chip him; the owner said he was planning to get a shock collar/electric fence type thing in an effort to contain him. The dog didn’t act excited to see the owner, and had to be picked up to get him out of my car. But what made me feel worst, is that when I told the owner I’d selfishly wished we wouldn’t find him because I had grown to love the dog so much and wanted to find a way to keep him, he said something along the lines of “we wouldn’t have minded that too much as long as we knew he was going to a good home.” I texted him afterwards and offered to take the dog in if he becomes too much for him to handle, as I’ll be moving into a house in a few months and already planned on adopting a dog. He said thanks for the offer and that he’ll keep it in mind, but it is ultimately his daughter’s decision. But I can’t stop thinking that maybe the dog was meant to get out and not find his way back home this time. I’m heartbroken. Is there anything I can do? I mean technically there doesn’t seem to be anything going on that would necessarily warrant me trying to get the dog taken away from them, but it’s breaking my heart to think of him being in that situation when he is so friendly and lovable.",25Jun2020,1

My BF (23M) and I (19F) had a DS 4 months ago. His birth was very traumatic for me and both my BF and Mother who was with me. My son was born usimg forceps and i ended up needing a blood transfusion with a week long stay in the hospital for me to recover. 

Ever since his birth, even in the hospital ive felt conflicted on how to be his mother. I didnt want visitors outside my mum and BF because of how bad i was after the birth. My BF begged me to let his brother, 1 of his sisters (the other one was too young to be allowed on the ward), his mother and father to each visit in groups or on their own. I ended up giving in even thou i felt my dignity and self worth deflate at the lack of care for how my mental state was or how i felt vulnerable over the fact i couldnt even get off the bed for anything longer than a sponge bath.

Thankfully when i left the hospital it was about 2 weeks before i was expected to do visits with people by taking my DS to them. That was only cause it took me that long to be able to walk long distances without pain. It also helped that BF wasnt allowed to leave with him without me because of how fragile my bond was to my baby and because i breastfed till he was 8 weeks old.

Fast forward to now, and ive beem expected by my BF's family (especially his mum) to bring the baby round even when BF is at work. I dont like going over even with BF because his mother and brother smoke a lot even in the house. I put up with it because ik the rules and boundaries will change when we move into our own place (we live with my parents atm).

Recently thou his mother and sisters have been complaining about how i mother my child to BF, who then tells me because they r too scared to. I have a bad habit and im trying to change it, of hovering over people who hold my DS, i take him back after a while so they feel they domt get to hold him long, and i refuse to leave him alone for long periods of time unless absolutely necessary. They want me to change how i feel and for BF to just take DS away from me for an hour or so for a walk or to leave me at my parents while he takes DS to them. They feel i am ""wrapping DS in cotton wool"" when all im trying to do is be the best mother i can while constantly feeling like im doing something wrong because of their comments. 

I dont know what to do and it doesnt help that BF is going through his own mental health problems by having to go back on anti-depressants and having periods of time where he doesnt remember doing stuff. I feel alone and find it hard to talk to my family about this stuff without crying. What can i do to make this better but still be able to be the parent i want to be to my baby",25Jun2020,1

971,"I'm not asking reddit to diagnose me, nor am I going to list all the symptoms, but I've been wondering if I'm on the spectrum or have ADHD, and if I should go get tested to find out. I've asked a few friends for advice on this and they all think that I should, but I'm unsure whether they're saying that to be supportive, or if it's the advice I need to hear. For some background, I'm 17, and have been wondering this about myself since I was 12-ish. My dad will be supportive of this should I go through with it, so parental consent isn't an issue. 

My main reservation is that I was recently tested for a learning disability, and though the testing wasn't focussed on ASD or ADHD, the therapist said in the report that she didn't notice any signs of hyperactivity, or anything that would raise a red flag for her in terms of other conditions. In daily life, I've 'worked' on myself so that I seem normal/not super weird, and I try to make these things unnoticeable, but I feel like if it was really a problem, she would've noticed. 

Another concern is that she'll think I'm stupid for going back lol, I don't want to make a fool of myself or make it seem like I'm doing this for attention, or trying to make a big deal out of it. But part of me knows that if I don't get tested.

So, should I go for it (after COVID), or am I overreacting?",25Jun2020,1

All of those things are totally valid, but there is no reason for her to have to schedule the kids' outdoor activities around the neighbors. It's one thing to chill in the backyard and drink beer.

974,"Sorry long post. I work in a Medical Spa ( massage therapists/MT, nurses, botox, estheticians...) We get pay by the hour not by the client or services. Depending on the service we can see between 1-4 clients per hour. 3 years ago this MT that have been working there for 6 months, states she injured her hand and couldn’t massage, at the same time one of the front desk ( FD)staff resigned so the bosses decided to have the MT temporarily help the FD until her hand get better. They maintain her $25 per hour pay instead of decreasing to $12 like the other FD that have been working with them for like 12 years.
Imp thing here!! that MT had cancer when she was 18years old and thankfully hasn’t come back, she will turn 49 years old next month.
The 1st 4 months she was doing an excellent job and at the same time getting closer to the owners, like buying them lunch, getting their car tires fix etc and every time the bosses are in the office she is super nice and competent... now once they leave she is another person. She started making lots of errors like overbooking therapists, scheduling at lunch breaks, scheduling wrong days, telling clients they have an appointment and giving them the appointment card but not putting them in the system so sometimes the therapist wasn’t there or was with another person, she started leaving in the middle of the day to do personal errands, been rude w/clients and staff...
Clients and therapists had complain but the bosses always answered “ remember she had cancer”... don’t get me wrong I know it is a terrible disease, 2 of my grandparents died cuz of it, and is horrible. However that was like 30 years ago and otherwise she is healthy. 
The bosses fired 2 employees because she didn’t liked them. The esthetician complain about the lady and they gave a warning and told her the same “ she had cancer”. Again please don’t take this wrong I am not saying it isn’t a serious disease.
The bosses have even paid for her to take other certifications so she can “help” in other areas but then she always put excuses and never helps or do anything, most of the time she is on her phone. She is making everyone very uncomfortable and miserable. We used to love working there most of us have been 10+ years but there is a limit. Sadly how things are right now it isn’t easy finding jobs on our fields. Well some of us couldn’t worked for 3 months due to Covid restrictions. Lots of similar businesses around closed permanently. But we don’t know what else to do, how to address this with the bosses w/out been fired because of that employee. Any suggestions? Thanks in advanced! :)",25Jun2020,1
975,"So, my bf and I are in an “open” relationship where he’s allowed to fuck other girls. In April, everyone was really paranoid about the disease — especially me, since I have a history of pneumonia — and he kind of agreed he wouldn’t see girls at that time. We never made a contract or anything but I think he did say he was going to not see girls and try to keep me safe.  

In mid/late April, I got sick. Very bad symptoms. Lung problems etc. 

I saw a message on his phone just today (I KNOW, but he left all his texts open and I couldn’t resist, partially because it’s almost like I’m trying to find a reason to leave anyway) and found that he was referring to me to a girl as a “paranoid roommate” in mid April and hooking up with her at least once, maybe twice.  

The issue isn’t that he was fucking a girl, because technically it’s allowed. The issue is that he exposed me and then I got sick, not sure if it was from her,....probably unlikely actually, as I read all their texts and she never told him she had symptoms, but still. 

I also asked him, just now, if he hung out with any strangers in April. I brought up coronavirus and was like “you never hung out with any strangers in April right?” He sent me a voice message in response saying “Yeah that’s true. We were careful and I didn’t see people back then.”

But he lied. https://imgur.com/a/pw6mxsS (He is the green text). This was mid April. Also, he was always very blasé about the virus and kept saying everyone’s going to get it eventually, etc— but honestly, the fact that he exposed me (and just now lied about it) makes me really sad and upset.",25Jun2020,1
976,"At the beginning of the year my roommate told me he (40sM) was going to move out and I (33F) said “cool, just let me know when.” I was doing him a favor, I don’t need a roommate. I have a 5 bedroom house with a family and he was renting a room because of a divorce.

He “moved out“ end of February but then Covid 19 hit and he left his stuff. Which I understood at the time.. it’s not cool to be an asshole to people in the middle of a pandemic.

Two weeks ago I texted him and said, Hey, I don’t think COVID-19 is going anywhere, we need to come up with a plan for you to move out. He agrees. 
We agree to me sanitizing the door handle and the stair banisters and me Quarantining in my room until it was over.

The weekend comes and goes and he doesn’t show. I text him again. He says hey, I’m gonna try for Monday and Tuesday because it’s supposed to be cooler. Doesn’t show.
Text him again. He says he would be here yesterday or today.
He isn’t here. And he isn’t responding to my text of “let me know when you get here so I can sanitize.”

What am I supposed to do? He left like a giant mountain of clothes and stuff in his room and a iMac computer.  He’s has not paid to use the space the last 3 months, he stopped paying the moment he said he was “moving out.” And I’m not gonna even mention how dirty he was. I noticed rodent activity (I got cats) I went up to his room and pulled seven trash bags of food out of his room two months ago.. a dozen half full pizza boxes. 🤮

980,"Context:

Soo before the test, we were writing up a portfolio (set of notes to take into the test). When our teacher sent us the porfolio file, she accidentally left the validation test (real test) on the file. I decided to read through and write down key points about the questions to save time.

E.g. 

1. Ventilation pumps/monitors

On one question, it required us to link up numbers to letters, that suited the definition. I wrote that done.. (D5, A2 etc.) I forgot to take the notes off my portfolio before handing it in... The porfolio will also be marked.

I decided if she confronts me, i'l just say they were notes for the questions because i was having this big brain fart (In fairness, i was..) and that i was ""going"" to write the paragraphs later into the test.

981,"I absolutely cannot tolerate my dad. He has no respect for me, and he pushes me around and is pretty weird and scary. We have a broken shower door, as well as faulty garage door, in the house, and my dad insists that my brother and I help him fix it. This takes up 5 or 6 hours each day, mostly because he erupts into uncontrollable anger when we mess up anything, and he makes us do something over and over again until we get it perfect. I have absolutely no time for this garbage, and nor does my brother. He sometimes also asks my mom to help him, and since she's really inexperienced with fixing stuff, she often messes up or doesn't know what to do, so he bursts into yelling at her. My dad has anger issues. I can't believe he is my dad. I don't even know why my mom married him. I would bet literally everything I have that my dad kidnapped my mom and forced her to marry him.

My dad also has really questionable habits. In the summer, he just walks around the house wearing nothing but his boxer shorts. He has no control over his body functions, and he just burps or farts when he is around other people. My brother and mom are gluten free, so we have to buy special snacks and gluten-free bread for them. And you know what? My dad, who is not gluten-free, just eats their gluten-free snacks even though we have regular snacks. He sometimes also just takes some gluten-free bread and makes himself a sandwich with it, and he puts like half the cold cuts and cheese we have in a sandwich, and smothers the meat and cheese in mustard and mayonnaise. And then he sits down on the couch and eats it. He doesn't even read the label on the bread and half the time he uses bread that he shouldn't use. When my mom tells my dad that he is eating gluten-free food which is specifically for her and my brother, my dad just says that he is trying to be healthier, which is literally the world's lamest excuse.

And then my dad is super scary at all. In his free time, he just hangs out in the living room and watches TV. Or he watches the stupid videos about politics and news on YouTube, and he turns the volume on his laptop all the way up.

I really wish that my dad will stop his gross habits and become a better person. I really don't feel like my dad really loves others or is a considerate person. And I believe my dad is mentally unstable or at least has some disorder. But I don't what to do about it.",25Jun2020,1

989,"So me \[21m\] and my gf \[21f\] have been together for 2 years. She is great and we have never had any major problems. A big problem and insecurity of hers is that she doesn't have any friends and finds it hard to make them. She is honestly the funniest and kindest person you would ever meet, if someone knew her as I do you would never think that she would be someone who finds it hard to make friends. Shes told me i'm the only person she feels comfortable around, everyone else she gets anxious around and can't hold a conversation with, even her parents, siblings, and co-workers that she has been working with for years. It breaks my heart the amount of times shes been crying to me about this, even to the point where shes told me that she has even thought about ending her life over it at some points because she doesn't see the point in life if you can't connect with others.

I haven't seen her for about 2 months because of covid, but came to hers for the first time again last weekend and noticed she had been texting a guy that we are both friends with. We met this guy together about a year ago through mutual friends, i'd say me and him are good friends but not super close. I don't usually like to snoop but I had a look on her phone when she was in the shower and they have been talking almost every day for weeks. I couldn't find anything flirty between them but the enthusiasm she put into her texts to him seemed more than I get off her most of the time. They were mostly just talking about random things, nothing to deep, just food that they both like or their favourite shows, just random things but they had been talking back and forth for weeks straight without it ever seeming to die down. 

I felt guilty for reading them so told her that night and I said that I don't like how she has been speaking to this guy constantly and their conversations seem much more enthusiastic and 'jokey' than ours. She said it was nothing like that and even gave me her phone and said I could look through all their messages and won't find anything that isn't completely platonic. She then started getting upset and said that I don't know what its like to only have 1 person in your life to rely on for all your social needs and said that she thought I would be happy that she has finally been able to feel comfortable around someone that isn't me, and I am, I just wish that person wasn't a fairly attractive single guy of the same age as us. 

The guy is a very charismatic, popular guy who is easy to talk to, so i'm not suprised that she has felt comfortable around him to talk to him (this is all via facebook btw, he lives in another city). I'd feel awful for taking away the one friend I have ever known her to have, but I just haven't been able to settle since finding this out.",25Jun2020,1
990,"I'm a 17-year old girl that currently goes to high school and I've had a on and off crush for about 3 years now. It started in ninth grade when I was placed to sit next to a guy in my class that I never usually talked to. He was a short gamer-guy with a very strong personality that girls in my class didn't find attractive at all, if I where to put my words like that. At that time I was pretty shallow and I hung out with other shallow, very boring people, at that time I also started to watch anime. When we sat next to eachother I heard him mention death note to one of his friends (because it was at that time they made the horrible Netflix adaptation) coincidentily, I had just started watching it too, so we started discussing it. So everyday, in class, we talked about it and I was so comfortable talking to him, my ""friends"" looked at me like I was crazy. After a while we started to talk more and more about other things and I realised we had a loooot in common. Everything from interests to opinions and the same humor, even the people around us noticed how similar we were. After a while I started to take a liking to him, but I didn't realise it at that moment. We had a great time sittning next to eachother, but after a while, we stopped talking as much, we still talked but not as much as before. When the school year was over we took different paths (because in my country, we choose which ""line"" we want to study, for example some people choose a economy line to study at highschool, some people choose science and so on, we chose different lines) I had him on my snapchat and from time to time I texted him about anime or gaming or something, but he never wrote first. After a while I stopped and then we just continued to have streaks on snapchat, I still had a small crush on him but it faded away after a year. I haven't talked to him irl since ninth grade. After I while I thought that I had completely forgotten about him because I started to text others through tinder and so on, but I always compared them to him. I haven't found anyone like him, and I don't think I will. It's weird that I realised today that I still have a crush on him, but I don't know why, I don't know him technically but I can't stop thinking about him. Sometimes I try to text him but he never texts first and he's never interested in talking to me, which is understandable because I'm basically a stranger to him now, I don't know what to do, I want him to give me some sort of chance to get to know me now, and I'm starting to panic because I Only have one year left in highschool and then I'll never see him again, we will take different paths.

I was in a long term relationship for 3 years and that was almost 2 years ago.. since then I haven’t been with many people at all. But The last few times I’ve attempted to have sex it fails miserably and it’s not just sex.

When a man leans in to kiss me I just freeze and like turn my head and get very uncomfortable. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to kiss.

998,"Me (17) and my brothers are currently in the middle of an argumentative divorce. The divorce was caused by my mom cheating on my dad with my uncles friend, leading to my dad finding out and filing for a divorce. We’re currently moving from a house to an apartment and I’m going to live with my little brother ( he’s 8 ) and my mom while my older brother continues to go to school and live with my dad. 4th of July is coming up and my mom keep pressuring me to go to a party where I’ll eventually meet the guy ( I know who he is ) and I’m not okay with the idea. 

The man knew my mother was in a relationship and suddenly she believes there will be a good introduction while I don’t want him in my life! I don’t want him in the apartment, I don’t want him talking to me, and I don’t need him doing anything for me! My little brother is young and will be confused, but easily manipulated and I can’t exactly stop that. 

My question is should I meet the man? Should I allow him to be in the apartment? Should I stop being stubborn about this? There’s a possibility she will re-marry or have children and I don’t know how to feel about it. I’m confused :/",25Jun2020,1

1000,"ive been in my realtionship for 11 months. it started off of the back of a one night stand. he was kind and loving and attractive - everything i was looking for. we hit it off real good and were basically inseperable. we have been together since last july, and up until december everything was amazing, and ive never been happier.   (it is important to note, i was 17 at the time, and am now 18, and he was 22, and now 23. ) 

it started out slow - i would say no, he would keep trying, i would say no, and he would keep trying, until i just said ""fuck it, if it gets you to leave me alone then sure""  and so, i would do what i had to. 

then i found out that he was into some more kinky stuff, so we set up a safe word.  

this was then he started ignoring the word ""no"".  with him, no stared to not mean no - instead our saftey word would mean no, i dont want you to touch me, before any kink thing had actually begun - which is when a safeword is normally used. he ended up revealing to me that he had some pretty dark interests in the bedroom. (enjoyed non-consensual play). i wanted to make him happy.  so i went along with it. then the same thing started appening again. i would say the word, and then he would keep trying , i would say it again, etc, etc, etc.  i would give in.  beacuse of how rough he likes to be in these situations, there have been many times i have been left bruised by his restraints, or he has slapped me when i havent behaved; he says he does it to try and turn me on because he thinks i like it, but ive asked him to stop and he doesnt. another time i started crying, and he didnt stop. just 2 days ago i was trying to put on my pyjamas, and he stood in front of the wardrobe so i couldt get my pjs until he saw me naked. he gave me a time slot, and within this time i had to be stripped. i did it, but covered myself with the duvet. he tried to take it off. i said ""youre scaring me stop"" and all he said was that he wasnt trying to, he just missed me so much and he just wantedd a little look, he promised he would be gentle, but i didnt want it. i didnt want it. i grabbed a pillow and tried to cover up and he kept trying to take it. i said the safeword, i was on the verge of tear, i asked if i could please put some clothes on, i was scared and uncomfortable. he then let me .

im at the point where i flinch when he is near. he scares me. but im consenting. and i let this continue for 11 months. i feel like this is all my fault. heck i dont even know if this is the right place to post this. im leaving him because of other reasons. but i just want to kow what you would even call what he did to me. i feel dirty and violated, but i also dont want to think he did anything wrong? but i want to acknowledge it for what it is, even though i dont really know what it is. 

anything you have to say would be great. this isnt my first post over our relationship. i just feel so lost. please  help.",25Jun2020,1

I have a pharmacy degree, just fell short (1%) of graduating cum laude. I have a learning disability which makes taking classes, studying and exams quite hard for me.

Going on to second masters, was on a good streak and had enough marks to graduate cum laude next year.

This semester I 'messed up' again, marks will definetely be lower.

I am so dead set on graduating cum laude because almost everyone in my country does it (Belgium) and I probably won't stand a chance on the job market if I don't.

I finally said something about her always being negative and talking about suicide, something along the words of “All I can do is tell your mom or call the mental institution and they can keep you for a few days”. I know it was rough and probably out of my place to say that, maybe she really does wanna kill herself, Idk. I feel trapped in the relationship though. Today I told her I wanted to take a break and she sent me a voice clip of her bawling and begging me not to leave her, then called her best friend bawling and then her best friend called me and I ended up breaking down while on the phone and have been crying and trying to think about what I can do to end things. I’m afraid she’s gonna try to kill herself if I leave her.

Anyways, I will drink anywhere from 2 minimum to 4 times a week.  Sometimes I hit 5 but not often whatsoever.  I always drink to get a buzz or drunk.  My friends just always go out so its hard to say no or be the sober one.  So my problem is that sometimes I will wake up with yellow eyes or yellow skin after a night of drinking wayyyy too much and binging.  I have even gotten a pain in my stomach before (although that is very rare).  I'm scared I have liver disease.  I am basically asking if I should go get tested or if I am over reacting? I have had a wake up call recently with alcohol.  It's scary and I don't want it to be apart of my life like this, maybe not at all.  My habits will be changing hopefully from here on out.

1006,"I've been together with my girlfriend for not to long, we started dating March 31st
I fell for her real hard... I've never felt the way I have then when I'm with her
But for the past 2 or 3weeks or something like that i haven't felt very happy in the relationship. What bothers me the most about feeling this way is that she has done literally nothing wrong and so it hurts to not feel that stuff anymore. It's clear that she definitely loves being in the relationship, constantly telling me she wants to call me because she misses me and shit like that. 
Another problem is I think I might be fooling myself into not wanting to break up with her. When I started feeling this way it was so weird it felt like some days and some times I loved her and could never leave her but more and more it feels like it. Right now as I'm writing this I feel like I don't want to but when I started I kinda did. I'm totally lost and don't know what to do. I thought I was having this feeling because I was sick of going to her house, but after our parents let us go to a resturant it didn't really change.

1008,"Honestly speaking, I don't get why women date or get married, if they are financially stable by themselves?

My dad is so petty and treats my mother like uneducated shit.  She was 20 and he was 32 when they got married.  He's a fucking control freak.  He wouldn't let my mom learn how to drive.  He didn't let her work outside the home until she gave birth to 4 kids--and I was 5 years old.  He would plan vacations that interrupted her work schedule--he forced her to go on these vacations even when she couldn't get permission from work.  He showed up at one of her jobs and made a scene--causing her coworkers to ostracize her (she works super hard and didn't get fired, but it made her life harder).  He takes her money from working at Walmart, so she can never save or move out.  I can go on and on but he has so many ways of disrupting her career and financial stability in a way that she can never leave him.  She lets him bully her because she's afraid of losing us kids.

Background: she's really pretty and kind, but she came here basically from Poland by marrying my dad.  I breaks my heart how he treats her.  When I grow up, I'm think I'll save enough money and we can move out together.

He's so controlling.  When he's eating out with coworkers or having fellowship with people at my church, he pretends to be a good person.  But I think what pissed me off the most about his wrongdoings is that my sister had an ear infection.  She kept crying said her ear hurt.  I'm a nurse--so I assessed her and looked at her ear.  My sister couldn't hear out of her right ear and the ear drum was red and swollen--if the ear drum ruptured, she would have gone death out of that ear.  My mom and I had a screaming match with my dad to let my sister go to the doctor.  My sister got oral antibiotics and ear infection is over now.  But I am still so mad.  In the past, my mom had appendicitis and he told her to shut the fuck up and take TUMS.  It was good that she didn't listen or she would have died.

Why are men evil and selfish?

I'm living with a roommate right now, and I'm talking to her just to see if I can house my mom and sister temporarily until we get an apartment.

I broke up with someone a while ago.  I don't try to control people, and i hate when people who are manipulative and controlling.  Its not that I don't date because I'm stuck up, but because I don't trust men anymore.  They say the want love but they just want someone to control.  And the thing is ever since was a little girl, I never got excited about weddings, or dating, or romance novels, or falling in love.  It feels like something's wrong with me.  So I listened to my friends and family, who encouraged dating.  But in the pit of my stomach I don't want to.  I'm happier by my self.  I just want to make a lot of money and help people as a nurse (even though Covid is scary right now).   I hate the peer-pressure of a lady my age being told to date.  I hate how guys assume that since I don't have a boyfriend its okay to pester me thinking I will cave.  I'm getting to a point where I hate men.",25Jun2020,1
1009,"I'm (24M) on the job search right now and am looking for a job in town. I got a degree in Computer Engineering by the way.   

My family is the type that stays together and it isn't exactly shameful to live with your parents in our culture. My brother got married and him and his wife are living with us as well as my parents and my sister, 6 of us total. My parents build a huge house so space isn't the issue. Each of the 5 bedrooms has a bathroom as well so the housing isn't an issue. The only thing is my mom remarried and so she's always been over protective of us since we lost our dad at a very young age, when my mom was in her early 20s. I feel really awful for leaving her since she usually asks me why I would want to move out if I'm going to be working in the same city.

I understand the advantage is that I can save money for the future as I won't be wasting money on rent when I don't need to be, especially since my parents aren't keen on kicking me out or anything. I myself never felt the need to go anywhere either though I can't tell if thats my own though or something influenced by me caring for my mom. I personally don't have any particular place I want to live since I can just go on short vacations and such.

What should I do? Stay home until I get married lol? Get a job here but get an apartment of my own? Build a house that way I don't lose money on rent and can sell it later if I decide to move or something? Just a bit confused on what to do in this situation. I think the best thing would be to get an apartment here to see how I and my family fare with some space then decide and just except some unnecessary money loss. 

Its just most people in my very big family don't do this so its a bit tough and I always feel like I'm wrong since no one in my life really agrees with me.

1012,"My friend and I are both 23, M. We've been the closest friends possible since sophomore year of high school. We dated the same two girls who were best friends together, and got each other through the breakups as we entered college. I entered college with him in 2016, and between 2017 and 2019 we were roommates. We studied in the same program, and are now going to graduate school in that program.

As for the tension between us, this has its roots around the time I entered the college. I'd had a huge explosive rupture in my perception of my family after learning my mother had been lying to me about a lot of stuff since I was a child, leading to a huge shift in the way I presented my identity. I consciously changed a lot of aspects about how I presented myself, and consequently got some new friends that knew the new me, not the old me. These weren't totally personality shifting, but I did eventually become religious when I had previously been non-religious, converted, etc.

This weirded my friend out for sure, but he our baseline was still the same. We hosted a radio show together, hung out together nightly, and organized politically together, etc. Things seemed as strong as ever, though he definitely felt a little strange about my changes in college. I sort of had two separate friends groups that rarely mixed by 2018.

In 2018, he got very close to one of our roommates and they eventually became a couple. I was fine with this at first and happy for him, but just a few weeks later, some of her friends intervened on their nascent relationship and told her that he was a sexual deviant and assaulter who had forced her mutual friend into sex when she didn't want it. He was sobbing and I was basically the only one there for him, and drove him home. He explained he'd asked multiple times to do stuff with this woman before she'd finally gave in, and was very scared of being typecast as a rapist. His new gf, our roommate, broke it off with him almost immediately without asking him his side of things.

I took him home that weekend, and his father, who's more like a father to me than my dad is, thanked me for helping him. I felt awful for him, but I was enraged about what his gf did to him. I was very disappointed when a couple weeks later after he had begged for her forgiveness, they got back together as if nothing had happened. However, it was his decision, so I said nothing. She was already slated to live with us the following year. If I said something against her now, either he wouldn't accept it and they'd both hate me, or he would accept it and we'd both be forced to live with her. Over the next year into 2019, it felt like she was slowly taking over his personality and using him. It seemed like he had a total devotion to her, or was maybe even afraid of her. I took to sitting with them if they were in common areas, just to monitor their behavior and kind of take notice. I did this a lot and for a while. When we hung out individually, it was only in the context of her absence usually. If he wanted to watch a show together he didn't like, he'd always wait until she was asleep before coming back downstairs to do it. This was alarming to say the least. She'd also become sort of talkative with my girlfriend, who by this time I was long distance with as she did graduate school in Europe.

With her and God knows who else, she was talking about how sexually inept he is, how they only fuck twice a month, etc. My gf was alarmed by this and shared it with me. My friend is a very private conservatively oriented person who would be mortified at knowing that. I still didn't tell him though.

With my own girlfriend, I was preparing for months to move to Europe with her after I graduated last year. I'd bought my airline ticket a few months ahead of time and posted a subleasing for the summer months of our shared lease. I had several voices of interest in it from other students, but few takers. Finally, a month before I was supposed to leave, I reposted the sublet with a hundred dollars knocked off to try and entice more interest in it as the clock ticked down. If I cancelled the ticket to Europe, my relationship would've ended right there. If I had stayed, I still wouldn't have been able to cover rent + utilities. My girlfriend made an arrangement that she'd cover every expense during the summer with her tuition money. I got zero support from my parents through college, so it was just me, struggling quite a lot of the time, getting through it. With this being said, it appeared the best option was to go and continue the search from there. I'd also begun online tutoring once my degree was conferred, which I figured would allow me to make more money remotely.

My friend knew all this, and was not phased by any of it. He tried to make our last few months there great. He tried organizing trips, though with my financial frugality he knew most of it couldn't happen. He organized a big going away party for me in the house before I left, and offered to drive me six hours roundtrip to the airport, which he did. The last time I saw him was hugging me goodbye at the gate.

The literal day after I left, his gf, who by this point I pretty much thoroughly despise, and she obviously did not like me, asked about the room and rent stuff again. I told her I was still looking, and I was finally getting more offers from prospective renting students. I was probably getting two to three a day in the last few weeks leading up to the start of it.

I was contacting these people, arranging visits between them and my roommates to show them the room etc. They were giving me feedback on what they thought of everyone etc. Finally one young woman contacted and came to the house, where only my friend's gf was present. She said she had good impressions of her on the tour. When I asked her if she was endorsing her to come in and post the first month's rent, she said yes. There was general confirmation from my friend and the third roommate.

When this lady came back a few days later, she'd brought her husband (who turned out to be a former felon) and their child into the room. My roommates went ballistic, with the exception of my best friend. The other two went on a tirade about how I'm a piece of shit, my friend's gf, not copping to okaying her or anything, came straight at me and did not let up.

My friend later texted me and said very upfront. ""This is not your fault."" He would blame the lady for trying to turn the place into a boarding house, but not his gf, nor question what happened when it was just her there.

The landlord got involved directly after a few days, and evicted the lady. Things were back to normal on that front, but the subletting situation was still apparent and rent was getting to the point of being due. I scrounged together about half the month's rent tutoring like crazy and stuff. My friend's gf and the other roommate still despised me but my friend was normal and conversational, though definitely irritated by the situation, but still lighthearted, and even joked about the situation with me.

Then my friend's gf texted my gf and tried to turn her against me, talking about what a living hell she put her through. She got very frustrated when she did not and explained that she greenlit the person to me and there was no conflict whatsoever between the them while there. This really threw me into a depressive episode. It felt like the cold war with her had finally gone hot and this was her move. I felt like a total idiot for thinking the situation was all in the clear when I had left, and still do.

Finally, the landlord forced them to cough up the remainder of my rent since I was still working to pay it piecemeal. It came to around 250 a person. My reaction to it was more manic-depressive than apologetic. And my friend, the most non-confrontational understanding person on the planet, said I was allowing his girlfriend to be hurt by letting the lady come in, totally denying the unanimity a few weeks earlier. I fell into a tailspin and ended up going dark on social media, after apologizing profusely. I cleared the calendar and spent the whole next month toiling away tutoring to make up the rest of the money to pay them back. It took about 4 weeks to get it all after the fight. I venmo'd it all to my friend, who I hadn't spoken with since.

Things got weird after that. A couple weeks after I finished paying it, he told a close mutual friend from high school that I'd gotten a notice in the mail about my student loan grace period being half-over and told him to tell me? A few weeks after that, I bought a game on Steam and he bought the same thing the next day (not a brand new title either). Finally, on my birthday, he removed me from steam. Two and a half months after the argument.

I'd been waiting/hoping for contact from him the whole time, though still worried about his girlfriend's influence over him, which I felt had reached a fever pitch. Finally I contacted him a few weeks after that, with a firm but apologetic stance. He was hostile from the start and claimed he was exhausted with me after I didn't apologize to his girlfriend, and did not want to be my friend anymore. I pointed out this was blatantly false and told him, very straightforward ""You are in a toxic relationship. She complains about your sex life to people, she called you a rapist and only took you back after you begged and groveled her to, she stayed friends with her co-accusers, she met and endorsed that lady, she tried to destroy my relationship and got angry when it didn't work, and she whips you into line whenever you dissent. Good luck."" He did not defend her, he simply said to talk to someone else when I got back. I'm pretty certain she coached him on what to write based on the language and that they both deleted me off snapchat the same day.

Through a mutual friend still on campus, I learned a couple months later that after I'd gone dark on social media, he cried to him in private and claimed ""I cut him out"", and felt betrayed that I went off social media, and only said he was 'annoyed' by the subletting and landlord fiasco, but was devastated by me going dark to take stock of my mental health. I felt awful for causing that. A couple weeks later, this friend said he'd made a joke about breaking up with his gf, and also brought me up out of nowhere in a positive context at a party, and finally after the New Year, he broke up with her, and she was furious.

I'll say very upfront that he is of meek demeanor and basically would never just try and end his relationship. I've seen him go through a couple and they always kill him. I firmly believe that my last words to him caused it to happen. I ended up writing an apology letter to him around christmas by hand and explaining a lot of stuff (the weird identity changes in college, what I and I think he also thought was stable in regards to the rent situation, etc). A week after that letter was delivered he broke up with her.

However, he is still susceptible to her influence, and did unfriend me on social media and such. However, since the breakup, he's talked about me positively on a few occasions, though does not want to reinstate contact right now. My girlfriend texted him to ask about it after he deleted me on facebook and he simply said ""I really appreciate where you're coming from, but I don't want to deal with this right now. I'll still be your friend though."" Since the breakup, he's not contacted me, but he's done very weird things (unmodded me on a years old derelict fb page in March, cancelled a venmo request from well over a year ago just last week, etc). He said he wants me cut out but keeps trying to get my attention with these gestures every month or two.

He is a very non-confrontational awkward guy. I'm very proud of him for dumping his toxic relationship, but I really hunger to have contact with him again. He moves out of that place next month and moves to a different state for graduate school. I miss him so much, the greatest friend I've ever had, but I feel so much emotional confusion about him. I find it really strange that he'd accuse me of lying or duplicity but also take my word to end his relationship when he seemed so totally absorbed in it. I recognize that based on his personality and his will to be liked (she hates him now and he still tries to be friendly with her in the house), that it is impossible for things to improve while he's still there. I am wondering how things might change when he's living alone after next month, but am scared they won't.

Is there any hope based on this behavior? I feel just awful about what happened and I think about it 24/7. I don't know if his behavior is designed to hurt me or to be therapeutic for him or something. I just want my best friend back.",25Jun2020,1

The next time I saw her (not sure what day it was), I also brought the report to her to tell her they were not issued. I can't remember what we spoke about but I left her the reports so she could check/issue them. I think they are still on her desk.

Today, the manufacturing plant said they had not seen the order and it had not been issued. So now we are going to have to rush to get materials for this and it will probably be late. We are still working part time, so I will be going into work tomorrow for a few days but my coworker won't be in until Monday.

This is probably going to be something my boss brings up tomorrow. How should I deal with this? I feel like I did what I needed to do (found the error, emailed coworker, and gave her reports to fix it).",25Jun2020,1

Is it the same for big chains? It's Aldi's by the way. It just feels weird and impersonal to me that it's all over the phone/internet and they don't get to match a face/voice with the application.

1021,"I've thought about this a lot during this quarantine and I do not know what to do...

This is my first time using a Throwaway account and since the quarantine started I started thinking about this nonstop ( what i should have done, What i should have said ) and well I need some advice on this. ( btw, if this post somehow looks like a mash of self pity or stupidity please don not blame me since I will try to give as much detail as i can in this post )

I'm a male and way before quarantine started, I had met this beautiful ( both in the inside and outside ) girl and well, one day I was hanging out with my ( dude ) friends and we were all talking about dating and all that kind of stuff, and as a joke a friend of mine asked her what if I asked her on a date, her answer was that she would say yes ( whilst laughing ) and then a couple days later her and her friend asked me to go out and watch a movie, since I'm the shy kind I politely declined, not thinking much of it but a couple weeks later, I then realized that she had asked me out on a date and i fucking refused.

All I could think of during this quarantine was her and how i acted like a terrible dumb piece of shit.

So I've been thinking of asking her out when this is over but there is another problem, she is really into kissing and such, but she has got a mouth disease ( I do not remember it's name ) and well I wouldn't like to catch the disease if i somehow start dating her.

Please reddit, this is my first time using a Throwaway account, please do your best to help me with what i can do to make her want to go on a date when quarantine is over, how to don't run out of topics, how to avoid getting the disease whilst not letting her down.

Please answer all those topics I requested, now do your thing reddit",25Jun2020,1
1022,"I've been at my job just about a year. It is my first ""real"" job. I'm a full time administrator and in my department there are 2 other women, both nearly 70. I'm still in college and have a year left. Since I've started my job one of the women (who I serve as backup for.. she's the receptionist) always babies me, tries so hard to manipulate me, and both the women in general are mean.

If I stand up for myself it does nothing. I'm to the point where I feel almost depressed about my job and just want to tell then I'm quitting and walk out. I make very good money for this entry position, and am grateful for that. It's the only reason I hesitate quitting. 

Some days are just too much. The receptionist acts like I'm her personal assistant. She tells me to break up with my boyfriend (she doesn't know him), tries getting any personal info out of me she can, and is extremely invasive. She talks to me like I am a child despite being fully capable of whatever it is I'm doing. Combined, both women act like since I am so much younger than them (22), they know everything and therefore are controlling. I'm sick of it. I could just be opening mail at my desk and be told I'm doing something wrong, need to learn how to think, etc. 

I cannot go to HR because they are in a little clique with the HR woman. It's pointless. I've caught them gossiping about me before as well.

1027,"I’m on mobile so I apologize for bad formatting. 
In my country, you can only get a driver’s license at 18. I’m 19F and I got mine last year on my second attempt. In my country you have to learn how to drive a manual car, but my parents have an automatic one, which is way easier. But it’s also much bigger than the ones I’m used to and that’s hard for me. But overall, God, I hate driving. 
I live and study in a big city, but due to Coronavirus I’m at my hometown with my family. I don’t drive in the city I live because I don’t own a car, traffic is too crazy, and it has a good enough public transport system. But my family thinks in order to be an independent woman I need to know how to drive. But thing is, I don’t want to. 
Driving makes me incredibly angry. I cuss at literally everyone on the street (not picking fights or anything, just getting really mad inside my own car). I also think I’m a bad driver because I struggle to park, have a lot of trouble, for example, crossing a busy street that doesn’t have a traffic light. I really try to be careful and pay attention but I constantly mess up. My mom says I have to practice but I have been driving everyday for 2 (?) months and I’m not getting any better. Not slightly. It might seem so, but a new way of messing up always comes up. 
I have never driven alone. I was always with the school instructor, and then with my dad (I have driven with my mom once, but she yelled at me for getting the car out of the garage all wrong, and I said I didn’t wanna drive with her anymore). I panic when I don’t know what to do, and really just have the urge to get out of the car and run away. 
I don’t really know why I’m so terrified, there’s a lot of options. I used to have frequent nightmares in my childhood about being lost and alone and having to drive back home. I grew up with the story about my uncle that died at 22 from a car crash. My mother had panic syndrome when I was a child and, for example, would get us from school and then just drive around because she would forget how to get back home. That was before she completely stopped driving. She has resumed a couple years ago, and she feels like it gave her independency back, and that’s why she feels so strongly about me driving too. 
I have talked to my parents about all of this. I have told them I don’t want to drive, and bitched about it so they would get tired of me. I’ve said I was afraid of crashing, and I felt it was gonna happen. I get so unbelievably angry that I start yelling that I’m gonna get in an accident and get killed or kill someone eventually. I’ve cried because I was so angry and panicked. But they are not letting me quit, and no, I don’t go to a therapist as much as I want to. (My parents won’t pay for one, because they have before and felt it wasn’t helpful, and bc you can’t be sure you’ll get a good professional, and I can get help from psychologists on YouTube and whatnot.)
So. With all that. What should I do? Should I keep trying? How do I fix being so upset? Or how do I make my parents stop forcing me to drive?",25Jun2020,1

1031,"(Copied and pasted from another post about him) A little over a year ago (sophomore year of high school) I was sexually assaulted by a close friend of mine. I don’t really want to get into the details of it but it led to many hours of therapy and trauma that I still suffer from today.

When I first realized what he did, I went into a severe depressive episode and did not know what to do. I told a few friends and they spread it to the larger group of acquaintances. Someone used this anonymous app to report it to the police/school and I went further into a depression as my whole family now knew.

After a week, I decided to call off the case and such because his dad is a teacher that I frequently hang out in the room of when school was in session and I was afraid. I was manipulated by my assaulter as he claimed I would ruin his life and I felt bad. I am not sure if I can open the case but I assume not.

He has apologized in the past after I contacted him (spur of the moment) to say he has given me irreversible damage to how I am as a human being. 

He just contacted me today saying, “(My name), I did not know what platform was best to reach you but I wanted to extend an apology.
I am so deeply deeply sorry for everything that happened last year and how this has been long time coming.
I wanted to personally ask you what I can do to prove that I have grown and changed as a person from that moment where I hurt you. 
What can I do for you and all others I hurt to show that I deeply regret and am against my former actions.
I’ve sat on this for a long time but with the changes I have been experiencing in perspective to my privilege as a man I realized feeling bad for myself isn’t enough and it’s time for me to recognize my wrongs and to try my best to grow even more from them. 
I apologize for how out of the blue this may seem for you, and I hope this all makes sense. Just know that I am sorry and am ready to work with you and all others I’ve affected to prove I am above and against any forms of abuse or harassment.”

What do I say? I told him I need time to think. Part of me wants to tell him he doesn’t get to just... be a good person now. Another part wants to tell him I’m not responsible for his actions and shouldn’t have to teach how to be a decent human being after what he did to me.

Variables I consider are how can this phrase or sentence affect another and does it hurt someone even though it doesn't seem hurtful towards me but can be towards them or simply a foundation to a fragile construct of them or her mind effectively changing their life coarse into perhaps a negative way.

1040,"So I’m a 20 year old white girl and I’ve always wanted to cover my hair or at least try it out. For a while i wanted to wear a Hijab because that was the only covering I knew of, and they’ve always looked beautiful to me, but i never did because I’m not Muslim and i felt like it would be offensive even if i wore it respectfully. Over the years I’ve noticed a lot of black women, and other women of color wearing headwraps, and again 100% beautiful to me. Then I learned there’s a dark side of headwraps that’s tied to slavery so I feel like i can’t wrap my hair up in those styles. 
A few days ago I moved in with my relatives and they smoke heavily. I didn’t want to ask them to stop smoking in their own home, specially if I’m temporarily a guest, so I bought a “bonnet” that’s layered to hopefully protect my hair. The reason I say “bonnet” is because it literally looks like a beanie but it goes over the hair and has silk / satin on the inside and I’m not actually sure what to call it. I’ve been wearing it a lot inside then taking it off when I go out to reduce the smoke on my hair, and as I’ve been wearing it I’ve really started to like it. 

At this point I’d like to buy more and wear them out in public, but again I don’t want to offend anybody by doing so. That being all said, is there a way or something I could wear in public that covers my hair without crossing the line of racism/ cultural appropriation?

Anyway, I was hired as a camp counselor in May. I had no other job, and was worried about money, so I applied to a new camp (my old one I worked at for the past few years closed), and got hired very quickly. The season starts next week, so I will be working this job and can not quit this close to the season. I also feel it is one of the safer jobs to be doing right now, as it is enclosed and I am with the same group of children and staff every day. 

For those who are unfamiliar, camp jobs do not pay much. I will be making about $1k for the summer. I applied to other jobs as well, to keep my options open, as the camp staff were very lenient at the beginning about whether or not a staff member could stay. Nobody contacted me back, so I committed. 

I got a phone call today from a serving job (for private parties, if it matters), which would not interfere with my camp hours. On one hand, I really need the money to pay rent this upcoming fall and feel like I could safely do the job, but on the other I'm worried about picking up the virus and giving it to the children in my camp group. I know kids don't tend to get sick from this, but I dont want them to expose their families who may be vulnerable. I'm just really stuck about what to do. I do not know the safety/sanitation measures of this serving job yet. Is it a horrible idea to pick up a second job where I will be working with more random people during the evenings and weekends? Or do you think with the right precautions I could be okay and not spread the virus? I know numbers are low, but I am worried about asymptomatic people as well. Thank you for the help",25Jun2020,1

1048,"**Background information:** I'm a pathways student trainee intern with the federal government. I will be a junior in college this fall. 

**Current Situation:** I started a month ago, and have completed all of my mandatory training plus some that wouldn't be expected to be done until after I am hired on full-time. I will be an intern again next year. 

**Problem:** A combination of my job description being very light on duties. The only things my supervisor/coworkers expect from me is to do all of my training and job-shadow various employees. I job shadow at every opportunity and have been given the opportunity to do certain tasks independently. However, since everyone is teleworking and we're only allowed 1 employee in the office on any given day, it's hard for me to go above and beyond to do work that will assist my co-workers. I have no access to files, scanner, etc. I am also not trained in any of the software tools that my co-workers spend a lot of time using, and afaik the training for those are only offered in person, which are currently cancelled due to covid-19. My co-workers are trying to train me to use them, but it's difficult via screenshare and since it's new software (came out this year) even they don't know what they're doing and are relying on input from leadership and even they have no idea what they're doing and are always contacting the national headquarters for help. In other words, I feel as if I can't contribute meaningfully and I feel as if i'm ready for more responsibility but my supervisor hasn't been very receptive because it's not within my job description. I find myself having a difficult time tele-working because I run out of things to do frequently, and find myself just refreshing my email a dozen times. Usually I am good at finding meaningful things to do to help everyone out, but when i'm not in the office it's hard to gauge what needs done.",25Jun2020,1
1049,"Yesterday, I made a post on AITA about my dad. He's a paedophile and I'm not legally allowed contact with him until I'm 18. I'm turning 18 next year and have been conflicted about whether or not I should completely cut him out if he tries to contact me or if I should just try have a relationship with him so I posted ''WIBTA if I disowned my dad when I'm legally allowed to see him next year'' and it got instantly took down.

The reason they gave was because my post contained 'rape and sexual assault' even though I never even mentioned him doing anything I just mentioned he was a registered sex offender. So I censored it out and reposted it and the mods took it down again, saying they can't allow posts involving sex and minors but like I said my father never did anything and i never said he did so this was unfair.

Also, I spent a long time looking through their rules before I posted and there was nowhere stated that my post wouldn't be allowed to include mentions of my dad being a paedophile, even though I stated in my post he hasn't done anything. I think that's a bit messed up to not include in their rules and I was really upset, especially after spending such a long time pouring my heart out into the post.

I sent them a message and because I was pissed I called them shitty mods. I got upset because this is such a hard topic for me to talk about and I spent 3 hours trying to bring myself to properly write that post, and that was after I looked through the rules. My family on my dads side was giving me a lot of trouble about going no contact and I didn't know what to do so I just made that post.

I tried messaging the mods but they muted me and I don't know what to do. When I turn 18 he's going to be able to get half of our house and I've just been so scared and confused about everything lately that I turned to AITA to at least try to settle one issue. Please can someone give me advice on what to do? 

Edit: for reference I never said anything about my dad doing anything, I just said my mom found porn on his computer. Nobody even knows if he's done anything or not.",25Jun2020,1
1050,"Basically my boyfriend (18.m) had his graduation ceremony this morning and afterwards went to go hang out with his friends and get food(this was when he said he last had his wallet). Apparently he was in his friend's car with his wallet in his pocket and only got out of his friend's car to get back into his own car. He thinks it might've fallen in his friend's car but his friends aren't answering his calls or messages. He's also worried it might've fallen when he got out of the car. This wouldn't really be a big deal if he didn't have almost $2,000 in checks and cash from his family for graduation in his wallet. He's super stressed about it and I'm starting to get stressed about it too honestly. I'm not sure what he'll be able to do about this graduation money if he can't find his wallet, do any of you guys recommend anything?",25Jun2020,1
1051,"I have liked this girl for a year (I’m 18). And I thought she liked me. She had pecked me at a party, made flirty eye contact with me, said she’d get with me previously. All my friends made a big deal of and I thought she liked me.

Also please bear in mind I’m writing this drunk while it’s still in my mind.

Today we were at the beach and we ended up meeting up with the group this girl is in, she kept making eye contact with me (is pretty normal). 

Like eye contact which is kind enough awkward but also flirty.

My friend kept chatting to her and ended up sitting next to her. So at this point I’m like, damn I should be really jealous but if she wants to get with him whatever. 

they were kinda flirty and they went off with another pair to the shops and apparently piggy backed each other but yeah. I made a bit of conversation with her once she got back and she was laughing etc. but I don’t know if she likes my friend and not me. She kept addressing him by his name and chatting to him.

One of her friends kept shipping me and her while we were out as well out of my earshot.

The guy who was chatting to her even mentioned the fact she had kissed me months prior and she put her head in her hands and cringed a bit.

Even writing this at this point I’m thinking yeah she probably likes him but I have such a massive crush on her and just want some validation ;(.",25Jun2020,1
1053,"For context, I’m a 14 year old girl who has a very nice living situation and life in general. My parents are loving, they make mistakes like anyone else but are well intentioned, and I’ve never been abused or suffered anything I would really count as trauma. 

Despite this, for going on five years now I’ve been depressed. I mentioned to my parents when I was 9 that I was feeling tired, sad and self loathing on a daily basis and persistently but they said it was a normal part of being a teen so I dropped it. Similarly when I was 11 I told my dad that school was emotionally exhausting and that I could barely get through it, he said that if I can’t handle this, the real world will destroy me.

After 3 years of trying to get them to help me, even confessing suicidal thoughts and having a note and the pills, they finally reacted when I started self harming. They did listen when I told them before, but it was always treated like a short term problem that they could just talk me through, like a breakup or something.

They took me to a doctor and they said that I was just a teenager dealing with some emotional issues, they recommended therapy and that was that.

Therapy hasn’t worked. I feel no better and whilst I’ve pulled myself away from suicide I’m slowly starting to think that that might be the only escape.

I think I may have clinical depression because I’ve found that regardless of circumstances or help, I still just emotionally drop. I don’t really know how to explain it, but it feels like I’m trying to swim upstream against rapids, it doesn’t matter how hard I swim. My family members on both side have medical history of depression, my grandfather (paternal) because of how horrible the last decade of his life was and my grandmother (maternal) who takes anti-depressants but my mum doesn’t know the specifics. It also could explain why it came out of nowhere around the time I hit puberty as my hormones would have changed. 

The thing is, my parents don’t like the idea of the medication. My dad says that he doesn’t want me to be hooked on them as my only way to survive and that it will make me incapable of coping with life.

I’ve been to several doctors and therapists but I feel like they all dismissed my concerns that these methods aren’t working. It’s so exhausting to get my hopes up that this time things will be different to only be given the same useless solution over and over.

With how the world is right now, it would be enormously selfish of me to take up the NHS time with this, especially if it does turn out to just be me gunning for attention. 

I know that self diagnosing is a dangerous game to play but I really don’t see any other alternative to what my symptoms could be. 

Sometimes I cut myself just to get attention, as awful as it sounds. I’ll pretend to cover up my scars and act all sheepish when someone sees, I’m unable to stop grinning when people worry about me and it’s honestly sickening. 

Do all teenagers feel this way? My friends have confessed hard times but all seem to think I have a bigger problem. This could just be because I probably exaggerate it to them for attention so I don’t feel they have a very objective opinion.

So do I need to genuinely see the doctor? Or am I just too soft and seeking attention? 


TL;DR I think I may have clinical depression, I have some symptoms and a family history, but I’ve seen doctors who haven’t said anything about it and I know myself well enough to know that I’ll do anything (even subconsciously) for attention. It could also be teenage hormones (14f)",25Jun2020,1
1054,All my life I have gravitated towards long distance relationships. I hate the guys that are from my hometown and never had the best luck with them.

1056,"Background: Rose and I have been best friends since high school, so about 10 years now. Growing up, her house was always messier than mines. NBD, she’s my best friend, who cares about how she lives at home?

Rose, her boyfriend Abel, and I signed a lease together this past March. This was Rose’s first time living in an apartment. 

I regret moving in with them. My best friend is as messy as she is at her parents house. I just blindly ignored it for so many years. 

They both leave their belongs in the common spaces (living room and deck) so that it’s constantly messy. 

The kitchen attracts fruit flies, gnats, and roaches. 

I have mentioned this to them both on two occasions. We decided to chose days for someone to clean the kitchen by bedtime. 

https://imgur.com/a/bkfnspw

That is how the kitchen has looked for the past three days. I haven’t cooked since last week, and I cleaned every dish I cooked with. 

She grocery shops for a family of four, yet is only feeding herself and her boyfriend. I have to reorganize the fridge to put my groceries away. I have allergies and religious preferences, so I’m limited in what I can eat. I swear she goes out her way to buy as much pork, shrimp, and zucchini as possible for our fridge. 

When she gets off work, she’ll coo, eat, and leave the dishes/pots/food in the sink, in the counter, and on the stove. She will leave food on the stove for days. 

She enjoys singing and playing with her boyfriend in the living room, which I have no problem with during the day, but she gets off work around 11pm, which is after I go to bed. When I mention to her I’m trying to sleep, she acts offended that I suggest for her to move her activities to her own room. 

This is destroying our friendship. I don’t want to talk to her anymore. It’s “Hi” and “Bye” at this point. We have conflicting work schedules. It bothers me to no end that I’m not comfortable in my own house",25Jun2020,1

1060,"Hi I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years and he claims that I’ve sexually abused him. 

Warning this may be graphic

I was stupid and I admit that but I thought plan b was good enough to use as birth control since I’d been using it as birth control for over a year. But then I got pregnant. During my pregnancy I was very scared and ashamed of myself so I didn’t tell anyone and attempted suicide more times than I can count. I drank bleach and detergent trying to kill myself and my baby. I also tried to hang myself. I was very depressed. I am quite skinny and my stomach didn’t get very big. Probably because I tied a belt as tied as possible to prevent my stomach from growing. So tight it cut into my skin. At 6 and a half months I looked almost the same as I did before I was pregnant. I barely had a bump but one day I started bleeding like a lot. I bled so much I thought I was going to die. I had to be rushed to the hospital. It was very scary for me and I was very depressed at this time. Turns out I did almost kill myself and my baby. I was now marked with high risk pregnancy. After this I felt horrible for everything i had done and decided to tell my boyfriend I was pregnant. I was very scared because I told him I was on birth control (plan b) and I know now that’s not birth control. I know I was stupid. My baby was born two weeks later and he was completely healthy with nothing wrong. I’m so thankful for that. It has been two years and I’m still with my boyfriend but every other month he yells at me for even getting pregnant in the first place and today he told me I sexually abused him because I got pregnant. I am hours away from my family and I don’t have a car and he told me to catch a cab to go home to my family. What do I do now? Did I really sexually abuse him?",25Jun2020,1

I agree that its good that we have consequences so my siblings and I could be raised right but I don't think going as far as taking away food for a day is good. 

My mom has tried normal  punishments like taking away electronics and phones but she has been doing even worse punishments recently like making my sister only eat dinner for two days.

He is an independent business owner and is fairly successful. He has many business partners and they all know each other very well including their families. 

But, recently, he was talking with a business partner, let's call him Mr. M. Mr.M saw a picture of mine in my father's office and asked about me. My father tells him about me and my interests and Mr. M seemed quite excited apparently. He tells my father that I would probably really like his son since we have similar interests. They both thought this was great, and then Mr.M suggested they try to set us up on a date. And my father agreed, even while he knew that this man's son is 32 years old, 13 years older than me. 

I told my father that I do not want to meet this man or go on a date with him. He told me I have to meet him and go on one date to not upset his business partner. He told my mom that he thought this man would be a good match for me and that they wouldn't have to worry about him providing for me since he is a wealthy lawyer who owns his own law firm in the city. 

I fear they are trying to marry me off. I don't understand how they can't see that this is wrong.

However I had night sweats and had to go to A&amp;E walk in as he forgot to mention he had strep throat recently and so he gave it to me which I then had to take antibiotics for.

I took a self HIV test a couple of months after (6 months ago) as I’m a worrier and I *believe* it came back negative. I also took one 2 months ago from now and I *believe* that came negative too.

I say *believe* because I’m convinced i have it since my lymph nodes have been swollen since. 

The main thing is I’ve also created this picture in my mind of the tests I took actually being positive but me being too stupid to realise. So I’ve ordered another kit and it’ll be here soon.

But i dread to think what happens if it returns positive; the images of them actually being positive is haunting me.

1070,"I need your advice here: 
On Easter my sister-in-law and husband got in an argument about my daughter's ""spoiled"" behavior, It was originally my husband who brought up the fact that she was whiny and I, as her mother cottleed her. My sister-in-law kept bagging on my daughter... Well my daughter was walking up, My sister-in-law shouted "" I hate your daughter, I've never liked her"" everyone heard including my daughter. 
previous to the situation, there has been multiple instances with her oldest son that is 7. He is rude, excludes my daughter from playing with stuff, and and trief choking her with a ribbon metal necklace about a week before Easter... He has also tried getting my daughter, which is 5 to pull her pants down, pushes his younger brother's head against my daughter's head to make them kiss, and make sexual passes which are clearly inappropriate.. parents have talked to him but It continues and they don't seem to be sending help for him. All of which my In laws are aware of. 
We have limited our meetings with them, supervised visits but Easter was what broke the camel's back. 

Anyways, I banned My sister-in-law and my nephews from my house and have not talked to them since, I do allow my brother-in-law and because he does work for my husband.

Well, their son is having his 8th birthday party and celebrating July 4th.. I've stated I didn't want to go but I've gotten many questions as to why. I'll be honest, I wasn't very transparent and blamed a lot of it on the comment that the mother made but the inappropriate comments that have yet to be addressed have been eating me up..
A couple days ago, my mother-in-law asked me why I wasn't going She also mentioned ""I shouldn't be punishing an 8-year-old for adult mistakes"". I did end up sending her a text message, but she completely ignored it. 

I also opened up to my husband as to what was really bothering me but he is also yet to talk to his brother. This also really hurts my feelings because this is his daughter too. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much and I'm asking for advice because I'm not sure where to go from here. 
Also, their son is specifically asking for another cousin around his age to come and he has even requested to do it at an uncle's house to make sure that that cousin comes. This terrifies me but I'm not sure that I should say something to the mom and make her aware or stay out of it because she was never involved... I don't really know.",25Jun2020,1
1071,"I've been going through a lot of stressful things recently (mostly family issues but some more personal issues). Sometimes when I have a really rough day I (17) ask my boyfriend (19) of almost 8 months if I can vent to him. I always make sure before I vent to him that he has the space for it and he's okay if I vent/complain to him and he normally is.

He's a ""gamer"" and in the past month he has picked up gaming a lot more. Its gotten to the point where it's lucky if we call to talk once a week or more. We text every day. Sometimes when he plays games he forgets to respond or hit send and leaves me on read which I get because it happens but its been happening a lot more recently. I understand that you cant pause games if they're online because thats just how it works. But, it upsets me because I'll ask him if he's busy or if he's okay with me rambling to him and clearing my mind and he'll say that I can and he's not busy but when I respond with what's on my mind he leaves me on read. It's normally because he's preoccupied with videogames and talking to his boys.

I try not to get upset because I know having hobbies that make you happy is fantastic and I don't want to take his hobby away from him. I also don't want to ruin his relationship with his friends because thats even more important and I would feel like shit if I did mess that up. I don't have friends like he does and I don't want to take them away from him because I know how sucky it is to not have many friends. 

I've talked to him about how it bothers me and he said he will try to make a some more time for me but how can I not be upset when I see him log onto discord (He wanted me in the discord he's in I didn't invite myself. Hell im hardly ever active on it.) or when he leaves me on read? I really don't want to take his friends or hobby away from him I just want to not feel like shit when he logs on or leaves me on read.

1073,"I've always wanted to be a teacher since I was a little girl they dubbed a ""smart kid."" And yeah, I'm one of those personality quiz kind of dudes, and 99% of the time they told me that being a teacher was a good choice for a person like me. And I still believe that.

But now, I'm going to be a senior, and I'm getting scared that teaching isn't what I should do at all.

The first time I had doubts was in eighth grade. A social studies teacher everyone respected (read: feared) looked me in the bright, hopeful eyes and said, ""Don't be a teacher. You'll regret it."" And then sophomore year I asked two teachers I liked a lot better about their jobs. One was brand new, the other was a fifteen-year veteran of the art class. (We're a really small school so we only have two art teachers. He gets a lot of jackasses who just want to draw a dick and turn it in. Despite that, he is kind. I trust him.) 

I don't remember what the new teacher told me. I just remember watching her struggle in class. But the art teacher told me that, ""As long as you understand the system and how things are--which you do--you'll be alright."" Then he stopped a passing math teacher and asked her how she felt about her job.

She smiled uncomfortably and said, ""Well, I wouldn't have chosen math."" Then walked away.

Through my entire junior year full of garbage, unfair teaching, mental health problems, and stress like I've never experienced, I've been thinking about it. I have always felt that I was meant to be a high school teacher, helping kids not only learn, but grow as people and make memories and--I don't know, like change them? Teach them the lessons I've learned, help them go out in the real world.

But I live in Illinois. In a small town. I won't be paid well. And my sister has new teacher friends who had to go to therapy from the stress and said that it was so, so hard their first year. Plus, despite how welcoming my district SEEMS to be, I am a member of LGBTQ+ community, and I never want that to affect my career.

Tl;dr...I know I won't be paid well, I know it will be hard, and I know that it isn't a stable job. But I want to be a teacher for high school students. Am I just trying to pursue a childhood dream, or is it worth the inevitable pain?

Any real advice or opinions are appreciated.",25Jun2020,1
1074,"I am a 23 year old female who is an only child of a single mom. I finished undergrad a while ago and I’m currently back home with my mom; I went to an out-of-state university. My mom is about 60 years old but she's still working. My dad is currently in rehab for physical therapy so he is not able to see me or talk to me. Things have been rough between me and my mom ever since I finished undergrad. Right after we got back home this past December, I had confessed to my mom in person that I no longer share her Christian beliefs and that I am Agnostic. She and I argued back and forth for a few days. Fast forward to late May, I was indirectly forced to come out to my mom out as lgbt (specifically as bi) in a conversation with her. Once again, my mom and I got into an argument about it but a more heated one. Ever since I confessed that I am Agnostic, my mom and I have gotten into multiple arguments on Christianity/religion from time to time. The same with being lgbt. 

In addition, she is not only a staunch Christian but a pro-Trump conservative as well. She constantly praises Trump, and watches Fox News even though the network has anchors on there that spew out toxic rhetoric towards minorities and immigrants. This is ironic considering my mom and my dad are both minorities and immigrants. If you try to argue with her on Trump and politics, she gets defensive. On top of all of this, I find her to be a controlling person. Back in senior year of highschool, she wouldn’t let me wear band shirts and other certain graphic shirts because they look “satanic”. During the quarantine in March, she said that I should stop reading books. Every now and then, she tells me how she thinks I don’t dress appropriately for a woman. I don’t wear crop tops, or expose my underwear. I typically wear skinny jeans, with a simple shirt, black shoes and a black denim jacket.

Apart from sharing DNA with her, my mom and I hardly have anything in common when it comes to substance. I honestly don’t want to live with her anymore; I can’t stand her.  I am honestly tired of arguing back and forth with her about religion and lgbt rights. Prior to heading to college, I used to argue about lgbt rights a lot with my mom in high school. I had to pretend that I believed in her religion because I didn't know how she’d react and I was scared at the time. High school was a rough and very intense period with her and I feel like high school is repeating itself. I am sick of hearing about “how good” Trump is and Fox news as a whole. I know this sounds bad, but I honestly wish that my mother had disowned me the moment that I confessed that I didn't believe in her religion. 

 Everybody else in my mother’s family is also very anti-lgbt and staunchly christian as well and i literally do not know anyone in my dad’s family. I am honestly thinking of leaving home and going to an lgbt youth homeless shelter to be around young people who are lgbt and liberal like me. I am thinking of packing the clothes that I need and leaving a clear note to my mom of why I left home. When I was in college, just about all of my friends were lgbt.

With that said, I have a tendency to ramble so I shall make an attempt at being as direct as possible.

I live in a toxic household and desperately need to move. I live alone in central Florida with my father and recently I have had a revelation of just how bad this abuse is. Not the kind of abuse that leaves physical bruises but the kind that leads to a feeling of entrapment and paralysis. The kind of abuse that micromanages your entire life, down to what I'm allowed to eat in a given day. And if any deviation from that is found, I am threatened and verbally assaulted. The kind of abuse that screams in your face when you withdraw $30 from your bank account that you have spent 3 odd years and 2 separate jobs building up when all you need is gas. The kind of abuse that won't let a 19-year-old adult that has already gone away to college out past 9 pm to see friends. And worst, the kind of abuse that tells you that your depressive episodes and suicidal ideas you have had before were just cries for help and that I never would have done anything.

Hopefully, you can see the problem despite this only scratching the surface. And I know to a lot of you, this is nothing. I have no scars from beatings, no bruised eyes indicative of any sort of physical abuse but instead I am left with a feeling of helplessness about my situation. But for no longer do I want this situation to be my reality.

The issues that I face currently is that my car is not mine, my bank account is co-operated with my father and I have no place to work at the moment. Leaving me hopeless to find any sort of housing where I live. 

I don't know what to do, or even why I am currently typing this message. Whether I just need those bittersweet words telling me to break my shackles and leave or deal with my issues alone I am truthfully not sure.

What I do know right now is that I need advice; I need advice on what to do and where to go.",25Jun2020,1

During my teenage years I had a lot of issues. And I ended up doing some sick things. 

•I groped my mother at the age of 15 once
•I used to spy on her in the shower and spy on her have sex
•I used to go through her underwear, and wear her clothes
•I used to take inappropriate photos of her.

So yeah, I’m messed up I know. I’ve manage to stop these actions. It’s been almost 2 years since I made these mistakes. And I’m proud that I’ve managed to change, But I still feel heavy guilt and remorse. 

I want to move on in life, make friends, and go out. But I don’t think I deserve to. And I’m just worried that I’m going to carry this for the rest of my life.

I have gone through therapy, but after 7th grade I stopped, tried again in sophomore year, but didn't get anywhere because I was too scared to actually tell the guy anything about myself.

Tbh I'm kind of a failure, don't wanna get a job, dont have good grades, and sure as hell dont wanna do chores.

I've been working on bottling them up because I simply have no other option, I'm too pussy to talk to a therapist, I cant just let it out or I'll get grounded, and I certainly cant just stop.

 I'm also finding it hard to support these protests now as it is affecting my health and my financial assets, and I can't afford to sleep now.

He thinks school is full of drugs and sex, but to me I haven’t seen any of that. When I was younger, around 12, we found a field mouse in my basement, and he wanted me to keep it as a pet. I know keeping wild animals is unsafe and unsanitary, but I decided to do what he wanted me to do rather than what I thought was right. Then we found more mice and my dad even went as far as having me keep the mice we caught in little cube traps in our basement as pets. I had almost a dozen mice and I felt, so, empty that the only things I had in life were wild animals I was told to keep against their will. My dad also made me keep a little vole we found crossing the road one day. It had 3 legs and a stump for a 4th leg and I kept it willingly as I knew it had a better life with me as in the wild it would just be dead within a few days.

My dad hates my grandparents, now I know why, and won’t let us stay with them often, maybe one or 2 days every couple months. I remember my grandfather telling me that is they got custody of us that he would have let me play hockey and have friends and be a normal kid like I always wanted to be. I want to tell my dad that I want to go to public high school for my junior and senior years of high school, and play football, and get my license, (he didn’t want to get my license as insurance is apparently too high even though I offered to pay it if I got paid cash. But that would make my dad angry, and when he gets angry, which is a lot, he yells at people and calls me stuff like “a girl” and “a slacker”, and having your father tel you you aren’t good enough just hurts.

1103,"I was having issues with a GPU and it was still under warranty so I sent it into repair on 2/13.  I paid for extra insurance to cover the $699 graphics card.  It was signed for, with a name and the address of the location it was delivered. Gigabyte shows “received” on the RMA site, yet they said they never got it. I called CS multiple times and they said it was my fault or USPS did not deliver it proper and to submit a claim. 

I went through the postal service and attempted a claim.  Since it was delivered to the correct address and they have gps proof, they denied my claim, and both of my appeals. Calling CS again, they told me that they don’t have it and it was still my fault. Irate, I asked to speak to management. They forwarded me to Chuck Lou, the manager of CS at the Gigabyte repair center. I got his voicemail and left him 2 messages.

I got nothing back. 

I was advised by the Gigabyte subreddit to hit their social media channels, which I did.  I finally got someone else through Facebook Messenger on 3/17/20.  We began discussing and things looked positive.  However, they have stopped corresponding with me on 5/17, I have attached the correspondence I have had in its entirety with them. 

My question is, what can I do now?  All I honestly want is my GPU repaired or a comparable GPU as a replacement.

And today her dad died, after being in a coma for some years. I have already written to her and told her that if she ever needed to talk about it i would be there and listen. However i feel like im making it worse by bringing it up. I just want to help carry the burden, but i dont know how. I need your help.",25Jun2020,1
1107,"Ite so I  [16M] have a good friend of my [15F] and when she's lowkey told me that I'm her only real friend and that supposedly everyone else has left or she hates the fake friends, and I feel sometimes as if when I'm trying to show her that I really care about her and she seems to kinda shrug it off as if it doesn't mean so much, yet she does smile and say that she appreciates it but it feels as if it's not reciprocated in the moment, but later she starts to get supportive and kind and all that when we talk about my problems (that we dont need to get into).

I would really like if yall could tell me what's up, if I'm the one who's overanalyzing or if something else is going on",25Jun2020,1
1108,"Context: I am a 16-year-old girl who has always had trouble making friends. I never really had a friend until my best friend, who I will call G we've been friends for about 3 years now. I was very lonely before I met her. She's just an angel.

Her mom is a hardcore catholic who forbid G from seeing me about three months ago. The only valid reason she did this was that we would smoke weed together, and I can confidently say that I stopped doing drugs on my own terms, and obviously there is no way she will believe that.

The other reasons being that I am not religious (and that somehow equates to having no morals? of course I have morals) and ""don't have good grades"" which is an assumption. I'm not a straight-A student but I am intelligent, and my grades are decent. I care about my education and want to go to college.

G and her other two friends have been caught drinking alcohol (without me there) TWICE. She still allows those two to hang out with her because one of them is a cheerleader with good grades and religious and the other is a competitive dancer. So there is some hypocrisy in this whole thing.

Overall, she forbid me from seeing G because she believes I'm a bad apple and the cause of G's ""bad"" grades. In reality, G is just naturally a black sheep (she hasn't told her mom she doesn't really resonate with Christianity anymore or that she is gay) who doesn't do well in a school setting. Like me, she is also very smart but has a hard time at school. She isn't rebellious, she's super sweet and empathetic.

I totally find the first reason valid, about smoking weed. But the other reasons are pretty much assumptions. I respect her for trying to protect her child, but a lot of it just isn't accurate. If anything I feel like I have been good for her, helping her out of an eating disorder, encouraging her to find her own beliefs, to teach her to be kinder to herself. I'm a shy introvert and not around her house often, and I'm afraid her mom thinks it's because I'm out doing bad things with bad kids. In reality, I'm a good kid, I have a good relationship with my parents (who care about me and don't just let me do whatever I want) I never snuck out or skipped school, I value my education, I have morals, I'm spiritual, I like to read about philosophy, I do yoga, never wanted a boyfriend in high school, and I make jewelry to donate money to kids in Yemen. Those are just a few things about me.

As I said, I am a big introvert who has never had a close friend until G. She is like a soulmate to me. If I lose her I will literally have no friends as I did for most of my life. Her mother is apparently pretty stubborn. I figured I would write her an apology letter to let her know I'm well-spoken and not just a total stoner (I never was a STONER even when I did smoke.) I will find a way to respectfully apologize for smoking weed with G, because I was wrong for that and willing to be held accountable. I will somehow lightly point out her wrong assumptions about me. I might even have my mom talk to her to let her know I'm not just some delinquent. Is there any insight as to how I can go about writing this apology letter/anything else I can do to help? G is extremely important to me and i don't want to lose her.",25Jun2020,1

His videos get no more than 500 views and each video from him I charge $25.

On top of that I'm very short, I have a skinny penis and I'm also ugly. I feel like people care less about me because of this. Therapy is not an option for me.",25Jun2020,1
1111,"So i invited this girl i just met from tinder for a second time to a little party we were doing with my only small tight-knit group of friends, together with my brother and sister in law at someone's friend nice apartment

to give a little hindsight,not so long ago i left a very long relationship and this was the first time i brought a girl to a hangout with my friends, so i was not planning on anything serious, just casual dating

We did a lot of drinking, the usual, i had a little too much as everyone else and was having a nice time, i of blacked out sometime at the night as almost the rest and woke up the next day with a little hangover and just went my day as usual with this girl, everything was fine, just another night of partying.

until i was told by my brother and sister in law that they saw one of my friends and my tinder date being flirtuous,making up, and then mosssssst probably having sex all after i was unconscious in another room the night before

I mean, i honestly don't care that much about the girl because i had just met her and it's just a fling from tinder, but i felt it was a really low blow from my ""friend"", he is what you could call a player, adventurous muscular guy, so he is in no need of any girl's attention

He has always been like the kind to take sometimes advantage of minor not very important situations, little wonky moral, but honestly we all have to a certain degree.. but i never thought he would do this kind of stuff to me, especially since he would always be like gum to a shoe, protective and never leave alone any date he would bring to our parties... Just interesting

And to think i would have never known if it wasn't for my brother actually seeing everything happening and then telling me!

So, i felt like crap for a whole 2 weeks, called both of them on their stuff, it was a he said she said situation, he says she started, she says he started it. I feel it was middle ground, both of them wanted it

Deleted the girl and blocked my friend on all social media, he decided to leave our group chat by himself, so i decided to tell the rest of the group the story. everyone felt kind of shocked

Am i possibly overreacting? I mean we have had a lot of fun times, memories, I've met this guys close to 5 years now, i even went to his graduation and i can't help to feel very contradicted. I'm not the best at making friends, and long friendships at that. So losing a long time friend to a strange situation like this makes me confused

We're all in our early 20's by the way

Tl;dr: at a little party where everyone was doing heavy drinking i brought a date form tinder we were doing fine, i passed out and later next day i was told my friend and my date hooked up

&amp;#x200B;

I know i should not drink until i pass out and it was not classy, i'm trying to change that, just everyone was doing it. And also i was with people i felt a lot of trust so i never tought anything bad would happen",25Jun2020,1
1112,"I have cut my brother off from my life for nearly a year now. He makes terrible decisions and seems to only care about himself. The tipping point for me was when he was arrested on a couple of felony charges. 

I have been wrestling with the stress of keeping him out of my life as we were quite close but I feel if I just act like nothing happened he won’t learn from what he did or reflect on how he has made me and others in the family feel. 

Any advice for dealing with this moving forward?",25Jun2020,1
