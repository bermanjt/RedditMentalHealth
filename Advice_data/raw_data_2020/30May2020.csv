0,"I’ve had enough of this life.

I don’t know where to start this post so I’ll just jump right in. I’ve had enough of this life. I turned 18 a couple months ago and I know a lot of people always say “there’s so much ahead of you” or “it gets better” but I just don’t think that’s the case. 

I’ve had severe depression and anxiety for a long while. A lot of this is because events that have happened in my life that caused me to always expect the unexpected but also my mother suffers from the same. I’ve made mistakes, I became a better person for them but it got me no where and ultimately I lost a lot to reach that. My childhood is filled with being bullied from a very young age, rejection and self dependency due to the work situations with my parents (long hour minimum wage).

I would say that the most important factor for me was my previous girlfriend and our breakup. I messed up a lot and before I came to the realisation of what I was doing, it was too late. At that point I was begging for a relationship and crying on the phone to someone who would laugh right back at me. She was justified in doing so, but it hurt. After, I found out that she had also messed up but had kept things from me. Sending explicit pictures to people I had told her caused me to feel insecure and anxious. Doing things that I had nightmares about. It doesn’t justify any of my actions, but I became a much better and mature person because of it. For my future relationships: I learned to be as clear as possible in order to make a clear picture of my thoughts so there was no mistrust. I ultimately made sure that I was truthful to myself and that I knew my intentions with all of my actions, making sure that I would never make the same mistakes or place myself (and anyone else) in unnecessary positions.

This is where my current girlfriend comes in. Very shortly after my breakup, we decided to get together. She accepted how I was feeling since I made it clear day in day out where my head was at. She helped me move on and slowly after, I let myself be okay with being in love with her. This time I made sure I did everything properly, clearly and, most importantly, with the self awareness to trust myself in my actions. I made sure to show her just how much I loved her, avoided every risk of loosing her and did everything to nurture our relationship. She messaged a lot of people, and because of my insecurities I questioned it, but I didn’t let it affect us and so I believed everything she told me “just friends” e.t.c. We had ups and downs but I can proudly say I never messed anything up. 

Then came a moment where she had to go on holiday for a month and I had to go abroad too, meaning we would only see eachother for a week when we both got back before she went to a festival. When that week came I did everything to show her I missed her and I made sure she had the happiest time. Well she went. Long story short, my depression got to me one night and I told her over and over how extreme it felt. Little did I know she was cheating on me and replying slowly because of it. 

She came back. I had my suspicions due to photos she’d post and when she came to my house she did a terrible job at hiding that she didn’t want me to see her phone. When I confronted her, shaking from my anxiety and feeling really nauseous, she blamed my problems and “my paranoia”. I of course found out. She begged me to stay even though I knew I couldn’t. I stayed, very reluctantly. 

Since, we’ve had our ups and downs again. I found messages of her bragging to other guys about cheating on me and I felt so embarrassed. She gave them so much power over me, the likes of “I’m glad he can’t do anything” and her replying “I’m happy you’re happy”. More lying and more hiding on her part, but it’s seems to have smoothed over since.

Now I’m here. It’s my exes birthday today. In the almost 3 years since our break up I’ve done everything to better myself, progress and get the right help. I have finished my anxiety counselling and can confront surface level stuff, but they recommended proper counselling for the deeper rooted issues. I have adapted to a routine where I no longer smoke weed and constantly exercise so I can feel like I’ve done “good enough”. 

Yet that’s my problem. 3 years. In these 3 years I have completely lost myself. My self confidence has been ripped from me and I no longer feel comfortable being awake. I remember the first month of the break up, I would sleep constantly because I never wanted to be awake. I remember it had been 3 months and I thought “is this feeling ever going to end?”. Here I am. It hasn’t ended, it’s gotten worse. I’m stuck in a relationship where I still love her and she hasn’t done anything in a very long time, doing everything in that time to show me she changed but I still feel as though she doesn’t love me the way I do, her. I love my family so much. I love my friends. But I can’t do this anymore. I can’t withstand 3 more years of being given hope for it to be ripped. Bettering myself just to be embarrassed. Distracting myself in work that gets no exposure. I make music. Everyone tells me it’s very good and I put all my passion into it. But this is just too much. I can’t hope any longer. I can’t wait for a chance at a life I will never have. My family was relying on me to reward their sacrifices, and I’m relying on luck to bring me that. I can’t feel like this anymore. This is my default, and this default is definitely not life. I don’t know where to go because I love the people around me and don’t want them to suffer, but it seems as though I have no other answer than to wait and hope. I can’t do that anymore.

How do I live? Am I just supposed to wait and hope it gets easier?",30May2020,1
1,"

So, I started dating someone pretty recently and I hope it works for the long run.. it's pretty rare I even find that type of interest in someone else and my bestfriend (of 7 years now) also knows this. I moved pretty far from home about 2months ago, and I let my bestfriend come and live with me for the adventure and experience with the promise in return that they would pay rent and help with chores, since they were living in a somewhat abusive home. 
Only 2weeks after they moved in, they found my bfs ex on tinder and before they even started chatting one of our friends even told him this! And who she was. Then he decides he wants to hookup with her in MY house. I didn't support it, and I told him it made me uncomfortable, I told him how shitty it was to do this days before and that if he did, I would be upset about it. And he did. He slept with her and now it's done. So to put it into more perspective; he isn't the type to hookup, so now I'm afraid he might feel some sort of emotional attachment to her. I can't tell him who to date or fuck, and clearly he doesn't care. But I'm not going to kick him out, and I don't even know if I have a right to be upset. What if he wants to be her friend or date or keep hooking up? 
I know she only did it because it might make me or her ex uncomfortable (and it does). What should I do? I'm honestly so upset.",30May2020,1
2,"So to make a long story short I'll skip some of the small details...

I woke up to my best friend/soul sister's husband feeling on me while I was asleep on the couch. He was rubbing my leg all the way up to my ass. I told my best friend and the friendship basically ended even though she believed me. So her husband sent me a text today and asked if he could call me so I said yes. He wants me to smooth things over by saying that he was just rubbing my calf and must have been asleep when he was rubbing up to my ass and pretend like everything is fine. Well I don't want to lie to her but I don't want to lose her either. She's all I have. So if I go along with this story, I have my best friend back. But I also know what his true intentions were because he made them perfectly clear. I've never needed her as much as I need her in my life right now so I'm torn on what to do.

I seem to have a very old-fashioned conscience and try to do the right thing, try to treat people how I want to be treated so I'm very torn on what to do right now. He obviously knows that I'm not interested so I don't think that will be a problem again and if it is I definitely do not have a problem letting him know I'm not interested. I just really can't afford to lose her right now. She's all I have.",30May2020,1
3,"Well, I'm a 27 year old single guy. I live alone and don't work the greatest job. I've been depressed for years and have been on two different antidepressants over the years. I live in a rural town that doesn't have the best job opportunities. I have a B.A in Communications but that's worthless in the eyes of most employers. I have about $13,000 saved up. It's really just cushion money for emergencies, but I was thinking of going somewhere. I don't know what I'd do, maybe go sightseeing. I'd love to go to Japan or something, but might be better just to go somewhere in the country. I've never really left Texas. Only state I went to was New York City and that was fun, but I was with my family. I've never really traveled alone, so it is a scary thought. 

I just feel stagnant. I'm not going anywhere and I have no friends. My mom hates my current job but she's a big worry wort and I know she wouldn't like the idea of me traveling by myself and she'd probably ask things like ""Where would you go? What would you do?"" and of course I don't know the answers to that. I suppose a train trip would be nice, maybe like a long train trip on a sleeper car? I wonder if I could just go to different states just exploring and sightseeing? I guess that's unrealistic and kind of crazy, especially right now with the COVID-19 pandemic going on. I also suppose it's a bit crazy to just up and quit your job to go traveling or something? If I told my parents this they'd think I was insane. 

There's just nothing in this town for me. I know there isn't. I could move but I don't know where to move to. I don't know what I want to do. Traveling sounds fun, but I suppose doing it alone is kind of depressing. My mom would worry every second that I was gone and obviously I'd have to consider stuff like where I'd live and then you have to budget a trip. Guess you can't really just sporadically decide to quit your job and get on a train and go travel or something. My job doesn't mean much to me anyway. It's not an amazing job and I don't really make good money or anything. I'm just trying to say that it doesn't bother me to leave it. I guess my biggest concern is that I won't gain anything from traveling. It might be relaxing and fun but I might just spend all my savings and then come back home to nothing. I guess it's not very realistic. As for vacation time, well, my company has archaic benefits so I don't get much vacation time right off the bat. I've been there two years but only get about a week worth of vacation time. The problem is that I need all my vacation time because my parents and I are going on a cruise in November, so I really can't burn any vacation time even if I wanted to do so. 

It's just so stagnating. I'm not going anywhere. I want to travel or do something. As I said, going to Japan is a big trip I'd love to take, but I don't really speak Japanese and going to a foreign country alone is a scary thought. And besides, even if I quit my job and go travel for a bit. I'd just come back but unemployed.",30May2020,1
4,"A few weeks ago, I decided I didn't want to fell like garbage anymore. I decided to start drinking more water, engage in more hobbies, have a better sleep schedule, limit my screen time, exercise, eat healthier, mediate, journal, actually force myself to have decent hygiene, all this crap, and yet I still kind of feel like trash.

This is the first time that I've had a decent schedule and can actually follow it, but I still feel so empty and unfulfilled. I don't know what to add or take away to make myself feel any better. My quality of life is better so I don't feel deeply upset about my life all the time, but I don't feel good either. I can feel positive emotions, but they're fleeting.

I don't really know what I'm doing wrong. Thanks in advance for advice.",30May2020,1

Today he has been really getting on to me about how I'm lazy because all I do is read and play doom (which he complains about if I don't play too because his logic is backwards). I don't have anything better to do with my time at my Dad's and he knows this but he still complains. Apparently according to him reading outside instead of inside is productive for some reason, but it was way too bright outside to day so I wouldn't have been able to see the book well. Tomorrow he's going to make me wash his car but I'm dreading it because he doesn't have the right stuff for the job and nothing is ever good enough for him. I hate it when he says I only need a car sponge and a single bucket because I'm a car enthusiast and I know that isn't right, but he has to be right all the time. I want to stand up for myself as I'm 16 and should be able to make my own decisions but I don't want to upset him out of the blue because even though I've been wanting to for a while, it would be totally unexpected because I've never shown any signs of anger towards him in his presence. At the end of the day he is my Dad and I love him most of the time but it's really hard to when he gets this way. Any advice for me?

We can’t have sex at my house cause he is only allowed over when my parents are home and my door must stay open so obviously I’m to nervous to try anything with him then cause we could get caught. However at his house his mom gives us our privacy to shut the door which gives us the chance to do it. This is the first guy and the first relationship where I have ever had sex...in the beginning it was knew and excited so of course I was super horny and wanted to do it all the time. But around 5 months in I just didn’t feel the need to do it every time we are together. I still love having sex with him. I’m just not ALWAYS in the mood. However, if i don’t want to do anything just one day after multiple days of doing stuff, he doesn’t say anything at the time but around the next day when we are on the phone he always brings it up and he is upset like we don’t have sex enough. It just makes me feel like I have to have sex with him every time we are together in order for him to be happy and I don’t know how to get how I feel across to him. I know he loves and cares about me he just lets this shit go to his head and he thinks it means I’m not sexually attracted to him anymore or something like that. Could someone please just help me out on what to do about it?

I got an iPhone 11 a few weeks ago and have a perfectly working iPhone Xs max. I got the iPhone X last year from amazon seller. No cracks in the screen/glass. Speakers work. Face ID works. The only park of the phone that doesn’t work is the very very far right side of the screen (about 1cm) the entire way down and the P and L keys don’t always work. You have to swipe and hold press down weirdly to get the buttons to register. It’s always been like that and I took it to apple but phone isn’t under contract anymore. So I’ve just dealt with it. That’s the only part that doesn’t work 100%. It will work you just have to maneuver weirdly. Other than that the phone is unlocked and ready to roll. Camera and everything else work.

I deleted the app and I talk to my mom about it hoping she was on my side about it. She said, “It’s not like he’s stalking you, he’s your dad. And it for safety.” And I told her I’m not keeping the app anymore. If they need my location I’ll send it to them via find my iPhone.

12,"My boyfriend and I were planning to travel out of LAX to Ohio for his sister's birthday in June. These plans were made sometime in January I believe. Obviously I have pushed for that not to happen as it is not an essential trip, but I guess his dad is now going since we are not. Is it still accurate we are only supposed to be traveling domestically for essential reasons, like work and emergencies?

His parents (in their fifties) invited me to live with them at the beginning of April, near the start of the stay at home orders, since they know I was trying to take social distancing seriously and not come over at all due to my roommate who was still working. I was worried to spread something to them. At that time, they were following the recommendations. But now, his mom is saying that they ""are not taking things so seriously."" His mom just came back days ago from travel to see that same sister since apparently the sister ""asked her to"" as she is dealing with some mental health problems. Not sure why things have changed, probably since they follow conservative media, but any advice on how to deal with this? They said I can move back in with my roommate when I'm ready and still come over regularly, but my boyfriend and I feel that will just expose them to even more potential spread. They know that my boyfriend and I have plans of me being with them for longer and they seem to understand that. I just worry they're gonna think I'm taking things too seriously.

14,"When our son was 6, he accidentally stabbed himself in the cheek with a sharpened pencil.  After the puncture wound healed, it became apparent that the pencil had left a permanent mark.  It's bluish gray and a little larger than a freckle.

This is known as a [pencil tattoo](https://www.today.com/style/pencil-stabbing-tattoo-marks-go-viral-twitter-t146505).  The graphite from the pencil becomes lodged in the dermis, the same place the ink ends up in an ordinary tattoo.  Some people's pencil tattoos fade with time, while others leave a lifelong mark.

Most people get pencil tattoos on their arms or hands -- places where you're likely to accidentally get a pencil stab -- but because our son's mark is on a prominent part of his face, I'm concerned that he may become more self-conscious about it as he enters his teenage years.

I've heard that laser treatments can erase these marks, but I'm wondering whether we should wait until he's 18 and can seek them out independently, or whether we should consider the possibility of having it removed while he's still a minor.

Speaking of minor, I acknowledge that it's a very minor cosmetic issue, and that many other people have much more prominent naturally occurring moles and birthmarks, and I don't mean to suggest that it's a big deal.  I have no intention of encouraging him to feel as if it's something that should be removed.  But it would be naive to expect that he might never feel self-conscious about it or wish to have it removed, and so I'd like to be prepared, and I'm not sure if it's the sort of thing that is better dealt with as early as possible or not.",30May2020,1

27,"I’ll preface this post by saying that I’m aware that calling protective services would be the logical answer, but I want to explain how it’s not that simple. 

I’ve lived in my current home, a flat attached to four other homes, for over a decade now, in a very low income area. On the top portion of the house attached to ours lives a family of six - a grandmother, her two daughters, and the three daughters of one of those daughters. We’re admittedly not sociable people but we’re always polite to our neighbours, and lockdown has been really bringing us all together. 

My concern for these three young girls started a while back. They are always being shouted at - nearly every time I see them they are in tears. I often give their mother the benefit of the doubt and suggest to myself that they may just be having childish tantrums. They’re always outside, and we occasionally hear them being shouted at through the walls. This alone didn’t worry me too much - their mother may have been particularly strict, or short tempered, but that didn’t necessarily translate to neglect. Today however, I’m beginning to think otherwise.

I was relaxing in my bedroom when I heard the three girls and my mother in my living room - this surprised me, as I didn’t think my mother had ever spoken to them before (context: my mother is a middle aged woman with severe mobility issues. She isn’t wheelchair bound and walks with the aid of crutches and painkillers, but is otherwise housebound and has been unable to leave the house without constant help for over a decade now) turns out the girls had come over because they wanted to meet our pets (four guinea pigs and a parrot) and I was more than happy to help my mother show them the animals. The issue however, was that the girls were absolutely filthy. I would put it on them having been playing outside all day, but their faces were covered in food and dirt, as were their hands, and the dirt we found under one of the girls nails on both her hands and her feet couldn’t have possibly been there for only a day. The oldest girl, who’s around 10 I think, her two front teeth had began to rot, and were black in places. The middle girl had a nasty cut to one of her toes that’s she’s apparently gotten that day that her mother hadn’t cleaned up, and so my mother sat her down and tried to wash and bandage the area, but had to stop when the girls mother and auntie knocked on our front door (they knew the girls were there, they were just checking in) and my mother couldn’t bandage the toe as well as she’d liked. The girls toenails were also so long that they were beginning to curl under, and we were going to clip them prior to her mother returning, but when she arrived we didn’t want to come across as disrespectful.

The three girls, emotionally at least, were bouncing off of the walls and were very talkative and happy. They seemed delighted to be receiving attention. The oldest one found out I had a tiktok (ironically, I swear) and asked me to follow her account. Upon viewing her videos, I could see that their home was very dirty and messy. One of the girls was also quite sunburnt.

I’m at a crossroads. On the one hand, I know that these girls are clearly not being cared for 100% adequately, and I strongly want to help them in any way that I can. On the other, I know that their mother is a single mother struggling financially with three kids, and isn’t exactly healthy herself. What I’m worried most about however, is the consequences that may come with calling social services to check on the kids. Their family will know it was us, there’s no doubt in my mind, especially now that they know we’ve spoken with the girls and seen how dirty they were. The area that I live in is rough, and whilst I’m friendly with a lot of my neighbours, I’ve also seen them turn quite viciously against others. I’m worried that if they realise it was us, they would turn aggressive, which in the community I live in could be dangerous. I’ve seen people get beaten with golf clubs and baseball bats for less. If it was just me, I wouldn’t be as concerned, but as my mother is housebound and disabled it puts her at a much higher risk. I don’t want to do anything that could possibly make us a target. 

I’m really unsure of what to do. Right now I’m lucky enough to live only a door down from these kids who have taken a liking to me, and I’ve let them know they’re welcome at our home anytime. I can keep an eye on them, and I can intervene if I see something I don’t like. I’m scared that that won’t be enough, and I don’t want to fail vulnerable kids, but at the same time I don’t want my family to be subjected to any abuse.

Any advice would be much appreciated - please don’t tell me any of my concerns for my own family are selfish, I’ve already called myself that many times. I’ve been on the verge of tears thinking about these kids, and I can assure you I truly do want to help them.",30May2020,1

37,"Alright so a bit of backstory, I’ve know these two guys for about 10 years now since middle school, we’ve always been good friends and have fallen out a few times. I’ve never been close to them hobby wise, all my friends enjoyed marvel and mortal kombat and all that jazz and I never had anything to click with them. 

So Minecraft dungeons just came out, and I was super pumped because we use to play Minecraft together and figured it would help me get closer to them. Only problem was they wanted to play it, just didn’t want to buy it. So I bought it for all three of us. 

It’s been a few days and I’ve grinded quite a bit by myself, and just realized they haven’t even started. How do I go about telling them they don’t have to feel obligated to play it just because I bought it. 

I could care less if they enjoy it, we could find another thing to do together, i just don’t think they would tell me since they feel bad I bought it for them. I don’t want to bring attention to the fact they don’t play at all because I don’t want to make them feel even worse.

My anxiety keeps me up most nights and instead of trying to sleep it off I just find something productive to do so I end up sleeping at 2-3am and it's been this way since. But yeah, he's the kind of person where he tells you things and even if it's wrong or over exaggerated, you cannot correct him. He's either gonna be mad or he just brushes it off. This just applies to everything I try to tell him. He's the kind of person where he cannot accept what other people tell him. Every ""open discussion"" with him will always end up with him saying okay but never going forward with it. It has gotten to the point where I just give up trying to correct him when he starts nagging. (His nagging can go on and on repeating the same thing for almost an hour). His mindset is also one of the reasons my mom left him. Yes it's that bad. He's a good father in general but this part of him bothers me so much that I'm just proud myself to not have the same mindset and attitude like he does. What can I do man jeez",30May2020,1
39,"Hello, I'm currently 24 and at the point where I get agitated when I think about my father. He wants to be buddies (He once told me that this is one of his dreams in life) but we have nothing in common. 

He's a very self involved person, a conversation with him consists of him not really listening, not listening, and or judging you (I always feel sad/annoyed after talking ""with"" him), He just wants to talk about stuff he's already told me about countless times, or city planing of a place I strongly dislike, or a restaurant idea he has had for 4 years (feels like he's living in a dreamworld with this stuff) that's all he talks about, I have better conversations with the clerk at a convince store than with him. 

I listen and try to be there for him, but its too much and been for too long, Ive personally had a rough go mentally for 7 years, and for the last 4 years my father has put his problems on me, venting about his relationships or lack of one, his unhappiness with his career, lack of friends, etc. I don't want him to go through that stuff alone but I was not in the right spot to do that for someone, he didn't have anybody else tho, so I had to (My brother can be a asshole)

He text's me things that just annoy me or to just say hi 4-5 days a week at least, and every Friday/Saturday he expects me to hang out, a little is never enough. I feel like a visit once every two weeks and a few texts or a call is manageable for me.

The main gist of the problem is I love him, but I do not like how he treats/talks to me (feels like he doesn't view me as a adult/person) I don't want to remove him from my life, but I can not continue with the stress he causes in my life. 

Should I tell him the truth? any tricks for distancing a family member without getting rid of them? I feel like he will be easier to deal with when I settle down and have kids (except for the probable dementia) just don't think ill make it that long.",30May2020,1
40,"So I’m currently a rising Junior in college majoring in Mechanical Engineering and I chose that major because I love new technology and building things. I’ve built 2 desktops and I was addicted to legos as a kid and I have knack with computers and software in general. I enjoy helping people especially with technology issues that they encounter. I have lost count at the amount of times that I’ve helped my immediate family with something tech related, including my sisters that are in HS who have issues with their phone or PC. I did some research about switching majors and I saw that having a degree in IT is not required for the majority of IT jobs and tons of people have made careers in IT without even needing to attend a traditional college. I’ve been pretty unhappy in a lot of my classes and I don’t see myself enjoying working in the engineering field long term.

42,"Okay so just a little about me first, I'm a 21 year old female. I've currently been single for about 6 months now. It was a super toxic relationship and I didn't really get to do much during those years that I was dating that person. 

Now, I'm finally ready to start going out to new places, and traveling but everyone (my mom, dad and brother) are always telling me not to, or telling me that I should get other people to go with me. Problem with that though, is I don't have many friends. I was more concerned in high school till recently with having a boyfriend that I never really made close friends in school. My brother and I are really close, so I ask him sometimes to go out with me but sometimes I can tell he just wants to stay home. I'm also getting to the point though, that I don't want to keep waiting around on people to go out with me because then I feel like I'll never get to do the things that I want to. And I would rather do things by myself than force friendships just to be able to go out.

So I guess I just need some advice on how to go out by yourself. Would it be weird to go to a brewery and have a few beers alone? Or a nice restaurant that requires reservations? I have so many restaurants, bars, and cool places around the city where I live that I want to go to. Or some tips on traveling alone would be cool too. I also have a lot of day trips that I want to take, there are a lot of really cool hiking places that are about a 2 hour drive from where I live. I also want to go to the beach, but my parents are against me going by myself. I get that something ""could"" happen, but I don't think living my life in fear is the way to go either. Would it be that bad of an idea to go by myself?

There are obvious things that I wouldn't do by myself. For example, I wouldn't go to a music festival, concert, or a bigger city like Atlanta alone. But I'm just already such a cautious person, I don't think I would have a problem with the places that I'm thinking of. I don't even like to stay up or be out late. Most nights I'm in bed by ten or earlier.

So I guess in short, should I just start going to the places that I want to? I don't want to wait around on other people for forever. And also, just some tips on doing things alone?",30May2020,1

So recently my bestfriend and only friend really took her own life and i feel shit about it cuz she was litteraly the only person that would try to cheer me up and even say hey to me. She was the first person in 6-7 years that even asked if i wanted to hang out and thats not even a joke man

Like at school example could satnd between 5 of my ""friends"" or w/e they are and some1 could come and i would say hi and they would ignore fully and say hi to the 5 other guys and if i tried to speak to any of them they wouldnt even bother look at me and thats how it has been for my school life etc

I have never been invited to a party in my life other than school parties were everyone is invited and the 2 times i went i could be doing whatever and if i remeber right only 1-2 teacthers said hi to me so feelsbadman (and i was there for the whole party)

I tried a lot of things like improving on myself with working out trying to be more positive even tried new games out and no one even seems to care about me (other than my friend) not even my parents they dont care really.

Like if i tried to change my hair i dindt even get a single looks decent all just making fun of me no matter what i did i tried so much shit that i dont even know what to do. The only person i ever could talk to dealt with shit that my stupid head couldnt even pick up that she was dealing with it and i feel really shit about it cuz she was the only person that would bother asking how my day was the only person that even wanted to talk to me really and everything i care about i kinda lose randomly used to have a dog i bought with my own money that i worked for one day when i came home my mom gave it away cuz she dindt like it.

I have been playing games for years now only gotten like 2-3 friends and they all randomly ghosted me got no one to play with anymore every community i get in no one seems to want me there and im not even been rude or mean or anything imo

And if you think this is like a joke or something thats fine laugh at it w/e i dont really care anymore

Some context:
When I was 12 I wanted a second dog more than anything in the world. Now, obviously, I was old enough to know better, but not really old enough to understand what that meant in terms of my family dynamics. My dad was all on board. If it were up to him, he would have as many dogs as would fit in the house. My mother, however, was well content with the one large dog. Nevertheless, on my 13th birthday my dad adopted a small corgi-cocker spaniel mix. 

Let's just say my mother was not happy.

And well, while my brother while still 14 when at all happened, he was still nevertheless just as much of a child as I. Being a child, in combination of some.. other factors, he went with my mother's opinion almost to an irrational extent. In turn he took an irrational hatred to the new family member. 

Jump some years later and we're all home for quarantine and we're down to just the one dog (unfortunately the large one passed from old age) However, when I say ""all"" I mean.. well just me, my mom, and my brother. I love my dog, now named Hunter, and while I can see looking back how the home for him isn't ideal, he never is abused and I wouldn't trade him for anything in the world. 

As the title says, however, my brother does repeatedly kick him and calls him names. He never hurts him. This I'm very grateful for. But he does take great joy in making him uncomfortable. And, I don't know, call me crazy but I think kicking or shoving a dog no matter if the dog is hurt or not is down right awful. He no longer lives with him in normal circumstances, but as long as quarantine lasts we're stuck together.

Is it weird I'm hurt whenever he even calls him names? I'm definitely all on my mom's side and at this point I'm over the whole idea of my father to begin with. If it makes any difference though, I have a suspicion my brother isn't quite. 
What should I do, though? I've tried talking to him but he doesn't seem to care. Am I overreacting?",30May2020,1

Well, just before quarantine she got a boyfriend and they've spent all this time together. We are both pretty young but legal adult age. It's the first serious serious boyfriend she has. The thing is, I can help but feel a tremendous jealousy. I've never had a boyfriend, even the times I had sex I didn't enjoy it that much. I already know some details because of close friends of Instagram and they are like the perfect couple etc. 

I know when we meet up she's gonna to explain me the details but I don't want to hear any of that. Soon or late I'll have to meet her because I don't want to lose our friendship but at the same I don't want to listen about that.

66,"My mother is looking into buying a house and is in need of financial help.

A bit of background: We grew up as a low-income family and I never took my mom to be good with money (I've made some bad financial choices too). English is also her second language so I feel she can get suckered into things. I'm an adult now, probably classify as middle class, so I make enough to have money on the side. Whenever my mom asked for money before, I always treated it as something I didn't expect back.

So she got some inheritance and wants to use the extra money to purchase a house, with my help. I don't want to have my name down in anything so we agreed I'd loan her $10k and she would pay me back when she sells the house (or give the house to me if she passes though I really don't want this responsibility). She got an estimate for how much of a loan she could get and found a house within that range. I was going have an official note to legalize our part (as mentioned before, any borrowed money before I didn't expect back but this is significant dough).

Now I've learned the loan approval relies on the $10k being a *gift* and she wants me to sign a form stating so.  At this point, I'm torn on what to do. I assume *legally* signing this makes my original note invalid, and would then rely on the good will of my mother to return the money in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for legal advice, but rather the human advice. It's not like I need this money, I have some far off dream that I could retire early if I save and invest, but then I feel guilty of that selfish thought of wanting to retire early rather than help my mother who is in a worse position than myself. Any advice on how I could think this through and decide what to do? If you were in this position, would you help out?

Here’s the story: I introduced her to a new chill coworker that I knew she would vibe with. Which is awesome! However, in less than 5 months the person I introduced her to and her bf became close to my best friend and her bf. No, I am not jealous. I am very happy. Everyone needs friends. They began doing things and then going on trips together all of them. So the question started pondering through my mind...and I confronted her about it. I told her how I felt and asked a question. I told her I notice you and (the new friend and bf) and your bf have been doing a lot of stuff together lately. That’s awesome! Then I proceeded to ask we have been friends four years almost and you have met my wife multiple times, but why have we never hung out or met your bf? Is it because I am gay?She got extremely defensive claiming I was playing the gay card? (Didn’t know that existed) I told her if it is because I am gay I get it I understand.

74,"My (a man) ex, ""X"" (a woman), was my abusive partner for a long time. It only started to get physically abusive towards the very end. 

X started dating Y (male). While they were dating, X would come onto me often and get upset when I rejected her advances. I pressured her to tell Y about this, because I think cheating is horrible, and she claims she eventually did. 

One time, when I rejected her advances, because she was in a relationship, she sexually assaulted me. She was very drunk. She got on top of me, hit me, stuck her hands down my pants, and just kept touching me while biting me, hitting me, spitting at me, and yelling. I was too afraid to fight her off because she threatened suicide often when I tried to kick her out of my place, and I have a lot of suicide related trauma. 

Anyway, I'm not in contact with either of them. They are both pretty awful to me and it's been months since they moved away and got engaged. 

Do you think I should call up Y, X's new fiancé, and tell him what she did to me? I feel like he might not even believe me, but if I was engaged to someone who did that, especially during the time we were together, it would be an automatic dealbreaker, so I personally would want to know. 

But I also don't want to just be an insane home wrecker and I want to move on with my life, which is already difficult, because I have flashbacks to the assault very often and nightmares about X most nights, and I feel like this could open up a lot of retraumatizing. I also don't even know how legitimate I feel sexual assault by a woman against a man ""is"" or will be taken, especially if it's a ""one time thing"".

75,"Some background info:
I’m currently 16f. My dad and I don’t live together. I’ve only met him a few years ago due to previous family drama, but since then, we love spending time together by taking hikes, going to parks, restaurants, theatres, malls, cooking, etc. He calls me daily for a few minutes just to check up on how I’m doing. He’s made an instagram account to see what I’m doing. He really tries to he involved in my life as much as possible. 

The problem: 
I started feeling suffocated by how much attention my dad is giving me. I have a trauma from my past relating to my step-dad trying to get “too close to me” (the problem with my step-dad has been resolved already, don’t worry) and began overthinking about the time I’ve spent with my dad. He does not know about this trauma. When we’re in his car, he would always try to give me these massages on my back and shoulders  and putting his hand under my shirt. Whenever we go to his house, he always tries to give me foot massages along with what I mentioned earlier. He always talks about my figure, how I should be working out more (he signed me up for a gym before quarantine), how I’m gaining to much weight around my hips, and has even smacked my behind in the past. I thought this was normal father-daughter stuff at first, but I started getting suspicious because of my trauma and the fact that he doesn’t do these things when my step-mom is around. 

We’re currently not on talking terms because he continuously wants to go outside during quarantine, claiming he’s “different” from other people, and we haven’t been talking for about a month now. I know he’s doing fine because he’s posting about his fun road trips and places he’s visiting. 

I don’t know how to tell my dad about how uncomfortable he’s making me feel or even how to bring up what happened to me in the past. I don’t even know how to talk to him after his ridiculous views of being “different” compared to others during quarantine. How do I talk to my dad about these things?",30May2020,1

77,"Today my county announced that they will finally be entering phase 1 of reopening on Monday, June 1st, and I'm dreading the return to my job. I work for my parent's flower shop business, I hate it but I don't really have the option to quit unless I literally walk away. Long story short, my parents (67M &amp; 62F) have been running a flower shop business for over 30 years. Mom basically handled all the paperwork and back end stuff, while dad mostly handled physical labor stuff. During my last years of high school and through out college mom started to develop early onset dementia and slowly started being unable to do a lot of the work she could do. Dad, instead of taking up those responsibilities himself, tried pushing it onto our relatives. Dad has temper issues and narcissistic tendencies, ends up pushing away said relatives. Tries pushing it onto my older brother, he puts up with it for years despite the bad relationship he has with my dad because he felt like he owed it to my mom. However, last summer I returned from college and my dad basically used that as an excuse to suddenly push away my brother too, now dumping all that responsibility on to me.

I've been putting up with it for barely a year now, and I absolutely hate it. I barely know how to run a business and I was just thrown into the deep end. Anytime I didn't know how to do something, my dad obviously didn't know because he never had to take care of that. Anytime my dad asks me take care of something, and I don't know how to, I get chewed out for it. I hated this job, and it was day in, day out, 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. But I felt like I couldn't quit because I couldn't just walk out on my deteriorating mother. My parent's had been trying to sell the business for a few years now, so that they can finally retire. I figured I just gotta put up with it till the store got sold right? Months past, and quickly my mental health deteriorated. It legitimately got to the point where I was contemplating suicide, because I did not want to deal with the constant problems and responsibilities being dumped onto me and was tired of fighting with my dad every other day.

The coronavirus and stay-at-home order was honestly a blessing in disguise. I know its terrible to say that but it was for me. It meant the store had to be closed because we're non-essential. I finally could get a break from the constant work and stress. I even finally got to see a therapist for my mental health. I was even hoping that maybe the store would finally get sold, or maybe my dad would finally close the store down for good. But of course, that was all just wishful thinking. Now that things are reopening, it means I have to return to this job I hate. I'm dreading it and I feel like there's no escape.

**TL;DR** Got dragged into family business because dad kept trying to push responsibilities on to relatives and older brother, only to end up pushing them all away. Was working 10 hour days 6 days a week where I was constantly fighting with my dad and way in over my head trying to basically run a business. Couldn't quit because I felt like couldn't walk away from slowly deteriorating mother. Coronavirus happened and temporarily closed family business. Finally got some needed time off, was hoping that the business would finally get sold so parents could retire and I could move on from all this. County is starting to reopen now, and I'm dreading having to go back to this job.",30May2020,1
78,"Me (20m) and my SO (20f) talked recently about where we want our sex life to go.

Due to this I also agreed that I couldn't have what I wanted (fmf) because it isn't fair of me to expect her to compromise for me when I couldn't do the same, but I cant shake the feeling that I've let her down and that I'm holding her back. So I'm looking for advice from anyone who has either had a threesome with an SO: how did it go?, was it awkward after?

81,"I’m tired of this. Everyone tells me I’m wanted and loved but no one wants me. This goes out as the biggest “fuck you” to everyone who says shit like this. Why? Because I just got yelled at for being realistic about my future. One of my friends always tells me “you aren’t ugly” “it will happen some day” and the fact that I believed this proves how stupidly fucking dense I am. I’m given all sorts of advice about what makes girls happy and what makes them like you. All of it is wrong. Since early elementary school, I’m the kid that people say “ew” to. The person no one loves. In 6th grade, I tried to date one of my best friends and I really thought she would say yes, she decided she “didn’t want a relationship till hs.” She got in one next year. Then I met a girl after a hurricane when she stayed at my house due to her electricity going out. We became great friends and went out to lunch together. I told her I liked her, she said “my mom won’t let me date” then she dropped me and she never talked to me again. A few months later, she posted a picture of the boy she was dating on Instagram. I decided dating sucked and I needed self improvement. “Self improved” to a point where I thought I wasn’t the ugliest person in the planet. Finally, right? Then 10th grade rolls around years later. I meet this wonderful girl through a friend. We become very good friends and talk about shit I wouldn’t even talk about with my parents. So I decide maybe she’s someone who will finally date me. I drop a few hints. Nothing. I tried a few months later and still got nothing. Then I gave up. I tried to forget. Around February, I met someone online and tried dating her, she was just horny all the time, come to find out, she didn’t even like me, she was just looking for sex, she then hit up all my friends too. A little after this I just lost all hope. Had to get put on anti depressants for it. I always have people tell me how handsome I am and “stop calling yourself ugly.” At this point I don’t even believe them any more. I made a reddit post asking people my age to rate me, I got one comment, a girl my age flirting. I jumped as I nowhere near expected this. I woke up the next day with a cute girl showing interest. It was also the day I get my Drivers license. She asked if we could call and talk. I told her I’d call her after I got my license. I got home after and messaged her and got no response, I thought nothing of it. My friends invited me to bike over and then swim, had fun. Came home and went to shower. I asked the girl again when we could call, what she was doing at the time to spark up a convo and she left me on open and ghosted me. Checked her Reddit account a few hours later to see that she was looking for someone else. I become so unbelievable upset I immediately tell the friend I talked about earlier. Vent to her about how no one has wanted me and for advice, and I just got the same stupid bullshit “it will happen some day” clearly it fucking won’t because no one has ever taken genuine interest in me. She then yells at me for thinking bad of myself. Claiming that “just be you girls will like you.” None of them like me. I’m tempted to yell back and tell her why I know she’s wrong, because if she really was telling the truth about me being an amazing person or being attractive, then she would have responded to the hints I dropped. I fucking hate living. People will say that a partner isn’t everything, but they fail to realize that I don’t want to be alone especially not for the rest of my like as it seems right now. I’m never making moves towards it ever again because what does it fucking matter, in the end I’m just an ugly POS that won’t ever be romantically loved.",30May2020,1

I live downtown and moved into my apartment a year ago, shortly after moving in we found roaches. Argued with the landlord and he fumigated our unit (unsure what he actually did but only our unit was treated and we had to be off the property for 4 hours. Pets too) 

We went almost a year without seeing any, but a month and a half ago, saw one moving slowly and killed it. And since then found one in the toilet, looked dead, and another one my roommate found in the basement last night also looked dead? 

The last two were black ish and i think its the german roach.

How can I relieve the pain without medication? Obviously I still take painkillers for it, but they wear off, and oral numbing gel only lasts for so long and only does so much.

91,"Hi, so basically my boyfriend suggested I post on here so you know, why not? (not sure if it’s NSFW but just a warning for those who deal with PTSD)

For background info, I (15F) was molested by my step father of seven years for i think 5 years? It’s foggy so i can’t exactly remember. I’m safe from him now so there’s no worries about that. 

To get into the story, the day my mom found out she told me that it would just be my sister mom and I again. Fast forward to now, she’s been sleeping with him, saying she still loves him and so on. I’ve told her a few times that it hurt me that she did this and she told me that he was the first man that made sense with her. She said she’s sorry and agreed to not mention his name. 

A week later she talks about him. It’s so infuriating especially when she straight up told me she was screwing him. She wants me to forgive him and to think of the good he’s done. She tells me he’s constantly sorry and how she wants a family again but respects that i don’t want to be in a family with him. She talks to my sister about it and got her on board with a family counseling idea. I’m so sorry if i’m rambling at this point.

I don’t know if i’m overreacting anymore. I don’t feel like i am truly apart of my family anymore and it feels like he stole my mom and sister from me. I don’t know what to do. I have support from my boyfriend which i’m forever grateful for but i’d love support from my mom.",30May2020,1

And I mean I was planning on using a little shit motor but the boat needed up being a lot bigger and that motor won’t cut it no more.

Last night I woke up at 3am with sudden, severe pain on my pelvic floor. I could not stand up straight, I couldn’t inhale very much, I couldn’t cough- I had to crawl to my bathroom. I sat on the toilet , feeling like I had a bowling ball sitting on my belt line pushing down- I did not have to make a bowel movement; no gas. No fluid or anything vaginally either. This same thing happened to me a few months ago, but only lasted around 20-30 minutes. This time, the pain was incredibly bad, and lasted a little over an hour. I was able to fall asleep as the pain shifted from stabbing to dull- today my pelvis feels very heavy almost. 

I am not currently on my menstrual cycle and my last period was around 4-5 weeks ago. I have the nexplanon birth control implant (have used the same BC method for 6 years now) I didn’t get periods from 18-21yrs old, when I first started Nexplanon. Now I get periods very irregularly- sometimes every 2 weeks, sometimes spotting, sometimes it lasts for 2 weeks. My cramps have increasingly gotten more painful as the years go on. When I was 15 I was brought to the hospital for similar pain (not this bad) and told I had an ovarian cyst rupture. Not sure if that matters. 

Not on any medications. I smoke a vape (water vapor nicotine) &amp;amp;amp;amp; marijuana daily. I did use MDMA 1 month ago. I don’t drink often but honestly with the quarantine I have been having an average of 1.5 drinks per night, 6/7 days a week.

Does anyone know what this is? Or any advice on how to avoid? I have a doctors call scheduled for Tuesday.",30May2020,1
100,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently rethinking my entire life and would appreciate any advice.

I’m a junior in a Cal State University, majoring in information systems and minoring in Japanese. For the past two years or so I have been basically relying on financial aid to get through college and am lucky enough to get tuition completely covered.

Here’s the issue: My school has a 150 unit policy for financial aid and I have switched my major before which puts me at a total 168 to graduate with my plan. Not only that, but an extra two semesters, which makes it so that I will run out of aid elgibility.

Thing is, I have absolutely no one in my family to rely on for help and I’ve had no luck finding a job either especially now so I am worried if I won’t be able to finish my degree at all because I can’t pay for it.

As for the future, I planned on become a web developer and eventually moving to Japan. If I were to, ironically enough, change my minor to my major, (Japanese) I’d finish on time with basically guaranteed aid. I am also looking to enroll in a coding bootcamp after anyway to get the technical skills I’d need for a job in development.

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, how feasible is this plan? I am terrified of not being able to finish my bachelor degree but I am equally scared that I’d have significantly less job prospects by the end. 

Do you think I should leave my plan as is or is it worth it and more or less full proof to go through with the change?

Please help. Really desperate for any advice",30May2020,1

Ok I probably have to go into a little more detail with that 💀 so my mom married a complete asshat who was always sexist and racist to us (were Puerto Rican) and he's always treated me and my mom and my sister like shit for as long as I can remember.

He wasn't the most responsible, but the way I remember him is completely different from what my mom remembers.

123,"Ok so basically I’ve been sick for over a month now, can’t breathe, body aches, vomiting and diarrhea etc. just overall not doing great. I’ve been out of work with a doctors note for suspected covid for about 3 weeks now and I’m not allowed to go back (company rules and doctors orders) until I’m 72 hours symptom free without medication. 

Today, my boss emailed me asking if I’m better yet and I responded no and told her what was still going on. She completely disregarded my email and said “k, I put you on the schedule for Monday” today’s Friday. So I call my doctor, she tells me to go to the ER, I get a bunch of test and medications and stuff. 

The respiratory specialist said he was very concerned about my lungs and said I absolutely cannot go back to work for at least a week but probably more, the doctor said I could go back to work in two days. The respiratory guy said that wasn’t enough time for the antibiotics to even start working fully, and that my lungs are too constructed to be able to work because I get dizzy talking. Doctor says “yeah well I’m a doctor I know what I’m doing” respiratory guy says back “I’m also a doctor and THIS is what I specialize in!”

The end up arguing outside of the room where I can’t here them, doctor hands me a note for 2 days and I know I won’t be even close to better by then since this is the first time they have even bothered to prescribe me with anything the whole month I’ve been sick. 

Also, my covid test won’t even be back for another 2 days so I could be positive and carrying it around. 

So, should I disregard the doctors note and tell my boss that my doctor said I can’t come in, show her pictures of my prescriptions and my discharge instructions but just don’t show her the note?

129,"I work at a small town shop that has a full coffee bar, gourmet donuts, and assorted chocolates. Before Covid-19, we gave all of our tips to the food pantry which wasn't a thrill to us, the employees. During Covid-19, my boss has let us keep our tips from curbside pickup. Now since our state is opening back up, she is only letting us keep tips from curbside pickup. In store customers are only shown the cup in front of the register that says ""All Tips go to the Food Pantry"". Most of the time, customers don't even read the jar and believe that it is money for us, saying things like ""Oh here's something for you guys!"" and we say ""oh thanks it goes to the food pantry."" Or they just want to get rid of their change.

On average, the food pantry gets around 300-400 dollars from our tip jar a month. That means that on average since we are a low volume store and only need a few people on shift per day (4-6 roughly), my coworkers and I are missing out on at least 50 bucks a month. Yes, factoring in the number of customers that only put the money in the jar because it is for a donation; if it becomes a regular tip jar that amount will go down. But it's still a few extra bucks a month for a barely above minimum wage employee.

Starbucks and small coffee shops get tips; I don't see a reason why we shouldn't and why it should be my boss' decision? Today she suddenly said to us that the tips are going back to the food pantry but we get to keep the curbside tips. There was no discussion about it, it was just a statement.

It's also not like we do not do anything for the food pantry as a business. Our extra donuts get picked up by them often. I believe if you want to donate, it shouldn't be out of someone else's pocket (aka our tip money).

Now that the context is out of the way; how do you think I should approach this? Should I just leave it and lose out on 50 or so dollars a month? Or should I approach her calmly with an email or off shift in person and discuss it?",30May2020,1
130,"I'm looking for advice on how to prevent overreacting before it starts. I've [22f] been with my bf [23m] for 1.5 years and lately he'll abruptly change his mind about something (wanting to hangout, wanting to stay home; going get food with me, saying he's too tired but I can still go). Now I'm not saying these are huge issues that he is changing his mind on... I know they're not. That's why I'm so confused on why I get like this. but I still get upset by it and then I overreact by confronting him about it, he thinks it's stupid and gets annoyed, he will in turn get a little defensive and say things out of frustration... and then I feel like a total idiot. And at this point my crying barely phases him anymore. (I cry alot, not just about him. Just how I react to things)

I just want to prevent myself from these situations. How do I swallow the hurt and not overreact to my boyfriend's actions? 

Or generally, how do people... Essentially ... Deal with things that don't go the way you expect. (I guess I sound so entitled here, but I hope that's not what this post is coming off as...I really want to do better.)

131,"I got some horrible news today and I am not sure what to do or how to process it at all.

My dad was tested for COVID-19 and tested negative. They gave him some sort of scam to see if he had an infection. He had pneumonia, but they found something abnormal. My dad has stage one lung cancer. Due to his incarceration and COVID-19, I am unable to see him during this difficult time.

I immediately entered a stage of shock and now I am just in crisis. I want there to be a god, but I never believed in one. I've always been agnostic. I am also scared for my dad and his health. I am worried the surgery will go wrong or that he will only be more hurt. I am the most scared I have ever been, and I had to watch my dad walk out the door to self surrender.

133,"Congratulations to me, I have been regularly using the onion router for almost 2 years and I have only now found cp. I was looking for an old friend of mine who used to play MMOs with me a while back, I hopped on an Onion router (I am a straight up security freak) and typed in ""BellaModz"" into the search bar, I have my TOR browser configured to run through an Italian exit node, and I literally just found it before I started typing this. I selected ""Images"" to see if I could get a picture of my friend, the top images were young girls in very little clothing. Disgusted, I kept looking for my friend, eventually I found her, but now my mind is focused on this. Out of morbid curiosity, I clicked on the link under one of the images, it brought be to a website with a bunch of these photos. Even worse, there was an ""Onion version"", since I was on the Onion router and just had to know, I clicked, you can guess what was there, photos of young girls straight up naked, shot professionally, and what seem to be third world countries, after seeing this I immediately closed the router and came here.

134," I (22 F) have never been in a relationship before, never held hands with a man let alone actual intercourse. When I was 19 I told myself that I was ready to settle down and I wanted to save myself for the man who'll be my husband. At the time there were three reasons for doing so that I told my current fiance. 1. I understood how precious my body is. It's something that I'll never give to just any man. I also realize how equally precious a man's body is and so, I can never do hookups or one night stands, I can never reduce a relationship to a mere sexual transaction of sorts. It would break my heart if I gave myself to a man who will only leave me the next morning, and I will never do such a thing to a man.  
2. When I came here to America, I was given the freedom to make my own choices, I have the choice to give myself to a man and it is not a freedom that I will allow to go to waste by spending it on just any man. I only want one man and the man that I do give my heart, soul and body to will be my husband, my life partner. I have the chance to find the right man and I don't want to waste it.  
3. I believe there are 3 things that are the foundation to a successful relationship. Unconditional love, immense trust and the ability to compromise or even sacrifice. My decision to save myself for the man I love is how I intend to build one part of the foundation that is, trust. When I say I love you and only you to my future husband I want him to understand that my words are not to be taken lightly. I want him to realize he is the only man for me, sure there were other men whom I could have been with, but he is the only one I'm given all of myself to. I want him to understand that. I also don't want his feelings to get hurt. Here men are wonderfully open minded but jealousy and feelings of inadequacy are inevitable, a man could push those feelings aside but I don't want my man to EVER feel jealous or that he's not as good a lover as he hopes to be. There will be no need for him to be jealous because he will be my one and only, my first and my last. There will be no need for him to feel inadequate at love making because there will be no other male he has to compare himself to. I think out of the 3 building blocks trust is the easiest foundation to set in the relationship, and by saving myself for my man, I can build trust between him and I.

Well it's been 6 months into my first (and hopefully only) relationship and I regret saving myself till marriage, the wedding isn't going to be for another year but I honestly wish I hadn't saved myself because it's made me feel less like a woman. I still believe a man and woman's body is precious, that's why consent matters, and hookups can have a negative effect on people, it's not for everyone, but I now disagree with points 2 and 3. I no longer feel that losing my virginity to a man who isn't my husband is a ""loss of freedom"" nor do I believe that if I've had sexual partners before my husband it means I love him less or I am unworthy of his love and that trust cannot be built in the relationship if I'm not a virgin at the time of marriage or that I'll be incapable of being faithful if I'm not a virgin.

Being an inexperienced virgin has caused me a lot of heartache and feelings of inadequacy and insecurities of how I don't feel like a woman, fears that I will fail miserably at satisfying my partner, jealousy that others had their fun and I didn't when I had the chance to before I entered a relationship. Obviously now that I'm in a relationship, I'd rather die than be unfaithful just to gain sexual experience but it's been bothering me so much that I regret being a virgin now. In my head, due to only having romance books and movies as my relationship guides, I naively and pathetically imagined that the time my husband makes love to me and makes me into a woman will be this joyous and fulfilling moment that will seem to go on for eternity. Now I realize that it mostly likely will be the most underwhelming moment in my life that won't even last for a minute and it will not define me or make me into a woman. It won't make or break our relationship, in fact it won't even matter at all. Virgin or not, you deserve respect and should not be treated lesser, but I do believe I made a mistake holding onto it and thinking so dearly of something that in the end never actually mattered in the slightest. Now, I regret being inexperienced. I no longer believe it's something I needed to hold onto and save for only one man, I now believe it doesn't matter at all and thus, I regret not losing it and gaining sexual experience in it's stead.

I'd like to know other peoples thoughts about my post and if they've ever felt or currently feel the same as me. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my post, I welcome all view points from men and women as well as any advice so that I can no longer have this negative attitude towards myself.",30May2020,1

I recently visited her and she kept telling me she looked terrible because she just had a baby and I kept assuring her she's beautiful and realized I wasn't just saying stuff, I really did think she was beautiful.

137," My close friend of about a year and a half (he's 23 years old) made a suicide attempt 3 months ago. He survived and promised to me afterwards, in tears, that he was never going to attempt suicide again. I gave him all the support I could. I was terrified I'd lose him.  


Three days ago, he called me and we talked. We talk daily on the phone, for the most part, so this wasn't unusual at all. We talked about our days, how everything was going, etc. He told me, somewhat out of the blue, that he didn't like making promises, because they're too binding. I told him I agreed, me neither. So he said, ""I want to take back my promise."" I asked about what, and he said, about suicide. I immediately became very concerned and told him to please not attempt again, but he cut me off and told me he wasn't contemplating suicide, and that he was feeling fine. He just wanted to have the option ""open"" so that if the worst case scenario were to happen for him, he wouldn't have to feel guilty about breaking his promise. I agreed to let him drop the promise, because he seemed insistent.  


Now that we had the conversation, though, I'm terrified about what happened. I'm so scared by the concept of him attempting again, and that I somehow facilitated that by letting him break his promise. Did I do the right thing? How can I help to stop him from attempting?",30May2020,1

149,"Okay, first of all, she doesn't beat the dog or do anything to warrant animal abuse as far as I know. I don't know what to do or who to call. 

I went up to their cabin last weekend and her sister came with her massive dog which is a Black Lab and German Shephard mix. Her sister lives in a tiny carriage house with no backyard. This dog, according to their vet, needs to be walked 10 miles a day or equivalent exercise. She says that that will never ever happen because ""he wouldn't even make it 2 miles"". I doubt this heavily because this dog is a beast of an animal who loves to run and play from my experience. I think, she doesn't want to take the time to actually walk the dog because she's lazy.

So at the cabin, the dog was chained up for almost a whole day. It was pretty hot out and he was left with no water until I brought out some. He looked lonely so I tried playing with him for a while. The sister sat inside the entire time and didn't bat an eye at his barking and whining. 

This dog is super nice and friendly but definitely not trained properly. She literally just screams at the dog because he isn't obeying and that's obviously not how to train a dog. 

Just from this experience in front of people, I can't even imagine how he's treated at home. I feel horrible for this poor animal. I would love to take him in but I don't have a big enough place, yard, or enough time to give him the exercise he really needs. I also don't want to take him from the frying pan into the fire so to speak and have him stuck in a pound somewhere. I'm really unsure of what to do or if I could do anything at all.

Since he has a roof over his head and isn't physically abused, Im not sure reporting this to any organizations would actually result in anything changing for him.

151,"I haven't trusted anyone for as long as I can remember.  I've gone through my fair share of ""friends.""  And, any have lied to me and used me.  I don't know how to trust, have I ever known?  

let's start from the beginning. I have never had a friend group, I'm what you would call a player.  I would hang out with the boys, the athletic kids, the popular kids, the special needs kids.  you name the group I bet I was apart of it at one point in time.  

&amp;#x200B;

Once I hit middle school, I was finally thinking I would settle down in a group but yet no one would take me in. I would squeeze my way in just to have a seat at lunch.  The first half of sixth grade was terrible.  I would sit with this girl from elementary school and she was a drama magnet.  So like a good little pet, I followed her everywhere.  they would join up with her other friends and then they would fight and then Id always follow that one person.  You know those stories of girls taking photos in the bathroom, yup, those are true except I was never in the photos but I was the one taking the photos. I once told her off saying it wasn't fair and that I should be recognized as a good friend!  But she threw me away like garbage so I moved on to another table.  At the time they were good people. There were 2 guys and 2 girls.  I've known them for a while but then one of the guys said he was moving due to his parent's job.  Around that time one of the girls started fighting with the other guy and that was that.  after 6th grade, we all went our separate ways, the other girl went to another friend group as well as everyone else.  The one guy who didn't move became quite a popular fellow and yet again, I moved on. 

 I basically ended up spending half of the 7th grade in my ELA teacher's room having lunch with them.  But then the other staff called it off and I spent the rest of the 7th grade eating lunch in the bathroom or with one of the girls from the old friend group.  

In 8th grade I met a few nice people who I thought could be my friends, I was very very wrong.  The friend group also brought drama and thought the whole world revolved around them.  the friend group eventually split in half because of a nasty false rumor that went around and it showed how they were homophobic and selfish so a wound was created that just couldn't heal, and yet again we switch friend groups.

  Next High school freshman year.  I ended up with a decent group that I do not trust at all.  I don't think they are bad people, but I guess they're not just for me?  I need to learn to trust or I will be lonely for the rest of my life.  Any advice?  Can I ever trust?  Is trust a thing?  Will I be OK?",30May2020,1
152,"I made a friend (I think?) from a Meetup group months ago. We exchanged numbers and text occasionally, but primarily interact during meetings.

I told them I'd been writing about the topic lately and asked if they'd want to read what I'd written to hopefully continue the dialogue. They responded with an enthusiastic ""Yes definitely!""

162,"I adopted a 10 year old cat about 8 months ago as an emotional support animal. I have PTSD and I thought a big fluffy cat would help me sleep at night. The shelter that I adopted him from said he had no health problems, so I took him home. I was in love with him from the very beginning. However, after two weeks I realized he was sick. He had severe diabetes, which turned into hypoglycemia and seizures. I'm a college student and I picked up shifts at work and I spent all my money on his medical care. It caused me a lot of stress. Thankfully, now he's much much better. 

Two months ago, I moved back in with my parents because of the virus. Since then, he's been a nightmare. He cries at night and wakes everyone up, he steals our food relentlessly, and worse of all he's started attacking us. He's a big cat and he pounces on us and bites really hard. We're always on edge around him, because if we pet him or stand too close to him, he'll bite. Our vet recommended we give him anxiety medication, which has helped a little but doesn't stop him from biting. 

In the past few weeks, we've been letting him spend the day outside so that he can get his energy out. He's been bringing us ""gifts,"" but not little moles or mice. No, he brings us lizards, birds, and rats. He eats them in front of us. My mom has OCD and she can't cope with having a cat in the house that has eaten rats and birds and lizards. Today, she told me that we should give him away.

I love him so much. I took care of him when he was sick, I drive him to the emergency vet when he was having seizures. I can't imagine being without him, but he's also brought a lot of stress.

I’m not sure i added him or if he added me, but he ended up in my contact list and he lived 1.5 hrs away. He was 28 and we started talking, as a 14 year old i thought it was because i was so smart for my age ( i know, i roll my eyes with my thinking) and whatever we said he’d always make talk about sex. He worked in IT and i gave him my phone number. The thing is, after i turned 15, like all teenagers i always felt a bit horny and wanted to learn and talk about guys and he seemed like he was always open to talk to me about it. We talked often, and he was the first guy i had phone sex with when i was 15. he always wanted to know what i was wearing, and when i had my first facebook he messaged me telling me “ where you wearing pink underwear in that photo?” I didn’t even notice and took the photo down. I kept talking to him until i was 17. I sound naive but where i come from and the news we were getting back them we didn’t know much about pedophiles. But every time he was in the mood for phone sex, he’d message me, the thing is, it never happened when he was in the mood only when i was. I never met him in person nor had he asked me. 2 years ago he tried adding me on fb, but i blocked him. On the one hand, i don’t feel like i was taken advantage off at all, on the other i know he works in IT what if he’s truly a pedophile trying to get with younger girls and he’s an expert in hiding it because it’s his job?",30May2020,1
165,"Hi Reddit, I hope you're all doing fine in the midst of this pandemic :). Alright, let me set the scene here. My mom recently separated from my dad a little less than a year ago. A few months into the separation, she gets into a new relationship with a man that she began living with almost immediately. Because my dad and I don't get along very well, I opted to live with my mom and her new boyfriend. They sleep in the same bed and live in this house together. I, a 20 year old female, have been with my boyfriend for over four years and we are planning to get married soon. My mother doesn't allow me to lay next to him, not even just to watch TV. I can't stay over at a friend's house if he's there, and I can't even take a small vacation to the beach with a few friends and have him there. She knows I'm not able to live on my own right now, and she always uses it against me. Words along the lines of, ""We provide for you and you live under our roof, so you have to do what we say."" I do whatever I can when I can and when it is asked of me, and they're all about respect but I feel like I'm not getting the same amount back. Am I wrong for wanting more freedom?

Long story short, his keys were in there and she was stopping him from driving drink. A lt the end of the conversation/argument. The guy screams ""fuck you"" to my fiance so I yell back at him. I'm not the one for altercation or violence so i told my fiance that maybe we should've just called the cops because what happens when this guy comes back because he knows where we live.

171,"Sorry this is long, I have never dealt with this type of situation before and am still learning how to adult. 

My husband and I live in a duplex with a shared backyard and have been here for two years now. We love it, and our dog loves having room to run around. All the previous tenants have been pretty annoying and never help out with the lawn work which is supposed to be shared. Also we end up cleaning up after all the dogs. I haven’t cared too much because the previous tenants didn’t really use the backyard much, and I also love to do all the landscaping in the backyard. 

So now to the issue. The current tenants seemed great at first. They talked about how they would definitely split the lawn care ‘because only losers don’t split lawn care’. But they haven’t held up to what they said and we’ve been doing everything like usual. The big issue is that they adopted a dog aggressive pit bull right after moving in. It was supposed to be a single family dog because it attacked and injured another dog which caused it to go to the shelter. They lied to adopt it because they have a dog, and we have a dog in a shared yard. The pit bull has been aggressive towards my dog, and lunged at me when I picked up our dog because I didn’t realize he was out. So my husband and I are very uncomfortable with this. Also their dogs bark nonstop. All day. To the point that it becomes maddening. Also I have talked to them about all these issues at least once. I’ve done my best to communicate with them, but they haven’t changed anything.

So we need to resign our lease next month, but I really want to bring up these issues to our landlord before we resign. We don’t have a backup place to move into... so leaving isn’t really an option. I’m not sure how to tell her we have some serious concerns about the other tenants. I also don’t want to cause a bunch of unnecessary drama, but I’m tired of feeling used by all the tenants. I’m also not even sure if anything would change if I told her about everything.

We have a mutual friend who is one of her best friends and one of mine.  However, this friend is definitely closer to Melinda than me.

We had an argument over cleaning the apartment and from there that was pretty much the last time I considered myself friendly with Melinda.   I consider my self a fairly neat person.  I am not a clean freak but I always clean up after myself and I overheard Melinda talking to someone saying that I never cleaned.  Keep in mind Melinda is what many consider a clean freak.  So later Melinda decided to move out of our apartment after the lease ends, which it has not ended yet.  Since I am not on speaking terms with her, I ask our mutual friend why and where Melinda was moving to.  I thought this was an innocent question as I wasn’t talking trash or anything.

The next day I get a text from Melinda explaining why she was moving out (which didn’t have anything to do with me) and the message ended with “if you’re so concerned with my life next year maybe just ask me”. Months later of us having no interactions she unfollows me on Instagram.  Keep in mind we still live together and will most definitely still see each other around after she moves out since we have mutual friends.

Was it wrong of me to ask the question about her? I don’t see the issue bc people talk behind people’s backs all the time and say much worse.  I didn’t say a single negative thing when asking so I really don’t understand her reaction.  What am I missing other than she’s just crazy?",30May2020,1

180,"I’ve been told grief hits you like a train. I don’t know where my metaphorical train is, but I’m not feeling it.

(Tl;dr at bottom)

My grandfather passed recently, and that’s the first time I’ve really had to come to grips with my own mortality, and with the sort of finality in acknowledging it. My grandfather is dead: a statement which, once true, will remain true forever, to paraphrase John Green.

The memorial service was today, and I, a usually very sensitive person, didn’t feel or react to much of anything said. I know I’m sad about it all, but I just can’t seem to access the emotions. I don’t really know why. Everyone else is telling me to let it out, but I have nothing genuine to contribute, so then if anything I feel guilty.

His death was pretty sudden, and it happened during my final few weeks of school, so I shut it out to try and get through school first. I don’t know if this emotional numbness is a symptom of something larger - of grief so overwhelming that my brain blew an emotion fuse, but I just want to know what next steps to take.

Before he died, I had been working on having better mental health with a more positive outlook and realistic goals.

One way I’ve been coping is with music, one of my go-to coping mechanisms. For the most part, it’s been the Carrie &amp; Lowell album by Sufjan Stevens, especially songs like Death With Dignity, Should Have Known Better, and The Only Thing. I’m not sure if I’ve been emoting vicariously through them or if I’ve been using them in an attempt to conjure some semblance of real grief, but either way, I need a better way to think about how I feel.

Anyways yesterday he contacts me and starts talking to me. 

Note: I do not know this guy, I have never met this guy. But I asked a close friend (same grade) if he knew him and he said yes and that they were friends. The friend said he isnt the type to contact others but whatever. 

Anyways he says ""hey"" and we start chatting. Is nothing sexual or like he is trying to come onto me just random stuff, just about what we are doing in quarantine and random topics like that 

He hasnt made a move on me and I asked why he hit me up and he said he just liked talking to new people. I dont mind being that he hasnt made any hints that he likes me or anything but I worry being that we dont know eachother and he is in college.

But the close friend (we have a thing currently haha) said he was cool so whatever 

But is this weird? I dont mind talking to him but he texted me ""hey"" twice once in the morning and once now (I responded and we chat)

During our first encounters I noticed a bad smell coming from my vagina that I hadn't noticed before (he is my 2nd sexual partner) and he told me I should get checked so I just visited a regular doctor and I got some antibiotics for an apparent vaginal infection and I noticed the smell was gone and thought everything was fine.


About a month or two later he told me he got genital and oral cultures and he had some bacteria that he didn't have previously so I should get cultures and an analysis that I can't remember the name of, I told him I'd only get the cultures because I I got tested for HPV and AIDS a month before I met him and I hadn't had sex with anyone after that and the analysis was very expensive. But in all honesty (I didn't tell him) I was really scared some STD would come positive because my ex cheated on my and I don't know how many times, so I was and still am scared I might have gotten something although I haven't noticed anything weird.

When I got my cultures back my gynecologist told me that those are normal bacteria that live in the vagina and that I shouldn't get treatment for them because antibiotics for those bacteria can do more harm than good. 

That was back in late February and today he called me and told me (very respectfully) that he had noticed a weird smell in my mouth and vagina and noticed it had transferred to him, so he got the analysis that I didn't want to get done, and that luckily he didn't get positive in any STD but that there was a rare bacteria that was what probably caused the bad smell. And that in general he was very angry because he takes good care of his health, and that if I'm not going to take care of mine, he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I asked for his forgiveness and told him I didn't get the analysis done because I was scared, and he told me it's something that can be treated and it could've been worse, but still it's not fair for him, but that right now he was very angry and stressed out because of the quarantine and he didn't want to say something that could hurt me so we'll talk tomorrow.

So now I feel terrible because I know it's my fault that he got the bacteria from me, and that he was scared as well, but still I feel like trash. I told him I'd do anything to mend my mistake (of course I'm going to get the analysis and treatment) and that I know I did wrong, but I cant help feeling bad because I hurt him emotionally.

No hard feelings. Then we have the nice special ones that last longer and might become something. That’s what I’m used to, I can manage that.

Unfortunately, my grandpa's use of cigarettes for so many years has led him to have a lot of health problems. Not all of his health issues come from smoking in the past (thank God he quit years ago) but they contribute to a lot of his health problems. He has high blood pressure, thrombosis, and heart problems.

I feel very sad that he's unhappy towards the end of his life. My grandmother forces him to do construction work despite his fragile health, and she just argues with him all the time. I don't know too much of their past but I think she does have a level of right to be upset with him given how he was a dominant male in the marriage. But, she'll never seek therapy or couples counceling to help. And, there's no way they can live without each other because their codependant in taking care of each other. 

He recently had heart surgery and as my mother says and from what we can see he is unfortunately fading and it's breaking my heart so, so bad. I can't fathom my future without him because I love him so much. Id miss him so much. And everytime the topic is brought up of one day without him it gets pushed away ""like think happy thoughts."" Which I totally get because we should enjoy his company now, but I can't help but stress and worry about it. I don't know how I should emotionally prepare myself when the time comes.

199,"

So I was born in Puerto Rico, and I was raised Puerto Rican. My mom married the worst kind of guy possible, the racist sexist kinda guy. Since she married him, we moved to the US (this was a long time ago). When I moved I got made fun of because I didn't know English. Eventually I learned and became one of the top readers in elementary lol. Then we moved again, still in the US. Honestly, me my mom and my sister were the ONLY Hispanics around for miles (I'm not even exaggerating , we lived in the middle of nowhere).

When I moved I told then I was from Puerto rico but they said I didn't look like it or they didn't believe me because I was born so pale. And I moved again and again and everyone told me the same thing; that I didn't count.

Even today, people call me Asian after I tell them I'm boricua and they say it doesn't count, saying in white but apparently not white enough to fit in :/ is this some sort of racism? I've only lived in remote places full of white kids and I've really never found diversity. I've even had best friends say horrible things that she then assured me we're ""just jokes"". She called me a classy Puerto Rican once and I asked her what she meant by that. She responded with "" well Puerto Ricans are ghetto and your family are the only ones decent enough, I'm guessing because your mom married an american."" she makes jokes when we walk by pet stores and if she sees a hamster she'll lean over and say ""is dinner looking good tonight?"" I didn't even know people could use that kind of stuff to insult. 

My mom's husband doesn't like living anywhere else, and my mom gets the same kind of crap I do and more because she still doesn't know English too well. She went to college being dyslexic and pregnant and still managed to major in business. She worked really hard to get where she is today; managed by 20 yr olds at a phone company. Her workers make fun of her because sometimes she needs to get the Spanish version of things and she can't understand what's going on sometimes. Despite all that, she's still very successful, but she gets made fun of constantly because of the language barrier. 

My sister was the only one of us that was born with color. She gets crap from people at her school , including friends and TEACHERS. Once they marked her as an immigrant from Mexico. To make matters worse, my mom husband, who once again, isn't too ""open minded"", has cracked jokes to his friends about her being Mexican. She was complaining about a sunburn when he turned to a large crowd of his friends and said "" you can't get sunburnt; you're Mexican!"" and everyone started laughing. My mom told him not to say that, but he didn't seem to care. Didn't even apologize.

Sometimes I really feel invalid. Where I live today, there's only so much diversity. My best friend is one of the only 2 biracial kids in the entire school. When people talk about hate against POC , I always want to join in but never feel valid. All these years everyone told me that your color is what makes you what you are and I've always known that's not true, but I've been told that so much I'm scared to join the conversations I need to join. 

I really do feel like this might be racism but when I tell people that they say in exaggerating or it's a lie or just a joke. And sometimes they make me question if I even do count as boricua sometimes :/ what should I do? 

( also, it wouldn't let me post on the Hispanic women or racism community so I had to post it on this one. I'm sorry if it's the wrong place for this )",30May2020,1
200,"Whatever you want to buy, you probably have many options.

Want to buy a fast food dinner after having eaten healthy all week? You can get shawarmas, pizza, burgers, and so on. I can never stop thinking about price though. Today, literally an hour went buy and I was so stressed out by which option to choose.

“Pizza has the best value, but I just got that last week. Shawarma is a little more expensive, but I’d probably need to get two of those. What if they’re not even that good? Everyone talks about this shawarma place, but what if it sucks? Then I’ll end up trading what could have been an extra large pizza for two bad-tasting overpriced shawarmas. Wait a second, how about burgers. Yes, I could try the fancy burgers that have pepper jack inside the patties. Those look really good, but they’re so much more expensive. The Carl’s Jr.  burgers are burgers too. And a burger is a burger. But if I choose Carl’s Jr., I have another hundred combinations/options to choose from. Should I get a root beer float? I should, but I also have ice cream at home, but not soda. Maybe I should get soda from the grocery store. That would be cheaper than the root beer float, but it would take so much time. Wait a second. An hour has gone by and I have made ZERO progress.”

The dog walks away when he sees him, but he’ll just run after it and pick the dog up.
I have tried telling him that he is hurting him, but he ignores it and keep the same behaviors.

I just met my initially online girlfriend today for the first time after 6 months of being together and 9 of knowing her, and I ran into a serious issue. So we got along super well, and had a lot of fun walking around her home town and talking about our interests and whatnot. But we ran into one really bad problem, I must be either seriously perverted or just unlucky, because every time she touched me it sexually aroused me instantly to the point where I eventually got blue balls and was in pain for basically the whole day. I had to tell her she couldn’t touch me for basically the second half of the day because of it and it made her really sad, though she understood my problem. I was looking really forward to spending the next 2 days with her but now I’m almost dreading them because I know I’ll surely be in pain throughout both of them. I’ve never had this problem with any other girl and I don’t think this level of arousal is normal. Should I see a doctor or brush it off and hope it doesnt stay this bad.",30May2020,1

222,"October 2015: I started liking this girl in my 2nd hour Spanish class &amp; my lunch period. I’ve never liked a girl before. So as the weeks went on into Nov., I learned that half of the school(including her) was moving to the school across town bcuz the school district was becoming bankrupt &amp; had to move students, etc. So I was determined to ask her out by the end of the school year. As finals ended/winter break started, I really started missing seeing her. I began posting #wcw pics of her on my ig as I was trying to be sweet. No replies as my account was private, but I guess word got to her that I really liked her. 1st week of January I posted a screenshot of my notes that basically said I need help to ask this girl out(everyone knew who I was referring to) &amp; that I was thinking of either getting her a Chevy Silverado or getting her a puppy &amp; putting a note on its caller asking her to go out with me. Then I realized I really messed up. It was nonstop talk around the school when winter break ended.

 1 of her friends that followed me on ig dm me saying that she thinks that it just wasn’t going to work bcuz she was already talking to someone else. Idk if that was true or not. I asked the friend if she was mad at me, she said na but that she just felt bad. I said ok thanks for letting me know &amp; that I’d lay low for a while. I then got the idea of writing her an apology letter in person. I spent the next 2 weeks writing a 20 page apology letter to her &amp; gave it to her the day before my birthday. I gave it to her in the middle of the school cafeteria &amp; I basically said I’m sorry for what I did to her(embarrassing her on social media) &amp; that I wrote this for you. She said thanks &amp; I said no problem. We had drivers ed class that quarter (from Jan to March) also. She then DM’d me later that day saying that she felt that I was beating myself up too much &amp; that she wasn’t mad/hate me. She also said that she was flattered that I liked her. When I gave her the note, I got a bunch of ig follow requests from her friends so they certainly knew about it. 


The next day, my birthday, I got called in my school counselor office about the note. So either her or her friends told him about it. He was making sure that I wasn’t going to hurt myself. I told him I wasnt &amp; got a phone call home. My mom wasn’t too thrilled with me. The girl I liked(I still do) was worried that while I wasn’t in class(I was @ counselor office), that I did something to myself. A few weeks went by &amp; got the idea if I got her a cat she would wanna go out with me/increase my chances. That didn’t work. A few weeks later, I was going to do a bunny. That didn’t work either. I was just too scared to talk to her in person. So sometime over spring break, a group of acquaintances had a convo on Xbox saying that I was going to shoot up the school in May. When spring break ended 1st week of April, I was interviewed by dean/police &amp; said I didn’t know nothing about it. Apparently a bunch of people got interviewed about it, including the girl I liked supposedly. I felt so sorry for her. I asked a classmate if she liked me &amp; he said she said no but that she feels bad. So I then made plans to kill myself bcuz I figured if I did she’d be happy not to see me again. The day I was going to last see her(if my suicide went through) I bought her a sorry card from Walgreens &amp; a gift card to Olive Garden. Gave it to her after lunch. I said sorry &amp; just left to my next class. Kids said that she couldn’t take the gift card bcuz she said she felt bad about it so she gave it to one of her friends. I posted my plans on Snapchat on that Friday evening in mid April to kill myself &amp; somebody called the cops on me/was sent to a mental hospital for 1.5 weeks. I missed her so much. When I got back from the hospital &amp; to school, a friend told me that she felt bad for me. Lots of her friends told me that she wanted me to go talk to her, but I was too scared to. In early May, the school went on lockdown one day bcuz somebody called the police &amp; school saying that they saw me walk up to the school with a gun. I was pulled out of my classroom &amp; held @ gunpoint with AR-15 by cops &amp; had FBI/news crew on scene. They obviously found nothing on me. By noon, almost everybody went home with their parents. I couldn’t bcuz my mom was @ work. Even the girl left. I felt so sad. The next week, I was forced to stay home bcuz that was the day I was originally rumored to shoot up the school. I was sad I couldn’t see her. 

My lunch table said that I wasn’t allowed to sit with them anymore so they could be “separated from the situation” is what they told me. I ended up starving myself from lunch the entire rest of May. Instead of going to lunch, I hid in my school bathroom stalls so nobody would see me or hear me cutting/crying myself. Nobody ever knew about this. They probably never will. 


The following week, the last full week before finals, I finally worked up the nerve to talk to her. I just asked her how her day was, what’s new, etc. I was so proud of myself &amp; so were some of my friends. The last week of school was so depressing for me personally, bcuz I knew I wouldn’t ever see her again. I almost cried midclass bcuz of that. Once the school yr ended, that’s when I DM’d her asking to hang out sometime over the summer. That’s when she said we’ll see(bcuz she said she had lots going on &amp; that she’d dm me). I never got a dm back &amp; messaged her every 4 weeks asking her how she was etc. nothing was responded to. I listened to 10 hours of demon sounds on YouTube every night, wishing that I’d be skinned alive &amp; burned in hell. I decided that November to have another suicide attempt bcuz I missed her so much, &amp; went through all this pain &amp; got no reward for it. I wanted at least 1 chance. I ended up going to my counselor office at school bcuz someone found out about it. I was put in a mental hospital for 2 weeks &amp; was given medication for my depression. I haven’t talked to her since all this happened. I’ve been in hiding ever since &amp; don’t go out in public anymore.



2020: I’m a 20 yr old male &amp; this is different a 19 yr old female. This girl that I met 4 years ago moved &amp; now she said she’s single. We’ve always liked each other. We met in a hospital in late 2016. However, she had to move due to family reasons. She used to live 25 minutes away from me when we first met. But she was taken back then. Now it’s 100 miles from my place to her town. She lives in a rough neighborhood so I’m a little nervous about going there. She said she wanted to spend time together. I was willing to do whatever it takes to make this work. I’ve waited 4 years for this opportunity. No other girl has ever liked me back. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me &amp; I wanted to make it work. I prayed that God will have us reunited with each other again soon one day. I was also looking for a job opportunity &amp; looking into acquiring a license so that way it would speed up the process. I was hoping that this would prove to her that I was responsible &amp; making a legitimate effort towards our potential relationship.

We live in Illinois(United States) &amp; the state is still under lockdown, meaning that we can’t meet up still. It keeps getting pushed back more &amp; more. She was upset on the day after Memorial Day about this because we’ve been planning on meeting up since March(I’ve been upset too). She didn’t reply to my texts I left her on Tuesday evening when I told her that we’re still not allowed to hang out. I was scared that our relationship was going to be ruined because of a stupid disease &amp; the travel restrictions our state has. I’ve always wanted to have a relationship with this girl &amp; I knew I’d never have this chance again in my lifetime. I waited until 2 days afterwards to give her time. I really wanted to make this happen for both of us. She texted me saying that I don’t know what it’s like to live in the hood, that she’s grown up, &amp; that she’s into a different type now. I told her that I’m sorry that I wasn’t good enough for her &amp; she blocked me on everything. I’m so upset.",30May2020,1

I’m super socially awkward but I used to be comfortable with her and what if it’s awkward now and we just don’t click like we used to? What if she thinks I’m weird or if she thinks I’m ugly or dumb now? And then she’ll not want me to stay with her and I’ll have no where to go. Should I just cancel it right now?,30May2020,1
231,"So....hmm

I grew up in a “Veggie Tales” Christian family- we went to church but it wasn’t part of our lives or identity, and we stopped going when I was 6/7. I grew up in a big Catholic environment, went to a school where I was the only non-Catholic person, and even ended up at a Jesuit college for two years. I have a lot of problems with biblical teachings and living “by the book”, and I’m someone who questions “the man” and all that. 

But lately I feel like I’m missing a big part of my life, and I keep getting drawn in to religion. I’m not sure why but I always come to the conclusion that I wish I had a faith community or some guiding force in my life. 

I’m lost. I don’t know where to begin (I’ve gone on multiple church websites and can’t find anything that points me in the right direction)

I know reddit is largely atheist/agnostic, but if you’re religious and have some guidance for me I’d love to hear it.",30May2020,1
232,"Some context: 
I’m 19F and I’ve had a hard time recently.
I‘ve always had trouble making friends, but upon entering high school, I was doing pretty well. I went to summer camp and had tons of friends there, ended up with a great group of kids in high school, and then I went to college where I met my best friend (but basically nobody else because I suck at making friends). 

I don’t know what it is, but suddenly I’ve found myself finding major flaws in my friendships with EVERYONE. I don’t even feel like I have people to talk to anymore. I find almost everyone annoying or inconsiderate or hard to talk to, and I haven’t always been like this. It’s mostly the annoying part that’s an issue. It makes me emotional just to talk about this because I often feel extremely lonely now. I’m not sure if I just only know people that suck or if I’m the one that sucks.

I’ve become so critical of others in my head that it makes it so hard for me to stand being around them sometimes. Like some of my girl friends just talk about guys too much which gets annoying or my best friend talks about politics too much (i’m passionate about it too, but I think her opinions suck sometimes and if i argued with her it would turn into a whole fucking controversy).

I’m genuinely asking for help. I can’t keep living like this. I literally will never make friends if I have such a critical mindset. What do I do to fix this?",30May2020,1

251,"So the title says it all. My 68 year old mother is a victim of one of those love scams. She’s still married (45 years) to my dad which makes it even worse. For well over a year now I have known my mom was talking to someone from overseas via Instagram and WhatsApp. Initially she told me it was some young kid she met playing a slot game on Facebook and I didn’t think too much of it. But then l went digging around her Instagram account and noticed this CLEARLY fake profile following her and I asked her about it. She said it was a guy who reached out to her and they were just friendly talking. Knowing the profile was fake, I told her DO NOT send any of these people money. I knew immediately that is exactly what it was and she assured me she wasn’t and wouldn’t. I kept checking back on the IG profile for the guy and noticed one day that the name had completely changed, as did the photos! So I took screen shots and shared them with her and she seemed genuinely concerned which made me think this person was more than just a “friend” in her eyes. I pleaded with her to stop all communication with him and she told me she did.

Fast forward a little and my brother tells me she is still messaging with someone all the time when he’s around her. I reach out to my moms sister to see if she knows anything and she told me that my mom had a boyfriend, he was an American but not living in the US (typical, huh?) and she shared a picture of him with me but he was not the same man in the IG profile I knew about. So now there’s another guy! At this point, I don’t know what to do but to believe that my mom is NOT that stupid and naive and believe that she’s not sending money, though I hurt because now I know she is having an emotional affair with this fake person.

So just over a year ago, my grandpa died and left a rather large inheritance to my mom and her siblings. My mom ended up with probably $150k or more. So here is how I found out all of this. Tonight my mom approached my brother and asked if she could borrow $10k to redo the kitchen. He was taken aback and asked why she needed the money. Where was her inheritance?? Yes she has been spending a bit frivolously over the last year but not to the tune of $150k! He asks if she’s been sending money to her “boyfriend” and she replied, “no, I don’t send him money. I send him gift cards.” 🤦🏼‍♀️

I do not know what to do at this point, which is what brought me here. My mom has never made smart financial decisions, but this takes the cake. I don’t know how she could be SO stupid (I hate to use that word but what else is it?) to not see through this scam! I don’t want to even THINK about how much money she has sent this piece of shit! And now she’s asking my brother for money to send him?!?! And my Dad. My wonderful, sweet Dad who while may not light her fire at age 70, after 45 years of marriage - he doesn’t deserve this. And at his age, to learn about a deception this huge (the affair AND the money)... it breaks my heart. If/when he does find out, world war 3 will erupt in that house. I just don’t know at all what to do. I’ve already pleaded with my mom to not send money and to be cautious of these men and she didn’t listen so I doubt she will now. Help! What do I say to her? Do I tell my dad? Do I get everyone involved to stage an intervention?!",30May2020,1

I just got out of a really bad really long relationship. This guy knows that, I made it clear from the moment I realized it was kinda a thing that I’m not looking to jump into a relationship, whatever happens happens but that’s pretty much it. It’s very well understood. 
He’s much younger than me which is definitely the polar opposite of my usual, I’ve been treading lightly but I’ve also been enjoying our time together, but again, not trying to get into an actual relationship. We connect on a lot and he’s incredibly smart, makes me laugh etc, but chemistry.. there’s not really any. 
Anyway, one thing led to another, we all have needs, we had sex. And it wasn’t good. There was no connection, honestly I was bored. My ex and I had absolutely incredible sex, but the relationship was toxic. However, going from that to what just happened.. I don’t know, I’m sure his sex is for someone, just not me. 

Unfortunately I put myself in a situation now.. I don’t know what to do. I can’t exactly say “hey, the sex was bad and I already didn’t want a relationship but now I’m pretty confident it can’t go anywhere..” 

Maybe that sounds bad, but I think having a sexual connection is important. Anyway, I don’t know how to handle this. He’s a super sweet guy but I just feel awkward now..",30May2020,1

My mother divorced him and as i got older i understood how horrible the environment i was raised in and that i was taught many things that were inaccurate, racist, and would take many years to unlearn. My whole family is white. Thanks to DNA sharing and social media, i have come to find most of my dad’s family to be neo-nazis. Fucking terrifying. 

I love my mom. I don’t think she’s a bad person but she’s generationally racist, which is horrible. I feel caught in the middle. I am VERY supportive of the protests going on across the nation. For years I’ve been trying to explain BLM to her. She is very resistant to the concept. She doesn’t understand “All Lives Matter” disenfranchises “Black Lives Matter”. She doesn’t care. She goes off on how she’s scared of the police (she does have PTSD from how a cop treated her when my sister died, but her life was never in danger) so she ‘gets it’ and how I’m going to get murdered for being white if i hand out cold water at the protests.

I’ve been trying to explain to her that BLM is about police MURDERING innocent black people. She then circles back to “what if a cop killed an Asian man? Is that ok”. It’s really fucking frustrating. It always ends in a screaming match. I was screaming at her why any murder is not ok, but that’s not what BLM is about. I screamed “i am so sorry racism effects you this way” and “GET THERAPY”


I already don’t talk to my father and two of my siblings bc they are racist. I have been disowned by my father’s side of the family because I am an outspoken feminist and I don’t put up with any racist bullshit. I don’t want to lose my mother but this is not something i will surround myself with. Family or not, i don’t fuck with it. 

She refused to admit she may possibly be racist. (She always says “you know me” “you know who i am” or “you know I’m not racist”) I don’t know what else to say or do. I’m going to go hand out water. I’m going to do anything i can to help keep people safe.

I’m heavily competitively driven and passionate a bad grade and I’ll try and bargain, if I lose rank in a game I’ll become mad, or even play alone to regain it even though we’re playing to have fun, I can’t stand losing.

When people make actually funny jokes and people laugh a lot I become angry and upset and when my jokes fail I become upset. No one ever validates me because they expect me to be good and when others who are worse do good get validation I get upset because I want to be seen.

I feel vindictive and manipulative and I feel like a horrible person. I lie, I become angry easily, I become upset over nothing, and I have a drive to be nothing but the best and if I’m not I feel like a failure and it’s so hard.

276,"I moved in with my boyfriend recently. We have been doing good aside from overcoming obstacles that come with a new place. But theres one thing I'm struggling with and that's that fears, anxiety, and thoughts I had from a past relationship are flooding back in.

I had an anxiety attack where suddenly I couldn't breathe easy and my thoughts were racing with worry and feeling like I'm not good enough- similar to how I felt from the past relationship where my ex ended up falling for someone else and would threaten to leave me for them and compare me to other women. It was a mess and turned me in to a different person. 

I know I need therapy. I'm planning on getting some when I have money. But for the meantime I'm just trying to make sense of why this is happening.

We were just watching a movie and suddenly I had to leave the room and ended up a mess. And I've been having these feelings on and off since we moved in together. The fear that he will find another woman and do what my ex did to me after we had lived together. I keep trying to battle it with logic. I just dont understand why this keeps coming up. I feel ashamed. Like I shouldn't feel this way and I should be over it and that people have gone through worse situations so I dont deserve to have this baggage.

285,"I started this job in November 2019 and for the most part I can say it’s the best job I’ve ever had. I work for one of the main liquor distributors in the United States. I’m currently 23 years old and the pay is very good for my age and I’ve been able to save more than I ever have previously. When I had started the job, I was told my hours would be 9-5. This is not an office job, as I often go to a new location every single day (grocery stores, independent liquor stores). They are very lenient with letting me leave early if I really have to. Most of the time, I get off multiple hours early and can enjoy my day. I have very seldom started work before 9am.

When COVID-19 started to become a prevalent issue, my job became drastically easier and switched to mostly making calls to stores to see what they need ordered from my home. Usually I would start making calls at 9am and stop making calls around 2pm or 3pm. This was the case for all of March and April. The last week of April, I received a call saying I would be furloughed for 60-90 days. I started obtaining unemployment benefits the day I became furloughed and surprisingly I was making a little bit more on unemployment than I normally do on a bi-weekly basis. 

But here’s where my problems begin. I have always had extreme difficulty falling asleep any time before 1-2am. This is primarily because I enjoy being awake and completing tasks at the end of the night. I love the night time as it is the most quiet time of the day. I am prescribed focus medication due to ADD which works wonders for me. I do not take it every single day, but I often take my medication for work or completing online school work as recommended by my physician. Normally when I was working, going to sleep at 1-2am and waking up at 8am was not a problem for me as I could always make it to my destination on time by 9am. During my furlough, my sleep schedule became ruined. I began staying up later and later to the point where I am falling asleep at 3am and waking up at 11am. It is extremely difficult for me to wake up any time before 10am. 

Today I received a call from Human Resources who had asked if I would like to come back to work on June 1st which is the day I start my online statistics course as well (hardest subject for me, I’ve dropped it once before and it is the last credit I must complete before I get into my program). This has only been 30 days of furlough at this point, not 60-90 like they told me. I agreed, because if I denied working I would no longer be eligible for unemployment benefits as I would have to detail that I refused work. Hours after my agreement with Human Resources, I received an email regarding my day by day June schedule with destinations. Every single job begins at 6am and will end at 2pm at the very latest. This is completely unlike my previous schedule for this job. I must be on time, as I am working with a team which is unlike my previous tasks. Some of these job destinations are over an hour and a half away and I do not know how to handle this. I feel as if they are making these jobs start at 6am primarily because they want us to have as least exposure to COVID-19 as possible. However, I am severely concerned about driving these far distances when my sleep schedule is simply just not going to fix in 2 days. I have never almost fallen asleep at the wheel before, but this situation is most definitely concerning me. I fear being extremely tired or irritable throughout the day if I can even make it to the jobs. If I were to tell my boss I don’t feel comfortable working, I do not know how he will react and I know I will leave my other coworkers hanging. Focus medication and caffeine can be great assistances to working early (8am) but still do not assure me that I can be up on time, and ultimately i fear the decline of my health/ mental state from using this tactic. I don’t know how I can handle the most stressful college course for me during this time period either. It is highly possible that this schedule will carry on into July.

Lastly, my girlfriend is getting a tonsillectomy for chronic strep and tonsil inflammation on June 2nd that will require her to have two weeks of downtime. This has been scheduled for about a month for her and thinking that I would still be furloughed, I told her I would be there for her as much as possible. She is very understanding to everything I am writing in this post, but also extremely concerned with how I will have to drive this early knowing how poor my sleep schedule is. 

I need advice on what to do in this situation, sorry for the long post!",30May2020,1

288,"I'm a 14 year old girl. I dont know what I am. All my life I've regarded myself as a tomboy. Even when I was little, I didn't even think about my gender.

Flash forward a couple years to now,  I'm still confused. Just saying the phrase  I'm a girl is so weird to me, saying im a boy is easier. Whenever I think of what gender I am, I just say im me. I'm not confidently a girl or confidently a boy. I always think to myself, damn I wish I had boy parts, but a girl appearance.

I had maybe two friends from highschool there but I never really saw them due to scheduling. I go to a small community college and no one there is very social. In fact everyone I know that goes there says nobody speaks to one another. Aside from college I worked part time at a local zoo. Job was fun and I actually had a decent amount of friends there. Due to the epidemic they have remained closed. I also have not been seeing my close friends that much lately. They are a group of guys I went to highschool with. I trust them with my life. They are like brothers to me. With all that has been going on I simply have not felt real joy in a while. I spend my time playing videogames to waste time.

Long story short, my friend decided to stay with her husband and try to work it out. Now I’m in a weird spot because I can no longer invite him to functions where my family will be in attendance and my husband wants absolutely nothing to do with him.

Me Mentally

First off a lot of this happens to me when I’m stressed. I feel like writing it down may or may not help me in the long run. I want to write down everything in sections to make it easier to understand.

Paranoia

I find myself sometime getting paranoid. Not too bad or schizophrenic but just an unsettling vibe. Thoughts I don’t believe are true but do kind of put me on edge and creeped out. For example the vent in my washroom sometimes make noises and I’m scared if I look into it someone will be looking back. Or small noises which I blow out of proportion. Like when I left the shower and heard my fan I thought there may have been someone in the apartment with a chain. Not actual beliefs but it puts me on edge. The only other thing that I would consider paranoid is about bugs, cock roaches mainly as they do live in my apartment. I think I see them run under paper for example, but they won’t be there or under it, same goes for dishes etc. Also mirrors sometimes freak me out.

TLDR; I get paranoid for no reason, only small or mild, over little things.

Dissociation?

Again this may be stress related, or just random times, but I don’t really know if it is classified as dissociation. Everything becomes very fuzzy, my body for example, feels like it’s shaking and it very well might be. My girlfriend once pointed out I was shaking and I didn’t know I was, but I was slightly. It was when I started to dissociate. I got scared knowing it was happening and everything kind of became a blur. I knew what was happening around me but it all seemed fuzzy and hyper focused at the same time. Things kind of felt unreal (kind of feeling like this while writing this. Or I’ll look at something and it all blends together, like the pattern of a floor or a corner of a cupboard. It’s almost a feeling of fear. I’ve wrote a post about this and someone had pointed out depersonalization so that’s what I’ve been referring it to. Only happens sometimes but it does happen. Also I feel nauseous usually and my head can hurt.

TLDR; I feel like everything blends together, fuzzy feeling around my body. Don’t feel like myself

Mood

My mood varies from hour to hour. I can be excessively happy, or overwhelmingly sad, to angry. Girlfriend was annoying me one day, which happens sometimes, it’s natural. But I got so unnecessarily upset over it (she was sitting in my chair, and I’m protective about my stuff) I started to raise my voice a bit and begged her to move and she wouldn’t and she told me I needed to calm down first. I started to panic a bit and had a mix of frustration and anger and sadness. Eventually I calmed down a very little bit to the point she moved and me and her were both a little startled, this lasted a few minutes. 

This happens at varying intensities and different moods. Depression is a factor, but so is happiness? I can feel like the best in the world to feeling like dirt and worthless and just stuck overall. It can happen in minutes, hour, or days. All in phases. Sometimes caused, sometimes for no reason whatsoever. Motivation varies. I can never stick to goals or tasks, other times I want to set several goals for myself. I feel like I never improve however. Mood did cause me to self harm in the past but I got over it, although years later I still sometimes get the urge and the images in my head, I still am able to hold back but it can get to be stressful. These only happen when I’m very upset or stressed.

Good feelings consist of me being happier, more open, chattier and just kind of a “laugh at my jokes I’m funny aren’t I” kind of guy. I think I deserve more than I have, tons of entitlement and I value myself over everyone. 

(I go from not caring about random people, to caring about everyone randomly, I’m either a really good guy or a very selfish one depending.)

TLDR; mood swings, happy, sad, angry, random times random feelings but they can be affected by people and events.

Obsessions 

I do find I obsess over things. My games, apartment, income, work. But only sometimes. My obsessions aren’t destructive imo but they do happen randomly about random things (wanted to go to school about psychology, was in it for a week obsessing over it, the dropped it and didn’t care) my games I think about 24/7. Working out I don’t follow through with but I’ll plan for days and think about constantly. I’ve always had an issue obsessing over girls. Different intensities over different things.

History 

I grew up with separating parents in a poor family, one parent abused me, mainly mentally but sometimes physically. Always the least favourite out of the kids by one of my parents. Diagnosed with GAD and health anxiety (which comes and goes). Been on anti depressants but dropped them due to side effects. Lots of physical pain, head aches, chest pain, pain in arms and stomach. Severe depression as a teen with self harm and suicidal thoughts, very close to following through once. I can’t currently find consoling and have been looking for months but due to COVID it’s harder. 

Conclusion

I just want help, I want to know what to do and where to go. I’m broke, in debt, and I feel semi mentally unstable and trapped. It is depression, but not as bad as it was. Maybe mild to minor. Everything else is mainly new, I don’t know how to get help or what to do really. I just hope typing this out helps me.",30May2020,1
303,"So I've just completed my BSc in Biochemistry (i live in UK)

I feel quite dissapointed. I did not enjoy my degree at all, and the science of biochemistry although interesting at times, doesn't captivate me.

Ive realised that psychology is truly what I want my life to revolve around. I think there can be nothing more fascinating than the human mind, how it works, how personalities differ, how experiences impact us, how much is determined by nature vs nurture etc.

I have myself always had therapy since the age of 7 so Ive had mental health challenges my whole. Im a really reflective person and spend hours thinking about all these things.

I really dont know where i can go from here. I mean biochemistry does have implications in forming someones psychology, but I dont really see a direct link.

Aside from just converting to psychology through a master conversion 1 year course, is there any other path I can take? 

Im not even entirely sure what I want to do in this field, as I know there is more to it than just being a therapist/psychologist. I wonder if my current degree could be helpful in any way

During school I sometimes had a ""the grass is greener on the other side"" type of feeling. I would work on side projects as much as I could and I felt intense motivation, but i was always annoyed at how little time I had.

 Now that I'm finally done with school and I can dedicate my entire month to doing those side projects, I dont really want to. I spend my time off just reading. Its always nagging me in my head, I can finally finish those things, but knowing I'm going to have a full time schedule in a month exhausts me. I already gave so much time to school for 4 years, and now I'll do the same for my job. I know this sounds pessimistic but I sometimes just spend a full day doing nothing and reading or browsing the internet, and it feels good. 

It feels like im wasting my potential. I want to make things and help others and work on my goals. But it feels like i'll need to compromise my mental peace to do it. I think this may be burnout, or maybe I'm just being a lazy dickhead. Does anyone know how to deal with this kind of feeling other than just not working? Doing nothing feels wrong.",30May2020,1
310,I’m 16 and I’ve been losing my memory to the point where I can’t even remember what I ate yesterday. Whenever someone tells me “remember when you said _______” I deny them and tell them I never said that and they tell me that I’m losing my memory. This has happened so often that now I’m really starting to believe that I’m forgetting things.,30May2020,1
311,"So I’m constantly feeling sad and what not and a while back I was told here on r/advice that I might have depression and I have no way of checking with a doctor right now or talking to a therapist 
I also feel like I annoy people when I post more than once and I feel like I’m pressured into dealing with my own problems and sometimes that causes me to not speak about it 
So is it ok that I’m always needing help or advice I’ve just felt like my life’s been out of control recently and 1000x worse and 1000x sadder",30May2020,1
312,"So my younger sister just recently graduated from high school, and lately she’s been having problems with our mom over the fact that my mom is very strict and always up her ass about things. I do believe that just because you graduate high school doesn’t mean you get all the freedom in the world, and to an extent, you still have to live by your parents’ rules. But she’s been feeling as if she needs to stand up for herself and she’s doesn’t know if this is a good idea. 

The other day, my sister was out all day long hanging out with a friend (socially distancing of course) and then she left for about an hour with me to go pick up some food for dinner. Then later in the evening, we were going to go to our neighbors’ to just hangout on the porch and chill for the night, and so when my sis told my mom that we were going to do that, my mom said “haven’t you been gone long enough today?” And then said “that’s fine but you have to stay home all day tomorrow.” I mean, is that a little extreme?

My mom does take the role of authoritative parenting ( she’s not extreme, but she’s up there). However, compared to all my sister’s friends, my sis is the only one who can’t just say “I’m heading out for a couple hours to hang out with so and so” or “I have plans with friends today, so see you around dinner.”  My sister has to ask my mom to do these things and she has to tell my mom everything she’s doing that day and who she’s with. If she doesn’t, my mom texts her all these questions on where she’s at. My sis is sometimes told that she has to be home by a certain time. Is this good parenting or should my mom just let my sister have a little more freedom?

Being the older of the two, I don’t think I ever dealt with this because when I was her age, I was more introverted and didn’t have much interest going out all the time. So is my mom just too controlling of my sister?",30May2020,1

314,"I (23 F) am pet sitting at a close friends house tonight and tomorrow. 

Their bedroom smells like dog piss because one of the dogs is horribly trained. I am also watching my 4 yr old godson. He is asleep in the big bedroom because he doesn't mind the smell. I literally can't stand it. 

It's humid and reeks, I can't sleep in there. So I got a blanket and pillow and moved to the couch. 

The living room is much better because the balcony door has been open all day with a fan wedged in the frame. The air here is wonderful but I notice the reek from the bedroom starts creeping out as soon as I close the door.

I really want to keep the door open while I sleep but I guess I'm not sure if it would be okay? The kid can't get through without me hearing cause of the fan and we're on the third story so I feel like it's unlikely anything would happen. But I'm not sure. 

This is a sucky situation and I just want to be able to breathe.

TLDR: The place where I'm staying smells like piss. Can I leave the third story balcony door cracked for air while I sleep?",30May2020,1
315,"So, I know this isnt anything important, but I was scrolling through Reddit, and I saw a post of a flower candle someone made. I swore I remembered seeing the image before, so I did a bit of research into it and found the original source.

I have a good feeling the peson did not make this item, consider the image was alterer a bit, and the original was on another site, posted over 3 years go.

So with this evidence, it really makes me want to call the person out, but they didn't out right say they made it, and I dont really know how to call them out, or if I even should.

Some help would be very appreciated.",30May2020,1
316,"
Okay so I just. I can’t deal with this shit going on in the world right now, right? My line of work is shut down and I’ve been home almost 24/7 for almost 3 months now. 
Some about me shit you likely care little about:
31 y/o female. I am married and my husband and I have a 4 year old boy. We live in a travel trailer on my in laws property after problems with debt and nearly declaring bankruptcy and are working towards getting a house. 
I have ADHD, which has not manifested anything other than negative thought harassment, panic attacks, anxiety, depression etc. I have been recovering for years now from PTSD that comes with a household where one parent has borderline personality disorder and a violent temper.
I have been trying so godamn hard to be a better person. I have quit smoking cigs, cut back on my alcohol, I am losing weight and have lost 130+lbs already! I have a licensed line of work that I went to school for! I got on ADHD meds about two years ago and it made my life so much better— my moods are more stable and so is my ability to finish tasks. I try so hard to be kind and thoughtful, just to be positive! Anytime someone speaks poorly of themselves I am always there to defend. My husband and son are told daily they are loved, I give them things, tell them verbally and physically— I try ALL of the love languages because I don’t ever want them to feel the way I did in my life.
Anyway, back to the point.
So this ADHD, panic disorder shit. I am at my wits end. Before the shut down I cried maybe 2 times every 6 months. I was fine without weed! I started partaking again in February/March but now I feel dependent on it. I have such bad anxiety that I’m crying every single day and that anxiety is the problem.
Fight or flight can go fuck itself. I DONT want to square up with my 4 year old!!! I am the parent who is always pushing for LESS discipline and more positive reinforcement! My husband and in laws have teased me for being weak because I give into my little gremlin!
He is ADHD like me. I can tell. I look him in his stupid ass clone face of mine and I can tell the SECOND he dissociates because *I* do that shit. There is so many things he does that other kids his age do NOT, and it is heavily due to the ADHD/stimulation issues of which I sympathize! I know that he’s been told six times NOT to turn the barn hose on but he was just focused on cleaning his garbage truck and not flooding the hay bales! 
But alas, half of this kind, sweet and understanding mommy is just baked as fuck and wants to cuddle her asshole child because hearing him cry is upsetting. 
Well this mommy can’t afford it. My husband hates the smell of burnt flower and my in laws forbid the use of it on their property.  I can get away with vape cartridges but they clog and it gets expensive. I also can’t have edibles because they don’t work well for the 2 weeks around my period. 
Tonight I was trying to keep it going but I lost my shit, my dudes. This fucking kid is taking a huge sTANK ASS SHIT in our ONE bathroom. He has not filled the toilet with water. Do you know how bad a dry shit smells? While this is happening I am TRYING to listen to an audio book with noise canceling headphones while making dinner using the .5’ of counter space available. Our AC is a loud vent that blows down on your head when you stand at the sink. It is blowing on my head. Captain stank shit has decided to STAND UP IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS DEUCE DROPPING AND BLOW RASPBERRIES AT ME.
Mind you, this fucknut has been shitting in the toilet for a year now and knows how to wipe his own ass. And he has decided this last month that post-poop ass wiping is NOT a time sensitive matter. So he’s smearing his stank all over his taint. Also I HATE the sound of the raspberries— he is mimicking a goat. It is a sensory nightmare. I have the audiobook talking, I am trying to read directions, I hear OVER the AC, audiobook and my own thoughts, the sound of those raspberries and I turned to say “please stop, you know I don’t like that” and saw him standing up with his pants at his ankles in that “I just busted my load and didn’t wipe my shit” lose and I was LIVID. I wanted to Homer Simpson strangle him! walked over to his cackling ass in two steps, shoved him
 back on the toilet and I  started to rant about how it was rude and inconsiderate to be blowing raspberries, that he needs to stop playing around and wipe his butt— and he rolled his eyes and then curled up with his head on his knees and made this whiney annoyed MRRRR EHHHHH EHHHH sound he always does when he is in trouble and doesn’t wanna hear me talk. This anxiety rage is like someone is taking the muscles between your shoulder blades and they are winding it together.
Each wind sends a prickle of heat through you. You feel agitated. Your skin is crawling. The rest of your body gets tense
Like when something is crawling on you and you want desperately to smack it away. It builds and builds, like when you see the cup full of foam and you are waiting for it to spill over because that foam is a metaphor for the breathless feeling that claws away at your lungs...and you either scream, cry, attack or snap and dissociate.
Well Jesus took the wheel cuz my arm shot out and my hand cracked against the back of his head so godamn hard I had to shut the door and walk away cuz that kinda slap was opener to an asswhoopin he’s not old enough for 😤 
He was screamin and crying and I had to go sit down and then ended up leaving the room entirely to calm down. Came back and he was bitchin at me saying he doesn’t like getting smacked and my inner mom wanted so bad to say “welll if you didn’t act like a lil shit I wouldn’t have to smack it outta you” but no I said some m shit like 
“I don’t like it either! I’m sorry I smacked you and I was really mad about it. You need to stop whining at me like that and stop playing on the potty! I wasn’t picking on you, and if daddy had done that he’d have gotten whooped to— but daddy wouldn’t act like that with me, would he?” 
Of course, hubs and I slap each other’s asses for fun so me whoppin daddy is not quite the same BUT I was telling the truth! 
Basically this situation wouldn’t have happened if I had weed. 
Tl;DR
I have anxiety and sensory problems from adhd and shit and on top of quarantine, my son has annoyed me so fucking bad lately that I gotta smoke weed so I don’t yeet him out a window. However, I am trying to QUIT smoking weed because it is an expensive habit. I feel guilt. I am depressed and I hate myself because I feel am not a good enough mother.",30May2020,1
317,"Not a huge issue but a few of my friends are getting together and since rules around lockdown are less strict they’ve asked if we could meet up on the docks at some point to catch up. We all agreed and I decided to invite another friend of ours who isn’t in our groupchat. 

His gf is in the group and she said she has asked him to go out before but he has always said now due to the pandemic and all that’s going on. She said she’s too fed up with him atm to ask again so I said I would ask. I did that. Told him our plans and if he was interested in going. He hasn’t responded. Read it but that’s about it. 

My friends and I will of course be staying apart when we meet up and I do get why our other friend doesn’t feel comfortable meeting up or going out because it makes sense, you could get the virus from anyone and give it to a family member of his. I get it. 

I’m just curious as to how I can get his reply. Does he want to meet up? (Im assuming not but idk because he hasn’t said) or does he not? What type of message could I send that wouldn’t sound like I’m being pushy or needy or annoyed at him lol.",30May2020,1
318,"i just need another opinion/someone else's thoughts as to a situation that's been going on for awhile now

in July of last year, me and my ex-girlfriend ended, on good terms. at first, i didn't really miss her, but a few months ago it started hitting hard

it got to the point where we started talking again. not in a relationship sense, but as friends, I think. we call every now and again, we snapchat each other sometimes, and she seems to be comfortable talking to me

though, here comes the confusing part

she is in a relationship with someone. that's fine and all, if she's happy i'm happy. however her boyfriend apparently said that he wasn't comfortable with her calling/talking to me, so it eased for a few days. we didn't call any more, she sent me a few pictures throughout the day, i sent a few back, i didn't really get any responses but i always responded to hers

but then she started calling me again, and tried to avoid the whole topic. she didn't want to talk about it. i don't know what's going on, honestly.

me, and an ex friend of mine who i typically go to for advice, speculate that she may have feelings for me even though she said that she wasn't ""attracted to me anymore"" when appearances came up in a casual convo, she seemed very defensive about that. i know for a fact i have feelings for her still

she called me a minute ago randomly. it's actually usually random when she calls me. i'll snap her and then she'll just call me

 i ignored it because...i don't know. anxiety, i guess

i just want to know if anyone else has any logical opinions about what might be going on. if me and my friend are likely correct, if she just wants a friend, i don't know

i don't want to ask her. i don't want to make her uncomfortable.",30May2020,1
319,Whenever I get pretty tired I start feeling nauseous and I’m forced to go to sleep. Is this normal and is there anything I can do to prevent it besides just going to sleep? For now it’s manageable but once I go back to school I’m sure there will be late nights studying and whatnot so I’m not sure what to do about the nausea when that time comes.,30May2020,1
320,"Every single house I’ve rented has seemed to have this issue. Every. Single. House. And it’s the worst. 

I moved into a brand new, never lived in house, in January. Everything was fine and okay except for needing to turn the water heater up (done and done) but our AC unit and thermostat refuse to cool down the house. It is absolutely horrible and it’s only 85° outside right now so I can’t even imagine how bad it’ll be once it hits 100°/105°. (Actually I can imagine because it happened in my last rental and was like that for 3 months haha but still) 

I’ve tried what I feel like is everything. Made sure the external unit was switched to on/plugged in, reset the thermostat, tried putting the settings on a higher temperature, flipped the breaker and left it off for some time before turning it back on, closing the vents downstairs to push cold air upstairs, etc.. I’ve called my property manager twice and he gives those things as suggestions but it’s just not working. If the house was being cooled down at all, and was anywhere close to meeting the temperature of 66° that my roommate set it at (I know that’s way too low but he’s paying for it not me- I’d accept 72° minimum) that would be different but it is the same temperature inside that it is outside and everyone is hot and sweaty and upset because it’s so hot. 

So I have two questions. 
1. Any suggestions?? How can I fix this? It’s a brand new house/AC unit so this should NOT be a problem. 
2. What do I do about my property manager? His phone only goes to voicemail and we’re lucky if he calls us back. But he only calls us back to give advice we’ve already tried- to no avail- and seems to not want to come over and look at it or call someone to fix it. If I call the rental company they tell us to call our property manager. Can I call an HVAC company myself and send them the bill? I honestly cannot afford an HVAC bill right now as I’m newly divorced and unemployed due to COVID (I don’t qualify for unemployment apparently) but I’d rather figure out how to pay a bill and possibly get reimbursed/get a credit on rent than deal with this BS. 

Thanks in advance. I appreciate any and all support and feedback or advice.",30May2020,1
321,"So basically a guy started texting me around the end of 2019/start of 2020. We had already known each other casually from college but were never close until we started talking. He was upfront about his intentions, as 2 weeks into us texting on fb, he said ""i'm gonna be honest with you, I'm interested in you in a romantic sense and would like to get to know you better for the purpose of an eventual relationship, I honestly am not talking to you to be your friend i'm not gonna lie"" I appreciated his honesty and said why not, i'll give him a chance. I told him ""ok we'll get to know each other better and if all goes well, we'll take the next step for sure""


From this point forward, we started getting closer. It seems that he really liked me. I thought he was handsome and believed that with time I would eventually develop a strong interest in him. Over a period of 3 months, we would text every single day, attend some college lectures together and we went on a couple of dates, and we just started getting closer and closer. Anyways after 3 months I never caught feelings for him and decided to end us ""seeing"" each other. I honestly don't think i was interested in the guy at all, like ever. 

When I rejected him as a potential partner and told him that I would rather we stay friends, he didn't take it well I guess. He accused me of leading him on, and his reasoning was that I said some ""things"" to him that he took as signs of interest on my part. He says that he thought I was into him because I agreed to meet some of his family members including his mom, told him things like ""you're my type"" and ""I treat you in a special way"", and went out with him twice and was going on a third date before plans were scrapped. To him, that was me leading him on because he thinks those were signs that I was interested in him, when honestly I was never interested and was just giving him and myself a chance.

He told his story to one of my friends and she says he was correct that I led him on and that I should apologize to him.

Tldr; rejected a male friend, he then accuses me of leading him on because I told him things like ""you're my type"" ""I treat you in a special way"", went on dates with him and met some of his family members. He says that I should have rejected him much earlier if I was never at all interested in him, and my friend backs him up.",30May2020,1

323,"So as I said I’ll wake up and see two pizza boxes, and even though I don’t want to eat that there’s like a 50/50 chance my mom won’t be in the mood to make me something, and my father would be in the room bugging me to just eat the fat fucking shit we always get outside. He always get stuff outside for me and for my little brother who is severely autistic. But despite being autistic he still has that same thing in common like me and my father, we all use junk food as a way to escape from our problems. So much so to the point that we look forward to it. And many times when my brother would ask (just by saying the name of the food) when he would ask for just one specific food my father would have to order and it pisses me off. It pisses me off more than my little brother is actually pretty fucking fat. And I get mad when I look in the mirror and see myself and I see my own fucking father with his fat belly. God it makes me want to put holes in the wall this anger and embarrassment. And hell I’d cook the same thing everyday but my father would still fucking bug me about it. What am I supposed to do when I go to the kitchen and I see fast food and my mother doesn’t want to cook and my father is just away chomping and my little brother does the same? The amount of fucking times I used this to put myself down, that familiar fucking mindset of me and my family being the losers.

324,"I have a friend who is a total skeptic about Covid-19. He thinks all news/media is a complete hoax and that the only purpose of the ""supposed pandemic"" is for the government to take away freedoms and create a police state. He has this tendency to reject any ""mainstream"" beliefs. You could easily predict his opinion on just about any event. I personally don't share these views, and it's not what I'm here to discuss. Let me be a paranoid sheep for a minute.

We recently caught up for the first time in months. It quickly turned in to an unnecessary debate over Covid-19. I have no issues with a healthy discussion, but he really crossed the line by purposely coughing, wiping his hands on my shirt, and ridiculing me for simply wanting to keep my distance. He literally laughs off any suggestion that this is a real threat. I was surprised at how obnoxious and provocative he was about our difference in views. 

This is not the first time we've had differences in opinion, but we've always stayed behind the line. If the roles were reversed and I was the skeptic, there's no way I could become that militant about it just to prove a point. If I thought someone was sheepishly believing something, I wouldn't shove it down their throat and expect them to suddenly ""see the truth"". You know what I'm saying?

What would you do? It's tempting to cut this person out completely. I don't need that kind of rude bullshit. To avoid any doubt - I'm not uncomfortable about changing my view or what the truth might be. I will listen to anyone that's being reasonable.

Can't say I'm thrilled with it, being a guy and knowing how we think. But lately she's been talking to her ex that she left because he was abusive. The conversations seem mundane enough, but there's been talk of ""hanging out"" if it doesn't ""give me a heart attack"". I trust her, but this guy is her krypotonite, he knows how to manipulate her and it seems like every time they start talking our relationship starts to sour. Lately I've not felt any emotion coming from her and I know a lot of it is from being tired from chasing around a two year old and a newborn, but I want to know if the fear I'm feeling is valid, or if I should trust her and let what happens happen or confront her about it? I don't know what to do, I'm not good with this stuff and I don't want to lose her because I know if I do, I won't meet anyone and I genuinely love her. And I'm scared if I give her an ultimatum, that she won't choose me. I ask her if she's happy and she assures me she's not going anywhere, but it seems like another guy comes a long and she starts talking to them, and then next thing you know she's hanging out with them and it's not good on my anxiety.

I have always been wanting to leave this country and live in an English speaking country. I have studied and gotten good grades all my life but the only thing that can be considered as a weak point in all my studies has been in this country's language Bangla. I understand English and have no problem going to another country and learning a lot of new but old things again. 

Here are most of the main reasons for me to want this:

1. I like the 1st world countries and their mental and physical freedom.
2. I want to live in a country that I choose to live in, not a place my parents choose.
3. I don't have any kind of emotional connection with any of the people I currently know (e.g. family, friends, relatives, etc).
4. This country has a lot of sexism, corruption, religious influence, low understanding of nature, and biological taboo, etc.

Even if some of these reasons may not be valid to some people for an Atheist, LGBTQ+ &amp; gender equality supporter it is not a very healthy place to live. No place is perfect but I want to live in a free/open place.

332,"I know this may seem dumb but I’m struggling. 

When I was in high school, I was a hottie. I was a high-level athlete and fitness junkie, I took obsessively good care of my hair, skin and teeth and had a “savage” attitude that guys thought was cool. That period was the most confident I think I’ve ever been. That’s saying something though, because I was also diagnosed orthorexic around that time and had some real issues surrounding my looks. 

In the years since, a lot of shit has happened including the death of my first husband and several health diagnoses. Over the last 8 years, I have gained over 50 lbs, my once-great complexion is now mottled with acne and scars and I don’t even recognize my reflection. I don’t recognize my habits either, I went from an avid reader and enthusiastic artist to a zombie. I don’t even know where most of my days go anymore and I’m dragging my heels hard on the opportunity I’m being presented with to pursue my dream creative career. 

I should be asleep, but instead I was scrolling Instagram where I kept seeing pictures from my childhood friends. They went on to become famous models/performers and they have these beautiful bodies and pouty lips and lash extensions, they’re like painfully beautiful and successful. I’m honestly so envious. 

I was getting in the bath tonight and just felt like this fat slab of mediocrity. I started to have thoughts like maybe if I just stuck with a workout plan, got lip injections and invested all this money I don’t have into my appearance i would feel better. My fiancé came in later trying to be all lovey dovey and I can’t even accept it because I don’t understand why he wants to marry me.

333,"So my friends (13) started sending these WhatsApp stickers of a Dora without clothing. It’s not very inappropriate, it just shows no clothing.

I’m really concerned and worried if it’s allowed or not. I’m really scared that it’s illegal because I accidentally sent the sticker as well and I forgot to delete it.

336,So one of my friend’s relatives is a extremely racist anti-black police officer I believe he is a police brutality ticking time bomb. Is there anything I can do?,30May2020,1
337,"So basically, I have this one friend group that mostly hangs out at lunch- we usually just talk about silly things and we get along pretty well. (It should be noted that mum is strict and I’m basically never allowed to go out- I mostly hang out with these friends during school; I know they hang out outside of school.) We’re all in a group chat together on Instagram- where we mostly send funny posts to each other. I kind of made the mistake of asking for information on the Minnesota shooting- cause I was confused on which event was which. (A LOT HAPPENED OVER LIKE, TWO DAYS BTW- WOW.) This prompted an argument between two of the friends- one who believed it was a race issue and one who didn’t. We all agreed that what the police officer did was wrong, and the police officer needed to be reprimanded; as well as other things- but the two were arguing about the underlying causes. I did my best to mediate between the two, citing it didn’t really matter what the underlying cause was so long as something’s done to keep people from dying like this again- but eventually the one who didn’t think it was a race issue left the chat. I messaged him and asked if he was okay- to which he said yeah, and that he just wanted to cool off. I told him that I sided more with the other friend on the specifics but I didn’t think it mattered much to which he agreed. I then wished him a good day. I then talked to my other friend and asked if she was okay and she was annoyed but also stated she was cooling and gave her the same speech but with an attachment of trying to explain that I saw politics as more of a bus stop scenario and not really a final destination. (It made sense- this is just already a long post.) I thought everyone was gonna be okay but then later the one friend who thought it was a racial thing took screenshots of the conversation and posted them- saying that the one friend was an awful person. (They edited my responses out.) When it came to the argument- I sided with the friend who thought it was a racial thing more, but I think it was wrong for her to post the conversation- (she didn’t edit out the other friends username, etc.) I’m a social person, but my main friend group never deals with these sort of situations. Any arguments I have with my main group is usually resolved within a day or two at most after a long conversation about feelings and stuff. I have no idea how to handle this situation though- any pointers? (Sorry for long post.)",30May2020,1
338,I have a fictional story I am writing called A Decade Long Sleep about a kid who got hit by a car and was in a coma for a decade and in his coma he is in a world in between the living and dead but after he wakes up he can’t remember. He lives in this world until he pass a test called The Test of the Living. Then his memories from his coma and before is starting to come back to him little by little and trying to find a girl he met and she said she lived in New York the story is still a work in progress but the girl died and he is overwhelmed with grief and the story end with him finding this out and asking how long ago she died and realize that the coma test wasn’t actually a test it was something to distract them until they either woke up or died. So should I enter this story in a literature writing contest?,30May2020,1
339,"For the past 7 years I’ve been in the process of fix my life after going through a rough patch (i.e. bipolar disorder depression and social anxiety). I went back to school to finish up my degree and was finally able to save up enough money to for a sizable down payment on a house for my parents and siblings. We had lived in a small two-bedroom apartment for nearly two decades. The house was something I really wanted to do given how patient my parents have been with me over the years.

Unfortunately, because of school and work, I had no real time for a social/dating life other than the occasional drinks with coworkers. Now because of the lockdown I’ve really begun to feel alone and depressed the past few months, almost to a point where I think I’m going through an existential crisis. I'm not too worried about the social side as I'm sure I can make friends either through hobbies, they gym, or even reach out to some old ones. I'm mostly concerned about the dating side. I really want to get back into the dating scene, but I’m afraid women will be turned off by the fact I live with my parents. My parents do chip in with whatever little they have but it’s not enough to help me pay mortgage and separate rent for myself. And I know that they’re technically living with me, but I feel as if that’s not how they will see it. If not the parent thing, then they may find the fact that I have a mortgage too much of a risk for themselves. It also doesn't help that my parents are religious, and wouldn't be too thrilled by me bring women around the house, though this is less of a concern at the moment. 

Please understand that I'm not coming from the mindset that women are all self-serving or selfish. These concerns are just insecurities, especially given my age and how rusty I am due to a 7-year dating hiatus. That being said,  I would honestly rather be rejected because of my looks/personality rather than the house situation. The last thing I want to do is to ever regret buying the house for my parents. 

Am I overthinking this? What would be the best way to bring it up on a date?",30May2020,1
340,"TL;DR: my manager ask too much of me and is either oblivious to the fact or dgaf about me. Any and all advice is welcomed, ty.

I work in food service. I do deliveries, cashier, waiter and dishes; all in a days work...today started slow and work was backed up when i got there, nothing too unusual but more common than not...

I walk in and already my manager is pinning multiple task on me (this is pretty regular) half of which i do without having to be asked and the other half she knows how to do and has been told by me multiple times that i do not know how to do, just yet, but yet still chooses to assign and abandon on me. Luckily another co worker bailed me out but if not our customer probably would've been waiting longer for something that could've already been done before they even got there.

Fast forward a few hours or so and deliveries start coming in. atm its just one we're working on so we get it done fairly quickly. i take a few more deliveries but we end up falling behind due to computer issues and a possible mini rush that came while i was out. So even though these delivery times are shit im thugging that shit out.

7:30pm rolls around and that's when we cut deliveries. Before I went on my first delivery there was multiple loads of dishes and i cleared that shit. When i got back(id been out on deliveries for an hr&amp; a half at minimum)  there was again multiple loads waiting for me, which means somebody had the time to collect all these dirty dishes but didn't have time to run one load or even rinse a few...this shit infuriates me to no end because i work with these cucks and i know they sit on their ass, whip out there phone for a nice 10mins and socialize when ""we've"" got nothing to do...

So i take my time with that shit because dish on paper isn't my responsibility that's not what they hired me for i do that shit out of the kindness of my heart and because i take pride in keeping my work station clean plus it keeps my busy. I pour a few cups of water and lemonade for myself and just try to calm my nerves and get in a better headspace before i start the dishes but then my parents text me asking if i want some food and i asked if they'd drop it off, they said yes.

so now im holding out even longer to do dish and my manager has already ""asked me"" (""hey bb you'll do the dishes?..."") Like 3 times in a span of like 10mins and she's getting really irritated probably because I'm not letting her pussy-whip me and not immediately doing what she's asking but it's because I want my hands to be clean before i eat and my parents are literally right across the street getting food for me so they're not going to be very long but finally manager confronts me...

Her: ""Is there a reason you're not doing the dishes?""
Me: "" im waiting for my parents to bring me food""
Her: well can you at least start doing a load? We've only got 30mins till we close
Me: *checks watch* It's more like 50.
Her: ok well we still gotta do xyz and xyz and yadayadayada...
Me: *walks away because my parents just pulled up*

I go back to dish area, eat my Jr burger with onion rings, turn on the faucet and begin to devise my plan...manager comes around the corner...

Her: Omg bb you haven't even started! This is bullshit why haven't you started? What's the hold up?! You gotta do all this before blahblahblahblah....( i cant remember exactly what she was saying because I was getting furious. Point is, she was bitching at me for something that could've been done by any of the other 4 people not including me that was there and it wouldn't have gotten that way if someone just rinsed or did a few loads while i was away...)

This is basically the whole story, I told her to fuck off and said something like i know y'all aren't that busy to not do a few dishes it's because y'all didn't want to and of course she argued back and tried to antagonize me saying that she's been busy and were suppose to be a team...

Most of this stuff is so petty to me and most likely others but im fed up with people thinking they can bully me or just talk any kind of crazy way to me.",30May2020,1

342,"As a 22 year old African American male, I understand and quite frankly am outraged by the recent death of George Floyd as well as countless and countless of other cases of police brutality over the years. This is the first time I actually have taken part in a protest, regarding the subject matter. Recently with the effects of the protesting leading to riots and vandalism, one recently happening a few blocks from where I reside in Charlotte. 

On one note, I understand why we'd be outraged enough to have to resort to violence, each other method of a formal and peaceful protest ending with tear gas, flash bombs, etc launched in our directions, not to mention being ridiculed for simply taking a knee during the National Anthem or wearing shirts that support our movement  while others can simply be armed, standing on city hall, yelling and screaming for the country to open back up. 

And on the other note comes confliction where I can't agree with the vandalism of properties especially in my community. I just feel a sense of guilt and I suppose, its because I'm not really that violent of a individual, I just cant find it in my heart to witness it and just be okay with it, it's really tearing me up and I don't know what to do or how to think on it.",30May2020,1

346,"I’m gonna preface this saying I’m a female and I’ll refer to my friends (both male) as A (single) and B (in a relationship). 

A just finished his classes at medical school and I found out yesterday from his Snapchat that he’s in town. I also figured out in that story that A and B were together at B and his gf’s apartment. I literally had NO idea that A was even coming home and I know he would’ve told B, who also didn’t mention it to me. Neither of them have said anything to me and have hung out two nights in a row now. 

To complicate things more, I think the reason why I haven’t been invited is because B’s gf has been starting to make her dislike for me more obvious to B. I know this b/c B and I went on a nature walk around a week ago and when we got back to the parking lot in front of his apartment he literally told me “you can come in, [insert B’s gf’s name] is not here right now.” I don’t think he meant to phrase it that way, but I think it was a telling slip. I bring this up because A and B have been hanging out together at B and his girlfriend’s apartment. Part of me can’t help but feel like I’m intentionally not being invited because she’s told B I’m not welcome. I feel really hurt to just be ghosted &amp; kept so out of the loop. 

For B’s last 2 birthdays she has asked me to help her throw B a surprise party. B’s gf has been upset before about our friendship. One night B accidentally fell asleep at my place and both of us apologized to her about it. I realized I might be unintentionally putting strain in their relationship and called B saying I don’t think we should be friends anymore. The next day his gf called me and asked to meet. We did, she asked me if I had feelings for B and I assured her I don’t. She said she had asked B if he had any feelings for me &amp; he said no. She said she never wanted us to stop being friends but was just feeling left out &amp; forgotten by B because we were spending so much time together. We hugged it out &amp; both went to go talk to B. 

I can’t help but feel like if she does want us to stop being friends that B will end up picking her over his friendship with me (which I would understand, but I don’t understand why it needs to come to that). 

Do I reach out to B’s gf? If A or B don’t say anything to me over the next week, I’m tempted to just end my friendship with both. A and I have also been romantically involved multiple times over the last year for what it’s worth.

350,"So I’ve been best friends with this person for up to 1 year and we are both in this close friend group. He has always liked me and made it very clear from just being flirtatious. A long time ago I started to question if I liked him back and then that news got back to him and it brought his hopes up, I then realized that the way I was feeling was probably because of the continuous encouragement my other friends were giving me to be with him. I told him that since we were such close friends, I didn’t want to ruin that from us being in a relationship. Overtime we both moved on from it and I later started getting involved with someone else for about 2 months.

There was no problem concerning that, but that ended pretty soon. We’re closer now than how we were back then. We recently hung out at a get together with close friends and I noticed him stroking one of my friends hair and it made me feel some time of way. I don’t want to lead him on like the last time and hurt his feelings again.

My main concern is that we’re involved with the same people so if I were to ever do anything with him, he’d tell one of our friends (even though I don’t think he’d do that) but the paranoia would be there. Or the fact that if we were to breakup the friend group wouldn’t really be the same. If there’s anyone who’s dated a close friend before, let me know what you recommend.",30May2020,1

He's mentioned that he has a moral opposition to watching p*rn, and he feels like he hasn't been given consent. So he's a teen guy that's never watched porn and rarely jacks off, and he's miserable. He's also been rejected a few times recently; while I'm there for him for any support he needs, it's hard for me to offer advice because he's the only person I've ever dated, and we're both rather socially inept. And I am technically a member of the ""Friendzoners"" in this situation, though he's made it clear that he doesn't blame me and he still values me as a friend, no matter what.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how can I comfort him when he expressed frustration over his situation? He's a really nice dude and I would hate to see him give up hope.

Because of covid we haven’t been visiting especially because we both had it and had to self quarantine. Now that everything is a little more relaxed she asks him to bring over stuff like water (many bottles) even though her oldest son is still living with her. My bf does things like that whenever he has time but mind you he has to travel by car to work and back. Yesterday she called him, he was sleeping and didn’t pick up. Then she left a voicemail blaming me for not picking up. 

Mind you I always had a good relationship with her although she could be complicated and hurtful at times (just like her friends) but in a million years I would never say my bf should not contact her.

355,So all my life I’ve struggled with weight. Ever since I was eight the doctor told me I was far  above average weight. Every school I went to I would be mocked by at least one person for my weight. When I was younger (10ish-13ish) My parents would always say the same thing “Starting Monday we are going to start working out and eating healthier.” but I was never motivated the thought of being slightly more attractive and healthier didn’t seem like a good enough goal for all the work I had to put in. Especially since I would always comfort eat because I got bullied a lot as a kid. It led to a sick twisted cycle of being fat and getting mocked then comfort eating and being fatter etc. There are only two thing that have been or would be able to motivate me. One year when I was little me and my family were going on a vacation. my mother said that she would give us 1 dollar for every pound we lost to spend on vacation. both me and my brother lost somewhere between 20 and 30 pounds in two months. The second thing that could motivate me is punishment. People say that punishment is not a good motivator. But I feel that punishment is the best motivator. For instance if someone told you to do something you’d be more likely to do it if they held a gun to your head. So please give me some ways that I could motivate my self wether it be punishment or reward. Thank you in advance.,30May2020,1
356,"Hi all this just happened and I’d appreciate any feedback. Sorry in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile.

So I just got a new car and my parents were with me to help and co-sign for it (just got my first credit card, so my credit is basically no existent). After we sign everything we’re waiting outside with my new car for the salesman to come back with the plates. I take a picture of the car and send it to my best friends. After I sent it my mom said, “Let me take a picture and send it to Hon (maternal gma).”

Me being cold and tried (we were there for about 2 hours after the dealer closed) said, “Just send her a picture of the car.”

Both my parents said no and told me to just get in front of the car. As I started walking my dad mentioned how he wanted to send it to my grandparents (paternal) and I replied, “No only send it to Hon”

To give to the brief TDLR on my grandparents without getting too deep we don’t get a long with them or my dad’s family that well. They’ve done/been a part of some messed up shit to all 4 of us and have treated my parents like shit. We’ve cut contact with them a few times and as of now things seem alright. In recent years, my dad has had a few coming to Jesus moments. In those talks basically said they’ll loose both me and my brother if this continues. Since I’ve gone off to college (I’m a third year) I could probably fit the number of times they’ve talked to them on 2 hands. Whenever I do talk to them it is either me initiating the conversation or them be nugged by my dad to reach out. The conversations a very surface level and fell like they just can’t wait to stop talking to me.

Because of this, I’ve stopped making an effort to reach out to them, but I remain polite and cordial when I happen to see them in person or they text. For the most part I want nothing to do with them, I have given them endless chances and they have usually ended badly so I keep them at an arms length. I prefer them not know anything about what I am doing and that we just go on living separate lives. I don’t wish them any ill will but I just can’t flip a switch and forget everything. I know that is really fucked up to say, I feel like they’ve proven time and time again that they don’t deserve a relationship with me and they don’t give me the same respect I’ve given them in the past.

Both my parents know exactly how I feel and mother respects it but has encouraged me to let go of the anger and resentment I have, my dad on the other seems like he’s in denial about how I feel. Whenever, I make comment about how I feel about them or have flat out said “I don’t want to go to X with them” he always hits me with “stop they’re your grandparents.” If anything that makes the entire situation worse in my eyes. I’m very much a believer that your family doesn’t have to be blood and that if someone doesn’t show you the same amount of respect you show them, they don’t deserve you.

Now back to the story.

I stood behind the car and saw my dad took his phone out and I said, “No let my mom take it”

My dad started protesting about how he was going to send it to my grandparents and my mom interjected with “Respect her boundaries.”

My dad kept the phone out so I just squared out of view. My dad started getting even more pissed and we all started bickering back and forth. My dad relented then put his phone down but when my mom told me to pull down my mask, he took out his phone again. I squatted again and and the bickering started this time my mom just told me to stand and take the photo. I relented and stood straight then walked away to sit down with my mom. My dad stayed with the car.

As we were walking my mom said, “Well you pissed your dad off now.”

“Well, he’s pissing me off too.”

“You have no right to act that way”

“Mom, I have every right to act that way.”

“They’re your grandparents. You keep this up then you are no better than them.”

I didn’t reply and we sat in silence till the salesman came back. After everything was finished I drove my mom and I home and my dad followed in his truck. 

When we were walking towards the front door, my mom mouthed “apologize to your dad and thank him” I nodded and we walked in.

We were greeted by my brother and our dogs. My brother asked were the car was and I handed them the key and told him it was in the driveway. I was planning on going out there with him after I calmed the dogs down (they get very loud and excited whenever we come home). I’m in my room petting them and just as they got quiet my mom walked by and noticed she noticed I was in my room she said, “You didn’t go out there with him!?! You’ll send pictures to your friends but not let us take them. What kind of person are you??” 

When I get mad/overwhelmed I shut down and go silent and that’s exactly what happened. I also didn’t want to reply because I knew things would just snowball even more and just wanted to avoid it. I didn’t say anything to her and just walked outside. My brother and I talked for a bit about the car then came back inside. I walked to my parents room after and said goodnight and apologized to my dad for acting like an ass and thanked him for helping me with the car. He nodded and my mom walked past me to get in the shower and that was it.

Reddit I’m not sure want to do now, this isn’t the first time an agrument like this and has happened. And each time it has happened I feel like my parents kind of just brush it out of view. In the past they have scolded me/pushed me to be more open with my feelings (I usually prefer to keep things to myself and handle them on my own). Since quarantine I have voiced my grieves with my father a few times but he just brushes my off and or tells me I’m over reacting/need to calm down. 

In terms of the boundary thing this isn’t the first time my dad has just completely ignored what I’ve asked of him. There are times when he’s asked me to call my grandparents and I’ve said ok I’ll did after X or in such and such minutes, and he comes back 2 minutes later with the phone already dialed with my grandparents number. When this has happened, my mom has scolded him for not trusting me but he just passed it off with “they called me.”

Another time this occurred was last year around final season. I got hurt at work and had to drive myself to the ER and about 2 days before that my hard drive failed and I lost 2 of my final essays. After I got out of the ER I called my parents and told them what happened and asked them to just keep it quiet for a few days till I knew everything was going to be alright. The day after I was home from the ER, I was in my dorm and started getting calls and texts from my grandparents. I answered them and was respectful.

After I took care of that I called my parents and basically chewed my dad out. Here’s the convo as best I could remember it,

“Dad why did you tell them? I already told BOTH of you that I didn’t want anyone to know.”

“They’re your grandparents they have I right to know, they cared about you.”

“Uh huh I get that but on MY own terms, it’s not fair that Hon and my Nino do not get to know while they do. I told you that we’d wait. I don’t have time to deal with all these calls, I have TWO finals I have to rewrite now, I’m down a hand AND have to pack up my dorm.”

My dad relented and ended up calling them and told them to leave me alone and that I was very stressed and received no more calls. 

With quarantine I feel like we’ve been bickering a lot more and I’ve kind of just given up and just shut down. Recently it feels like everyday is a new argument and I’m afraid things might get worse. Next semester will be completely online for me so I won’t be moving back into my dorm. While I am happy that I get to stay home and be with them, I am very fearful that I might just explode and say something I might regret. The times I’ve gotten mad and gone silent it feels like their looking at me like I’m crazy or just blowing things out of proportion but when I approach them when they’re mad then I’m bugging then and not leaving them alone.",30May2020,1

360,"Some Context - I love to read, my mother knows it. Also, I had to appear for the online AP Exams this year and due to some technical issues, I applied for a make-up exam which I will be taking in a couple of days.

What happened was that I had talked to my mother about buying 3 books a few days before the ORIGINAL online AP exams so that they would be delivered after I gave my exams and I would enjoy reading them after I was done with testing. There was a period of around 15-20 days between the original exam and the make up test during which 2 books were delivered and I read 1 of those 2 books WHILE I continued to study for my make up test because I was bored of being home all day.

Now the third book was about to be delivered a few days before the make-up exam and I had explicitly specified to my parents that I'll read it after my exam, but, today my father got to know that the third book I had ordered was ""Crime and Punishment"" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. After which he started scolding me for some reason I don't completely understand, he said ""how in the world did your (my) mother allowed you to by ""these"" kinds of books"" (idk wtf he meant by this, he probably judged the book by it's name) and said ""why would a child like me read something like this"" (I know for a fact he's not read Crime and Punishment). I tried telling him what it was about but he didn't seem to care.

He then started scolding me that I should focus my studies and not waste time on frivolities like these. Upon being reminded of my promise to not read it before my exam, he implied I was hypocritical because I read a book by Marx before my exam (the book I had read was ""The Communist Manifesto"", my father has been mildly critical, albeit teasingly, of my political leanings). I tried talking about how he always does this (he has criticized my reading in the past, saying it would hinder my studies) and I admit I got passionate in my defence because this is something close to me and I raised my voice.

My mother reprimanded me for this and I went quiet. My father then began to glare at me quite severely. I felt pissed so I matched his gaze, however, unlike him, I had a poker face. After which he proceeded to hit me, on the head, multiple times. It hurt, so involuntarily, a few tears started falling. While he was hitting me, I, through the tears kept saying ""what did he hope to achieve by hitting me?"", he kept saying ""how dare I think of myself as his equal"" (this is something he feels strongly about, he has chided me in the past with this statement at various occasions). My parents have strong opinions on children ""talking back"" to their parents.

After he had hit me a few times, he went away to do something in another room. I took a few minutes to collect myself and wipe my tears. He came back to the room I was in for something when I said ""glaring and hitting aren't good parenting tactics"" after which he said ""You better shut up"". I replied, admittedly without thinking, ""why? will you hit me and then prove my point?"", this, I acknowledge wasn't a nice thing to say.

He got mad but did not hit me. Now, both my parents are giving me the cold shoulder, my mother says it is because they are angry with me for raising my voice and talking back.

My father is nice, on almost all days, and usually doesn't get angry easily, which is why today was so strange. At the end of the day, I love my parents and need them to survive. How do I make amends? Do I apologize? Do I do something else?

367,"College student here, let me start this off by saying we live in an area that is not gated, and does not have an HOA or any regulations what so ever. Well this all started because one day I decided to change some bushings on my car. It was sitting on jack-stands and I was underneath it working on it and it was going to be done that night and put back on the ground. Neighbor proceeds to come home and feel nosey enough to come over and tell me to take it down because this is “a nice neighborhood” he proceeds to go to my parents instead of just talking to me about it, and quickly gets told to basically just go home and mind his business since no harm is being done. Nothing happens for a while and he continues to see me doing work on my truck such as changing out spark plugs and all is well. Next time he comes over when I am detailing my car thoroughly and complains about there being water on the ground, literally water on THE GROUND. This time he gets the door slammed on him and he walks home. Time passes on and the next time I see him he is coming home while I am washing my truck and stops his vehicle for a second, pretty much trying to see what I am doing so he can decide whether he wants to come over and bitch about it or just go inside. He chose the right option and went inside. Then today another issue occurs. I have a good relationship with the people who live in my area around my house (culdesac) besides him. Neighbor to the left is a family man and stand up guy, next to him is an old couple who are friendly and love my vehicles and always make sure to wave and be friendly, next to them is an odd couple who keep to themselves and are always busy working so nobody hears much or sees them outside. In front of my house is an old persons home and the owner only comes outside to smoke during his breaks. Well the neighbor who wants to be nosy seems to have littered right next to my car and truck leaving beer cans and Powerade bottles. I threw them away and went about my day. I’m just really tired of this dude and want him to pretty much, fuck off. No harm is ever done. We don’t smoke or drink outside. We don’t play music, yell, or even cuss. And whenever we do finish working on the vehicles we clean up properly and make sure there is no mess, we leave the street how it was before we started. Seems like he just really has an itch to be a dickhead.

TLDR: neighbor feels he needs to be nosy and act like the neighborhood cop, continuously harassing kids for working on their vehicles.",30May2020,1

369,"F- friend 

FH-friend's husband

BF-my boyfriend

this is a long story, please bear with me.

This all started in May. I was planning to return home (got retracted from the company due to the virus); got everything packed up, terminated my rent and did all the relevant procedures. Few days before I was supposed to fly, my flight gets cancelled and I won't be able to get another flight back home until mid-June, so that's still one month I have to spend here. So F, whom I met in church when I moved here, offered to let me stay at her and FH's place until I could find a flight back home, foc. I was immensely grateful ofc because my BF was already staying with them (we are mutual friends &amp; he was staying there temporarily). He paid for both our stays before though they said we don’t have to. 

So after I moved in, things were great for a while. Not long after, she asked me (I work as a nutritionist) to help her lose weight, by planning what to cook and eat and I agreed, because I felt like it was the least I could do. One day I decided to cook some rice, spent all morning making a whole meal and when it was done, F took two bites and said it was too tasteless, so she stopped eating it and looked very fed up. I was annoyed of course. This wasn’t the first time she had something to say about my food. I don’t mind people not liking my food, it is more the attitude of it. Then here's the thing, whenever we cook, FH, BF and I would always clean up the kitchen after we use it. And, on this day, as usual, after I cooked, I made sure to clean everything I used. A little while later, she comes into the room and says that BF and I need to treat their place (it was a new place) better, clean up after ourselves, brings up the one time we forgot to clean the airfryer. So we apologize for making a mess and making her upset. After she went out of the room, I felt like I had to talk to her so I went to the kitchen and suggested tentatively if it would better if I didn't cook anymore. 

After dinner that night, we decided to talk it out because she had iced me the entire afternoon and I really wanted things to be okay, for us to clear the air. How the talk went was that when I said that I felt hurt from her actions at lunch, she said we were making her look like a bad person for just one thing, she was letting BF and I stay there for free and she feels very hurt from the way we accuse her and that she also has a lot of things she wanted to say to us but never did. She also wanted my BF to apologize for being upset on my behalf &amp; not being objective because he had defended me. Conclusion: we apologized because it was true that we were staying there for free and we honestly just wanted to move past this.

All while this was going on, FH had also tried to gently explain to her why we were feeling like this (during lunch he actually said the food was nice) but F still refused to listen. Around 10 that night, we had another talk, and basically she said she was very hurt like we forgot all her kindness, so from now on we cannot cook in their kitchen and BF and I are only allowed one compartment in the fridge, our stuff has to be separated from their stuff. 

I couldn't sleep that night because I genuinely felt bad for the way things turned out and was upset because I didn't how our friendship would go on. So we decided to write out a letter, sincerely explaining how we felt and apologizing once more. FH later sends us a message saying she is okay now after reading the letter, and that maybe she felt deeply hurt because she cared for us a lot. So we achieved a tentative truce and things went back to normal-ish. But I started being super-duper cautious. I stay in the room whenever possible; I only cook when they ask me to, I just tryd to be as invisible as possible.  

Fast forward to today, she and FH went to talk to BF about me. Apparently, they have concerns about me wasting food and how they are paying for most of the food. Thing is, the one or two times we threw food away (mushrooms and leeks) was because we were having the conflict and she said we couldn’t cook anymore and the food spoilt. After that, I was super cautious about what we buy. And the thing is, F, FH, and BF have set up a grocery budget together; I insisted on paying as well but they wouldn’t take my money, getting angry if I pushed. F also recently bought baking supplies because she wanted to bake and she keeps asking me to bake. But being super paranoid now, I never touch anything unless she wants to bake then I will assist her. Then she keeps asking me 'why don't you bake? Just bake.' So, I just say okay, but I haven’t actually done anything. BUT she said to BF I should ask for their permission before baking because all the supplies were bought with their money. I really don’t get it.  

Now I'm considering whether to rent a temporary place to stay because it's honestly so stressful for me to live here, I never know when I'm going to make a wrong move. Please give me advice on what I should do to fix this friendship.",30May2020,1

371,"Feeling super stuck and I'll try and make this as short as possible.   


Dad recently moved out of my house, and mum couldn't afford the rent on her own so an ex-boss of hers and the boss' 4 year old kid moved in to cover half of the expenses. I was of course living there at the time, and for reasons not really relevant I didn't get along with the new move-ins at all, and quite frankly her child was the most undisciplined child i've ever met.   


My boyfriend and I made plans to move into a new place together, so I packed my things and moved in with him and his parents (w/my cat too) for the short term until we found a place. After a couple of weeks staying at his, we found a place, put a bond and deposit down and started buying things for our new home. Anyways, he got made redundant a couple days ago so that's totally destroyed our plans to move out.  


Feeling super stuck - I don't want to stay at my boyfriends house for the foreseeable future because obviously its not my ""home"", and his parents are in the middle of a divorce pretty much so it's quite tense here. I don't want to go home because the environment sucks. I'm also a student, and i really have trouble concentrating there due to constant noise/yelling there.

Im just an average 19 yr old and I feel aimless and unsure with what I want to do and I don’t know why. I use to have a job that supported my rent but i was laid off. Luckily i saved alot and I decided I wanted do focus on what i wanted to do with my life. Im a really big fan of comics and manga like marvel in general, jojo and my hero academia and I wanted to start creating my own stories and I was initially ecstatic because It felt like everything was lined up for me to shoot and succeed.
But that was about a year ago. No matter how hard i tried, I couldn’t do it or I just couldn’t see it thru. From what i know (in my tiny circle of friends) everyone i’ve explained my stories too has really enjoyed them, but when i draw, i just get a horrid feeling that it no good and I’m not cut out for this so i stopped
Now I kinda just piddle the day away, occasionally helping and my mothers work, but not leaving the house for much else. I’m not sure where to go from this point, had it not bin for the stimulus check (thx Trump) I’d be kicked out a week ago. Im wanna give comics another shot but I’m afraid that ill just fall thru again. Maybe its a lifestyle thing or an environmental thing, but I just have so much trouble seeing things thru or creating the things i want too.
Im just curious if anyone has any kind of advice they could throw my way that I could use to better my circumstances.

Also when I asked him to explain his recent weird behavior, he says he is like that to all his girl friends (which I dont rly believe) and then he asked me out, i said yes, to which he told me it was a joke, which hurt.

RED was seemingly fine with it but proceeded to ignore us the whole way back to the apartment and it bothered me because it’s not like any of us had enough money to pay for the Uber to get to Bourbon anyway so going home was honestly the best choice. Another time she called me a literal f**cking idiot because I couldn’t remember the name of a book that my teacher showed me I was more focused on the material my teacher was telling me about then the name of the book. I assume RED was mad at me because maybe she wanted to buy the book to study it (keep in mind RED makes straight A’s and her grade was not in danger at all) but I did express to her that I didn’t like being talked to like that and she apologized but she did ignore me for like a day following this incident. Another instance that happened was that I planned a lunch with Red and my other nursing school friend and I told Red a week ago that it was supposed to be a lunch. So Red on the day of the lunch forgot we were going out to eat and she was already at Sephora and she assumed it was a dinner...even though I specifically told her it was a lunch (keep in mind Red asked ME two days prior if we were still going out to eat and I stated “yes we are” and she mentioned nothing about dinner) I even went back in our texts from a week ago to make sure I said lunch and I definitely did. Well Red proceeded to tell me that “it was just only MEE who thought it was a lunch” and insinuated that I didn’t plan it right.  I didn’t clarify to my other nursing school friend if it would be a lunch or a dinner (which is my fault 100%  I thought RED and the other friend knew it was a lunch by the texts and language I used but I guess not and that’s my fault yes for not clarifying to the other friend but she understanding and we rescheduled for tomorrow but RED Cant come until next Thursday. Red definitely knew that it was a lunch though because I definitely texted it out and told her)  I will 100% admit that it was a lack of communication on everyone’s part about what time everyone wanted to go but for Red to tell me that it was only me who knew it was a lunch even though I TOLD her it was a lunch a week ago made me very upset and when I defended myself saying that I did tell her it was a lunch RED did not respond to my text and it’s been over 8 hours. I just don’t know what to do because this behavior of Red really bothers me and idk if it’s me overreacting or if my friend isn’t being a good friend.",30May2020,1
385,"16m turning 17 soon

Nobody in my friend group is ambitious, all they want to do is play video games for the rest of their life (not joking) 

I spend time studying for exams and school in general (sometimes they make fun of me for doing it) [make fun of somebody for revising? Seems legit] 

I want to be something when I’m older, I’m determined, I know what I want to do with my life, I know what’s out there, and I want it.

But my friends are content with living off benefits if it means they can play games all day. 

I have a friend (not in the friend group) who’s determined to do well, who wants to make something of their life.

But what I realised is, i don’t care what type of job they have, or whether they’re on benefits, the problem is that they have no determination to do anything with their life. If they got hit by a car tomorrow, they wouldn’t think, “no I have so much I want to do/live for” 

Throwback 2 years ago - I had some other friends, I tried telling them that they need to focus and study, and it ended up with them laughing in my face, then they started smoking weed and gang crime stuff 

I’ve tried telling my current friends and they say they’ll just wing it, or who cares. 
It irritates me, because some of them are really smart, but don’t do anything, so fail most of their classes.

They didn't look normal tho? They looked like blue silhouettes. They just kept shouting all of these things at me. So I understandably started crying and ran. I ran as fast as I could until I reached a wall a smooth black wall. Suddenly the wall turned to dirt and in the middle of the wall stood a coffin. Once the coffin opened up I could see my friends dead body. It was decayed and gross. It lunged out at me and it wouldn't let go no matter how much I begged. After nights of this I decided running shorter distances so that I couldn't reach the wall but it always managed to find me. And last night I decided to stay in the circle of people.

now (i’m currently in high school) i sometimes feel the same horrible textures and in some very stressful situations i feel the overwhelming feelings from the episodes again, and it’s horrible. i usually need to chew on ice or eat something cold to get the texture out. is this something i would need to talk to a doctor about? do you know what this is?",30May2020,1

396,"I’ve never written a single thing on here before and am not sure where to begin. I guess I just wish I could find someone who perhaps also experienced what I’m going through, or maybe just give me insight into how you’d deal with it?

The first thing I’d like to mention is that as an adult who has gone through a lot of life changes/seasons of life, I believe in the mantra that no matter how distant you become with the one person you consider your “best friend”, that you are still just as important to one another if you are truly best friends. That there may be times you grow apart, life end and flows, but that doesn’t change the place they hold in your heart (cheesy I know).

Painfully long story short...ish, I had a best friend who I met in high school, was college roommates with, and spent the next 6 or so years after college being inseparable with. She and I had ups and downs, times where we had distance between us, but as far as I saw it, she was family. I introduced her to my family 17 years ago and included her in every special moment in my life. She was in my wedding, the only non-blood related person at the hospital at my 1st daughters birth, dedication, etc. Any special moment in my life, she was invited and included. We went through A LOT. Pretty much every major event that happened in my life or hers was shared with one another. Birthdays, holidays, graduations, vacations, etc.

My younger and only sister and I have always had an up and down relationship. There were times we were extremely close and others we were not talking. At the end of the day she’s my sister, and to me, you’re always loyal to family no matter what. She went through several toxic dating relationships and during those times alienated herself from most other people. Despite her pushing me out of her life time and time again, I always forgave her and tried to help her move on when things would end. One of these times was when I brought her into my circle of friends and where her and my best friend met. They were cordial but it was evident that she was my little sister, and this other person was my best friend (for years after they first met).

The cycle of toxic relationships would go on and on with my sister. She currently is engaged now to be married. At the time her last relationship ended (her last ex before her now fiancé) I met my, now husband. I admit I was consumed with my new relationship and let my social life dwindle. We dated for a year, got engaged and then married 3 months later. One month after we were married I was unexpectedly and happily pregnant, and 8 months after my first child was born I was pregnant again with our second. I went through a lot of personal struggles, switched jobs, lost my job, struggled with PPD all while being newlywed parents of 2 under 2.

During this whirlwind of a time in my life my sister and best friend slowly but surely got closer and closer. In a time where I desperately needed them, I was slowly being pushed out. I wasn’t partying or smoking anymore. So I stopped being invited. They went on a trip to Mexico for my best friends birthday together just the two of them, and I wasn’t invited. It was assumed I was too busy and too broke. It crushed me but little did I know it was the first of many times I was being replaced by both of them-with one another. 

There was even a time that I reached out to both of them struggling with deep sadness and loneliness and their response was to “find a counselor” when all
I really wanted was them to come spend time with me. 

Fast forward to my sisters engagement (she was my maid of honor), which has lasted for the last two years. My best friend has been included as a bridesmaid in my sister’s wedding as well, and I am her maid of honor. 

During year two of my sister’s engagement my best friend also got engaged. Her family did not support it. It was not public knowledge and despite how hurt and left out I felt over the last few years, my heart broke for her. I bought champagne and congratulated her and cried with her.

Fast forward a few more months and I find out on Instagram that my best friend had asked all her bridesmaids to “help her tie the knot”. I hadn’t heard a word. I reached out to my sister and was informed that my sister was asked to be her maid of honor and that when she was asked (my sister) informed her (the best friend) that her decision to exclude me from her wedding party would hurt me deeply. The response from the best friend was that “she had her mind made up” and that I could not afford to be in her wedding so that’s why she didn’t ask me (meanwhile my sister was getting married a month prior to her and was paying for her entire wedding herself). 

Now, I was devastated. I had been excluded by the one person on the planet (besides my sister) who I thought would always view me as an important person in her life. That she would understand I had gone through so much in my life recently and that that didn’t change all we had been through, all
I had done for her over the last 17 years, that despite the distance in our relationship I still honored her (and only her) as if she was family in my most precious life moments. 

Not only was I excluded, but my sister was the one who had been asked to not only be a bridesmaid but the maid of honor. Someone who 3 years prior was in a toxic relationship and not speaking to anyone. There was no conversation with me explaining anything. 

So it took me a while, but I accepted this what felt lien an “ultimate exclusion” by my best friend as a blessing in disguise. I clearly had misinterpreted our friendship over all these years and worked on accepting that this relationship was not one I any longer needed to invest my (now broken) heart into. 

The thing I could not accept, still cannot accept, is the betrayal I feel from my sister. She happily accepted the role in the wedding full well knowing the affect it would have on me (I feel I should mention currently I legitimately have zero other friends and nobody I’ve ever been closer to than this now ex-best friend and my sister knows this). On top of this my sister bluntly made it very clear that she would not allow the actions of this friend towards me to affect her relationship with her in anyway. 

Now I am forced to plan wedding festivities with this person for my sister.

I had decided to say nothing to this best friend on my behalf and act civil with this person for the sake of my sisters wedding; table any conflict and conversation until after my sisters wedding. To be the bigger person and swallow all the hurt and betrayal I felt and carry on as polite as possible (feeling like a doormat).

Well my sister recently informed me that she does not want a bachelorette party and that the rest of her bridesmaids can celebrate separately with her (they are all from the same group of friends) and my mom and I can do something else separately with her...aka they’re throwing her a party, and I’m the sister and maid of honor and am the only one not invited; the explanation is because having us together would be too uncomfortable for her (my sister). She then informed me the same thing will happen in the future, if she has a baby shower it will be separate, my mom and I can throw her one and her new family and friends can throw her a different one.

Neither wedding has happened yet. It’s been an eternity of waiting to just suck it up, be nice, and get through it. 

To be clear, I have not said one mean thing to this best friend person, gotten in any type of altercation with her, and have basically pretended nothing has happened, have promised that I’d be civil and just wanted to participate and am still being excluded. 

It is my understanding that beyond the BS excuse of me being, again “too broke to be included” (I’d get a new credit card if I had to to be able to there for those I care about, it’s just money, also, I’m not that broke), the reasoning is because our friendship drifted apart that this is the justification to exclude me in this way, however there is not any other thing that I have “done” to receive this treatment. 

Here’s where the advice part comes in, despite that this best friend has been tearing my family apart (my dad sided with my sister, my mom sided with me), my sister clearly has chosen her over me while saying she hasn’t done so. What do I do? Do I try to have a relationship with my sister (one that’s beyond being civil with my toxic ex best friend is not an option in my mind for my own mental health)? Do I allow my sister to continue to be a part of special things in my life when she will be willingly excluding me from hers in order to not make anyone (aka her and her now best friend) uncomfortable? Including my own hypothetical future niece or nephews baby shower, birthdays, etc. I told her I could be civil, I could enjoy the special events like a baby shower for her, make it all about her and not about anything else, so we could all be together for that. My sister declined. 

So not only did I realize how little I meant to who I thought was my best friend, but now I feel like I’m losing my sister and all the special moments I should get to have with her. What would you do? How would you cope? Has anyone ever gone through anything like this that could shed some light on how you got through it? 

I should also clarify that I could have understood more (but still have been super hurt) about being excluded from this friends bridal party if she had perhaps given any thought to my feelings; perhaps even just having a conversation with me prior to asking my sister to be her maid of honor? That when my sister responded telling her how hurt I’d be that perhaps my sister would have at least come to me and told me. That it wasn’t some big secret I found out about via social media? 

I just don’t want anyone to think that I feel entitled to anything I guess 🤷‍♀️. I just feel that they both knew how badly it was going to hurt me but did nothing, not even have a simple conversation with me.

At the end of the day, I just want to do the right thing but also not be a door mat. What do you think that is?

There’s SO much more to this story but I’m already embarrassed with how long this post is. 

Please, please be kind in your responses. I truly don’t need anymore heartache. Thanks in advance for your advice!",30May2020,1

400,"I have this friend who is very active about racism and stuff like that, I’ll call them Z. A while back Z posted on their spam instagram account about how they were hanging with some friends and how fun it was and at the end Z mentioned how their friends said the n word in a song (btw Z and their friends are not white but are not black either). The way Z worded that sentence was like in a way that was suppose to be funny if that makes sense? Which it wasn’t, and it really upset my black friends when they saw that, but no one called Z out for it because Z is usually very “woke” about things like that. Fast forwarding to a few days ago, Z posted on their private story how they were annoyed how others would post about George Floyd, but then go and hang out with their white friends who are racist and say the n word. Z stated that “those people are just contradicting themselves”. But Z is doing the exact same thing, by still hanging out with those friends who have said the n word as a “joke” but still being anti-racism. 
Basically, I want to message Z anonymously and show them Z’s video and Z’s post, and how they’re contradicting themselves. This isn’t the first time that Z has done something like this either, which is why I’m frustrated about it. But I’ve never really confronted someone like this, and I’m really nervous that I’m in the wrong and it shouldn’t be my business to call them out.

401,"I'm so exhausted because I've already written this post, but somehow it never went through and got deleted. I'm too frazzled to write eloquently right now, so this is just gonna be an information dump of everything I need help with. It's about my mother. 

A few days ago, my teacher wrote me a note basically wishing me well, reminding me to stay healthy, and saying ""blessing to your family,"" (he's a theology teacher.) Most people would identify this as a 'happy summer' type-deal, but it's the event which triggered the nightmare I'm living this week. 

My mom took me and herself in the car and said the following: 

\- ""why would we need 'blessings'""

\- ""has Dad always been 'good' to you"" (my father isn't abusive and nobody would ever think that.)

\- ""did you tell something to the school that you should've told me?""

\- ""you're all hiding the fact that my brother has corona virus"" (he doesn't, she pulled that out of thin air.)

\- ""are your brothers 'okay'"" (??)

""are you filming me? oh, it's your dad who makes me paranoid"" (like an hour later they went swimming together.) 

So obviously, she was completely paranoid about it. Now's as good a time as any to mention that her sister was schizophrenic, but her parents were not. She has no KNOWN psych issues.

Today, she got taken to the hospital. 

After returning home, I was shocked to hear that she got screened for cancer?? Nobody mentioned that before. And, no, she tested negative- but why cancer?? I was so positive it was a psych evaluation. It needs to be a psych evaluation. 

She screamed just a few minutes ago. 

Here's a list of things she's done in the past:

\- Screamed randomly

\- Varied from being extremely threatening/condescending to my father

\- (A) Stripped from her clothes and poured food on herself (??) (I wasn't there for all of it, I only saw the end results)

\- (B) Walked around the front yard like that, after smashing plates and screaming 

\- Banged on my door, only to walk away before I can open it so that I have to go find her. When I do, she acts almost like it didn't happen, or just says that she wanted to ""check-up on me."" She acts like I just slapped her in the face if I express any kind of confused expression over this.

\- Made threats about killing herself to her kids as a method of trying to get us to behave.

Right now, she's downstairs talking to herself. She has a bunch of candles lit and she brought a thing of kerosine (I think) from the garage. I know that sounds crazy, but why do you think I'm writing this now?? I don't know if we're safe anymore. Granted, she did light a fire, so it could've been for that, but I don't even know if our fireplace needs that stuff. I'm too scared to remember. 

I don't even know why I'm doing this. I wanna hear what people think is wrong with her, but really, I wanna hear that people think that there IS SOMETHING wrong with her, because nobody else in our family seems to understand. She shields my brothers from her behavior, but she doesn't bother with me- I think because we both know our relationship is already damaged unsalvageabley. 

Anyways, I'll answer any questions if anyone sees this since this post was a bit unintelligible. Please help.",30May2020,1

I didn’t want to I kept saying no but obvs it was too playful or not enough I don’t know how to feel about it cos I know I’m just gonna overthink everything, worry about him telling people and what not I also feel very emotionally disconnected from sex

414,"So setting aside my self confidence issues for a sec, my friend and I talk alot and are pretty close. We sext eachother as of late somewhat regularly, maybe once or twice a week we'll mess around on the phone. While she had been with many people since 13 and probably had more sex than any adult I know irl, I'm a virgin (fuck - havent even kissed anyone) and she is well aware. A couple times she's said I could have sex with her, if I was ""good"" and tied her up good, etc. She has never wanted a romantic relationship with me, but would possibly be open to a one (or more idk) time session of fun. So do I, a person without an 8"" dick or experience take the inevitable chance of disappointing her? I've always imagined I'd be in more of a relationship when this happened, not with a friend. Now ask 12 year old me this question and it would be obvious lol, but grown me is thinking a little different. Its hard to pass up however as this friend is really the first girl I've majorly talked to. For me, it seems like self confidence about my body is the biggest issue, idk.

I’m posting here to try and get some peace of mind. We found out today she is definitely pregnant. She took three of the 2 line tests yesterday and a digital one today. The three line tests yesterday were faint positives though. I’ve read that this is because she’s not that far along. That’s what I’m hoping is the case. She was raped April 21st and then the next morning took a morning after pill and 5 or so birth control pills. she was taking tests all week until she started her period on either the 30th or the 1st of May (which was 18 days late). But it only lasted three days. We’ve had sex at least twice a week all month, probably more most of the time. She wasn’t taking her birth control the whole time. I know the obvious advice here is go to the doctors. But I’m just looking for any advice on how to ease my mind that this is in fact my child.

417,"All right so without going into too much detail, I tried to help my closest friend out of his depression and I failed. It was really traumatic because I was there when he ended it. I haven't been the same since but I've taken a lot of steps to be better. At first when it happened I just went on a binge and ignored life. Later on I went and got myself help did 30 days clean, and now I'm just trying to get back to life but I have some underlying issues that I need help with.

I realize everyone is doing pretty bad during the pandemic, but my whole life revolved around touring and having crowds, obviously that's gone. I started a business with someone who is in the same position as me and all that they can do is bring up how they need more from me. I try to explain that I'm not doing very well and I understand their frustrations but I can only do so much right now. 

They'll say things like do what you need to do, take care of your mental health. And then when I'm on top of things and do 40 hours of work in 3 days they just bring up how I missed the boat a month ago when I lost days to depression. It makes it really hard to be motivated to do anything. Today I have severed my relationship with that person. So I'm once again feeling like I have no purpose, no way to make money, and nothing to really do to set my mind off of it.

I don't know how to mend my relationship with that person, I feel like what they did was pretty condescending. Even if I say hey I understand and work hard, I don't think they'll ever let it go. I've done an insane amount of work on our project and it doesn't get recognized The only thing that gets recognized is when I fall apart.

When they bring up how bad I've been it just sets me off and then I just lay down and stare at a ceiling for days.

I feel so lost. Any advice appreciated",30May2020,1
418,"Im new at this. This is my first advice post and I usually see people posting lots of passages but im just going straight to the point. 

To start off, Im 18 years old. I just graduated and my friend is an online friend on ps4 and hes 15 years old. I dont know him in person and we live in completely different states but we are best of friends, we know what each other look like through video calls and all that, known him for a few years now. 

A new game just came out and us and a group of friends could all play it together but my friends parents are really strict on him and I cant stress that enough so he doesnt have any access to money. I decided ill buy the game for him. Its only 20 bucks so I sent him a psn card code through the normal phone messages. He put the code in and bought the game but his account is linked to his parents email and now theyre on to him or was. 

They questioned him asking who sent you the money, this and that and saying there are rapists on the internet which i understand but ill get to that. His parents have access to his phone and found out my phone number and my entire full name. 

I didnt know how they found until i searched my own number online and found a website called SearchPeopleFree.com. Literally just by my number I found all the information based off of my dad because his number is linked to mine and im a junior dont know why i mentioned that. Felt necessary. 

But on this website it tells where I live, where my parents used to live YEARS ago, where we work, A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE NAME OF MY RELATIVES. Phone numbers of the people in my household and the location of where we work. Basically anything to contact and find us. Idk why this website even exists. 

Honestly feel like this was made for stalkers or something. But im not really worried about that part just the fact that his parents my call my parents phone numbers now and get them involved into this which i do not want. How should i solve this?",30May2020,1

420,"I'm 27 and my sister is 25, and we disagree on a lot. I'm gonna try not to be biased here. She goes out of her way to tell me anything I ever do that's wrong in her eyes. (I always ask her to stop because it seems like she's mothering me) She's an intense person who zeroes in on whoever she's arguing with and throws out things that will deeply hurt them (name calling, bringing up irrelevant things from years ago they did wrong, speaking in a condescending/patronizing way). I am a super laid back person but when we argue I have bad tendencies. I can tell she's itching for a fight sometimes and I know I should drop it and walk away, but something she said or her tone will get under my skin and I'll feel like I have to combat her accusation and defend myself, even if I see its toxic or ridiculous. 

In our arguments, when accused of something bad, I cannot for the life of me think of ways to stick up for myself, good points to make in my favor, or anything to shut her up. Its like I get stunned silence and then she feels like she's right. I even apologize for things I know I didn't do, or things I'm not even sorry for, just to make her stop coming at me, and even that doesn't work every time. Then hours or days later I'll be like, shit I should have said that, or I'll remember something that proves her wrong but it's too late.

We have a mutual best friend who's a lawyer, she's seen us fight and says I should try to match her passion/anger because she uses big dramatic words, but I just don't have it in me! I can't make myself  care as much as her. I wanna stick up for myself in a productive way, instead of getting bulldozed and apologizing, because I always end up feeling so defeated afterwards.

I hope I'm not being too vague, I typed out a whole specific argument we had and it was the longest post ever so I wanted to try to sum it up in as few words as possible. She accuses me of being selfish and immature alot, that's a common one. I know I can be sometimes but not nearly as much as she says. I go to my parents for advice and they say she just really mean and that's how she's always gonna be. They are also scared to stick up to her. I don't wanna accept that as an excuse though, I don't wanna be scared to stick up to my little sister.    

So I guess what I'm asking is- do I try to get better at arguing? And how do I even go about doing that. Or- how I take the names she calls me/accusations she makes and let it roll off my shoulder without it turning into a full blown fight? Her and I live on different continents now and I fear its only gonna get worse as the years go on. Thanks if you took the time to read this.",30May2020,1

Hello to everybody,

First of all I'm not a native speaker, I’m doing my best here but please be patience.

Background: since I know myself it is very easy for me to get injured. Most of them not in my bones because I’m thick but my muscles and tendons is a whole different story. Thats include pain in wrist, elbows and ankles on and off. Also a few years ago I fell on my hands while playing soccer and damaged both my shoulders pretty bad. My right shoulder cartilage is torn (MRI) and probably to some extent in my left as well, as I fell the same pain on both. With Physiotherapy I managed to go back to the gym and most of the time the pain was gone.

Two weeks ago I started to play basketball while I regularly keep going to the gym 3 times a week. Until I played basketball everything went fine but the day after the last time both my shoulder started to ache (different from the one from my injury). The same day I went to the gym (stupid) and did bench press with really bad form (stupid X2) which made me quit in the second set because of my elbows started hurt. The day after my workout my shoulder hurt even more and the elbow as well.

Right now I’m a week since the incident without any kind of training beside rotator cuff physiotherapy. The shoulder pain decreased but is still there and the elbow pain is gone.

I would like to hear tips from you guys about what should I do. Should I get back to the gym? And what cany what can I do to get rid to my tendency to inflammation.

Thank you for your time.",30May2020,1

He says that once I show his friend I am not scared anymore he will stop and it’s up to me.

She has a very abusive family, her mom beats and belittles everyday.

And her little sister was manipulated into only trusting her mom because her mom is manipulative. And it's been like this her entire life, and now that she's stuck inside with her family because of quarantine it's gotten a lot worse.

Even when her mom kicks her out she'll search the streets and go to all of her friends house to find and drag her back to their home again. And i've always tried to stay positive but she just kind of broke recently. And tbh yeah her situation is pretty damn hopeless. Until she can graduate highschool and be on her own she's stuck being abused mentally and physically for the next two years.

Ok so I don’t know if this is the right place to post it because I’m just so confused and unsure of the current situation. 
So last night my boyfriend woke me up to tell me he “just felt like was gonna die. Twice.” He apparently sat on the couch cause he couldn’t sleep and suddenly his heart rate jumped up rapidly, he felt nauseous and “his head felt really weird”, like his thoughts were in a Maze and just moving rapidly. He couldn’t really describe the feeling just that his head felt so out of place. He also at the same time had a deja vu but that might not be connected to this thing. He had that phenomenon twice apparently before waking me up. He was scared and thats really rare that he’s scared of anything. He says it kinda felt like a panic attack but really different as he knows how panic attacks and also really heavy ones feel like for him. He said he really thought he was gonna die.

After waking me up he ate something and then told me to come with him to the bathroom cause he felt so nauseous again and he actually threw up this time. 
And the last thing is he again had a random deja vu a few minutes later. 

So yeah idk. He’s asleep right now but I’m really worried about him as that’s really out of character for him.

442,"Hi guys, I hope you’re doing well during this time. 

My current apartment has been going under construction and renovation since November, and now because of the pandemic, the constant noise and disturbance are driving me crazy. Last week they started coming into my apartment to replace the windows, and they covered all of them in plastics. Now I don’t get to see the outside, and I don’t really get ventilation anymore. 

This is making me really want to break my lease and move out, my lease ends this November. I will need to pay a fee to break my lease, but it still seems cheaper than staying here until my lease ends, because I’m paying way too much for this hell hole.

Here’s the dilemma: it’s hard for me to find an apartment right now because I’m a full time student who graduates in June, I’m not currently employed so it’s really hard to apply for apartments because I don’t have legit proof of income.

So which solution should I go for?

Solution 1 is to stay at my current apartment, pay way too much rent and tolerate the construction. Try and find a job before my lease ends in November so I can apply for the next apartment and move out then.

Solution 2 is to break the lease right now, pay bunch of fees, do a lot of apartment hunting, and risk getting rejected because I don’t have income. (Also my parents aren’t in the US so they can’t co-sign for me)

Long story short - I am working from home since March due to Covid and only working on my lap top (I have no extra monitor at home, although I have one @ the office). Yesterday one of my male colleagues told me that female coworker literally came to the office, took my monitor from my desk, took it home and left the office (although he told her to take some other monitor). He told me that on an online meeting in front of 7 other male coworkers and it really pissed me off, her actions and the whole situation. This is not the first time she's taking my stuff, a couple of months ago she took my working laptop charger and replaced with faulylty one that was hers (I tried not to react and did nothing about it).
Ofcourse, she did not call me, ask me, or tell me anything about taking monitor from my desk. I never thought of taking stuff frome the office and bringing it home, so I am a bit shocked.

I would really appreciate any advice on this. Should I tell her something? I am afraid I will make a scene due to the fact this made me very angry. And this is work. I really don't want to show any anger in the workplace.

And I know I need to feel my sleep schedule before I got head first into a part-time job. &lt;(´^`)&gt;",30May2020,1
449,"She sent this message not long after my wife and daughter asked why she deleted us on fb...
My niece:

I just thought I'd let you know that the reason I deleted you guys is because I felt disrespected. I don't know why you always have to argue with my grandma. We don't believe the same way. Can you just accept that and be respectful about it? Because she doesn't feel accepted. I also don't know why you think it's okay to tell her how to parent me, and why you called her a few months ago telling her that I shouldn't be posting what I'm posting on facebook. What do I post? A bunch of dog videos and sometimes my opinions on issues I care about. I'm legally an adult and I have been for a year. Let's see, I'm expected to have certain ""adult"" responsibilities, yet you're getting my grandma worked up about how ""I shouldn't be staying up late"" and I'm ""posting things that aren't true"". That's really what you're complaining about? You got mom all upset over nothing. Have you not seen what other peoples' kids do? I was in the top 20 of my class, I don't smoke, I don't drink, etc. Have you seen the bullshit that Emma posts on her facebook? Do you complain to Stacy about what she posts? I understand that you care in your own way, but you have to accept that kids grow up at some point.""

Me: Hello. Nice to hear from you. I talk to my mom 4 times a year and as an almost 60-year-old man I will say whatever I want to her. I come to Indiana all the time but no one ever comes to see me. Do you think this feels like acceptance? The travel is exhausting. We have to take time off from our jobs, hire people to take of our property and animals. As to politics, people shouldn't talk about if they can't be civil. I NEVER bring it up. I get called a baby killer. I turn the other cheek. One thing I have learned is the best way to keep a friend is to not talk politics. In my business I work with all kinds of people and I accept people of all different beliefs. Now I have to sign off and drive 500 miles to make some money because that's what adults do. Got a job yet?

Niece: You can say whatever you want to her, but you can also consider respecting our ""christian crap"" since you supposedly accept everyone. Oh and by the way, I'm in COLLEGE, which is something you didn't do. So before you accuse me of not being an adult, please consider that the biggest job I can get as a college freshman is to work in a library/become a theatre usher/work with fast food. I don't have time to have a full time job or drive 500 miles. What I do is not exactly a walk in the park. And if you're going to expect me to have adult responsibilities, you can at least allow me to have a say, give my opinions, and post what I want on my OWN FACEBOOK. Also, I go to a university with 40,000 and most of my friends do not agree with me politically. 

My wife: This is Marie helping Rob with his Facebook. I could not read this whole message aloud. What an ugly, awful response. You owe that man an apology. You have NO idea how smart and successful he is and that is all to do with his work ethic. Get a job.",30May2020,1
450,So my now ex boyfriend who I’ve been dating for 1 year and 9 months dumped me. We’ve had struggles in the relationship and he’s had commitment issues but I’ve always forgiven him even if it hurt and tore my self image down. The last month of us dating has been hard I’ve recently been kicked out of my home and I’ve been moving from place to place.. he’s been there to support me however he could and I really did appreciate it. I last saw him nearly 2 weeks ago and the last time i did see him everything seemed fine other then the occasional yelling from his father over my ex boyfriend being slack. We kissed and cuddles and I left.. 2 days later he dumped me over text stating that he couldn’t function in a relationship and that he’s sorry or that he needs to get his life together before dating anyone. He also told me to move on and forget about him and how he’s sorry he “ruined my life”. He still expected me to be friends to me after this and his belongings are still at my house.. I’m still trying to process what’s happened I feel like I don’t have anyone. As I’m not at all close to my family and I don’t have many close friends whom I’ve shared that connection with. My now ex seems to be happier without me. He’s going to parties and drinking it hurts to know that he just doesn’t care about me. And the worse thing is that I did try to commit suicide over this incident I know it’s not healthy and I’m actually getting help which is what I should have done a long time ago. I just need some advice.. do you think he cares at all? Or is he heartless?,30May2020,1
451,"My family is toxic it’s hard to even visit my families home. (My family lives three hours from where I live) There are many teens and complex relationships in my family home. I’m Visiting and some huge arguments between them happened. My major is psychology and I liked to read on all the time in my spare time.  I sat with my family one by one, listened and gave advice. Not in  a way a family member would  but in a way a counselor that didn’t know you would. I’ve just been analyzing them and then once a huge fight broke out I jumped at the opportunity to share my knowledge. I’m like a snake and prey on them and feel like fucking shit once it’s all said and done. I have everyone’s faces in my head when I’m deep diving into the psych and what can help them rather then validating their issues. They’re were some terrible things said, teenagers almost kicked out, small children crying very scared. This was all surrounding the fact that certain family members aren’t washing dishes when it’s their turn and what not. Why couldn’t I have just listened and talked about the dishes? Why am I so weird? I isolate, go to school and read while everyone in my families home are not just fighting but laughing, conversation, and being social. Im so awkward. No ones asked for counseling.

I want to tell her exactly how I feel before she leaves but don’t know how or if I even should.

455,"hello, im 17F. I need advice on what to do about my mental health. I'm going to write basically a summary of my back story and what I have been dealing with but I will also try to write a TLDR at the end because I really don't want to bother you all or bore u with details I can't tell are important or not. Also, I sort just need to get this out. I really really need advice with this because im sort at my wit's end and I don't really know how to keep going without exploding haha. Anyway, let me begin.



My parents are great in comparison to other parents. I'm also quite blessed. My parents have made sure that my sibling and I have food, a roof over our heads, and have tried to protect us from things they consider dangerous. I am grateful for their efforts and love. Now that I am older, I recognize on some level that they are human and make mistakes and are definitely not perfect, but yet I remain greatly impacted by their faults and I am unable to be ""normal'.

Since even when I was young, I cannot recall ever feeling 100% happy. I have never loved myself or my body. I have always disliked myself and my personality. Growing up, my sibling and I were homeschooled by our grandmother, possibly due to the fact that my parents couldn't afford an education for us and they wanted to protect us from the horrors that occur in public school. For me personally, I have always compared myself to others because I have always felt inadequate, as "" other"", and as inferior. I wanted to be normal and go to school. To have friends. To be likable. When my niece and nephew would visit, they would make fun of me and my sibling for being homeschooled. My sibling turned out fine and he is naturally charismatic and can make friends instantly. My parents treat them and have treated them better than me in some ways (at least that is how it has always felt). Like, for example, if my parent calls me but I have headphones on and can't hear them, they will get angry and say I ignored them. If my brother is in his room blasting videos on his headphones and he doesn't hear them, they just go get him from his room and nothing bad happens. My dad treats his other daughters better than me too. Those are my half-siblings. I won't go into further detail because that is just extra info. 

When my grandmother would comment on how big my legs are, I would feel so sad. Once when I was little, I told my mom when we were snuggling and she got upset at me. I told her I felt sad when she said those comments to me and I felt she was making fun of me and my mom got mad and said I am making that up and that my grandmother meant it as a compliment. That dismissiveness was matched by both parents but mainly my mom for.my whole life when it came/comes to my feelings about anything.


By about twelve or thirteen, I started selfharming. In retrospect, I was doing it to get my parents attention so they would see that, no I am not making these feelings up please acknowledge me. That did not happen. When they found out in ninth grade that night, my mom left the house and my dad told me about how she could get n a car accident because the tears in her eyes. They did find out at the wrong time but if you knew the details of the situation, you would understand I had no choice. If you want more details on that, I will provide. 


Anyway, tenth-grade year I may have attempted suicide. I had a seizure and no one knows that about this incident. I still self-harm and have turned to burn. I also go through periods of eating very little/unhealthy ways to lose weight because I hate my body. My depression has never been worse.


Some nights, my had is so loud with intrusive thoughts and self-hatred I have to beg myself and pray that God saves me from killing myself because deep down, I think I know there's a high probability that's how I will go. My parents look down on therapy and especially medication. Once when I was like 12 or 13 I asked my mom if I could go on anxiety medication because my anxiety was so bad and she got so mad at me. She said I would be ""signing myself out of life as white people do"". My culture does have a stigma against the medical community (rightfully so) but it still hurt. My mom thinks I make all of my issues up because I got it from the internet. She thinks I do this because I am bored.


I also have a reputation to keep up. I am top 5% in my school and state etc so people expect great things from me. I wanted to wait until I was 18 to get therapy but with COVID, Idk if I will. I wanted a face to face session to stand up to my social anxiety but now I just feel more let down. Also, I just can't stand the thought of my family knowing I am "" getting help"". They will never look at me the same. What hurts more is that I am less than the people n my family. Like, my dad is so compassionate with my half-sister who is 27, living w her mom, and having all sorts of mental issues but with me, I get nothing. I told both parents I thought about suicide the year before ninth grade and they didn't care but my dad comforts my sister the multiple she calls him AT WORk about how she wants to die. 


Anyway, I digress. 



TLDR Growing up I have always hated myself. My parents, particularly my mother, are very dismissive towards emotion. This has caused me to resort to hurting myself and such. They really look down on medication and therapy, especially for me because I ""haven't been through anything"".  



Note: its not that my parents are strictly not allowing me access to therapy. One, it is expensive. We have insurance but I don't want to bother them. Two, they would be very vocally against it / judgemental in my opinion. My parents sat me down separately to tell me that "" sweetie you need help"" and it never happened. I never went. Looking back, I don't know why. Never got a follow up. Also, with covid, I would have to do video chats which are scary for me. And people in the house would hear me talking.



Question: I need advice on how to cope or get help until I have access to therapy. I am not 18 yet so my parents have to approve anything I do by law with therapy, so they'd find out. And in stuck at home. Online ""free"" therapy like 7cups and such just isn't working anymore because my issues are very deep and I feel like im at my breaking point. 


Or does anyone know of options for free therapy for minors or 18 years olds??? Anything will do, even just general advice on how to think about my situation differently. I apologize for the long post and I am so thankful that you have taken the time out of your day to read this. 


Extra: let me just say that I love my family. I understand why my parents think the way they do. They are from a. different generation, one where people of color not only were expected to suck everything up but where they were the ones experimented on. There's a lot of mistrust from their generation and now I am old enough to understand this, but it hurts all the same and quite deeply. At this, I hope you will understand them too. I don't think, or I would hope, that they aren't like this to hurt me. Everyone has unconscious favorites I guess and I am not one and I need to be ok with this. They are wonderful people and I just want it to be known that they deserve respect.",30May2020,1
456,"I have a Facebook account that I use to follow my family members. I am the youngest in my family. (I am Gen Z and my brothers are Millenials &amp; Gen X'ers). To bridge the generational gap between us, I made an account for the sole purpose of keeping up.

My family members are conservative. I'm not, I'm the obnoxious, political Democrat. But I do my best to understand their point of view and be respectful. A little while ago, there was some initial arguing, but we have learned to respect each other's space because the dialogue doesn't really go anywhere.

Now to the real drama

I went on FB and I posted about George Floyd's death. (Some background, I am white and I was adopted into a Hispanic household so my brothers are people of color) I posted a picture of him and expressed my sadness and frustration regarding the tragic police brutality. Why did it blow up? Well, one of my brothers is a police officer. His wife responded to my post and replied that my statements are often ""harsh"" and ""hurtful"" and that posts like this can cause ""debate."" She ended it with an ""I love you"" that honestly felt passive-aggressive.

I have no idea how this is controversial. A man died. How is that controversial?? And no, I didn't mention police brutality (which could have been triggering to her) or anything like that in my post. I kept it short and only said I couldn't believe what had happened and that it was heartbreaking.

It hurt that she commented publicly and it felt inappropriate. I'm a young adult but I believe that if you have an issue, privately reach out. Let me know that I hurt your feelings or if I stepped out of line FIRST before making a public statement. And, I would never do this to them. If I responded in a similar fashion, I would be told to fuck off.

How did I respond? I removed her from my friends list. While I was at it, I removed some other people that I was following as well (basically, ""do you spark joy? No?"" \*unfriend\*). That meant a few other people were unfollowed on FB as well, including another sister-in-law. Then, I removed ALL of my posts on FB and decided I will not post anything for awhile because I figured posting again would seem passive-aggressive towards her comment. 

One of my brothers texted me this morning (he is not married to either sister-in-law in question), and he is the final character in this family drama. We will call him M and call the initial sister-in-law who commented, SiL1 and the second sister-in-law (the one I happened to unfollow), SiL2.

All of this happened 2 days ago. This morning, I received a text from M, asking why I unfriended SiL1 &amp; SiL2. I reached out to both of them, received pushback from SiL1 who is hurt and got zero response from Sil2. After telling M that it was between me and SiL1 &amp;2, he ignored me and stopped responding.

459,"The quarantining and self isolation got me thinking about alot of things. One of them is my past school mates. 

I moved schools when i was 10 and was never able to reconnect with them because the internet wasnt as significant, back then, as it is now. Although, i was able to reach out to two of them. Both of them, Sarah and Justin (fake names), were my best friends but circumstances happened and we got distant. Or so i thought. Sarah stayed in touch with justin but they never made an effort to stay in touch. Didnt bother me then, so i took it upon myself to stay connected to them. Eventually i got busy with school. Its been a good decade or so since i last spoke to them. 

A few years ago though, i tried reconnecting with sarah. I never felt comfortable with her. She was always so fishy to me. Didnt mind it at that time. So anyway, we spoke for a while and she made me feel sooo inferior to her. Even though we were on the same grade, she made me feel like a loser. Like we were never friends, and i was being a creep. 

Months went by and i found out sarah was just using me to get close to merv. A close friend from my childhood. As soon as i moved schools, she came in and took my place in the friend group, and made she was i wasnt able to reconnect to them.


NOW, i want to reconnect with a Merv.  But sarah is the only one that probably knows how to reach him. I do not want to talk to her again, but its probably the only way i can reach merv.

My parents are extremely strict and I’ve been hiding the relationship.

I have almost a different entity with my parents. I have to side with their political views, any opinion they have etc. otherwise they get upset/angry. I don’t stand up to them ever. 

My mom logged onto my Instagram and found a selfie of us with my head in his shoulder and the caption is “the best ♥️.” She also looked at the comments which said things like “cute.” She also found his Instagram and saw pictures of me.

463,"This is kind of a tricky question for me emotionally so I'm gonna do my best to keep it brief.

I am currently a senior in high school in Canada, and my school career has been... unconventional to say the least. My school is grade 8-12 and in the 8th and 9th grade I'd say my life was pretty average; friends, studying, random casual dates that meant nothing. Grade 10 things got weird with my family and I was crazy depressed the whole year and fell off the map, but grade 11 is when it got bad. I have a severe history of concussions, like SEVERE severe. Current count is 16. Anyway in grade 11 I got a few that took me out of school for a combined 4 months which meant that even when I did actually get to attend school I was super heads down trying to get caught up and didn't really get to talk to anyone.

 Now in this my grade 12 year I was only 3 days into the school year when I was in a brutal sailing accident in September getting the worst concussion I've ever had. I haven't been to a day of school since and it's just generally very isolating, but one of the hardest parts is seeing what I'm missing. On the odd occurrences that I get to talk to my friends they're talking about parties, dating and everything else and I'm just missing all of it. So I ask, how much have I lost? Everyone talks about grade 11 and 12 as years full of parties and friendships, but I spent them in a doctor's office. 

I am planning on going to university eventually so hopefully I can have some of those lost experiences then, but for those of you who had both, what did your grade 11 and 12 years look like? I know this may sound like I don't actually want genuine responses about your happy memories but believe me I do, not knowing what I've lost just makes it worse.

TL;DR medically unable to attend most of grade 11 and all of grade 12, what did I miss socially?

467,"Short post, I just need help understanding. I’m 27m, and white but grew up with consistent horrible remarks and bullying as a result of my red hair. I live in an area that doesn’t take too kindly to redheads, as was the case for my dad and granddad.

I’ve starved, been excluded from potential jobs due to my race (told this later by acquaintances who worked there), not received government assistance when I needed it, and been slighted anywhere a person can be.

Hopefully unrelated (honestly have no idea), but I mean, I’ve had police on me my whole adult life. I’m pulled over about every 2 months for some trumped up charge. Almost never get a ticket, just harassed. I’ve had officers unholster their gun and start shouting at me just for following their directions.

Driving under the speed limit, suspicion due to wearing improper jogging attire while jogging, just being out after a certain hour leading to my car being searched by a K-9 unit. I have shown nothing but respect and had it thrown back in my face. 

I have worked along side police in the ER dealing with the worst kinds of scenarios, so I’m well aware that they aren’t all bad. The criminals who use the badge as a power trip should be put through the ringer for the rest of their days. 

I worry about posting this because of the usual, “you don’t know what it’s like” and “it’s different because you’re white.” It doesn’t feel different.

471,"Ive heard of reading, practise speaking and listening to native speakers speak, but how do they help? Ive been watching a show with decent amount of vocabulary in them, Ive also been reading books, I speak English to my friends, but i do not see any improvements in my English exam scores. The components of my English exam include
-Essay writing
-Letter writing
-Reading comprehension( gives you a passage and asks stuff like ""explain why john is 'blablabla'"" and 'summarise paragraph 3-5 in 80 words)
-Listening comprehension( Tells you information, asks you to answer questions)
-Oral examination(i feel that this is just rating your conversation content really, not much on grammar or skills)
I have to ask, do i really need to find out and memorise the meaning of every word i come across on a book in order to improve on my examination scores? Wouldnt that be quite tiring and disturb the flow of my reading, which then interrupts my understanding of that chunk of passage?

I have no trouble conversing in English but i just cant seem to achieve those high marks for my tests, especially for reading comprehension.

People say reading more books will improve comprehension skills and understanding of passages, but what if i couldnt comprehend most of the books i read? Doesnt that mean that i'd just be wasting my time reading, and when the exam throws me with a passage i dont understand, i  wouldnt understand it too?
Any advice? 

Im just doubting that reading books is helpful, because if you dont understand the words and couldnt infer clearly what a certain paragraph in the book meant, then isnt that just reading 100 pages of jibberish which you cant understand?

Or... you can assure me by saying stuff like  'Yes, if you finish reading for a certain period of time youll find that naturally, your english exam results will improve""

Any guides/tips/advice? I need to improve on my english exam scores badly.

475,"Hi there - I appreciate any help on this matter! 

My friend (lets call him N) has voiced his concern over my other friend (E) and me (T) not inviting him to hangouts.

 In the early days of him mentioning this, we had explained that sometimes we just wanted to hang us two alone for girl time or whatever - nothing malicious nor trying to hurt him at all. In fact, we still hung out with him a lot and I even hung out with him alone without E getting upset over that too. 

Now, we are a lot more diligent in inviting him to hangouts. It does feel a bit controlling, but we also do enjoy being around him, so it wasn't an issue. 

However, today I messaged E and asked her if she is free to hang and then told her to ask N. She messaged him asking if he is free, but he didnt reply for hours. Admittedly, we could have given more information during that initial message rather than just asking if he was free. He ended up replying right when I was about to leave, but he said it was too short notice since he was given no details nor did I ask to pick him up earlier. 

We apologized for that and during mine and E's hangout, we started planning to go to a music store. I was leaving to go home, so E said we would text him when I arrived at my house and see when he is free since that would give more notice and details to the plan.

N said he felt that he wasn't included in that new plan's process and is doubting my explanation. 

I really don't know what to do anymore. Please help! Is there a way we can help him see through our perspective or help him be more secure with himself to lessen his doubt within us? Or are we in the wrong?

Thank you!

477,"TL;DR at the end :)

My friend ""Jane"" and I (both 17F) are in high school, and Jane has gotten a tattoo. It's super cool and I'm really happy for her, especially considering it's her first tattoo!

However, now that she's had her first tattoo she really wants to get some more, which is cool, I'm super glad she loves her first one so much. I'm a bit nervous for her considering she's so young and once you get a tattoo it's there forever, but again, it's entirely up to her with what she wants to do and I'm sure she's making well thought out decisions :)

Here's where it gets a little bit odd. I'm not in any of Jane's classes in school, we never hang out outside of school, and she only occasionally hangs out with me and my friends at lunchtimes. I know it sounds rude but if I'm completely honest, I feel like she's more of an acquaintance to me than a close friend.

She messaged me earlier and I haven't clicked on the message yet because I don't want to look like I'm ghosting her, but I'm not sure what to say in response. Essentially she's said that she wants to get some tattoos to represent some of her friends, and asked me if I had any ideas surrounding what she should get to represent me.

I don't want to sound rude but I feel like I'd be doing her a massive disservice to encourage her to get this tattoo. She's really lovely but we don't talk much and I feel like I haven't had any effect on her whatsoever. It just feels weird to me having something representing me forever tattooed on her body when we aren't close.

I'm not sure how I should tell her I don't think it's the greatest idea without sounding rude. It's honestly super flattering that she'd like to get this tattoo and I hope I don't sound like I'm dismissing that, it's incredibly nice of her to ask. But again, although she's really nice we don't talk much, and I don't want to sound like I'm forcing a decision onto her because she can do what she wants with her body, but we're both leaving school at the end of the year and it's possible I won't ever see her again. I just feel bad that she feels this way and I don't.

TL;DR- My classmate ""Jane"" recently got her first tattoo and wants more. She asked me what tattoo she could get to represent me, however we never see each other outside of school, don't share any classes, and she only sits with me and my friends every now and then at lunchtimes. We don't talk much and I'm not sure her getting this tattoo is a good idea, but I don't know how to tell her without sounding rude.",30May2020,1

487,"For context: I’m a 19 yr old girl, my brother is 16. Our dad doesn’t live with us currently due to the nature of his job.

My brother has always been a difficult child. Ever since I can remember, he’s been causing trouble in terms of general behaviour and academics. My mom is a GREAT mom, but she’s too nice. From my perspective, he’s always been good at manipulating people. But my mom always says its a “phase” or “learn to ignore it” or “why do you even interact with him?”. Despite her excuses, she does become overwhelmingly frustrated with his behaviour from time to time and she’ll always vent about it to me. 
Coming back to my brother, he’s always been very greedy. Every 6 months he wants some big item because he’s saved up money. But the thing he wants usually costs 40-50% higher than what he’s saved. What happens? My mom ends up “loaning” the money to him. During the period where he’s deciding exactly what he wants (usually 1-2 weeks) he’ll be EXTRA nice with my mom, talk to her about why he absolutely NEED to buy xyz item etc. Once he actually buys it, he’ll instantly become an asshole. I know this sounds weird, but this is EXACTLY WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS. He’ll start being rude to me, to my mom, lock himself up in his room for days learning how to use whatever he bought. When he will occasionally come out of his room, it’ll usually be to demand food or ask my mom to get another “small” item to accompany his larger purchase. Some things he’s bought over the past few years: a laptop, a mobile phone, multiple gaming monitors, a PS4 and just recently this steering wheel remote thingy. 
Every time this cycle happens, I ask my mom why the fuck she helped him out KNOWING he’ll behave like an asshole. And every time her FRUSTRATED reply is “What do you want me to do about it now?”
This is just ONE example of how fucked up he is as a human being. He constantly hits me (and not in a playful sibling way, I mean I get bruised most of the time), verbally abuses me in the most disgusting ways, holds my secrets over me etc. 
He also doesn’t bother with his studies AT ALL. We’ve had him checked for learning disabilities, mental health issues etc but nothing has come up. And its not like he’s good at anything else either. I mean, he might be, but he doesn’t put ANY effort towards ANYTHING. My dad pays A LOT of money to send us to a private school and still my brother has been failing consistently since the last 3 years. Every time we have to beg his teachers to him pass. He’s 16, which I know is young, but you have at least SOME direction in life by this point. All he seems to care about is is his friends (who by the way are great kids) and video games. I feel like he puts up another persona when he’s around other people because he’s a completely horrible person with my mom and I. 
And I dont want to “blame” my mom because she is a VERY VERY simple woman, but I honestly dont know what to do....
My dad has been away most of our lives so he doesn’t really understand when we complain to him. His usual response is “take everything away from him” which obviously could never work. My brother would tear the house to shreds if we took even a single one of his “things”. 
Anyway, its come to point where he’ll sometimes walk up to me and ask for something trivial e.g. order food for him. If I tell him no I’m busy, he’ll get angry. He’ll throw things at me or damage something I own and run away to his room and lock it. 
Before you say “Why dont you hit him back?”, trust me, I’ve tried. But it always ends up in him being COMPLETELY ruthless (he does NOT care how much he hurts the other person whereas I obviously cant hurt him to the point where he’s bleeding or bruised or something. Thats just fucked up). 
I don’t know what to do. His situation is getting increasingly scary and neither of my parents seem to be taking it seriously enough.

I’m what I like to jokingly call an emotionless SOaB and very rarely show deeper negative emotions like sadness and the like (frustration and anger I still show just quietly) I still feel them don’t get me wrong, just never outwardly show it. I’ve always held them in even when I was a kid because I always saw it as a weakness (it took me weeks to admit I was really feeling down and even longer to admit I was depressed to my closest friend who I tell even my most embarrassing stuff to) but now that I’m older (18M) I see it as something to be proud of.

491,"Hi! I'm 25(F). New here so I could use some help. I have a couple of friends. Both Male. Let's call them Nick(25) and Sam(27). We have been friends for almost 6-7 years now and have been close about our personal problems with each other. Both of them have gone out of their ways at times to help me. Just to clarify I do not have any kind of romantic interest in either of them. They have been dating their girlfriends for a very long time now.
However, last month Sam's girlfriend called me up and asked me if I could help her because Sam was being rude and verbally aggressive towards her. He had been using foul language which gets pretty disturbing. Also, he treats her like a dumb person. Also he doesn't do behave with me or any other female friends of his.

Now let me give you a background of their relationship. They have been in a relationship for almost 8 years on and off. And he does get pretty aggressive (not physically) over minor things and isn't sensitive towards anything. She has always been the submissive one in the relationship. They have always had pety issues like blocking each other on social media about smallest reasons.

Now since it has been so long since he has used foul language while talking to her about her parents and towards her as well. She contacted me to help her out. I spoke to Nick about this and he suggested we talk to both of them together because just talking to either one of them is not going to solve this. 

Before that could happen the above mentioned girlfriend has ""patched up"" with Sam and doesn't mention about it again. But since the time Nick heard about the way he has been treating a girl, he has lost all respect for Sam. I am pretty upset too because that's not how you treat a girl or just anyone for that matter. But Sam has been really helpful during very tough times so I can't just cut him out of my life. He is also in a stressful phase in terms of career which has been major reason for his aggression.

Sam has realised that Nick is not talking to him and is desperate about what has happened. He has been asking me and I do want them to patch up and also that Sam should realize he has been extremely wrong in doing all this. But Nick is not ready for confrontation and just doesn't want to have any kind of conatct with Sam. 
Also, I do not feel comfortable with a guy who treats other girls this way.

493,"I spent 3 years in a toxic environment full of heavy gossipers, I know for sure because I told things privately to one person and then another demonstrated knowledge of it, every info was considered of public domain, no one bothered to know wether the info was circulating because someone had broken the confidentiality of a conversation between two people alone or because the person had actually told the info willingly to many people.

They were also nitpicking heavily whatever I was wearing or items I had, used to communicate in very oblique ways by alluding or by half-phrases and no one was ever talking to me directly or confronting me about things that seemed to matter to them (gossips they have heard about me), basically they interacted with me based on rumours about me without ever admitting knowledge of it or addressing me directly. These rumours were half personal confidences that I disclosed to people I mistakenly trusted with my soul and half speculations and random conclusions that the gossipy cliques came out with to explain things they didn't know.

They also hacked the email of one of them, found the password in a closet and regularly read the emails and commented on them. I was told by someone who knew it, almost matter-of-factly. I believe that this later happened to me too. I did two big mistakes: lost my usb key with my passwords and sensitive emails in pdf all in there, and that place where I lost it was nearby that toxic environment and it turned out that the people in there were acquaintances of them. And I also checked my email on their computers, I logged out but still they were very tech savvy and I had put my password in that environment's computers a couple of times.

Anyway, they started to react to things that I wrote in emails, not told to anyone. It went on for quite a long time. It was also an account that gave them access to my browsing history and they started to comment heavily on that too. As you can imagine at some point can become very confusing to figure out when you are spot on in guessing that they said something because of what you wrote and when you are just overreacting to a glance. They were incredibly sneaky and oblique, no way at all to walk up to them and talk.

In the end I broke down, I was already forcing myself in a path that I didn't like to please them, and it was impossible to survive in there. I did not had privacy at home to browse internet or reply to emails without fearing exposure and comments the next day. I collapsed. I called them out on this and they told me that my personality was disturbed and that I was paranoid. This really did a number on my mind.

An IT technician later explained to me that it is likely that they had put a forward option (I'm not a native English speaker, sorry for the weird language) so that even if I changed my password it did not get rid of them because they received my communications anyway. I am still in doubt wether they read my Skype conversations using that email too. It was that stressful. However, I had to close the account to disengage, and I quit that environment.

Can you help me figure out if I was making up the privacy violation because as they said or if what I think that happened is plausible? I have been cleared by mental health specialists, but I'm still quite confused about what happened, because I thought they were good people. Such a display of power made me also feel that they were extremely powerful and made me feel even more in need to justify them.",30May2020,1

It feels like no matter what I do I will always be unlovable/not attractive. To preface, I don’t hate women or even feel any bitterness towards women like incels do. I’m friends with many girls and I don’t consider them any less than my equals. However, I feel like an incel because I feel that it doesn’t matter how hard I try, I’ll always be unwanted. A few examples of things I’ve done to make myself worthy of a girls time are, losing 80 pounds since last January ( I’d still like to lose 30-40more), bought all new clothes, I keep a job consistently, I go to college, I bought a car, but none of this has made me worth a girls time. I feel like I’m good socially as well, I always like to keep people laughing and one of the only things that makes me feel good is making other people happy.

I just don’t know what else I can do to make myself worthy of a girls consideration. I know I’m not entitled to anyone’s love or attraction, which is why I don’t really feel bitter about my predicament. At the same time though I would do anything to be good enough. I really don’t care how a girl would treat me, even if she hit me, made me give up my hobbies, move away from family/friends, sell everything I own, if I thought it would get a girl to finally love me I would do it in a heartbeat.

One of the main reasons I feel like I’m so similar to incels is their discussion/obsession with “roping”. Roping basically means committing suicide by hanging. I don’t know about hanging myself but I think about suicide constantly. I don’t know why I should live knowing that I’m always going to have no worth, and that in all reality I’m just a drain on resources that other people desperately need. I hate being unlovable, I hate being someone that nobody wants to imagine spending their life with. I don’t want to stick around if all I’m going to create in the minds of others is disgust and uncomfortable feelings, the world is really shitty right now and the last thing someone needs is some fucking loser like myself bothering them.

I don’t know what It feels like to have someone in my corner and I’m just so tired of thinking that someday someone will care about me and things will magically get better. 

I’ve been going to therapy for about 3 months now because I know it’s not fair to a girl to be with someone like me. However it feels like it’s never going to get better, even with therapy. My therapist had been making me find ways to feel better about myself momentarily and try to find things about myself but what does that matter if I’m a disgusting fucking subhuman? No girl is going to want to sink down to my level when they could achieve so much better. 

It feels like killing myself would be such a favor to everyone I know. I know that sounds extra or “edgy” but it’s true. Nobody really cares if I’m alive or not and I’m tired of taking up resources that people with real aspirations and real potential need when I’m just trying to make it until the next day. I don’t feel any reason whyI should be alive, all I’ve ever aspired for is to be good enough to make someone else happy that I’m happy with but it’s becoming obvious that I’ll never have that opportunity.",30May2020,1
498,"This was what I posted 3 months ago:

So I figured out my friend has been using me. And all my effort felt 1 sided. I told her alot of times to stop using me but she said she wasn't. I asked her about my importance and she. I'm good and important to her. The feeling of being used doesn't stop. So this year I made up my mind to stop feeling hurt now I don't talk to her as usual and now we don't talk at all anymore, but we see eachother everyday in school. She doesn't seem to care or ask why I've been acting like this, I feel guilty that I'm the bad friend here and has done nothing wrong. Do u think I should get into this type of friendship or nah? I know it sound simple or dumb but this bothers me alot, I hope you guys can help.

I was told or advised by u guys, on here (thank u all, I really appreciate it, cos I don't have anyone else to ask these stuffs), i was told to stop talking to her and leave her alone cos she's not worth it.

And 2 months ago:

I really need help this might be long sorry. After 3 months that I stopped talking to her, and she never asked me why. She started trying to talk by either helping me but not the talk and laugh like before it's like ""oh that's where u sign"" I feel like the problem is me. But I felt like she was using me for her work and like I was just an optional friend but she barely needs help from someone like she used to need help from me, she tales care of her things herself unlike when I was still talking to her. Should I kind of message her like ""hey what do u think after I stopped talking to u?"" Or just ""hi"" without having anything to say? Or maybe I shouldn't message her at all and just live like normal without talking or trying to clarify things. I feel guilty for feeling like she treated me like an option in front of her other friends who are somehow from the same ethnic group and even just normal friends from different places. I feel like I over thought everything and those things weren't actually happening especially after she just helps me a little bit of course without saying ""hi"" or ""hello"" before helping she just helps and when she leaves she never says ""bye"" I feel like she's mad but just want to help me. I'm so confused if I'm in the wrong here for ""over thinking"" or I didn't over think or she's just being ""nice"" with her personality or she does treat me as an optional friend. Also when I asked her if I was get optional friend or her priority she said I was just a special friend and told her several times to stop using me but she'd said she wasn't using me.



2 weeks ago:
My friend finally asked me y I stopped talking to her. Should I explain it to her or not?

I explained to her but not fully, since I didn't want to hurt her feeling or put her down just cos of what I felt about her I told her i would summarize it so I did. I told her how she made me fell less than a friend and how I was hurt, I told her that, I wouldn't guilt trip her but I was hurt and she didn't have to change just cos of my opinion (since no one has ever mentioned such to me about her). I thanked her for listening to me when I wanted to talk. I typed a long message of like 3 paragraphs but tried to keep it short. 
It's been 5 days and she's seen it but she has not replied which brings me to the conclusion that she really doesn't care about me or my feeling and I really need to leave her alone and stop trying to understand her. 

P.S. I don't think I mentioned that I got her a hurt for her upcoming birthday I had but something and had to burn myself with fire in the making, not trying to be considered a good friend (honestly I don't deserve the title, but just wanted to mention that one too).

Anyways thanks guys...again for advising me everytime I posted these stuffs.",30May2020,1
499,"Pretty much we were told to organise ourselves into groups yesterday of 3-4 people. Because of social distancing, I couldn't tell my friend if he wanted to be in a group since he was sitting elsewhere. He ended up joining the people next to him and only 2 groups were left who could let 1 more person in.

The teacher showed me the first group which had people I have never or rarely ever even talked to. They were clearly not showing a good attitude when the teacher went over so I'd be assuming they really don't want me with them.

The second group had some people that I do know from a previous school and I have talked to before but... this is where it really hurt me. On my next class, one of the students in this group said my name and blatantly told me this, ""\[name\], please don't join our group.""

And that really hurt me. I felt like crying but I managed to hold in my tears. I know I'm not the brightest student and I know no one wants me in their group but blatantly saying something like that is just too much. This same student has given me s##t in the past as well but it was nothing too horrible.

I don't know what to do. My friend just joined another group and no one wants me in theirs. 

**Note:** I go to a public government college but it's filled with toxicity because of the competitiveness to the point where no one wants to help anyone else.

Also, I don't want to report this guy because I will get s##t on. This individual is one of the ""Toppers"" and pretty much, these ""Toppers"" even though they are very smart, are the biggest assholes. They talk crap about others and even each other sometimes when one of them isn't near.",30May2020,1
500,"I have this issue right now and it’s hard to deal with. Basically I hate being touched, my dad keeps touching me randomly. He used to hug me but I hated that even more and told him to stop so he did. But he keeps touching me and whenever he does I have to hurt myself where he touched me. Like I have to. 
Last time I let him hug me was after an argument, he pointed his finger in my face and screamed at me calling me too defensive, sensitive and told me he was sick of me. I felt scared that he would hit me tbh, I’m female and he’s a man and in that moment I was super aware of how badly he could hurt me. He never has, but he scares me when he shouts and gets angry. I kind of hate that I’m more vulnerable simply bc I happened to be born female, no offense to any girls reading this, it’s just how I feel. Anyway he left for a few minutes before coming back and hugging me. He said sorry but also kept telling me that I shouldn’t be defensive and sensitive so that kinda took back the apology tbh. The hug felt like ownership, I still felt scared and I was helpless bc I couldn’t refuse the hug. I really didn’t want him to touch me. It feels so possessive bc this is my body and I have a right to refuse human contact. I’m not an object he can touch whenever he wants but he seems to think that I am. And just now he touched my shoulder and I had to whack myself repeatedly and lightly cut myself there. I know he can’t love me, no one can, the affection is a lie and it also brings me back to that moment he screamed at me. This wasn’t the only incident where he yelled, it’s happened several times though it doesn’t happen that often. 
I know this all sounds stupid, I know it’s dramatic and weird and definitely not normal. I’m trying to stop feeling this way but I haven’t been able to yet. And incase you’re wondering, I do see a counselor for anxiety. We’ve been going through some heavy stuff so haven’t managed to discuss this issue I have. I plan to bring it up with her in our next session. However that’s not for another few days so I would really appreciate any advice you might have. Thanks for reading.",30May2020,1

504,"When I was younger, I saw concerning messages on the phone of someone that I know. They were flirtatious and had a lot of hearts and kisses and ""I miss you's"" and ""I'm thinking about you's"" and ""I love you's."" It was real, concrete evidence that this person was cheating on their spouse, but I was too young to know how to handle the situation. I just internalized it.

It's been eight years, and this person has consistently taken their wedding ring off to go out, deleted all of their messages routinely, snuck out, lied about where they were, and just been overall sketchy. Others have come to me with concerns about a potential affair, telling me that there seemed to be evidence that they were unfaithful.

About seven years after the initial messages, I found other messages and was involved in an event where this person was being overly comfortable with someone else. Everyone there was acting like there was a secret that I wasn't in on, and I was physically turned away from this person by their friend to avoid seeing a moment of intimacy. I confronted them about messages that contained a lot of innuendo, asked why their wedding ring was off, and told them I was uncomfortable with what I saw. They laughed it off and told me they were ""flattered that I would think they could pull it off."" They never told their spouse about our conversation, never brought it up with me again, and didn't outright deny my claims.

That was about 3 years ago. We never spoke about it since, and their spouse DOES NOT know about any of it. They make a lot of comments that indicate that they never even had suspicions, like ""they would never cheat on me"" and ""they have NEVER been unfaithful,"" etc. Nothing major has happened, since then. I feel like I'm crazy, a lot of the time, about assuming they would have an affair. I feel guilty for even thinking about it. However, I don't know how to proceed with this person. They're a major part of my life, and even though I have my doubts, I have a lot of resentment and anger toward them for what they've done.

So, my question is: how do I have a conversation with them about what I have seen and how it makes me feel? I don't have any real evidence, and I feel weird bringing up messages from when I was a kid. I just don't know to have this conversation, how to start it, and how to move on if they deny it again and laugh me off. Any advice on how to speak about this with them?",30May2020,1
506,"I'll just start by saying I know I'm a coward. I am a people-pleaser and someone who avoids conflict literally as much as possible. With that being said, with what is going on and the constant and perpetual violence being perpetrated against black individuals I do not believe it is in anyway moral to remain a silent bystander as they live in a constant state of fear.

I tried to gather my courage and make a post about this on facebook the other day showing my support for the Black Lives Matter Movement and vowing not to remain silent. My aunt, who I love dearly, responded with an ""All Lives Matter"" comment that I think she meant to be encouraging and expressing that she loves all people. I know my aunt is just has horrified by what is going on and does not understand what those words mean and how they negate black struggles. She thinks she is being supportive. 

I also know it is my job to educate her. And I couldn't get myself to do it. I made a vague response telling her that I agree but that too many black individuals are dying at the hands of violence. Another individual told her about how her words negate the black experience and my aunt then commented that she loves all people and thinks black deaths are far too high and that it's not okay and knows as a white woman she can not understand the struggles.

A black coworker commented on my post with support but later made her own post on facebook saying that if anyone in her friends makes a black lives matter post and their family responds with all lives matter, she will be coming at them.

I understand her fury and I understand that I should have been more honest and stern with my aunt. I feel awful and wish I could do it over and have stood up for the black community more with my response. 

I know this is silly. That my discomfort is nothing to the fear and pain that black individuals are living with at this moment and here I am lying in bed fretting over some stupid facebook shit.

508,"I am currently struggling with the fact that I am uncertain whether I can still be friends with whom I have considered to be my best friends at Uni for the past eight months after they have almost completely disregarded one of their friends assaulting me. 

I (19M) have started Uni in September last year and almost instantly hit it off with two girls (K and L)  that joined at the same time. We got along really well, we have the same sense of humour and just generally get along well so much so that I consider them to be my best friends at Uni. However, despite us usually getting along well, there have been some issues. 

The biggest one was that, throughout our second term at Uni, they repeatedly let me down either by barely meeting up with me or by standing me up when we wanted to do something together. Once the term ended and most people left, we ended up sitting down and talking about it, and they apologised profusely. 

Apart from that, another major issue for me was the fact that one of them (L) got together with another guy whom I consider to be a complete and utter asshole. Now it is worth mentioning here, and important for the story as a whole, that I developed feelings for that same girl (L) very early on and I told her so almost immediately. She didn't reciprocate my feelings which was and still is tough, but I was fine for the most part with us just being friends. The reason I was so upset with her getting together with the other guy was that he was a huge asshole. I am talking the kind of guy who proudly tells stories of driving and speeding while drunk with both friends and children in his car as well as generally just being a fuck boy. 

While she acknowledged that his behaviour was terrible, she reasoned for her ""relationship"" with him by saying that he was nice to her. The reason why I took this so hard was that I have a lot of experience with bullying and one of the most common things you get to hear when you tell others about what someone else has done to you is ""I know he can be an asshole, but he can also be a really nice guy!"". This is something that I have heard so often that it deeply infuriates me.

She eventually ended her relationship with him, though as I believe rather out of necessity than anything else since he returned home due to the pandemic. Since then, she has admitted that he really is just an asshole.

After the second term ended and we started hanging out again, especially during the two-week vacation between terms, and at first, things seemed to be great. Though I still had feelings for her, I accepted that she didn't, and I was really just happy about the three of us being friends. 

After the vacation ended, a friend of theirs returned to Uni, and I noticed that they started reaching out to me less frequently and just generally somewhat back down. Now I wasn't sure if I was right in my assessment of the situation because I was concerned that I was just somewhat paranoid due to the events of the last terms so I asked them about it and they assured me that it was just in my head. 

The next day, however, things got bad again when I found out that L got together with their friend. When I asked her about it, she told me that there were no feelings involved and that it was just a fling.

This really hit me hard. The reason for this is that, though I didn't really know the guy, over the eight months we have been at Uni they have repeatedly told me certain stories about him. It started when, in the first term, L told me that he confessed to her that he had feelings for her, at which point she rejected him. A few weeks later, K told me that he had also told her that he had feelings for her. When I got confused and asked her what she meant, given that he had told L the same things mere weeks before, she said that he had ""revealed"" to her that he had feelings for her (K) all along and that he had only projected them onto L since he knew that K had a boyfriend at home. A few months later, he got together with another girl only to break up with her after the winter holidays to reveal that he had only gotten together with her in order to get over K. Throughout the second term he made repeated suggestions that he couldn't stay friends with K due to his feelings for her. 

When he and L got together, originally as a fling, L told me that she knew that he had no feelings for her and that she just did it for fun. As mentioned above, this really struck me hard as I realised that my feelings for her weren't really gone and that her getting together with him made me feel massively unappreciated. As a result, I wrote her a message that day telling her that I needed a break from seeing her as I couldn't cope with them getting together. She was very understanding, and after roughly a week we both realised that we really missed hanging out with each other and so decided to try to ignore it. While this partially worked, there were several incidents where I couldn't handle it. 

This all ultimately culminated when L and I met up a few days ago and I ended up kissing her on the cheek. Now while I would like to say that it wasn't something I really consciously decided to do but rather something that, as dumb as it sounds, just happened, I do realise that this isn't a real excuse and I apologised profusely to her. She said that, though she didn't appreciate me doing so, it okay. 

When I asked her if we could keep it between the two of us, she told me that she didn't feel comfortable not telling her boyfriend. This surprised me, to say the very least, and upon asking her to clarify she told me that, what had started out as a fling, was now a real relationship. 

At this point, I apologised even more profusely and told her that I didn't know which in turn sparked her surprise, as she had thought that I was aware of this. 

We ended up talking for a bit and, as the conversation went, on it turned out that she had not been aware of the details of what he had told K when he initially confessed his feelings for her, with him convincing her that he had feelings for her all along. 

After finding out about this, she left rather upset, telling me that she was no longer sure if she could believe him. 

At this point, it was quite late, and so I decided to go to bed. However, about half an hour later, my doorbell rang repeatedly. Upon asking who it was L's boyfriend revealed himself to me and asked me to come downstairs to talk to him.

When I walked outside he asked me if I had anything to say to him and after confessing that I had kissed L he demanded an apology, stating that I could either show him respect or ""be taught some"". Now I have dealt with bullies who lie and threaten their way through life for most of mine, and at this point, it is safe to say that I am not someone to budge very quickly to their behaviour. As I was increasingly getting irritated by him suggesting that I could either apologise to him or be ""taught respect"", I decided that I did not owe him anything and turned to return to my room. 

At this point, he informed me that if I chose to leave that he would end up going after me. This got me to turn back to him and approach him to inform him that he was an idiot of making threats to me. He chose to respond to this by attacking me. 

Past experience has taught me that in situations like these if there is no real danger to your wellbeing, the best thing to do is to stay as passive as possible in order to ensure that it becomes a clear cut case. After being pinned to the ground, choked and threatened repeatedly with further violence, L and K came running out of a nearby kitchen to restrain him.

After this, I filed a report, the results of which are still pending. 

Since then, however, I have spoken to both L and K, who have revealed to me that, after he admitted that his behaviour was ""off"", they saw no reason to further make a big deal out of it and that they would instead just have things stay the way they were. 

When I told them that there was no way that I would just accept them pushing it under the carpet, I was hit with several statements such as: ""He could have gone further, but he didn't!"", ""It's still my choice with whom I am together!"" , ""It sucks, but it happened, and I don't see why we should keep making a big deal out of it!""

I was then, furthermore, told that if I didn't want to stay friends with them anymore, then they can't change that.

I haven't spoken to them since, though we have exchanged a few text messages which further strengthened my belief that their disinterest in further confronting him is founded by a general lack of appreciation for me. 

I am unsure if me expecting them to show him consequences to his behaviour by breaking off contact or even just taking a break from him is expecting too much. Especially because they have been saying that since they will only be staying for three more weeks before leaving Uni, they don't want to break any bridges. To me, this either means that they would rather lose me then him or they are just not willing to break any bridges themselves, meaning to do the ""dirty work"", since I was the one who said that I wasn't sure if I could see them again. 

I could really use some advice on whether or not me expecting them to choose between him and I is asking too much.",30May2020,1

511,"For the majority of my life, I’ve never particularly struggled with making friends. Even when I didn’t have a big group of friends - I always had a handful of close ones. 

My dad died in September 2018, when I was 16. It happened a week before starting college (the UK equivalent to highschool) - so naturally I struggled with making friends there.

After his death, I lost contact with my old friend group, and gradually with my old handful of close friends. Everyone has also started different colleges, and they were moving on and finding new people. 

I ended up dropping out in January to focus on my diminishing mental health. I didn’t do all that much to help myself in that time, just smoked a lot of weed and did not process the loss of my dad.

Last September I returned to college. It was also the year anniversary of my dad’s death. After being in a state of denial for a year about my dad’s death — it suddenly felt real, I suddenly started grieving. 

I’d planned to make friends at college, but with my overwhelming grief and poor mental health - I struggled. 

I hung around with friends from the year prior, but the dynamics of friend groups had changed and I did not feel wanted - the majority of them felt like acquaintances rather than friends.

In my classes, I struggled with making friends too. I think it was my own barriers that held me back. I did not try hard enough at all, but I also had a LOT going on at the time. 

Our country is currently on lockdown. The circumstances are awful and my heart goes out to everyone affected - however it has been really beneficial regarding my grief and mental health

But loneliness has been getting me down. 

I recently cut off the only friend that saw me consistently, I don’t wanna go too into that but I felt that it was the best decision for my healing - that having no friends is better than having friends that aren’t good for you.

My question is - once everything goes back to ‘normal’ - how do I make friends? 

I feel like it is too late for me to make friends at college, that everyone already has done. There are a few acquaintances I have at college that I’d like to pursue a friendship with, we never spent time together at lunch or in frees but we did talk a little - how could I pursue this?

I work and get along with everyone there, a few of us even have a bookclub once a month which I really enjoy. Whilst I really, really like these people I wouldn’t regard it as a close friendship where we can sporadically meet up or go to eachother’s houses or confide in eachother.

I also have a boyfriend who I love, and I get along with housemates well (I seem to get along a lot better with people in their 20’s, this applies to my work friends too, which is potentially why I struggled with befriending 16 year olds at college). But I don’t want my boyfriend to be my only form of socialisation. I. feel like that’s an unfair amount of responsibility to put on him - and ultimately whilst I love him, I want friends to love too!

We had been together about a year and a half at that point, but had been friends for about 2 years prior to our relationship. 
About 3 months ago I backslid and completely left the church. I have tried to talk to a few people in the last year but my mind always returns to my ex. Especially lately.

I work and get along with everyone there, a few of us even have a bookclub once a month which I really enjoy. Whilst I really, really like these people I wouldn’t regard it as a close friendship where we can sporadically meet up or go to eachother’s houses or confide in eachother.

I also have a boyfriend who I love, and I get along with housemates well (I seem to get along a lot better with people in their 20’s, this applies to my work friends too, which is potentially why I struggled with befriending 16 year olds at college). But I don’t want my boyfriend to be my only form of socialisation. I. feel like that’s an unfair amount of responsibility to put on him - and ultimately whilst I love him, I want friends to love too! 

So, how should I make friends - or get closer with the acquaintances and work friends I do have?",30May2020,1

It feels like no matter what I do I will always be unlovable/not attractive. To preface, I don’t hate women or even feel any bitterness towards women like incels do. I’m friends with many girls and I don’t consider them any less than my equals. However, I feel like an incel because I feel that it doesn’t matter how hard I try, I’ll always be unwanted. A few examples of things I’ve done to make myself worthy of a girls time are, losing 80 pounds since last January ( I’d still like to lose 30-40more), bought all new clothes, I keep a job consistently, I go to college, I bought a car, but none of this has made me worth a girls time. I feel like I’m good socially as well, I always like to keep people laughing and one of the only things that makes me feel good is making other people happy.

I just don’t know what else I can do to make myself worthy of a girls consideration. I know I’m not entitled to anyone’s love or attraction, which is why I don’t really feel bitter about my predicament. At the same time though I would do anything to be good enough. I really don’t care how a girl would treat me, even if she hit me, made me give up my hobbies, move away from family/friends, sell everything I own, if I thought it would get a girl to finally love me I would do it in a heartbeat.

One of the main reasons I feel like I’m so similar to incels is their discussion/obsession with “roping”. Roping basically means committing suicide by hanging. I don’t know about hanging myself but I think about suicide constantly. I don’t know why I should live knowing that I’m always going to have no worth, and that in all reality I’m just a drain on resources that other people desperately need. I hate being unlovable, I hate being someone that nobody wants to imagine spending their life with. I don’t want to stick around if all I’m going to create in the minds of others is disgust and uncomfortable feelings, the world is really shitty right now and the last thing someone needs is some fucking loser like myself bothering them. 

My family were real assholes as I was growing up.
After I graduated and was moving away my mom and sister both agreed that I was a solid 2/10 and that i needed to accept what I could get. Nobody wants me and it’s hard to feel like anybody In my real life even cares if I’m alive. I don’t know what It feels like to have someone in my corner and I’m just so tired of thinking that someday someone will care about me and things will magically get better. 

I’ve been going to therapy for about 3 months now because I know it’s not fair to a girl to be with someone like me. However it feels like it’s never going to get better, even with therapy. My therapist had been making me find ways to feel better about myself momentarily and try to find things about myself but what does that matter if I’m a disgusting fucking subhuman? No girl is going to want to sink down to my level when they could achieve so much better. 

It feels like killing myself would be such a favor to everyone I know. I know that sounds extra or “edgy” but it’s true. Nobody really cares if I’m alive or not and I’m tired of taking up resources that people with real aspirations and real potential need when I’m just trying to make it until the next day. I don’t feel any reason whyI should be alive, all I’ve ever aspired for is to be good enough to make someone else happy that I’m happy with but it’s becoming obvious that I’ll never have that opportunity.",30May2020,1

[Throwaway account] I have been quarantined with my parents since March 27 and have not been able to see my boyfriend because of social distancing. My parents are both in their 60s and are worried about getting covid but they told me that my boyfriend and i could see each other if he social distances with his friends. 
I suggested this to my boyfriend about this and he got extremely defensive and said he has a life too and i can’t expect him to social distance from his friends. He and his friends smoke while hanging out, so they share woods and bongs, which causes me concern for my parents. Although it concerns me, he and i have been in close contact twice since quarantine started and neither of us have been ill to our knowledge.
Since i miss my boyfriend and he won’t sacrifice not seeing his friends for a couple weeks, my parents said it’s ok if i spend the night at his house and hangout with him UNDER THE CONDITION of spending two weeks alone in an isolated room in our house that has a bedroom and bathroom. I saw him a couple days ago and spent the night and we had a good time. That morning, i left at 11 am and he said we would hang out at 3 pm. So we both leave at the same time to make it look like we’re driving to my house. I went home and he went to his friends house. Before leaving, he told his dad me and him were going on a hike and going to my house after. My boyfriend did not call me the whole afternoon and his phone died. His mom was calling me making sure he was with me so i lied to her and said he was (i felt really bad). So he ended up getting in contact with me and said he would leave his friends house in a little while and we didn’t end up hanging out until 8pm. I was upset and grouchy the whole night we were hanging out because he left me waiting all day and when i got back to his house he was still really faded and was the whole night. 
So today... at 7:30 pm he said we would hang out after he was finished eating dinner so i agreed. He didn’t text me until 11pm and said he was heading home (i guess from his friends house, i didn’t ask for clarification). In his texts he said that he was home but needed to take a nap to sober up (@ 11:48pm). I texted back about half an hour later that it was ok and to get some rest. 
So basically i sacrificed being stuck in a room by myself for two whole weeks and he can’t social distance from his friends even if it meant that we could see each other more freely and i wouldn’t have to be in isolation. 

Details: i live with my parents and i’m trying to respect their feelings of feeling safe from the virus. also my bf said to me about our visit and me staying in 2 week isolation: don’t shoot yourself in the foot for me. When i confronted him about lagging on me and being faded was that i was being controlling. my bf and i have been together for almost five years. 

What should i do? Am i overreacting for feeling so sad? I don’t know if i really am being controlling or forceful by suggesting the proposed scenario of him social distancing from his friends. (not indefinitely but just being able to see me *sometimes*).",30May2020,1

519,"Just found out yesterday through one of my in-laws that my MIL thinks my husband and I trapped our 1 year old kitty. MIL lives in the first floor with her youngest son and his wife, and our 700sqft apartment upstairs is adjoined with theirs downstairs. My husband got me a persian kitty since she was 3-4 months old and we've decided together that she will be an indoors cat with a small balcony upstairs for outside playtime. Since my husband knew I've been wanting a cat, we also agreed that she is not a shared family cat. I'm also self-employed, so I'm always home with her. Plus, MIL has two cats - one who is an extreme bully, which is why we rarely bring our cat downstairs.

Yesterday when my husband was at work, I went to the lake with my closest friend for a few hours. When coming home, I found out that MIL let my cat out. She was hiding in the basement in the dark. When I found her, she came to me asking for some comfort. Then, she immediately went upstairs to where her home is.

Then I've been told that MIL let her out because we always ""trap"" her upstairs and that she knows what's best for my cat. I'm a little hurt not only because she thinks like that, but also because she left my cat in a small basement in the dark all scared rather than bringing her back up. Am I overreacting? Or am I in the wrong for keeping our cat in one place upstairs and rarely bringing her downstairs?",30May2020,1

But I have a problem connected with porn-videos: now I like only what I was used to watch in those videos. I started when I was 13 years old, now I'm 19. When I started, I was young and didn't know anything about female body and sex, so I didn't like to watch videos where there was the vagina, because you know it could be strange for his shape for a kid who has never seen anything. The problem is that I avoided it for the rest of the years. I know what are you thinking, but I'm not gay, I have the doubt but I'm definitely attracted by women. So my problem is that for me it's difficult to have sex with my girlfriend for the first time, this problem and others unsecurities make me feel bad.

525,"This is a bit of a complicated one. I have PTSD, often get nightmares where I wake up screaming or crying. I take sleep meds usually and they help with the dreams. So my boyfriend has never witnessed these bad nightmares and how I react to them. 

Lately, I felt like the meds were making me too sleepy throughout the day, so I've been cutting back slowly and actually noticed an improvement. At first, I didn't remember dreaming anything, so I thought it was all good. But then my boyfriend pointed out that I made weird sounds in my sleep, like little whimpers, to the point where he had to go and sleep on the couch because I was so restless. He did say he found it cute though, so I didn't tell him that I'd probably seen him get shot or something in my dream. 

The past two nights have been terrible. He's away for business, so he thankfully didn't witness what happened, but I woke up several times both nights, screaming and crying, and thought what happened had been real. I desperately wanted to call him so I'd know he's alright, but realized if I called him I'd have to explain why. 

I don't know if I should tell him about the contents of these nightmares. I told him once, like 2 years ago, and his reaction was less than positive. The same thing happened with a previous boyfriend who thought I was telling him about my dreams to make him jealous, even though that was not the case at all. And it seems to be a thing with guys, to assume that their partners share dreams with them to be manipulative. 

But the thing is, I also don't think I can keep this from him. If I don't continue with the medication, I'll have more nightmares, and one day he's going to be sleeping next to me and notice. Being able to tell him would honestly help me so much, because then I could ask him for reassurance without having to come up with an excuse.

532," 

I have a friend who is quite a bit older than me, and very quirky and loving, really the most caring person I’ve ever met. I have an issue though which I worry is undermining our friendship - her quirkiness involves many conspiracy theories and (recently revealed) anti-vaxxer beliefs. Until recently it hadn’t bothered me, since I enjoy listening to others’ beliefs that are contrary to mine and engaging in discussion (I’m an environmental scientist). She’s very knowledgable about many things, but is also extremely suspicious of anything mainstream and holds strong beliefs about things like energy, angels and the body’s ability to heal itself, alternative medicine etc. This generally doesn’t concern me, everyone’s entitled to their own beliefs and many of the things she says are heartfelt and have got her through many traumas in her life. I’m also aware of the issues around things like the pharmaceutical industry etc generally, and I read a lot on alternative medicines because of some chronic health issues. But recently she asked me to promise her I won’t get the vaccine for coronavirus when it comes out… I told her I won’t promise her that, and she got upset with me and said she hopes I will reconsider. I told her the most I will do is fully research vaccines (which, of course, I’ve done before, and no I do not think the levels of mercury in vaccines are any more harmful to me than what I’m exposed to on a day-to-day basis in my environment). When I tried to explain this, her reply is simply ‘oh I’m a scientist too’, to try to back up her claims (she isn’t, but she sees her ‘critical thinking’ as having a scientific mindset). I’m not one to ever talk down to others or put people into boxes, but I’ve tried to engage in discussion to no avail, as she sees any evidence I have as just proof that science hasn’t caught up yet. Also due to our age gap, I do feel she talks down to me sometimes.

My concern is that if I pull at this thread, she’s going to realise how little I agree with many of the things she believes in, and we could end up falling out. I’ve never lied about this, but perhaps I haven’t previously been as assertive as I could have been in my own views (partly to avoid attempts to ‘convince’ me otherwise, when I’d prefer to just continue our other nicer conversations). Recently she’s also started forwarding many emails about conspiracies around the pandemic, and ‘the truth about cancer’, etc. It really bothers me, but I have no idea how to approach this without upsetting her or losing her friendship, which I really cherish. Yet, I know I need to be more honest with her about my own views, as otherwise I'm not being very authentic. Any advice?!

I’m really tight for money right now and I feel there’s no way I’ll be able to afford it being fixed at a mechanics.

539,"My husband (21M) and I (20F) live in a house with two other people (19M and 20M). My roommate (the 20M) was already getting on my freaking nerves. He changes everything in the house and doesn't say anything, expects us to figure it out, claims hes improving the house. (Hes not) Wants all of us to clean up after ourselves but won't do it himself. And about every other time I see him when I'm home hes got fucking beer in his hand and is talking shit about something.

Recently (like a few days ago) my husband and I adopted our first puppy together which is something we told our roommates in advance we are doing. We are both doing our damndest to love and care for her. We play, we feed her, give her pets, take her to go potty, etc and she loves us to death. Shes a little love but unfortunately due to how recently she was adopted and how shes showing signs of separation anxiety, which maybe we're wrong and it's just a puppy being a puppy, but either way we cant leave a room without her or she will start crying when she cant see us. I dont blame her, shes a baby in a new home and family.

We had to start going back to work a few days after we got her (NEITHER of us wanted to go so we can keep helping her adjust but if we wanted to keep our jobs we had to). My husband works nights I work days. 

Before we got her, the roommate would make jokes about inviting one of their Asian friends over to cook her, or would say ""oh well shes still punting age"". 

Recently I've noticed that when I'm home my roommate starts to play with her, hype her up, will tell me how to train our Pup like he's an expert on German Shepherds (hes not. Hes never had one before), and I've also noticed when I take her out back to play and go potty he tends to come with and takes over completely which is really starting to stress me the fuck out because I'll call her to me(shes still learning her name so already it takes a fucking minute) and she just runs to him. Literally it breaks my heart. Shes a puppy doing puppy things though, I'm not mad at her. It feels like every chance he gets hes interfering. Maybe I wouldn't mind if my husband and I had more time for her to bond with us, and had more time with her. 

I dont want her bonding with him (hes leaving for a month anyways and frankly I dont trust him around my husband's and my pup) and I'm terrified hes trying to steal her away. Shes just a baby so shes just happy for attention and lovings. We've started kennel training (just for when my husband my shifts begin and start before the other gets home), today is day one and GOD I'm terrified if he takes her out she'll start bonding with him more than my husband or I and undo what little progress is being made to help her see ""we leave but we come back everytime"". 


Maybe I'm being paranoid or overprotective of my little girl but god I cant get rid of the feeling in my gut and the heart break I'm feeling when I see it.

I'm working on getting a new job where I start later and can get more morning time with her and so when my hubby comes home one of us there so the transition will be easier.

In the start of our friendship I ignored the negative stuff about her because there actually were a lot of positive stuff as well but I cant take this anymore. Sometimes I’m even afraid to say something because she can snap in a split second and says really mean stuff to me and when I tell her that she says “It’s not a personal attack, don’t be so offended.” One times she sent me a pic of a random girl on instagram and asked me “Is she prettier than me?” And I said y’all are both pretty and she responded “I think I’m way prettier than her I don’t understand what’s so cute about her”. That just shows how highly she thinks of herself. Because of quarantaine we dont talk a lot anymore and she told me twice how worried she was about our friendship because she has the feeling I don’t wanna talk to her and I said I’m just really busy with school. Honestly those 2 months when we didn’t speak I felt so fucking free. Free of everything. No negativity, no fights, no hypocrisy. I’M FREE!!! But I can’t do this forever... I don’t know how to tell her that I don’t wanna talk anymore. I’m 100% sure she won’t accept it and start a fight again..",30May2020,1
546,"Whenever I really like someone (romantically), I become paranoid and feel like they are somehow watching or listening to me. It gets to the point where I feel like I have to close my windows if I’m going to talk about them, just in case they somehow are outside listening to me. I know how crazy this all sounds and deep down I know they are not really there. However, these intrusive thoughts still get to me.

547,"(TLDR at bottom)

I have a rather close friend (we’ll call her Judie) who is currently learning a language not spoken in my country at all (let’s say French). 

Judie is rather extroverted, at least a lot more than I am (an ambivert). I have been contemplating learning French too - but have not taken much action - since a few months ago. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing Judie post Instagram stories of her “progress”, which includes videos of her reciting French phrases and words. This has also inspired me to take some action (i.e begin learning French basics)

Something to take note is that Judie had complained to me about others: “xx is so unoriginal”, “well I started it first, people are copying me”, “I started this trend lmao”. 

As such, as much as I do not want to risk this friendship or have her have these kind of thoughts towards me (should she find out), I am also highly interested in learning French. 

I do not really want to purposely learn French in private just to avoid “getting into her bad books”, and usually when I see someone else sharing a hobby/preference with me, I’d approach him/her and have friendly conversations about it. I do want to do so with Judie, but I’m afraid of what could happen.

TL;DR: close friend learning new language i’m interested in too, but havent took action. said friend is also known for being unhappy about others doing something (usually unique, ie learning a language) when she’s doing the same thing. i dont want to learn in private just to avoid her, but dont want to risk friendship.

Also I work a fairly physical job in a plant growing operation where it's pretty warm and humid often times, and I'm afraid after working for a little while (came in at 7, its now almost 8:30) it may have increased my body temp so that if they do check me again it'll be high regardless of whether or not I have a fever.

555,"This issue has been recurring for more times than I can remember. My wife is very unhappy about my past relationships, which happened many years ago. Firstly, she did some stalking on social media to find out who they were and were jealous of them (beauty etc, even though it was irrelevant). I've never cheated but she holds me accountable for my sexual history with them as she never had any other sexual partners. I've tolerated this for years and kept ""defusing the bomb"". From time to time, she will bring up questions asking me about details and then feeling really terrible and what i thought was minor panic attacks. Recently it's been happening more frequently (may be due to work stress?) 

I'm afraid i may not be mentally strong enough to tolerate all of this. I want to keep my marriage. I've been telling her to let go of the past and focus on the present.

I play online with friends and I have a lot of fun doing it. Whenever i'm alone I sit here wondering what I could do. I mean My girlfriend likes to draw for example and sure we spend time together but we also wanna make sure it's not way too much. so we give each other space to do what we want.   
so the main Problem is: 

I don't know WHAT I want. 

Like I've had this random thought which was pretty accurate for me:  
''I don't need to hunt for food, I don't need to build a shelter to survive. I can, but don't need to, do so many things. I don't need to. I don't want to do a lot of them. On the other hand, I don't know everything I could do.''

Ive been hoping for either an art or medical job (I’m an artist by hobby but trained in lower level medicine, cna, medical receptionist, that sort of thing) anyway I started running out of money so I took a hostess job at a restaurant near me. I haven’t started yet but I accepted the offer and will begin on-boarding soon.
And just this morning I got an email from a painting job I applied for months ago. They stopped hiring during the crisis but they’re hiring again (because stuff is reopening, not because the pandemic is over- it’s not y’all) anyway this painting job would allow me to expand my art. It would force me to actually work on my painting. I’d get to teach painting to people if I got the job... but the other job is right across the street from where my fiancé lives, where I will be living in a few months. I dont drive due to an accident so a close job is really nice and this painting job isn’t terribly close but it sounds like it’s so much more fun and something I might actually enjoy... I’ve been a hostess before and I didn’t like it. This places pays minimum wage against tip sharing and the position is only part time.

564,"Hi everyone, I’m technically writing about an issue with my dad, but these are issues that started before I was even born. 

For cultural context my family is from the Middle East (secular). When my dad moved to the US he had immediate and extended family that moved here along with him. My mom didn’t have that, was independent and built a successful career before marrying. 

My mom’s and dad’s family knew each other in the old country and there was actually already another intermarriage between them. You’d think this would make for a seamless integration, but boy would you be wrong. 

My dad’s family (not so much his dad, but his mom and especially his only sibling, a sister) started making my mom’s life a living hell once she was pregnant with me. My dad’s sister (I don’t even call her my aunt) terrorized my mom so much that she was worried it would affect her pregnancy. Things only got worse after I was born, I have no relationship with any of them. They didn’t come to my first birthday because of some issue the sister created, and when my mom invited them to my 5th (a huge party my mom worked her ass off to throw) the sister caused a scene and ruined it. 

My dad has always put his family before me and my mom. He denies it till he’s blue in the face, but every fight we have as a family is about this and I’ve seen evidence of it, because when my dad’s dad died my mom really tried one more time to make an effort and they had no interest. 

I know it’s not uncommon for a wife to have issues with in laws, but in this case their hatred for my mom also extends to me. And my dad has never taken any ownership or responsibility for this. In fact he’s very manipulative about it. 

I haven’t seen my dads family since I was 10 (I’m in my 20s). When I was graduating HS, I found out I’d be valedictorian. My mom and I are best friends, but one day a couple weeks before the ceremony we had some dumb fight. He used this opportunity to corner me and insist I invite them to the ceremony, and I ended up running away from home and almost sleeping in the park. 

My 2 cousins are nearly twice me age (almost 50) and I have no relationship with them either. But this doesn’t stop my dad from randomly bringing them up all the time, including when I was going through a breakup during college graduation and he kept throwing in my face that I should have known because my ex was from the same country as my cousin’s ex husband. For context, my cousins are MUCH more privileged than I am and have no accomplishments, still live off parents but my dad won’t acknowledge this. And her ex husband was actually way out of her league, he divorced because he also got sick of family dynamics. 

My parents marriage has always been plagued by these issues. I recently found out that despite all the crap he expects my mom to put up with, shortly after their marriage when my mom wanted to help her brother immigrate, my dad wrote a letter behind her back to my uncle saying he didn’t want him here. This has damaged my uncle and moms relationship irreparably to this day. 

My mom is my best friend, and when I moved away for college she started spending a lot of time with me in my new city. Maybe it’s not normal, but it’s a dynamic that works for both of us. She and I are our best selves together and I’d be nothing without her. She wants to go back to work and this city has more opportunities. 

Now that we’re all back home in quarantine, my dad is constantly complaining, saying he wants us all to move back here. We are in a suburban area not suited for a young person starting out. But that’s the last thing I want to do. I went to a top 5 school and am building my career, but he doesn’t care about that. He thinks I should sacrifice for his convenience. He treats the fact that I moved to go to a better school like a burden, although ironically that’s the same thing he did by moving to this country. 

I guess my question is, how should I deal with him? Because my issues with my dad can’t really be separated from the problems in my parents marriage.",30May2020,1

My grandma passed away a few weeks ago, and I wasn't able to attend the funeral because I'm oversea. My dad would video call me and said how my mom was afraid of being in the house (with my grandma's altar, it's a culture thing) without my dad being there. With my dad, she still doesn't want to be on the first level of the house(where the altar is at) She would get really emotional sometimes, even though she used to be quite reserved about her feelings. 

The thing is, my grandma was not a good person. She unreasonably favoured my aunt over my mom, ever since childhood. She would chide and curse at my mom and accuse her of stealing a lot of times, even in adulthood. She also constantly gave out money to anyone that asks her, while once again accusing my mom of being a disgrace and meddling with her money.

 My grandma got Alzheimer's, and her health condition was getting worse. During the progress, she continued to deny and hate everything my mom did to help her. My aunt then remarried and flew off to America when my grandma' was so weak she couldn't do things by herself, which left only my mom to take care of everything. After months and months of dealing with my grandma (who hit, curse and spit at my mom at any given chance), my mom's stress level was really high. When she passed away, I wasn't sorry to say I was relief. But my mom was getting more and more anxious.

I obviously can’t go alone and she knows that. But that’s not the only reason I’m upset. She’s always talking and sharing things like she’s an activist for black rights. She’s white and teaches at an inner city school. But suddenly she’s not willing to fight for us when it really matters?

Idk man something about it isn’t sitting right with me but maybe I’m just upset I can’t go to something I’m passionate about (bc it’s not safe to go to something like that alone). I completely understand being scared. I get that her safety should be important to her too. But also what the fuck? She said “i thought it was going to be like a march but now i’m nervous”.

581,"Originally posted on r/datingadvice, thought it'd be a good idea to look for some advice here as well.

So I've a little story for you people. 3 months ago, that was before the whole quarantine thing, I went clubbing with a friend of mine. My friend brought along his ex girlfriend and his ex girlfriend brought along 5 friends of hers. I felt a little bit awkward at first since, I just knew like 1 of all these people and I'm really not all that good at socializing but I managed to shake it off and just went with the flow. 

I didn't really want to make a move on any of these girls because I'm not the type that makes a move on a girl before he gets to know her, and I just wanted to have fun. 

After clubbing we all went together to grab something to eat and we just sat down and talked a little bit. There I got the Instagram of two of the friends of my friend's ex girlfriend (sounds confusing). And after getting home my friend asked me what I thought of them. I told him that I thought they were pretty nice but that I was not in place to say something about them as I didn't really get to actually know them. Then my friend hits me with what do you think of (let's say) ""B"" [19 F]. I told him she looked pretty nice but again I don't really know her.

After that I was thinking about grabbing a chance to try and chat her up a bit and then try to get on a date with her to just talk and get to know each other. Buuuuuut! That's when quarantine started and of course I ended up doing none of that.

So here's my dilemma. I still want to do what I had in mind, but I don't know if should. Why? Well because I think that if I send her a message it'll be a little bit out of the blue. I mean it's been like 3 months and we haven't talked or seen each other since. Another part of me tells me ""well we don't have much to lose"" but I still can't bring myself to do it. 

So I decided to ask for your opinions. What do you people think? Would it be weird? ( I think it would). Would I come out as creppy? What do you people think? Just don't sugar-coat things. Hit me with truth, straight up.",30May2020,1
582,"I thought about making a throw-away for this just in case I have any friends who know my account, and I don’t want anyone to know my fiancé’s personal business; but I assumed making a throwaway might make it seem like I was looking to karma farm to sell the account. So here goes.

I’m deployed overseas and I got a text from her around the time I woke up saying she needs to talk to me immediately and I won’t believe what happened. At this point I’m assuming it’s good news since during the past months she lost her job due to the virus and we’ve had a few streaks of luck with her finding odd jobs doing modeling gigs (we live in Las Vegas). 

I texted her back asking what was up and tells me it’s bad and her and her friend are speaking with the police. She’s a very attractive woman in her 20s so we’ve had incidents before with sexual assault as well as her receiving disability from her supervisor being caught on tape trying to rape her while deployed overseas (she’s also a veteran). I went to a location on base where I can call her using WiFi and she’s absolutely delirious. Part of my reason for falling in love with her was her sheer confidence and ability to see through the bullshit of people’s malicious intent most times; so hearing her like this was something I never thought I’d experience. 

While visiting a friend staying at a hotel on the strip, she had a very well dressed “flamboyant” man approach them while they were in mid-conversation discussing modeling and brainstorming about what else they could do to continue making ends meet. He overheard this and told them he was a product designer for Gucci and showed them his google results. (I asked her if he scrolled or if it was a still image, she said he did not scroll). She’s dealt with scammers before but said he seemed very genuine and told them they were doing shoot in town and he had a group of models staying at the same hotel they were at. She said she was still on her guard since he seemed to mention his wealth a lot but his acting and google search was convincing so far. He then showed them his “300,000 dollar car” in the parking garage of the hotel. Which turned out to only be a 2015 BMW i8 (she doesn’t know cars, she thought it was a Ferrari). 

He told her to take his number down even though he never gives it out and they could discuss having a shoot tomorrow over dinner in an hour (this was around 8:30 PM). She’s done very high quality shoots before and to her this seemed just like another opportunity to pay some bills. Her friend agreed that this seemed like a once in a life time shot and how amazing the guy seemed. Living in Vegas you always hear about things like these but it’s obviously rare. She calls him around 9 PM telling him they’re coming down to meet him and he sounds annoyed at the fact that she’s not coming alone and that he only wanted her. She told him this made her uncomfortable and that she’d feel a lot safer if they all met up for dinner instead of just her (her friends boyfriend was there as well).

They all came downstairs and met with him in the lobby and agreed to have dinner together and the man asked my fiancé to ride with him. She insisted that her friend come along with them so she’s not alone in a car with a stranger but he told her it was only a 2 seater. They walked to the garage together and she said in the corner of the garage was a silver van and a man dressed in a bell hop uniform standing outside of it with a rope and a stack of shoeboxes. She said that was her first red flag but she had her friend with her plus due to the mans flamboyancy that he seemed harmless. After getting in the car she sees that it’s a 4 seater (her second red flag) and insists that her friend rides with them. Eventually the man agrees and after getting in the drivers seat he claims he can’t find his phone and asks her to call it while he looked around the garage for it (he claimed it must’ve been on the roof and when he started driving it must’ve slid off) as she’s calling it she hears the voicemail claim it’s a personal pharmacy company in the mans voice (final red flag) and sees the man wander off as 2 silver vans come to a screeching halt and pull up behind the car. Her friend and her sprint out of the car and over the small wall of the garage (first floor) into the streets where a black lives matter protest was happening. She said the man began to chase them as she heard the vans speed off but as she was running into the crowd of the protest she would lose him for a few second before seeing him pop up in the crowd again. Eventually the man gave up and sped off in his car. 

She told me they attempted to file a police report but the police claimed they were “super busy with everything going on” and weren’t taking them seriously. I’ve never heard a person cry so deliriously as I’ve heard my own fiancé cry while I’m helpless overseas.

The only information I have is the license plate and a picture that she took of the car. I looked up the plates and it confirmed it was a 2015 i8 so the plates weren’t stolen, but I have to pay 20 dollars to receive any more information. 

Is there anything public databases I’m able to access to find more information? I plan on looking on the google street view around the hotel to try and see if there were any public traffic cameras in the area as well as contact the hotel since he was in their lobby. I’ve never felt so helpless and I’m on military orders so it’s not like I can just pull money from my savings to buy a plane ticket out of here. Not to mention all the public airports are closed.

583,"Not sure why, but when I even think of this period in my life or things in it I get a feeling of dread or fear. The time is long gone, threat long over, or rather, whatever threat that remains is very little in comparison. Not sure what this means, or if it is normal? I'm inclined to think it is.

584,"This has been going on for more than a month now and I’m at my wits’ end. 

I told someone who I’ve been talking to online that I don’t want to be friends with them anymore. I told them my reasoning several times, I blocked them on several platforms after they threatened me but they will not leave me alone. 

First it started with an empty threat. Then they would try and apologize for everything. I kept saying no to being friends because I knew it wasn’t going to end well if I went back to that friendship. After that they would make account after account to contact me and then they would deactivate the account. They have messaged two of my friends (that they have absolutely no connection to) at this point under the excuse of “wanting to check up on me”. They’ve tried to contact me on every platform under the sun and I’ve tried to block every single account but I can’t even keep up anymore. 

I’ve explained several times how I want them to leave me and my friends alone. I’ve given my reasons plenty of times. I’ve said I would contact the police if they didn’t stop harassing me and my friends. After they didn’t stop for a long time so I contacted the police with everything I had but I haven’t gotten a response yet. I’ve done everything I can to get them out of my life. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. They can still contact my friends even tho I’ve warned them to ignore the messages. They have already spread things about me that are very personal to me to people I don’t know that well just to get under my skin. I’m constantly paranoid about the next thing they’ll do. Recently they even said they’re coming to my country and showed screenshots of bought plane tickets.

No matter how many times I’ve made my point clear about not wanting to be contacted they still manage to find a way to send me about 100 messages a day. I haven’t replied to any messages or provocation for a while now. I’ve muted half my social media. I respond to nothing no matter how bad it sounds and how upset it makes me. 

I don’t know what the right solution is here. Do i just deactivate all of my accounts? Even if I do they can still probably find my friends somehow. I don’t know what can help me since the authorities aren’t responding (at least not as of now). I don’t want this to turn into real life harassment as well.

585,"I used to love math as a kid, but when I went into high school I sorta just gave up on it. Mostly because I became lazy and started to procrastinate and pick up bad habits from other people.

591,"OK. I'd like to explain the title first. I have difficulty maintaining friendships, and I have come to terms with that and plan on working through it in the future (global pandemic. not the time), so whilst I'm totally open to criticism about my mistakes, know that I'm aware of my issues!

To keep this as short as it can be, when government lockdown started, I started speaking to my best friend less. I found myself letting her calls ring out, and taking a long time to respond to her messages, and generally avoiding her. Whilst I caught myself doing it, I felt like I couldn't stop - and what I mean by that is that I just put off speaking to her, and now we're here;

Before this all started, I would be speaking to her (texting, FaceTime, in real life) for most of the day. Two months on from the lockdown, we haven't spoken since Thursday and before that it had been since Monday. Our conversations have been short, awkward and she's read my messages without responding more than once (I don't blame her).

To be blunt, I feel terrible for her because she did not deserve this and I can only imagine how confused and hurt she feels. I don't know if anyone else experiences this; getting bored/annoyed with a friend and icing them out, but it would be nice if any of you understood it!

I've tried acting as if nothing wrong. I now realise that this quite possibly *the last* thing I should've done. It's manipulative. It makes it seem like I want her to think she was imagining it. Whilst our friendship wasn't perfect for reasons that aren't relevant to this, it was by no means past its end and had I not done what I did, it could have lasted a long ass time. I'm not trying to completely write it off, but I am worried that it won't be the same...obviously I accept this to be my fault.

To be honest, I'm more interested in what anyone has to say about me getting so vehemently annoyed/tired of friends that I feel the need to avoid them this much than I am about what I should do about my friend, because that's up to me to talk to her about and work through. However, I'm open to responses about either.

Some back round information, she's got 3 kids, in nursing school and a full time job. I totally understand I'm not a top priority and I'm completely okay with that. However the issue I'm having is, the last 3 times we've made plans for dates, she has stood me up with no notification and when I try to get a hold of her, my messages get left on read with no reply and I go straight to voicemail.

The first time was legitimate with a family emergency, the second time she said she'd come over after a friends get together, but decided to go hang out with friends instead, then last night she told me she needed my address after picking up something and then nothing. Once again, my messages got left on read and I went to voicemail again.

What I find most odd is, she's in constant communication with me right before she stands me up and if she planned to stand me up, why would she do that? I'm so confused by this.

596,"I'm 17 and in Year 12 (Junior year for those of you not from the UK). This is a pivotal time in my school career. I'm supposed to be finishing up half of all of my courses and beginning the application process to UCAS and various universities.

But ever since quarantine began two months ago I simply cannot get into the head-space to do any work. Every time I tell myself I have to sit down and do some work it's just so hard. It's gotten to the point that I'm afraid of my school inbox - I've gotten half a dozen emails about work that was supposed to be handed in before Easter and still isn't complete. I'm scared of disappointing my teachers but I'm also terrified of the mountain of work that I obviously already have because I just don't know where to start. I don't talk to my friends about it because we're all quite studious and I know they would not approve of me just throwing away my education the way I am doing now, but their advice would be to just ""sit down and get on with it"", because they all have a great work ethic, and I don't. I haven't started the UCAS application process, I have barely looked at universities, and the tests that teachers have sent out in order to calculate our UCAS/predicted grades (that are actually very VERY important: us getting into university hinges on those grades) are still sitting in my inbox, neither read nor done. I haven't handed in the Computing coursework that was due in in March.

And honestly at the same time I've stopped caring. Lack of school + having absolutely no future prospects has resulted in me just not giving a flying fuck about higher education or work anymore.

I know it's my fault, and I know what I have to do: but can anyone give me any advice on how to actually spur myself on? Am I alone in this work rut when there's no school-driven work environment surrounding us? Should I be afraid of repercussion from teachers?

At school, I worked hard to get my grades up and be a good kid, you know. My sister’s like the black sheep of the family and we only have our mom so I try not to add stress to her.

I worked and did things in college, edited thesis or did plates of other classmates to support whatever I needed at school cos my mom can only give me transportation allowance and that’s fine. I didn’t bother asking her cos I don’t want to burden her you know.

Then, I quit school cos my mom’s no longer able to help out even with the minimum units cos she’s also paying for my sister’s medication.

So, it’s been like idk 2-3 years and I’m working hard on a job that I hate because I can’t really finish my degree and need money to survive cos I live alone.

I really get jealous when people have it easier than I do. I mean, I know I’m still fortunate compared to others but I hate the fact that no matter how hard I work, opportunities rarely come and they have it so easy.

I hate that I’m not able to finish my degree because that kicked alot of options in my employment. I also wanted to go abroad but that’s not looking too bright now.

My thoughts are pretty messy right now tbh and I’m sorry. It’s just that I know that the world’s not fair and I still have it better than others (I repeat this to myself to somehow make me feel better but I still suck) but I feel like I’m stuck working here at this line of business, just moving through different companies, stagnant, and will continue to do so til I get old or give up and kill myself after my mom dies, you know.

My brother and I were never close growing up. As time has passed, we grew further and further apart. He reached out a few times over the years in hopes to mend that gap but has never come through any time that we have set up plans. Eventually, a few years ago, I let him know that I was done trying and we ended things there. It wasn't a great text between us.

Since then, he has reached out to me twice. I ignored both texts because I said all that needed to be said and ended contact. Also, he has a steady gf now and both texts included her so I feel he's trying to look good to her. So that is kind of making me wary.

A few weeks ago he finally cracked and told our parents I'm not talking to him. My dad then ambushed my husband, asking why and should he set up a meeting between my brother and I. My husband said it wasn't his business to talk about but forcing a meeting would be a terrible idea (it really would be).

604,"Sorry for the wall of text in advance. 

I'm renting a 2 bedroom with a housemate in the city center for 2000 a month - I pay 1200 for the master bedroom. Recently, due to the coronavirus, my housemate can't return to the country and forfeited her bedroom; she gave up her deposit but our lease still have 7 months to go before expiring. Fortunately, our lease term is flexible and we can give up on our lease and get our deposit back as long as we give advance notice.

I have a few options:

1st option is to look for another housemate who is willing to take over the remaining lease till end of the year. However we haven't had much luck because, coronavirus. Also, I know the rent is on the higher side which means only expats would seriously consider, but, because of corona, foreigners aren't even allowed to enter the country. I'll keep looking but I'm not optimistic.

2nd option: Pay for the whole apartment till the lease expires which means I'll hit the 30% threshold for rent and would definitely delay my goal of reaching 100k in savings for a few months. I can afford to without cramping my current lifestyle too much but it is quite a substantial increase in rent. 

3rd option: Move into a friend's apartment nearby for 900 a month on a short-term 6 month lease. The only problem is her pet pig. I'm just not a fan of pets cuz I've never grew up with one.

Additionally, due to the global situation, I'm hesitant to move and sign a new lease of a single bedroom apartment (which averages 1600 a month) in case I get retrenched in the next couple of months or if I were to end up moving back to my home country.

Basically, this whole coronavirus situation has turned everyone's lives into limbo and I can't see what's my next steps. I love everything about the apartment; it feels like a safe harbour and I'll hate to have to change it too along with all the other chaos going on now. Personally, I had plans to move back to my home country this year but again, I don't even know if I can find job back home anymore.

Is it a good idea to stay put and pay the extra rent till end of the year? Or should I just move and be prepared to forgo my deposit in a few months to save money?",30May2020,1
605,"I (f20's) and I'm a new relationship with a guy we can call V (30's). It's been a month so far.

V is a little quiet, but not in a shy way. Just sort of whatever about it. A bit awkward at times, but getting to know him he can be very funny, especially silly and makes great jokes. He is very kind to me and sweet and caring. I can tell he actually really likes me, and feel comfortable around him. 

But I'm getting some concerns, and am not sure how or if I should bring them up yet.

First concern is the not talking much. Half of the time I can get him talking a bit and we'll have a nice conversation about a movie or games or whatever. But the other half he will simply say things like ""you're so wonderful, you're so good to me"" compliments or it's just silence watching or listening to something together. This only bothers me because it feels like there is a barrier when trying to get to know him, if half the conversation is just compliments without any reason. I'm not sure what questions to ask or discussions to get going to get a better view of him as a person. 

Second concern is anger. He is a very gentle person and very quiet most of the time. Again not in a shy way, just sort of is quiet. But there have been 3 times I've seen him angry since we started dating.

The first time was a week and a half into us dating. We went to his apartment and ordered some door dash type delivery. When the driver arrived he didn't know what gate to meet us at. So we walk to the gate with the address in the instructions and he isn't there. V gets annoyed, not outright angry or anything, but you could feel him getting mad. So I decided to call the delivery driver to see where he is at, but thought V might know the location better, so I handed him my phone. V asked the driver where he was, and the driver may not have heard correctly, as he responded with something like ""yea I'm here for a delivery"". No big deal, just ask again right? Nope. V tossed my phone onto the ground in some grass. He got that annoyed that fast at something very minimal. This made me uncomfortable, so I picked up my phone and asked the guy a few questions til we eventually found him. On the walk back to the apartment I felt a bit uneasy and he apologized, saying he tried to toss it into the grass so it wouldn't break, and that he just got annoyed. I explained to him how this made me a bit uncomfortable, and that I get a bit freaked out by aggressive behavior. But I explained I also understand the annoyance at the driver obviously not hearing him right. Just didn't mention how silly it seemed to get so mad so quick.

Next instance was a week ago, we were at a vending machine and after he made his selection, the Machine spit out some change, but not all of it. As tho it had eaten his money. He got annoyed and tossed his change into the air by the machine. Wanting to keep him calm I just used my card, and when he went to get the snack, it seemed the one he chose did dispense originally, as 2 were there. I explained again, (not in a very serious time) how throwing things made me uncomfortable. And again I felt this was a silly thing to get so mad so fast over. 

Let me also state that both of these instances he had a blank expression. Not a look of anger just a blank face. 

The third time V got mad was yesterday, when his gps took us a weird way to get to a store. He was annoyed at first then after seeing where it was taking us, he slightly yelled an obscenity and punched his chair, VERY aggressively. Right after seemingly calming down, then taking the phone battery out to not have to hear his gps talking. Freaked me the FUCK OUT and I looked up the address but was very quiet and uncomfortable, which he could tell. He apologized briefly. I explained that I was very uncomfortable and he apologized again, saying he wasn't mad at me. And saying something like it probably doesn't look very good seeing him like that. I decided to look up the address on my phone and we got there fine. I eventually relaxed by the time we got to the store and told him I understand everyone has there issues. But reiterated that this kind of anger really makes me uncomfortable. 

Shopping went fine and we went home and cooked and everything was basically the same, but I couldn't shake this upset concerned feeling. Tried to keep it to myself tho, as part of me is a bit scared of him acting like that. He has not once hurt me or said anything rude or agressive to me, but I fear that if I end up making him mad, would he get like that with me? What if things didn't work out and we ended up breaking up? 

As silly as it might be, part of me worries he might hurt me, tho I don't have much to base that on. I'm going to continue to act like myself and if any physical harm did occur that would be the end of it for me. But having these thoughts and concerns this early on in the relationship worries me, as I do really like him and his company, and feel very comfortable around him most of the time. 

What I'm wondering is should I bring up these concerns? If not how long should I wait to bring them up? I want a healthy honest relationship, and want to work through this if it's a minor issue. I just don't know what would be best right now. Any advice on the situation would be appreciated.

Some background information as well, he works for a different company but in the same location as I do, so to avoid gossip and politics, no one at work knows about us. Not sure if that helps any.",30May2020,1
607,"In advance sorry for my English I'm not native speaker.

So basically hello, I'm 22 y/o male, I'm currently living a really weird stage of my life. 

Basically everything started going wrong when i graduated from high school(i didn't know that back then). I was 18 y/o and my dad gave me two options. First one was me going to serve in the army or second he paying for my studies but for the profession he wants me to go( It's like a private school where you can choose a profession you want to follow). At my young age my relationship with my father wasn't that good he was a strict father and always wanted things to be his way. So long story short i chose the second option as he wanted me to be a cook. I had not a single idea about cooking that wasn't my passion at all or i ever wished to be one, but for some reason i chose that one.(Since young age i was into computers just as a hobby)

So it took me 2 years of studies and I had to do my internship to graduate the institute. I had to leave to another place for that, another city away from where i use to live (my parents were there as well with me but we had to live in different places because i had to live closer to my work) That's where i first met my first depression i had to live with a complete stranger a random guy who was 6 or 7 years older than me in a single room. He was nasty he never clean after himself always had his clothes all over the room and i couldn't deal with that, i was literally crying almost every night. The thing is that at that point i didn't like the job I'm doing I didn't liked that I'm living with that guy and something that i never felt before, i was missing my parents so much.

So i lived through that graduated from my institute, started workings as a cook professionally still don't like my job, doing pretty well but hate it every second I'm in there.(working everyday for 6 months without day offs and the rest 6 months I'm just sitting home)

So now days with all that corona situation my work didn't start in time and got delayed. I started a new game, joined a guild and met that girl , she's literally what I was looking for, never met a girl that i like that much. We were talking everyday mostly about the game, figuring out things and all that, but someday out of nowhere she told me that she quitting the game and that she don't have enough time to play that anymore. She was trying herself in some professional team for another game. I was actually happy for her that she going towards her dream but a little upset about that because from no on we won't talk that much. And apparently it turned out that i was right about it, now we don't speak that much, we watching a stream together from time to time but most of the time she's busy with the team. 

After almost 3 months of staying home doing literally nothing but playing games and spending most of the time with her, now I'm here feeling like I'm loosing her, because now we only write few messages during the day and when we watching that stream together. She's usually online till really late at night and waking up late in the afternoon(we have 2 hours difference in time(I'm ahead)) but I'm still trying yo stay with her until late hours cause i like spending time with her even tho it's not that much.

I'm starting my work again soon so we won't have that much time to spend together (i will be working morning hours so i will have to sleep early) I feel like we already getting away from each other so me starting my work will probably end out friendship. The thing is that i started having feeling about her apparently she doesn't feel the same way about me. 

So now I'm here feeling shit, because I'm gonna lose her soon. I don't really wanna do anything with my life or go anywhere, don't wanna work. I don't hang out much with my irl friends because all of them are studing in other cities and never really had a close friend with who i can talk with or even trust my thoughts.",30May2020,1
608,"I will be using nicknames when talking about my friends. 

So basically, in my friend group there's this guy, we'll call him Voldemort. I've known Voldemort since the 4th grade (I'm going into 11th grade next year), and he's been a close friend of mine. 

Recently, Voldemort started dating this other girl in our friend group, Cinnamon, and at first he was super sweet and they were adorable together. But then the cracks started to show. Multiple times a week, Voldemort would make fun of, belittle, insult, and otherwise emotionally abuse Cinnamon, and I would be the one calming both of them down after Voldemort regretted his decisions an hour later. 

After a few months of dating, Voldemort and Cinnamon broke up. But then more cracks started to show. Voldemort got kicked out of the group because he insulted a different friend, Maple, by calling her a ""snowflake,"" and being otherwise sexist. He's been super toxic, sexist, racist, and an all-around bad person. 

All that was back in like January, but now we're thinking about letting him back into the group, but only on probation. He won't have certain privileges like he did before, and he can't be openly sexist, racist, or anything. 

I can't help but feel bad for him and care for him, no matter how bad of a person he is. Is it worth it to give him another chance if he wants to change?",30May2020,1

When you stop playing violin you'll start again from zero and i haven't touched it for two days. I want to learn more but I don't know if my mother can afford online lessons, she has too much on her plate now. I dont know if i should wait for this pandemic to end to start and learn again...when I'm practicing im getting frustrated because i dont even know if im in tune or my bowing is wrong or if im reading the notes correctly. I tried reading and watching some stuff on youtube but it's really not a thing for me and I really need someone to teach me. Violin is hard, it takes years so properly play it and the time i got now would be wasted if i stop.

615,"I just graduated from high school with excellence award (highest grades in class for 2 consecutive years) but I still think Im not ready for college. My classmates took entrance exams on more than one college school while I only took one entrance exam. It made me nervous so much that I didnt like talking about college and would try to avoid that topic as much as I can (without being rude ofc).

Since kindergarten I was used to small private schools. I transferred to different schools before but they were not as big as what college schools do. I guess you can call me socially awkward, but I get warmed up the more I spend time with the same people.

During my entrance exam, the size of the campus made me nervous to the point Im just heavy breathing but Im very glad I didnt back out and didnt alert anyone as Ive kept it hidden the whole time. Sad thing is, my mom suddenly refused me to go to that school because of protest/riot issues that might result to violence. Ive tried to convince her so many times, but she wont change her mind. I also told my father about this but he sided with mom on this one.

I am living with my mum, and I am essentially on time out after my first attempt at university lead to a suicide attempt (i had a lot of grief to deal with on top of existing mental health problems). I don't have any other health problems apart from severe depression and anxiety which Ive taken lots of different antidepressants etc for, currently im just on venlafaxine. I have bad insomnia and sometimes hypersomnia, so I will be in bed by 11pm,wont sleep until about 4am,and will then sleep until 3pm. Im still tired all day, and will often nap and my body will be so tired that ill lie down almost all day. Ive been working it out, and im lying down for at least 20 hours of the day. 


I feel so useless at the moment, i have weekly counselling but apart from that i dont do much. The only time i go out is running weekly errands like shopping, and walking my puppy once/twice a day, but currently its too hot to take him out much as he suffers in the heat. The rest of the time im lying down either playing video games or flicking through my phone. Sometimes I'll try and be productive and do art which i sell, making a writing portfolio online, or learning stuff like driving or coding. The trouble is, im almost always lying down and i get mentally worn out after half an hour. Ive tried at least sitting up doing these things, but im so tired and can feel myself being drawn to lying down like a magnet. I'll try and get out my bedroom, but i just end up lying on the sofa or retreating. I also try to do some weight lifting but i usually get worn out after 15 mins. Ive tried baking, but im currently on about 1200 cal a day to lose weight, and im assuming my BMR is like 1600 a day currently.

631,"It's a big decision, and I've been struggling with it for well over a year, nearly two.

I moved to a new country to get married many years ago. We worked hard in a city and eventually moved to a small rural town when my wife took early retirement.

My wife apparently has narcissistic personality disorder (I have a psychotherapist friend who is convinced) and has become more and more abusive (emotionally) over the last few years.

This has had a massive effect on our relationship and we effectively life separate lives - very rare contact and any conversation beyond household things makes me regret opening my mouth.

My career field doesn't exist out here, so I work part time in an unfulfilling role. My wife's retirement is the main income and all debts were paid before we moved here. Needless to say, I am bored out of my mind.

My family back home are getting older, and I lost a dear relative recently. We rarely visit because my wife isn't into it and of course it is expensive.

We live in a beautiful place, but I feel very isolated, and it's increasingly difficult to relate to locals.

We went on a rare visit before the virus hit, and I miss home so much I can feel it. Despite my time here, home is where I feel I belong.

I am scared of making a mistake. I have planned a return 'home' as much as I can - on paper. I don't know if I'll be able to find good work again, or if I'll be sitting in an awful apartment wishing I had stayed. Right now I feel like I've outgrown this place.

635,"You know how when people fall in love, after a couple of years, the very things that they used to love about them turn them off completely?

Well that’s me but it happens within weeks.

Now, the problem is that when I do find myself attracted to someone, I really find myself being attracted to little things about them like the way they speak, how passionate they are about what they like to speak about, how creative they are, how childish they are, how humble they are. I love these things for a few weeks. Then we become romantic. And then I can’t STAND these qualities about them anymore.

My most recent “person” is, unfortunately, somewhat of a work colleague... He’s very spiritual, animated, young at heart and had good energy and presence. There’s nothing happening between us anymore, but now when I look at him, I can’t help but think about how ANNOYING he is. He lacks common sense because of his childishness, he thinks with his heart so he thinks without logic, he’s passionate about things but the passion is so overwhelming sometimes. I avoid conversing with him because everything about him just makes me cringe and I just can’t stand it. But why did I love these things about him a couple months ago? He looks at me as though there’s still something there between us, but all I want is for him to disappear completely because he gets on my nerves. And he’s never even done anything wrong to me...

This thing only happens after I get romantic with someone. I could he friends with someone for years, but the minute that a label is slapped onto the relationship, I become annoyed with everything about that person that once made my stomach flutter. Although being in a relationship isn’t very important to me right now, I’m scared that I’m just going to keep hurting people I end up with and that I’ll never be satisfied with anyone I find.

I love my sister and would do anything to support her and my dad obviously has a huge soft spot for her, what father wouldn't for his only daughter.  But with the coronavirus and her traveling through two airports minimum I'm worried for the health and safety for myself and more importantly my dad and his brother who happens to be living with us at this time.  My dad is 66 and has a history of heart issues and his brother 72 so they are both at risk from catching Covid-19 more so than me (26) or my brother (29).  Like I said, I love my sister and I think this is a difficult time for her but I'm so worried about her and her kids going through airports and catching the corona virus and bringing it here.  Apparently she has already bought tickets for her and her kids and is planning on coming down here in 3 weeks.  I've talked to my dad extensively about it and my concerns but he wants to be there to support his daughter, which i get, and is sort of brushing aside any concerns for his health. So I'm unsure what to do.  I've told my dad if she bought the tickets than we can repay her the costs for the tickets because I'd rather do that than have her come down and risk getting us infected.  Another option would be to leave my house while she visited and stay with my old roommates - not ideal but they've been social distancing and haven't left their house in a couple months and at least they're only down the road and not coming from a couple states away.  So yea I'm unsure and would like any advice on how to handle this situation.  Thanks in advance!",30May2020,1
638,"I'm a teenager. I don't do my homework on time. I spend alot of time on video games. I lie sometimes. Isn't this normal? I understand that I need to be scolded and stuff but my parents are on a whole new level. I'm 14 and just because I don't study extra DURING SUMMER and ON TOP OF TUITIONS. When I don't do some homework or play a video game for a little longer they shout at me and then guilt me by saying ""we give u access to all these devices and u still don't work hard"" or ""if u don't study ur life will be ruined"" or ""ur so irresponsible...u can't do stuff like this, we only ask u to study that's it"".

639,so im a gamer. younger me was always a gamer and he always leaned toward the tv or computer when playing a game. unfortunately know im a fat 5'5 even though i am 5'7 because my neck is at a huge angle by default. i would way about 120-130 degrees. my shoulders also slouch a lot and i have pretty big shoulders so people pretty much see that immediately. any idea how to fix my posture?,30May2020,1
640,"When I was around 10-11 idk I had a pretty bloody eyelid injury, the skin of my left eyelid was chafed and it became swollen, like any injury. The thing is though, I feel like a bit of the flabbiness still hasn’t left and never will. This is why I think my left eye is so small compared to my right in photos. It really crushes me whenever I notice this in pictures and idk what to do. I’m 16 now. It leaves my face looking uneven and tilted I feel like. Plus I got i a big nose send help lol.",30May2020,1
641,"So I'm 99% sure I have a UTI right now, and the most common reason for those is sex. Which happened days before. I know I have to go to a doctor since I'm feeling worse, but I may have to tell my mom.

She might ask at home(if I had sex), or the doctor will ask me with her possibly in the room since my doctor NEVER asks her to leave :(

But I just really need advice on what to say because I know other people have had to admit this to their parent before. Previous conversations we've had lead me to believe she does not like sex and she thinks it's bad for teens.... so I don't want her to hate me or not trust me and never let me see my boyfriend/ friends again. Unfortunately I told her I was going on a run the day I saw my boyfriend, so I lied to her.",30May2020,1

By the end of the argument, I acquiesced to their viewpoint and my ego isn't allowing me to let it go. I don't want to back down on my beliefs so quickly like this ever again, and I want to move on from what's already been said and done, but my ego won't let me do so. 

It's been distracting me this whole day, just lurking at the back of my head. I could really appreciate some words of wisdom right now.",30May2020,1

645,"(M16) Hey again, so yesterday I went out with my father, and we were trying to figure out how to drive the manual car, and it went way better than I thought! I was banging gears like a race car driver for a good 10 minutes, until I stripped a gear, then burnt the clutch. I feel like a failure now, and I had a panic attack in the car. (We were in an empty parking lot) Now I’m afraid of the car, and considering selling it. What hurts so much, is that I had so much fun driving it, before I messed up the transmission. I don’t know what to do now.",30May2020,1

Can someone give me some advice on a good area in and around Winona? I have been looking in surrounding towns, including some in Wisconsin. I’m looking for a clean, one-bedroom that has had some updating. No pets. Would like to stay under $1000 per month, but that’s negotiable. LaCross and Onalaska, WI seem nice. But, because I may do some working from home, and I’m kind of past my college days, I would prefer to be in a complex/area that does not primarily house college-age students...no offense!

648,"Long story short, my ex broke up with me 3 years ago and since then keeps texting me from time to time, even if my he has a girlfriend. I really don't like it because the current girlfriend thinks that I am the one that wants a relationship (of any kind) again and wants to beat me up. A few days ago he texted me about some stupid things that sounded weird (he is a junkie) and I got super mad so I sent him memes in response to a very long message and in the end he got mad that I called him a simp (even if I did not?)
I wanted an advice on what should I do if he texts again. He is toxic and manipulative and makes you feel sorry that he is a junkie and does not think straight (being high all the time)
Should I block him or should I make fun of him and become a meanie?

650,"Me and my girlfriend have been happily dating now for over a year now and things are good but there’s still something that I feel uncomfortable with. Before we were together, when she was only 13, she had sex with a 20 year old man. Under the law, even though she said she was fine with it, that’s still rape I’m pretty sure. It was only once and within a few days he cut her off suddenly and it ended there.

I never liked saying anything because I thought it would just come across as jealousy or something like that. But realistically, rape of a minor is a serious offence and from what I’ve gathered, he’s done this before and may well have done similar things since. My girlfriend says that it’s fine and she was ok with it but still I’m not sure. 

Should I be concerned or am I overthinking this and what should I do? Thanks in advance",30May2020,1
651,"\*this is not for me, it's for my boyfriend.

I need advice on how to help him relax or resources he can look at because he said that he doesn't know how to anymore. He used to play video games but because he lacks the immersion he used to have (we have a daughter and whether we're in the room with him or not he said he just can't immerse himself anymore) and a lot of games he used to play just make him frustrated because they're competitive.

I try to help him with massage which he said does help, but he's so constantly overwhelmed as I recently started work, so now he's working from home and taking care of our daughter and also trying to take care of the house while I'm gone. I feel bad because he tells me there's no way that I can help, as I already do what I can with taking care of our daughter as soon as I get home, covering him for naps and the like. He's getting a bit distant with me because he's constantly trying to relax, which means he's off on his own trying to do his own thing. 

I'm just not sure what I can do. And he's not sure what to do because he said video games were the only way he could relax before. He still plays every day and I give him the time to do it on his own, but it doesn't work for him anymore. If it matters, I'm 27 and he's 28 and our daughter is 1. I'm concerned because I'm also pregnant with our second child (was not intentional, just happened) and I want him to have some better methods of relaxation beforehand because he's so stressed all of the time and I know it will be worse once I have this second child. Please help.",30May2020,1
652,"I need guidance on what I should do.

So, back in end of 2018 I met a guy online.  Things never   went anywhere.  He ended up cancelling a date then ghosting.  We still remained friends on social media. From time to time that we'd share a Hi how are you.   Around March of this year he reached out During the time I was ending things with my boyfriend, now ex.   Long story short this guy, we'll call him JB,  expressed how when he ghosted he was going through a lot and and constantly thought about me constantly spoke to his friends about me and really wanted to get to know me more and revisit the idea of us dating.   I was open to the idea because my relationship was already bad since months prior so emotionally I wasn't stuck on my ex.  For about a month we'd talk daily, video chat daily and he'd express how much he liked me and wanted to see me and you know also were going through this quarantine.  JB ends up coming over and yeah we enjoy each other's company and for about another few weeks we'd alternate I'd be in a Jersey for one week and he'd come to New York the next week.   I found myself really developing love for him liking him a lot and falling hard. JB already started with the I love you and always expressing how much he felt like we needed to  be together.   He was is sort of a complete gentleman I've never felt to so important so loved so cared about. He made new feel really good he made me feel like I was important.  Now we all have flaws, I'm not gonna lie I'm someone sometimes show clingyness or not so much clingy this but not understanding why when I go back home he wouldn't you know call me as much or text me or even respond so I would call him out on his BS and demand why he wasn't responding and what not.  But the main issue was he seemed insecure.   He'd always accuse me of still talking to my ex or sleeping with men whenever I go back home.  I even found out that he hot my phone and went through my private text with my ex and just looking through all of my social media all of my personal information.   He did not trust me because of what he claims his pass experience with his exes cheating on him and not being faithful.   I found myself wanting to be trusted by him just so I can you know seem worthy enough for him.  So I've literally like gave him phone password told him he could check anything he wants because I have nothing to hide.  Now JB always got drunk because he liked to drink and so the talks about my ex the talks about sleeping with multiple different men the talks about not trusting me always came up when he was drunk.   And I always found myself having to constantly prove to him that I wasn't doing anything having to constantly help him with his emotions when he was drunk and try hard to make him feel better.   Now fast forward to the night before Cinco de Mayo,   I was in Queens with my sister running some errands and he was home already started drinking, drank through a whole bottle of Jameson and kept calling me and telling me how much he loves me and he misses me and to come back home and all of that.   My sister dropped me back off at JB's house and um I brought back with me food for us to make for cinco DE Mayo all that jazz.   He still pissed drunk and next thing you know he starts bringing up my ex and the not trusting me and all of that we get into a verbal argument and things are just heated.   I'm crying because he saying hurtful things hes not really caring plus is still drunk and we just decide to give each other space and he goes and sits in the living Room and I decide to just cool off and take a shower.   After I get out the shower hes asking me if you can come in the bathroom to talk while I get ready.  He comes in and then hes just insisting to dry me off and you know I'm telling him no you know I just need to get ready on my own and hes not getting it because he is still pissed drunk.   He answer up telling me to get out the bathroom because I screamed at him to stop touching me.  I calmly walk out and I go to the room and get dressed.  Next thing you know hes telling me that he feels unsafe with me in his house because I am being quiet and I have nothing to say. JB then continues to say that he feels that I will get him killed by police.  He had an incident a week prior regarding his  racist  neighbors calling the cops on him for noise and the cops barging through his door with guns drawn.  I figure hes still drunk and is mind is just going out of control that's why he saying all these hurtful things. I'm a black woman I would never do anything to get another black man killed by a police.  Some time passes and next thing you know he is telling me he thinks I should go home because I making him feel unsafe.  In my mind I'm still crying I'm still trying to get him to realize that I'll never hurt him get him to trust me and I'm pleading with them asking him why is he doing all of this.  He takes my duffel bag and all the food that I came with and put their my right at his door. I'm sitting on the couch baffled not knowing what to do and he goes in his room.   He then comes out and tells me I'm currently being recorded. I ask him if I'm being voice recorded right now in the living Room and he says yes.  I asked him why and he says it's because hes afraid that I'll change the narrative and end up calling police and end up getting him shot and killed by police because I like to lie and change the narrative and gaslight him.   I walk away and go in the Room and he has his ipad currently video recording me. He then tells me that he has his friends watching and if anything happens they will put everything on social media.  I'm still confused still not understanding what's going on and I'm trying to talk to him and we end up going back into the living Room.  This whole time he is still drunk why? because he drank an entire 150 ML bottle of Jameson.   He then starts ignoring me and still taking all my things and putting them by the door and I'm still crying then he turns all the lights off on me while I'm in the living Room and slams the door to the living Room  in my face and goes in his Room in closes the door.  I just sat there in the dark in his living Room crying from 10:30 p.m. to about 1:00 a.m..

653,I was going to go to police academy this coming fall because I’ve always wanted to be a police officer so I could help people &amp; make sure no one that lays a hand on someone or animal in evil intentions will be able do it again... but with recent events happening in this world I’m seriously scared to go through with it. I’m too scared to be a cop now. I’m scared that even if I try to do good someone will attack me for just wearing a badge. Reason the fear is real right now is I’m also a volunteer firefighter &amp; an EMT &amp; I got 6 texts this morning saying someone attacked our firehouse breaking windows &amp; spray painting die pig supporters on the doors &amp; trucks.

655,"Throwaway.

I'm thinking about leaving my hometown. I've grown to love this town but there are multiple reasons for why I want to leave.

First, my parents are Christians while I'm agnostic, leaning on athiest. I have not come out to them yet, and won't be ready to anytime soon. I feel that to live my life in a way that makes me happy, I need to put distance between us, or I fear they'll just be breathing down my neck all the time and I'd have to go out of my way to hide a lot of things from them like I already do. Second, for the field I'm pursuing, there aren't many opportunities in my hometown, and all of the positions I want are elsewhere. I felt that to advance my career, I would have to leave this town in a few years anyway but I didn't think that it would be so soon.

I'm very lost on if I should do this and how to proceed. I don't have any out of town friends which will make things harder if I do decide to move (and I know that it will already be hard), and last time I expressed interest in moving to another town, my parents sounded baffled as to why I would want to leave.",30May2020,1
656,"My boyfriend has pretty bad OCD, mostly around being a ""good person"". He feels excessive guilt for fairly normal things, especially weird porn he watched/read as a young teen (nothing illegal just cringey or strange and boys I was friends with at that age did most if it too). He confessed his guilt for trying to find images of naked girls aged 12-14 when he was 13. This was a once off as he never found anything on Google and quickly realised it was illegal. However, he feels guilty that somehow he checked something younger than this even though he does not remember this. He just feels so scared that he could've looked up younger, maybe even 5 years younger or something and forgotten it as he might have merely typed it in and not really tried or was so guilty he managed to block it from his memory

After he freaked out one evening, he told me the next day that he is 99% sure he never looked below 11, as he clearly only remembers 12-14 happening and he never noticed girls more than  year younger back then, so why would he? He still has that 1% and doesn't want to promise he didn't go below 11 as it's too scary because what if he suddenly realises he did one day? He has said before about various memories  ""I think X thing happened when I was 14"" before only to realise in a calmer state a few days later  ""no actually X never happened, I just panicked because it was possible i could have but I have no actual memory of it and realistically I would have"".",30May2020,1

I end up falling asleep and he gets up at around 2:00 a.m. and directs me to the Room to sleep on the bed. I believe the iPad was still video recording. I lay down and hes holding me talking about how he hates that he keeps disappointing me. However he never apologized. 

I tried to talk with him the next morning however he someone who's very stubborn very prideful and won't own up to things that he did especially if it's something bad that he did. I ended up going home and things were quiet for a few days. 

We talked for a week after that but JB never brought up what happened. I ended up making the decision to just not engage with him anymore. I'm pretty sure he was still talking to other women So he never really reached out to me that much.

Ever since what happened I've been real hurt and just in pain When I think back on it. I really want to text him and tell him how much of a bad person he is and how much he hurt me with what happened and I don't think I'll ever forgive him. 

I'm more so stuck on him just switching off all the lights on me and slamming all his doors and leaving me in the dark. That moment just left me feeling so humiliated. 

And I wanna let him know how that made me feel and that I will never forgive him and that he is the most evilest person in the world.

659,"Ever since I was a little kid I have gotten extremely anxious at family gatherings with my extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc.) I’ve always felt very guilty about this because most people can easily relax around their families without thinking about it. I feel weird getting anxious over seeing people I’m supposed to feel close to. 

I’m totally fine around my immediate family, but when it comes to extended family I feel very uncomfortable and out of place. I don’t have any cousins my age (I’m an 18 year old female), so me and my sister are left to fend for ourselves at family events, and we’re usually left in a corner the whole time with no one to talk to. 

I have never had a bad experience with my extended family, so I’m not exactly sure where my anxiety stems from. They have been extremely nice to me throughout my life, but I can’t help feeling extremely nervous around them. I can’t be my true self.

I think one of the reasons I get anxious is because my Mom tends to change her persona when we go to family events. She tends to put on a show and put up a glamorous front, and I think that somehow makes me even more uncomfortable because she is being so disingenuous. They also tend to question me a lot because I’m the oldest grandchild, and I feel like I have to show up with a script to paint an image of the perfect granddaughter. 

I have also had experiences with Aunts judging me in the past, so I feel a tad insecure around them in terms of my appearance, personality, and life choices. 

I don’t want to feel this way! I want to have positive experiences with my family and I want to feel comfortable, but I literally dread going to holidays/events due to my anxiety. I have never had a fun Christmas or a relaxing thanksgiving due to my fears. Does anyone else experience something similar? How can I overcome this anxiety? How can I become closer to my family and not resent them due to my stress?",30May2020,1

661,"My (22F) roommate (22F) is an alcoholic and she’s too much to handle. This weekend after a trip with her and my friends I got so mad, which I never do, and I decided I’m going to do everything I can to move out. I’ve never been in a situation like this. I’ve tried to help her and take care of her and even just ignore her. She’s a slob and uses all of my stuff without asking.

So, he broke up with me 3 years ago and went back with his ex. For some weird reason,he kept texting me to the point where I decided to delete Tumblr, Reddit, block him on Instagram and even delete Facebook, even if he was not the only reason. Sadly, I needed a Facebook account to participate in a contest so I made one. He found it and kept texting me again, but we are not even friends on that social media. I don't know how he found it. I thought that he forgot about me, so I did not thought to block him when I created it (the second account). He is toxic and manipulative and for a very long time he made me feel like a piece of shit. He is also a drug addict. A few weeks ago he sent me a long text about our souls not being ours and so on. I was angry and he started saying how I should be loved and stuff at the end of the message, so I sent him memes and he got offended because I called him a simp (even if I did not, just sent memes).
Should I speak to him to leave me alone (even if I already did, nicely and not so nicely) or to block him on this account as well? I did moved on and at some point found it funny, but he kept saying sexual stuff, so that was a big 'no'. To be honest, I am even scared that he found this account on Reddit and is preparing another cringy text while high.

665,"Throwaway account, hence the Reddit generated username.

I just graduated from high school. Someone I know from school, let's call her Jenna, has a jewelry business.  She sells crystals and wire-wrapped jewelry (your typical hippie business).  I've had a few classes with her, and we've talked some, but I'd say we are just acquaintances.

I reached out to her back in January.  I used to make jewelry myself, and I have a bunch of leftover supplies, probably totaling up to $300 in value.  I asked if she wanted some beads, and she said yes.  We met up at a local park, she took at look at some of the beads I had, and bought what she wanted at a VERY discounted price from me.

Fast forward to the beginning of March.  I follow Jenna's jewelry page.  She sells primarily through Instagram.  She doesn't use an eCommerce platform like Etsy or Shopify.  You have to send her a direct message, Venmo her the cash, and wait for your item to arrive.  I probably shouldn't have purchased something in this manner, but she has over 2,000 Instagram followers and is pretty well-established as a seller.  So I figured she would follow through. She posted some rings that I liked and I ordered one.

I also told her that while I was cleaning up, I found more jewelry supplies.  It was really nice stuff, like emerald beads, and I would give her the same discount.  She said that she was definitely interested in buying some more.  We agreed to meet up again and she said she would bring the ring.

We meet up in early March, before coronavirus became a real issue. She said she had forgotten the ring at home, and that she was really sorry.  She told me she didn't have enough money to buy all the beads at once, so she bought half of them and asked if we could meet up again later so she could buy the rest. She said she would bring the ring then.

I charged her $20 for the items she bought. When she was putting it in Venmo, she said, ""Oh, I'll go ahead and take the cost of the ring out and give you $14."" Fine by me.  I was going to have to pay for it at some point.

Fast forward to mid-April.  I realized I had never gotten the ring, and that with the virus situation, meeting up might not be a good idea.  I messaged her on Instagram and said she could ship the ring to me and I'd pay her for the shipping.

She took a few days to respond, but came back with this: ""I'm actually fine with meeting up if that's okay with you! I'd like to buy more beads!!""

I said sure, because I didn't mind meeting up either.  We could wear masks and gloves.  Then I asked when she was available.  No response for several days.

When she finally responded she said, ""Hey bb! Sorry, when are you available?""

I told her when.  No response for a while.  Then she said, ""Hey I can meet up this week if that's okay! What days work for you?""

I answered her.  No response for two weeks.  I double and triple messaged her.  I finally decided to just Snapchat her, since using her business contacts wasn't working.

She responded: ""Hey girl, I saw your message but I've just been so busy! I definitely want to meet up, when are you free?""

I said: ""Tomorrow, Tuesday, or Wednesday.""

She  responded: ""Tomorrow might just work! Is it okay if I text you an hour or two before we meet?""

I said: ""That's fine! See you then.""

That was one week ago.  No response at all.  I ordered the ring at the beginning of March and paid for it, and here it is almost June.  I know the ring is only $6, but I'm a broke college student trying to save for a car, and that could buy me a meal. I'm also just irritated that she's making off with my money, no matter how much it was.

How should I handle the situation? Should I be more firm? I'm trying not to burn any bridges, but this is getting really annoying. I can't tell if I'm getting scammed or if she is just busy and scatterbrained.  Or maybe she has something against me from school?

TLDR: I purchased a ring from an acquaintance from school. She doesn't respond to my messages for weeks, and when she does respond, she never follows through with meeting up.",30May2020,1
666,"Ever since the whole covid shit started and college got canceled, so like March 13, I’ve been stuck living back with my parents in a town where I know nobody. I mean in the 2+ months since that day, I’ve hung out with someone ONCE, and it was with my brother cuz it was our old coworker. I’m so sick of my family and I’m so socially deprived and lonely. But I have no friends here. I only lived here for 2 years, and for 1.5 of those years I dated the same girl. This meant I didn’t spend a lot of my time meeting other people before graduating high school and leaving. 

At one point I had 3 best friends here. One of them turned out to be a crazy liar, other one tried to get with my ex while I was with her, and the last one (who was my ROOMMATE in COLLEGE as well!!!) just ghosted me and blocked me after getting a girlfriend 8 hours away and moving to be with her.

667,"I’m not sure really how to even say all this because it’s so random but I’m still upset about all of this and don’t know what to do. 

Some context: I live in a very strict Christian household where any music that isn’t gospel music is considered “evil” by my dad. With my mom it’s a bit more lenient, but my dad? No exceptions. He even once threatened to throw away my Coldplay T-shirt which had the X&amp;Y cover on it because he thought it was some sort of “satanic imagery.” It isn’t just music though. I’ve had to hide books, movies, literally anything that he would deem “evil” even when it’s not. 

Yesterday I bought a cassette of Led Zeppelin II, and I had already owned the Eagles cassette as it belonged to my grandparents (my dad’s parents btw). I absolutely love the cassettes and was listening to them last night. I decide though that I’m going to go to bed, so I put them on top of the record/cassette player and head to bed. 

Wake up this morning only to find that their gone. I ask around my family in hopes that they were just moved, but my dad beats me to it telling me to sit down. He immediately starts throwing scripture at me explaining how I’m basically evil for listening to this music. He tells me he’s thrown out the cassettes and wants to go through ALL my other stuff to get rid of anything else that might be “causing problems.”

I’m upset because 1. it’s MY stuff that I bought with MY money 2. its ridiculous how out of proportion this has all gotten and 3. I fell like I’m being shamed for something that’s not even a big deal. I know plenty of other Christians who listen to that type of music. Hell, my own uncle is a pastor and he loves Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.

I’m just upset but I don’t know what to do. He’s saying that tomorrow we’re going to go through everything and basically “cleanse” my room. Is there anything I can say to change his mind? Is it even worth fighting?",30May2020,1

so, lately, probably like 2 months already

shit's been heated up

like everyday, fighting

&amp;#x200B;

im 18 btw, M;

&amp;#x200B;

the main reason, at least at the moment, and for the last months, has been my self image.

yeah, i feel ugly

and when i feel ugly, i really dont feel like talking to them

and basically, obviously, they get frustrated asf

sometimes, when they come in my room, and since i feel the way i feel i even like hide my face, or just look away. and obviously they think that im being rude. 

sometimes, i even feel hatred towards them cause they made me.

and basically it causes some serious confrontations

like almost everyday

i swear

really heavy

&amp;#x200B;

honestly, my self image wasn't bad before

but then i came across this forum [looksmax.me](https://looksmax.me) (yall can basically look it up; what its about)

and it has warped my mind COMPLETELY

like, it has changed my perception of everything

tho, i do try to stay away from it, in the weirdest way possible, its addicting. so its hard.

but im doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

also, i have this habit of recording myself, like 100 times a day. just to see how i look, to get more of a realistic image of myself. and....

its addicting as well, and yall know why?

like, i dont know why, but sometimes i look hella good and it gives me so much pleasure mentally, that i want to do it again.

tho, obviously, i have times when its the opposite and i feel like a genetic trash, hideous, subhuman. and it works against me. and its the main reason why i feel ugly honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so, as an advice, i would really not like to hear yall saying: ""oh, you are perfect just the way you are""; parents still love you despite that; and shit like that

no, i actually need an advice on how to deal with those emotions. cuz its really hard to control them. like really hard.",30May2020,1

675,"Long time creeper, first time poster! Help!! My girlfriend wants us to live with her mom forever. - A U-Haul Lesbian


Hi. :) I’m not sure if you are intrigued or humored by my tite but we’re both here for something right? 
Here it goes!! 

So here is a brief backstory. My girlfriend and I are 27yrs old. We meant online when we were 17. (Before TikTok made it cool lol.) I moved across the country from Maryland to Oregon to be with her at 22. The years that came between I visited her as often as I could.. We decided It would be best if I moved to be with her because she just started her career as a police officer and I wanted to get out of my dead end town.  The plan was for me to find a roommate and we would go from there. 

Long story short my roommate fell through and I moved in with her and her mom. We didn’t get along at first exactly (both being Leos with strong personalities) she spent a lot of time criticizing me. I just wanted to be on my best behavior. I was a guest in someone else’s home and it was my first time leaving mine. 
Flash forward to that wearing off in the course of the 5yrs I’ve lived here, Although comfortable I still feel like a guest.  

Here is where it gets complicated.. My girlfriends mom is  HIV positive- she’s very healthy and you would never be able to tell, not that it matters or I need to explain.  I just want everyone aware of the situation that I’m asking advice on. Part of me moving here was because I didn’t want to take any time away she had with her mom and the other was wanderlust.  Her mom and I get along very well and she truly has been a mom to me. ( mine is a narcissist) We hang out, discuss new/big ideas and she even taught me how to make “the sauce”. (Yes they’re Italian, and yes I’ve considering this part of the issue lol) 

Her mom is single and still dating.. In the time I’ve lived here she has dated 4 guys and moved 3 of them in. (Her go to type is a guy who needs saved or fixed) When I first moved in they were renting a 3 bedroom I lived there for 4 months before the first guy, he lasted for a month. The next one came shortly after and lasted 3yrs. At this point we agreed to move to a bigger house. (A 5br w/pool we turned the game room into a second master for her) At the time we moved I didn’t have my driver’s license and I really wasn’t in position to challenge our living situation. I was just happy to be with my girlfriend finally and grateful for both of their support. 
Eventually her and the guy breakup only after I live through 3 yrs of his 3 kids coming every weekend and his mom moving in for a year from Ohio. He was a super cool guy but ultimately he grew tired of her trying to change him and we grew tired of the baggage that came with him.  

So at this point in my story the owners of the house we are living in wanted to short sell and gave us a month to buy or move.  We bought. Gven the situation we couldn’t find the space we needed in such short notice. Her mom is a realtor and was able to use the commission of the sale on the purchase ( we wouldn’t have been able to afford it otherwise.)Currently we have owned the house for almost a year and been making some small renovations. Everything we paint, change, or throw out is a three part discussion. If I like red and her mom likes blue it immediately puts my girlfriend in position to make a final choice. 
It has become so incredibly frustrating and my feelings just keep getting stronger. 

I know I need to talk to her but I don’t want to give her a bag of weights with no where to put them. I know it’s a lot to ask of her. For awhile her mom was financially dependent on her which is why I never pushed the issue but she’s very healthy and making decent money with a business she started.  This is pretty much  the first window I’ve had to entertain the idea of it just being us.. I love her and appreciate her so much but I need my own space beyond our bedroom.

678,"I work at a local Marshalls part-time (in Canada).

The store managers said they would be abiding by rules given to them, and that we were to follow suit (obviously). Anyway, part of the guidelines is regarding the fitting rooms; when customers try on clothes, we put them on these organized racks, and typically, we would put the clothes back on the floor. This time, we are supposed to let the racks get full, put them in the backroom, wait for 24 hours, and then release them back on the floor.

The second day I got back to work (after we were allowed to resume working in our province), I saw the store co-ordinator bringing the clothes from the fitting room, and onto the floor. But she wasn't bringing the actual rack out onto the floor, and putting the clothes back. She was taking the clothes by hand, and putting it back on the floor (so customers won't notice that they are actually taking the clothes right after people try them on, and putting them on the floor). I asked her, ""What's going on? Are we putting the clothes right out, after customers try them on?"". She basically told me yes, and to continue it.

This wasn't sitting right with me. Apparently they'd been doing this from the start. They were originally putting some in the warehouse, but they didn't even wait 24 hours. Now it's even worse, they're not even putting the clothes back in the warehouse.

I went to my managers and explained the mixed messages I am getting on what to do with the clothes. She laughed, and asked another manager to clarify. This other manager looked rather annoyed, and like she didn't want to say what she said. She told me to put them in the warehouse. I was relieved. But as I walked away, they laughed, and seemed bothered by my concern. They definitely were aware that the clothes weren't being brought into the warehouse, and actually being put back on the floor, as the store co-ordinator and others, were doing just that.

Another thing. We get our temperatures checked in the morning. I went in the other day, and got it checked. Usually they'll tell you what your temperature is. This time, they didn't. I asked, ""what's my temperature?"". The manager said, ""Oh, uhh....32 [degrees celsius]"". I was surprised, that didn't seem right. Then a co-worker said to the manager, ""it's just not working today, huh?"". And the manager said ""yeah, everyone is 32 today"" and laughed.

These are just some of the issues I have since coming back. There are actually more problems that exist within these stores, not just regarding the guidelines, but even pre-pandemic; the policies that are outlined are different to what the managers actually do, say, etc.

I do want to get out of here as soon as possible. For now, I need the money, but please, if you're thinking of working in these store-chains, such as Marshalls, Winners, TJ Maxx, etc., please give it some second thoughts. You will be over-worked, the pay isn't great, and it's just not worth it.

679,"I (27M) have a younger brother (20). We are from India. He’s a good kid and was really good at math.

He’s failing almost every exam and he just doesn’t give a flying f about his studies. He sleeps throughout the day. He’s on his phone or Netflix or gaming almost all the time.

My problem is that I just feel uncomfortable with how things ended.

I’m sorry for my part in things and in the toxicness of everything between us. I’m sorry about how things ended although I’m not sure there was any other way it could have. I’m not sorry that things did end, I want to grow as a person and it’s impossible to grow when something is keeping you in the past and being in that cycle of hurt that we were in was not healthy for either of us. We both deserve time to heal in whatever way is best for us and I do hope that you’ve been doing alright. I’m not sorry about how I view our past, even if you disagree there really is no black and white to what happened. Everything was very grey on both our ends and I’m honestly still confused about so much but I’m done looking for answers with that. And I’m also not going to invalidate your perspective on things because if that’s really what you believe and how you perceived everything then that’s valid however my perspective is valid as well. I do regret some things and other things I don’t regret at all but ultimately I do think that this experience, as painful as it was, was important to have. I don’t like leaving things on a bad note, it just doesn’t sit right with me because I think that no matter how ugly our situation may have been there was a lot of beauty in it too, and I want to learn from the bad times to grow but also be able to cherish the good times. I don’t think you’re a bad person at all, I don’t see you as the bad guy and I genuinely don’t see myself as the only victim either. This message isn’t meant to fix things or reconnect with you, I still think it’s best if we stay out of each other’s lives for both our sakes. However, I just believe that it’s better to end things on a good note and from a more objective perspective instead of ending things with anger. Especially because you are someone who I cared deeply about as a friend and even through the bad times that caring was always there so to me that’s what was really important, more than the fights. I think my big takeaway from everything with us is that love and caring is not all that matters in any kind of relationship because you can have both of those and there can be a million other reasons that things don’t work out work out so you shouldn’t stay in something that isn’t working just because you care. You seem happy and I’m genuinely happy for you, I wish you the best in life and I also wish you good luck on college. It’ll be an exciting new chapter of your life and I know you will experience it to the fullest. Also don’t feel the need to respond to this, I just needed to give a better goodbye that was true to my feelings.

685,"Its like most women i see around my age i just dream of having sex with them and i hate having these thoughts because deep down i know its wrong. 

I also wish that i wasnt attracted to petite,Slim women because i will most likely never get one (which makes me even more fustrated). I do get approached by women but they are overweight and i just couldnt have sex with a overweight chick 

But its not only sex, I want that intimacy as well and to be able to just walk around or go out to a bar/restaurant with a good looking woman. 

I wouldnt say that im ugly in fact i have had women compliment me quiet a bit. 

I did however punch a guy in the face at a bar a few months back because while i was speaking to this woman who i found attractive he jumped in and i felt like he was trying to take whats mine. 

The dude walked away with a bloody nose (i think i broke his nose) and i actually got kicked out of the bar that night 

This dude didnt know her btw but i felt like she was losing interest in me when he jumped in

At the end of the day he knew that i was talking to her first so he shouldnt of jumped in. If i seen a guy talking to a girl who i liked i would never jump in and take whats his in fact i wish him all the best

Im not a bad person at all but i think im like this way because i spent years being lonely, depressed, having bad social anxiety, having no friends, being bullied ect

I actually felt like i was doing a good job for once and i thought that i was going to hit it off with her. She was my type physically and she could also have a conversation

I was buying her drinks, making her laugh, Having interesting conversations ect But its like he had to just ruin my fun.",30May2020,1
687,"Let me start with my age which is 16, I live in a abusive household and there’s only one reason I’m not going to the authorities which I’ll get into later on. I really need to move out of this place because I simply can’t take it, I can last 2 more years but i can’t last any more then that, I don’t know how to move out or how to get a job, I don’t know anything about the things I need like paying rent taxes and etc, I don’t know what will happen to my future without parental  support. I don’t only just want to move out I want to be completely gone and for them to never be able to find me again, I want to change my first and last name and go to a different country but I don’t know the first step to doing so. The reasons I’m staying is because I’m scared of leaving, if I leave will I lose contact with the person I love (my girlfriend) and will I ever be able to meet her (it’s an ldr but it’s very serious and she’s honestly the reason I didn’t commit suicide a long time ago, she’ll be 18 this year if this helps)...I know some people will call this a phase but for me I’ve felt like this my entire life and it’s a serious thing, serious enough to be on the verge of suicide every single day. I don’t know what else to say or if I’ll even have internet to read any advice / comments. I guess I can tell you guys a bit about my parents. My dad has anger issues and almost strangled me not too long ago, he’s never really around but when he is it’s hell, and with my mom, I can’t even go out of my room because screaming matches start as soon as I leave to have a sip of water. What got me to write this was the fight that got me to lock myself my room (I’m still locking myself in), I told them they were being bad parents and that as soon as I can I’ll leave, and they’re saying things like “we’re sending him to a mental institution the first thing in the morning” and that “he’s a psychopath, we gave him everything he doesn’t even know how it feels to be in a family where you get beaten every single day”.

688,"At university, I made a new group of friends. In the start, they seemed so happy to see me and spend time with me. With time, I felt like they did not really like me. My friend and I joined at the same time and it seemed like they liked her much more than me. Since coronavirus began, we have been at home. They contacted my other friend asking her to facetime and watch movies and shows with them, but never me. I have brought up my concerns before, saying I felt like I was forcing myself in, but they said this wasn't the case. I have tried so hard to make them see me, but somehow I am always ignored. In our group chat, most things I say are ignored. They have group chats without me and have inside jokes. I am aware these are very ""first world problems"", but sometimes I feel so alone even when I am surrounded by them. I do not feel cared about. Am I overthinking it? What do I do?

689," okay

so, lately, probably like 2 months already

shit's been heated up

like everyday, fighting

im 18 btw, M;

the main reason, at least at the moment, and for the last months, has been my self image.

yeah, i feel ugly

and when i feel ugly, i really dont feel like talking to them

and basically, obviously, they get frustrated asf

sometimes, when they come in my room, and since i feel the way i feel i even like hide my face, or just look away. and obviously they think that im being rude.

sometimes, i even feel hatred towards them cause they made me.

and basically it causes some serious confrontations

like almost everyday

i swear

really heavy

honestly, my self image wasn't bad before

but then i came across this forum [looksmax.me](https://looksmax.me/) (yall can basically look it up; what its about)

and it has warped my mind COMPLETELY

like, it has changed my perception of everything

tho, i do try to stay away from it, in the weirdest way possible, its addicting. so its hard.

but im doing it.

also, i have this habit of recording myself, like 100 times a day. just to see how i look, to get more of a realistic image of myself. and....

its addicting as well, and yall know why?

like, i dont know why, but sometimes i look hella good and it gives me so much pleasure mentally, that i want to do it again.

tho, obviously, i have times when its the opposite and i feel like a genetic trash, hideous, subhuman. and it works against me. and its the main reason why i feel ugly honestly.

so, as an advice, i would really not like to hear yall saying: ""oh, you are perfect just the way you are""; parents still love you despite that; and shit like that

no, i actually need an advice on how to deal with those emotions. cuz its really hard to control them. like really hard.

and also, should i tell my parents??

i mean, i dont want to, cuz, obviously their response will be something like you are goodlooking, dont stress it and shit like that

and obviously, it might trigger me, cuz i mean, i dont even think it needs an explanation",30May2020,1
690,"I am currently struggling with the fact that I am uncertain whether I can still be friends with whom I have considered to be my best friends at Uni for the past eight months after they have almost completely disregarded one of their friends assaulting me. 

I (19M) have started Uni in September last year and almost instantly hit it off with two girls (K and L)  that joined at the same time. We got along really well, we have the same sense of humour and just generally get along well so much so that I consider them to be my best friends at Uni. However, despite us usually getting along well, there have been some issues. 

The biggest one was that, throughout our second term at Uni, they repeatedly let me down either by barely meeting up with me or by standing me up when we wanted to do something together. Once the term ended and most people left, we ended up sitting down and talking about it, and they apologised profusely. 

Apart from that, another major issue for me was the fact that one of them (L) got together with another guy whom I consider to be a complete and utter asshole. Now it is worth mentioning here, and important for the story as a whole, that I developed feelings for that same girl (L) very early on and I told her so almost immediately. She didn't reciprocate my feelings which was and still is tough, but I was fine for the most part with us just being friends. The reason I was so upset with her getting together with the other guy was that he was a huge asshole. I am talking the kind of guy who proudly tells stories of driving and speeding while drunk with both friends and children in his car as well as generally just being a fuck boy. 

While she acknowledged that his behaviour was terrible, she reasoned for her ""relationship"" with him by saying that he was nice to her. The reason why I took this so hard was that I have a lot of experience with bullying and one of the most common things you get to hear when you tell others about what someone else has done to you is ""I know he can be an asshole, but he can also be a really nice guy!"". This is something that I have heard so often that it deeply infuriates me.

She eventually ended her relationship with him, though as I believe rather out of necessity than anything else since he returned home due to the pandemic. Since then, she has admitted that he really is just an asshole.

After the second term ended and we started hanging out again, especially during the two-week vacation between terms, and at first, things seemed to be great. Though I still had feelings for her, I accepted that she didn't, and I was really just happy about the three of us being friends. 

After the vacation ended, a friend of theirs returned to Uni, and I noticed that they started reaching out to me less frequently and just generally somewhat back down. Now I wasn't sure if I was right in my assessment of the situation because I was concerned that I was just somewhat paranoid due to the events of the last terms so I asked them about it and they assured me that it was just in my head. 

The next day, however, things got bad again when I found out that L got together with their friend. When I asked her about it, she told me that there were no feelings involved and that it was just a fling.

This really hit me hard. The reason for this is that, though I didn't really know the guy, over the eight months we have been at Uni they have repeatedly told me certain stories about him. It started when, in the first term, L told me that he confessed to her that he had feelings for her, at which point she rejected him. A few weeks later, K told me that he had also told her that he had feelings for her. When I got confused and asked her what she meant, given that he had told L the same things mere weeks before, she said that he had ""revealed"" to her that he had feelings for her (K) all along and that he had only projected them onto L since he knew that K had a boyfriend at home. A few months later, he got together with another girl only to break up with her after the winter holidays to reveal that he had only gotten together with her in order to get over K. Throughout the second term he made repeated suggestions that he couldn't stay friends with K due to his feelings for her. 

When he and L got together, originally as a fling, L told me that she knew that he had no feelings for her and that she just did it for fun. As mentioned above, this really struck me hard as I realised that my feelings for her weren't really gone and that her getting together with him made me feel massively unappreciated. As a result, I wrote her a message that day telling her that I needed a break from seeing her as I couldn't cope with them getting together. She was very understanding, and after roughly a week we both realised that we really missed hanging out with each other and so decided to try to ignore it. While this partially worked, there were several incidents where I couldn't handle it. 

This all ultimately culminated when L and I met up a few days ago and I ended up kissing her on the cheek. Now while I would like to say that it wasn't something I really consciously decided to do but rather something that, as dumb as it sounds, just happened, I do realise that this isn't a real excuse and I apologised profusely to her. She said that, though she didn't appreciate me doing so, it okay. 

When I asked her if we could keep it between the two of us, she told me that she didn't feel comfortable not telling her boyfriend. This surprised me, to say the very least, and upon asking her to clarify she told me that, what had started out as a fling, was now a real relationship. 

At this point, I apologised even more profusely and told her that I didn't know which in turn sparked her surprise, as she had thought that I was aware of this. 

We ended up talking for a bit and, as the conversation went, on it turned out that she had not been aware of the details of what he had told K when he initially confessed his feelings for her, with him convincing her that he had feelings for her all along. 

After finding out about this, she left rather upset, telling me that she was no longer sure if she could believe him. 

At this point, it was quite late, and so I decided to go to bed. However, about half an hour later, my doorbell rang repeatedly. Upon asking who it was L's boyfriend revealed himself to me and asked me to come downstairs to talk to him.

When I walked outside he asked me if I had anything to say to him and after confessing that I had kissed L he demanded an apology, stating that I could either show him respect or ""be taught some"". Now I have dealt with bullies who lie and threaten their way through life for most of mine, and at this point, it is safe to say that I am not someone to budge very quickly to their behaviour. As I was increasingly getting irritated by him suggesting that I could either apologise to him or be ""taught respect"", I decided that I did not owe him anything and turned to return to my room. 

At this point, he informed me that if I chose to leave that he would end up going after me. This got me to turn back to him and approach him to inform him that he was an idiot of making threats to me. He chose to respond to this by attacking me. 

Past experience has taught me that in situations like these if there is no real danger to your wellbeing, the best thing to do is to stay as passive as possible in order to ensure that it becomes a clear cut case. After being pinned to the ground, choked and threatened repeatedly with further violence, L and K came running out of a nearby kitchen to restrain him.

After this, I filed a report, the results of which are still pending. 

Since then, however, I have spoken to both L and K, who have revealed to me that, after he admitted that his behaviour was ""off"", they saw no reason to further make a big deal out of it and that they would instead just have things stay the way they were. 

When I told them that there was no way that I would just accept them pushing it under the carpet, I was hit with several statements such as: ""He could have gone further, but he didn't!"", ""It's still my choice with whom I am together!"" , ""It sucks, but it happened, and I don't see why we should keep making a big deal out of it!""

I was then, furthermore, told that if I didn't want to stay friends with them anymore, then they can't change that.

I haven't spoken to them since, though we have exchanged a few text messages which further strengthened my belief that their disinterest in further confronting him is founded by a general lack of appreciation for me. 

I am unsure if me expecting them to show him consequences to his behaviour by breaking off contact or even just taking a break from him is expecting too much. Especially because they have been saying that since they will only be staying for three more weeks before leaving Uni, they don't want to break any bridges.

I could really use some advice on what reaction I could expect from them and whether or not me expecting a more significant reaction from them is reasonable. 

TL;DR: I kissed my female friend, and after apologising, I found out that she had a boyfriend. Later that night, her boyfriend came to my house and repeatedly threatened me only to end up attacking me. What sort of reaction could I expect from them? Am I overstepping my boundaries, or am I overreacting, if I think that it is reasonable to expect them to draw consequences to his behaviour?

I should note that this is not the first time that the guy in question has been involved or has attempted to get involved in physical altercations. I have heard several stories of him attempting to start fights at parties. One story, however, that specifically came to my mind again was that, when K had a disagreement with a friend (H) she mentioned it in passing to the guy in question, who then felt the need to turn up on H's doorstep later that night and berate him.",30May2020,1

692,"Hi! Uhm, this is my first post, and I'm writing on mobile, so please correct me on any spelling/grammar! Also, if this is the incorrect sub to post this on, can you please guide me to the correct one? Thank you!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I (13F) honestly dont know what to say to my older brother's (15M) BF (15FtM). From this point on, I'll refer to my Bro as Alex and my Bro's BF as Sam. They have an on/off long-distance relationship.

I honestly have no interest in relationships, kinda tryin to focus on school, but when one of my older siblings tell me about they're SO, I get to know the SO in case they're here for the long run. I just wanna make em feel welcomed! 

However, Sam is...Kinda different. To me, anyway, as none of the other people who have been SOs for my older siblings have acted this way. He's kinda mean, and makes me feel bad about not talking to him a lot. I'm gonna give y'all a few examples of recent events. If they are normal, can you help me on how to apologize? And if they aren't, can you help me on what to do from now on? Thank you!

• When Sam and Alex are on 'break' (I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I guess they aren't together for a while??) Sam constantly asks me what Alex is doing, if he's talking to different people, etc etc. Sam also had people virtually spy on Alex numerous times. That part absolutely terrifies me, still gives me nightmares.

• He always vents to me and expects me to agree with whatever he's saying (how the heck should I know if Alex is giving you too little of affection, sometimes we can't talk whatsoever cause you want to talk to Alex all day!) and if I don't, he says I always side with Alex and that I've been manipulated by Alex to hate him.

• I'm prone to snapping. I'm working on it, I swear! Sam knows this, but provokes me quite a lot by sayin my baby bros are whiny and annoying (they're 7 and 10!)

• If I cut a convo short becuase I was told to do chores or had a therapy call to get to, he'd whine and beg me to stay, then when I refused, he would get super mean and...Passive aggressive? I think that's the term? He was sayin stuff like ""Fine! I didn't want to talk to you anyway""

• If we have an argument, I immediately go to Alex because he helps me a lot, and since he's with Sam, maybe he can help me smooth it over. Sam gets really pissed at me for telling him, I'm not sure why actually. If I ask Alex, he just says to ignore Sam for a bit.

• He gets jealous of Alex reassuring me or complimenting me. I, honestly, have terrible body issues because my paternal family have the mindset of ""if you have a small bit of chub, you're vile"" so I feel (or felt, damn you pandemic) very conscious of how I look. Normally i ask Alex to help me pick out clothes cause he's good at that (I'm terrible, but I'm starting to get the hang of pickin out some good clothes), then get him to leave as I get changed. Once I finish, I go to him and ask him how I look. I accidentally did that while he was on a video call to Sam. Alex called me beautiful and did up my top button. When I looked at the computer to say hi to Sam, he just screamed at me to get the fuck out. Alex immediately ended the call because we both hate screaming (bad experiences). When I texted Sam about it later, he told me he wasn't sorry, because Alex shouldn't be doin that to me, and only to himself or his mother. He also said he has worse body issues because he's trans (FtM) and that I shouldn't get compliments. I cried that night..

A-anyway! Since I don't exactly have reliable adults and my older siblings (including Alex) are really busy, and it's too late for a therapy call, I thought maybe coming on reddit would give people unbiased advice. I just wanna be a better person with all this, but I'm so confused and my eyes hurt from crying..

702,"I’m stsrting to come to the conclusion that I have a hormonal problem. I won’t go into details but basically my PMS seems to affect me a lot stronger and a lot *longer*. I usually only have like one good week out of every month. 

My PMS affects my self-esteem a lot, I become very insecure and if I feel that it’s obvious, I use anger as a defense mechanism... at least from my own observations. 
I get very quiet and short tempered, I tend to isolate myself. 
I also have a situation at work right now with a coworker of mine who likes my boyfriend (we work together). Despite having security and trust in my relationship, it does affect my mood seeing her. It also makes me realize how many pretty girls there are at my job, I can’t stop comparing myself and that is what also seems to trigger me into feeling more insecure than I already am. 

I’ve tried explaining this to my boyfriend (not so much the pretty girl part, lol...) and even though he claims he understands when I tell him there are things he can do to make me feel more validated and “loved”, he doesn’t always catch on to when I need it the most. 

Sometimes I just wish he texted me more, or when I rant to him, I wish that he didn’t just give me a logical response or something like “don’t worry it’s not a big deal” but more emotional support, reassurance, etc. 

Last night he didn’t message me all day because he assumed I was upset. Which I was. But that’s one of those things where him texting me would make me feel cared for? I think. 

We eventually did start texting, and this is what I said to him ^ 
I told him  that I’m probably getting my period soon and so I’ll finally feel normal for a couple days. 

He didn’t end up texting back, I thought he fell asleep but in the morning all he said was Good morning. No recognition. 

I guess I crave more reassurance and attention in moments like this but I also am aware that I shouldn’t rely on somebody else making me feel better. 

This may sound super shallow, but it’s the truth. Deep down I guess I can’t get out of this loop of feeling below everybody else because I don’t get the reassurance I’d like. 

Is it wrong of me to expect this of him? How can I fix myself? I know this it isn’t his fault.

703,"I don’t even have to explain myself when I say it’s been a fucking wild year. On top of all that I’ve hit new lows in my mental health, faced parts of myself I didn’t really want to, but now I’m still here, and tomorrow I’ll be 20. With how the world has been changing constantly, especially now, I wanted also use my birthday as a marker for change in myself as a person and fellow person to others. I’ve conjured some ideas: living without fear because life is too short to waste it on being scared, or truly dedicating myself to my goals and dreams, or just never holding back on what I want to do (though thinking about it that could cause myself trouble lol). So as I’m thinking of what motto I want to adopt for my 20’s, I wanted to bring this question to Reddit and just talk about it.

704,"I am a very anxiously attached person in relationships, however I do think I do a good job of hiding it, but this hurts me because it ends up taking over my internal thoughts. Lately, I have been having this constant underlying thought my partner has fallen out of love with me or is cheating, and realistically I can assess this and realize I have absolutely zero reason to think this; as we have a good relationship and I trust them, but my brain will not let this thought go away. It also seems to be worsened because we are in an LDR at the moment because of COVID. Its to the point that I wake up in the morning throwing up from anxiety, but I obviously do not want to tell them this because they have not done anything at all to be accused of cheating.

705,"Hey people, to give context I am in Scotland where the lockdown guidance is still quite strict and close contact with people from different households is essentially illegal.

My(M27) baby sister(F16) had left the family home on Monday 25th May to originally visit a friend which in actual fact turned out to be a lie and since revealed she went to stay with her boyfriend until today, Saturday 30th May, breaking lockdown rules and completely disregarding the safety of others in doing so. As of this moment, my sister has returned home unchallenged and to my understanding my parents haven’t spoken to her.

For context , she has had a string of misdemeanours last year,
with no word or warning she has went missing on several occasions for days at a time, ignoring my parents attempts to get in contact with her which has led to police involvement and the filing of missing person reports on 2 separate instances. 

She has no respect for my parents or herself, her conduct over the last year &amp; a bit has left my parents a bit raw and “fed up” so much so that I feel they simply don’t know what to do with her. It has been a struggle for me to sit idly by and watch my parents be subject to such disrespectful behaviour. I admit I haven’t been shy on voicing my concerns about my sister to my parents but the dialogue I try to open with them is never welcome. 

Furthermore, this recent situation has left me at a bit of a loss, she’s not my child and I’m not posting to seek advice on how to deal with my sister as it’s not me place, nor ask for advice on my parent‘s behalf. I’m simply concerned for my own health and well-being, my country has started the process of phasing out of lockdown and I had already accepted plans from my employer to recommence work over the coming weeks. 

Thus it’s given with this new development in my household circumstances that I have to inform my employer of the potential cancellation of work plans over fear of exposure to the virus. To that end I am rather distressed and beyond disappointed in the way my sisters selfish actions have impacted my return to work.

I have spoken to the National police helpline call service who have instructed me to contact the emergency services who will come and have a word with my sister and potentially issue her with a fine. I spoke about this potential outcome with my mother a couple of days ago and she informed me that I would be asked to leave the house if I involve the police.

With all this taken into consideration, can I appeal for anyone’s advice on this matter as I am simply at a loss as to what I should do.

I don’t have anywhere else to go at short notice if I am asked to leave the house but at the same time, I am deeply upset that I have to cancel my work plans and how my mother is seemingly protecting my sister and allowing the situation that has transpired to go undisciplined.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you all in advance.",30May2020,1
706,"We have double glazed windows, blackout blinds and blackout curtains. I close every window and door in the house before going to bed. The attic has been converted but we've had foam insulation pumped in so there's no cracks or holes leading to outside. I've considered foam panels but I know that's for stopping sound going out. I've tried playing music and white noise to deaden the sound but that doesn't work. 

Every night there's feral and free roaming cats screeching and wailing on my road. And there's foxes making noises. My dogs go ballistic barking at them every night. I haven't had an unbroken night's sleep in 3 years. How can I further reduce sound coming into the house???

I think about texting her almost every day but for some reason I just can’t. I know I have some problems bringing up my feelings so I believe this is why.

Last night I was talking with some friends(over xbox) and I'll refer to them as P and W,now me and P are really close I'm pretty sure. We talk every day,we each know a lot about the other and are both comfortable talking about almost anything most of the time.

Now I had to go offline as I share a room but I told P that I went to a different room and could talk with both of them over Discord,like on a call. I said this 2 different times in 2 different messages. P dodged it both times and literally ignored it. So after moving to a has told her sevdifferent room with my phone,headphone,charger,pillow,etc.. I for an hour and a half was left alone. I sent P a message over discord saying I'll try to get on which they had told me to do if I could. I got no response for over 20 minutes. Checked xbox and they're still in a party with W. 


Just gonna skip to when I started talking to P about this. Well P tried to lie which P knows I *hate when people lie to me* saying that she lost her earphones and adapter I caught her in the lie. She also implied that she wasn't trying to dodge the fact that I could talk  . Even though when I brought it up to P in person ,she kept doging it. Untill eventually they asked ""do you want the truth or a good lie?"" I said the truth. They responded by telling me how they just wanted to talk to W in the meantime. W,who has told her multiple times over that he doesn't trust P in any way,W who has insulted P's voice and interests,who has insulted things I've put hours towards making behind my back.

P ditched me for W and refused to talk to me. Then tried to lie to me. Than outright told me that they didn't want to talk to me and had ditched me. Now me and P can be petty or jealous and stuff. We both have *bad*- jealousy and paranoia. W fuels my insecurities and paranoia because it seems P seems to pick him over me a lot. But P has reassured me that we're like family and that she prefers talking to me. Even though she got jealous when I was talking to W and another guy. This is also the second time shes tried to lie to me about something to do with W in the last few days.

713,"Long read ahead. (Disclosure: English is my third language) 

My issue is that i am an extremely popular and well liked, but i have absolutely zero friends not even 'fake friends' 

Firstly I'm a 22 year old male doing my final year of law school. I am also a devout Christian. 

I've been struggling with this particular issue for a while and thought things would eventually change, but it hasn't. 

I have severe ADHD (extra hyperactive) but only got diagnosed and started receiving treated in the 10th grade. 

As result i was bullied for being the weird and annoying kid because of my hyperactivity this reputation stuck with me untill the end of senior year. 

My first year in university i had my ADHD ubder control with my medication and no longer i was the weird annoying person, actually the opposite happened. 

I was immensely popular under all the first year students and even the lecturers. People appreciated me for me. 

So much do that i got elected as public relations officer for the University's Judicial Society at the start of second year. Third year ibwas elected to be the Senior Moot and gead researcher for our Moot Society. 

Often people ask to sit next to me in class just so they can talk to me because they say I seem approachable or when someone frim class sees me in public they would greet me in public and introduce me to their friends along the following line
""Meet xxxx, he is in my law class one of the nicest people around"" 

I enjoy socialising and meeting new people.
Often go to the local Mall food court and buy two lunches approach the first person that I see sitting by themselves and ask them if they would like to chat over lunch and then we share lunch and have some good conversations. 

Other times strangers approach me first and ask to chat because they say I'm very approachable. 

I am equally nice to ALL the people I meet and not because I want people to think good of me i dot it because it brings me sincere joy. 

Every third Subday i check up in each and every single person in my contact list i dobt do this ""just because"" I do this because I'm genuinely interested in knowing how theyvare doing ans if tbere is anyway i csn help them if it isn't going well with them. 

NOW MY ACTUAL QUESTION:
How is it that I can be so popular and everyone tells me I'm approachable and kindhearted butvi don't gave aby friends. 

Thisvis my fourthvand last year of university - not once did i receive a gappy birthday message from anyone besides my parents. 

Not once has any asked me to hang out. 

Not once any has asked me how im doung. 

I've never received a text message first that isn't someone asking me a favour the people that ask favours don't even say hi, they just ask the favour and as soon as i help them they don't even say thank you. 

I really want to know why I don't have friends. I want friends abd im startingvti vet depressed. 

P. S
Despite this, I will still be a nice as usual to everyone and gelp tvem snd check up because i dint do those things because i wsbt friends, I do it because i love people.",30May2020,1

716,"**tl;dr: I'm aware that my sibling has committed violence against myself and other people. I'm also aware of how they've on numerous occasions mentioned wanting to be a terrorist. Should I present this information to anyone of authority?** 

I'm (19) currently living in Toronto and self-isolating with my family. I was previously away for college but now I'm back.

However upon returning home, not only have I noticed that they(21) have been acting way more suspicious (peaking around corners before entering a room, following me around the house) but recently after they had left to hang out friends. (during COVID season) Were very hostile after being confronted by my family and told to self-isolate. Luckily they are going out to live with someone else today, however, I am worried about their behaviors regarding other people. 

Not only have they physically attacked me on numerous occasions. but they also have 1 dropped charge for assault. I also have held onto a screen-cap two conversations they had with my younger sibling (19) in which the following was said:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;""might be able to get him suspended

&gt;Thing is now that I'm adult if I get arrested it has to be something really big or my criminal record will prevent me from my dreams of becoming a terrorist

&gt;But I'm also check the legal surroundings of pulling a sword on him for you""

(This was in relation to my younger sibling asking my older one to stab someone)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There is also this birthday message sent by my older sibling to my younger one:

&gt;""Happy birthday

&gt;You've been an amazing sibling

&gt;Id probably be a terrorist or something if it wasn't for you

&gt;You taught me compassion.""

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was advised by my mom not to show these to my father as he is very defensive about defending my 2 siblings for whatever reason. My main fear is not only the fact that I know of this information. But also that if they were to do anything then I would be held responsible for their crimes... In my own mind at least. 

How I obtained these posts, was by using my younger sibling's computer (because they forgot to turn it off and log out) while everyone was on vacation after overhearing them have multiple conversations about attacking one of my peers at school. But I wasn't really sure if they were joking or not. After finding these posts I showed them to my peer in person, and essentially told him to watch his back around them. 

However, both of my 2 siblings seem to be obsessed with the idea of obtaining my parent's wealth after they die. The couple times that my older sibling had attacked me, were over petty things like stealing a pencil or bending a foam sword, the 1 assault charge was after they blew an airhorn at someone in a protest and things violently progressed from there. This was from a couple of years ago. Now. They haven't murdered anyone yet from my knowledge. But I don't feel safe living in the same house as them.

Just to be clear, I really don't take issues with what they are protesting. In fact, I agree with a lot of their causes, but what I take issue with them as a person.

There are a lot of moving cogs in this advice post, and in order to get real help, I'd need to speak to someone more familiar with the situation.

But what I'm wondering, is if there is any potential way I could tip off authorities? (Canada) (as an extreme measure)

Or better yet, if there is any way I can tip off my dad without him getting defensive about everything.

Then after I confronted him things got better but after 3 days or so, he started telling me that he wanna rest or he feels sick so I would let him rest but my gut feels something's wrong so I tried to check his match history in this one game, I saw exactly the time he 'rested' was the starting time of the game..

720,"I'm a guy, 16, from the UK. Because of the way I was raised I've never watched porn so my understanding of sex is pretty limited (I'm a virgin.) However, since I was about 11 I've been attracted to women who are dominant and strong, people like female villains or badass women from TV shows etc. Although it haven't been stupid enough to discuss this with friends, from what I understand it's normal for men to be dominant and women to be submissive, and submissive men are gay. I have no attraction to men and never have, so the other chance is that I'm mentally ill. Due to NHS incompetence the treatment I was supposed to have for mental issues has been delayed- I was first referred for URGENT treatment in August 2018. That's not a typo.
Out of desperation I asked my dad about it, but my mum overheard and told him to not answer me. She then told me that I needed to stop thinking about this so much and that it was not normal and ""sick.""
In normal life I'm not at all a pushover, I'm 6 foot 3, I box, work out, listen to metal music etc. This is completely out of character for me, and to be honest I've started to worry that I'm a pervert who will never find a wife. What is my condition called, and what is the treatment for it? I came to ask reddit because I don't want to search openly on the Internet bc my mobile account is owned by my dad and I don't want him seeing about it.

I'm attracted to feminine women, and I want to have a normal loving relationship with someone outside of sex, but this condition is making me feel disgusted with myself. The most disgusting thing is I actually LIKE being attracted to the things that I am, but I know it's perverted and wrong.

721,"I'm a 24F graduating from graduate school this summer. I have lived in LA for 7 years for university while my entire family lives on the east coast. I grew up not really having close friends in my hometown but made a good group in college. My friends are scattered across the country but mainly on the west coast.

Now that I am graduating, it's almost time for me to start looking for jobs. While I feel more comfortable on the west coast because I've lived there for my entire adult life and was able to break free of my family's restrictions, I feel the pressure to live close to my family because I feel like it's my duty to be near my parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles as they grow older. 

I am wondering if I should apply to jobs in NYC to start building my community on the east coast. I value my friendships and close relationships and want to be able to have family and friends in the same place. I feel like LA is a hotspot for my college friends to visit and get together and my heart hurts leaving that city behind because it's been home for so long.

722,"Our state (WI) just opened back up almost 2 weeks ago and the last couple days we’ve hit the record for our state for new COVID cases. My SIL still decided yesterday would be a great time to go out to the Wisconsin Dells for some mini golfing, go-carting and a picnic with a group of her friends. She said she didn’t go into buildings, they kept socially distant, and each place they visited sanitized equipment before and after each use.

My SIL is graduating high school this year and has planned a graduation party at their house next weekend. I’m not sure how many people were invited but I do know that her grandparents and great uncle were invited. She also enjoys walking our dog and has made plans for today to pickup our dog for a walk. Because she decided to go to a heavily populated town that normally has tourists from all over the world, I’m uncomfortable letting her walk the dog today and going to her graduation party in fear of catching and spreading corona. I also believe we should still be distancing ourselves from our grandparents no matter how careful we are being because of such high cases these last couple days. 

I also am standing up as MOH in my sister’s upcoming wedding in 3 weeks. They’ve canceled the reception and big ceremony and are now doing immediate family only. Her MIL just beat cancer and my dad has diabetes and asthma so I need to be extremely careful that I don’t get sick before this wedding so I don’t get them sick.

725,"To begin with. I am 17 years old Male (gonna be 18 on September). I am a virgin with some experience with girls, but none too amusing. I like spending time with them and I don't want to hurt anyone. I have been hurt. I haven't had a ""relationship"" more than 1 month old, not that I've had much but still. Three '04, from which they were either crazy, ""nice girls"", or just a hoe playing with feelings.

Most of my friends have either happy relationships with girla our age, or have lost their virginity, so I'm going a little slow for this party. I have suffered from loneliness and depression, cuz of that, but that is not the issue.

I just focused on becoming a better person, but I recently started hanging out with a younger girl - '05, which makes her 14 years old. (in August she'll be 15). So that means 3 years difference. She's great, I really like her. She' s beatiful, has a good personality so far and is crazy about me. And I love sending time with her, we are almost together, but not yet. Moat of the time she doesn't act like a child, but sometimes she does. That is not an issue for me, but I think an important point for the next paragraph.

The thing is, I don't know if I'll be good enough for her. Because my exlectations are like after 3 or 4 month together probably having sex. I am at the age, when I really want that. But I don't know if it would be right to want it from her. She could want it from me. I also don't know if it's illegal. In my country (Bulgaria) the Age Consent is 14. I don't know if it would be pedophiling when I'm an adult. I feel like it would be. I don't know. I do know I really would want to lose my virginity. 

In the end, I could only think of two options.

1 - Continue the things with her and see where they are going, maybe we'll be happy years from now on.

2 - End things with her then and there and prevent any possible bad consequences for me and for her. And possible damage.

What should I do? I know I may be overreacting, but it's important for me to make the choice, so I can have inner peace. Thank you for the antention.",30May2020,1
726,"My daughter (17f) recently told my wife and me that she was molested by the son (21-24m) of some family friends when she was 14 and staying at their house for the night. She was visiting their daughter and was talking to their son in the living room while everyone else was asleep. I won't go into the details, except he raped her then, and at least one more time that I know of, but it may have been more. What's worse is this happened right after another family friend (21m) molested her, although she was ""in love"" with him. My wife is visiting her mother right now, and she called me and wants me to punch the guy. She wants me to do just one punch because she's afraid if she does it, she won't be able to stop. Me, however, I'm not someone who gets violent. If it's to protect, sure, but to get retribution, that's just not me. I'd rather ruin his reputation, see that he gets kicked out of his house, that he loses all his friends and family over this. But I could just hear the disappointment in my wife's voice after I told her. 

My daughter has made it clear she doesn't want to press charges. Privately, with the way these things go, I doubt there would ever be any way to successfully bring these charges in a court of law. Am I wrong for not going over there and punching him? I'm a large guy, he's a small guy. I've never hit anyone in anger before, although I have humiliated them and ruined reputations before.

Sometimes in fights it gets to the whole “maybe we shouldn’t be together” but we always end up staying together and things are awkward for a day then good for a week and it starts again idk what to do,30May2020,1
731,"I live with my mom. My sister comes to do laundry a few Times a week. I didnt know she was coming today, so I put my cloths is the washer. They were done by the times she got here, so she took them out, and put them in the dryer. Also, my mom was an upset stomach, and a cough the other day, and shes the one who folded them and put them in my room. Should i wash them again?",30May2020,1
732,"I'm working towards my electrical engineering degree, one of the hardest I think many can agree. But I got into it not because I wanted to, but because of pressure from my parents because I did not know what else to do. I had to retake a bunch of classes and I need at least one more year. I almost gave my parents a heart attack when I told them that earlier. I need 8 fucking years to graduate with a degree that takes 4. 

I studied my ass off every semester and I do blame myself for not studying enough, but when some of these classes had an average grade of 42-53%. There's something fucking wrong man. Some classes are prerequisites to others and I couldn't do well enough in those to take the rest, that's why it's taking this long. My parents are most likely freaking out about money because my dad is retired and can no longer work and my mom never did. I don't know what to do, I've been looking for jobs and internships with no replies.",30May2020,1
733,"A person called me gay for liking a song called my ""time to say goodbye"" by casey William's it might not show up if you search it up like that so add ""rwby"" and it'll show up.

I know my music taste doesn't decide my sexuality I just thought this person was stupid for calling me gay for listening to a song that was made for an anime I watch. Also according to this person korn, slipknot, megadeth, cannibal corpse, static x, and pretty much any metal band besides Metallica is gay.",30May2020,1
735,So basically I was gonna talk to her or at least try to talk to her about 3 months ago and I blacked out. Idk what was said but at first I thought I blacked out due to mental issues but I found out it was physically. I was really dehydrated and don’t remember anything that was said. Is it normal to like a girl for this long without trying to talk to her. I feel like a absolutely pathetic human being because everyone else shoots there shot or try’s and I haven’t yet. She knows I’ve liked her for a bit now since my brother doesn’t know when to shut the fuck up. My brother told me to talk to her and that he straight up told her I liked her. He’s my twin and I swear I almost lost it when I heard that. Idk what to do I feel abnormal as all hell and idk if this is in my head but my adhd seems to be getting a lot worse. Like I can’t keep focus on things anymore. When I was younger I couldn’t keep focus on anything and it’s starting to comeback,30May2020,1
737,"Hi I'm posting again, in my previous post I explained about me not being able to stand up at work, but I did that today to the colleague who insulted me and we made up. I didn't feel guilty as a result of it, but I didn't feel relieved and I didn't feel that my self worth had increased as a result. A manager even asked me if I was ok and I just say 'yeah' even though I'm not, I cant seem to accept my emotions at work and I feel it is due to the pressure. All that's on my mind is that duties need to get done, but it's too the point that it's so overbearing that mum find doesn't want to concentrate on work, thus leading to inefficiency. All I can think about is 'fuck how long left till this shit ends', completing a task doesn't make me feel good it just gives me a sigh if relief and I temporarily feel good when someone else praises me for it. I'm not gonna quit, I took the L today and I'm gonna recuperate, I've always given in to despair but now that I have good self worth whilst at home it's not much of a problem. The advice of speaking to yourself as a best friend works for me while at home, but due to my own created pressure at work it doesn't come through. What can I do to practice that. I know now is not the time to despair, I've thrown myself in the deep end and am on the edge or creating a new path in my life if I stand up for myself more and feel positive in my own ability and worth. Just please advise me. Sorry for this messy ramble post.",30May2020,1
738,"I got a friends request from a guy and since he had a pfp from a show I watch I accepted it. I checked his age and it says he was born in 2003, so he's 17. Okay.

I have absolute no relation to these people, we're not even friends from the same country or continent but idk if I should do something about it. 24 and 17, eeww, I don't know if it's legal in the US or not but it rubs me in the wrong way.

739,"The year I left for a highly-competitive, international boarding school was the year I developed severe mental illness. I had been labelled a gifted student, had never had a teacher in my life that hadn't adored me, and was a huge perfectionist... but then suddenly I was alone on a different continent, unable to function at all, blaming myself heavily for it, and cast as a ""problem student"" (dumb, apathetic, dishonest even?) by all faculty and administration. Most days I was sleeping 18 - 20 hours, not eating, dropped to 85 lbs... needless to say I missed a lot of class. A few times when I did go to class, I had a teacher yell at me in front of everyone. One teacher even threw a book at me, and when I tried to talk to admin or my academic advisor about it, they said ""well, your teachers are frustrated with you, "" and ""well, if you want to ruin your relationship with him..."" Everyone gossiped about me: teachers amongst themselves, teachers to students, students with other students. The student body was 300 people and stuff got around fast. I heard things about myself that made me want to erase off the face of the earth.

I was a teenage girl, on my own, and not equipped to cope. I had enough in me to go to the school's medical centre many times and try to explain I thought something was wrong (didn't know anything about mental illness, couldn't put words to what was happening to me) but all they did was give me an endless supply of paracetamol as they did all students.

I struggled extremely with being able to study but would like to believe students still saw some of me underneath it all? I was elected to student council early on and had a friend tell me during a school outing that she overheard a group of our co-years talking about me, saying that I was ""so smart"" but that I was ""a mess"" and that ""raw intelligence isn't enough to succeed here"". 

Fast-forward to me barely scraping by and writing final exams. As part of graduation, our dorm, houseparents, and academic advisors (maybe 50 people?) had a special lunch to honor our graduating cohort. All the academic advisors were getting up one-by-one to say nice things about their advisees.

I had the newest hire in the school as my academic advisor. Maybe he was nervous, I'm really not sure what possessed him to do this, but when he got up to talk about the four of us that made up his advisee group, he ripped me to pieces in front of everyone. He started by talking about his favorite student, then literally transitioned with "" help4healing is the opposite."" He let everyone know in no uncertain terms how bad of a student I was, making joke-after-joke at my expense (to which not a single person laughed), and at points I heard myself pleading his name aloud, trying to get him to stop. 

He finished, people politely clapped, and I don't remember much else besides me sitting there, staring at no one, forcing myself not to cry. As soon as we broke for dessert, I went to my dorm room and ugly-sobbed with two of my housemates. One of the other academic advisors came up to find them (they were her advisees) and she (politely? unsympathetically?) didn't acknowledge what happened, my tears, or why the three of us had vanished from the backyard.

Something inside me broke then. I packed up all my stuff, booked a train ticket, skipped the actual, school-wide graduation ceremony, and left the school. If anyone noticed I was gone, they didn't ask after me.

Now it's been several years since I've been there or seen any of those people, but the memory of it all still intensely triggers me. I woke up this morning hit by the memory again and hating myself and my life so much. 

I can't piece apart what about it has me still so hurt all these years later. I frankly even struggled to write the title for this post... it the betrayal I'm struggling with? The violation of my privacy? The shame of having failed so miserably at something I love? Hurt nobody helped me at all? I want to heal the part of me that is still apparently very raw about what happened but don't know where to begin.",30May2020,1
740,"Hey all, when I was 14 I moved to a town which I hated and still hate. The city is way too big, gang violence happens around us compared to the friendly community with only 500 people I was in before. My parents didn't give me enough attention and affection and I eventually became pretty down with life, far from the friends I had and the family that I used to live around who loved me.

I was 15, did weed outside and I live in Canada so it's legal but not for people underage to use it (you can get fined) for about 3-4 months. I started doing it my home and got careless and eventually my parents found out, gave me the talk and told me not to do it ever again even though they smoke weed more than they spend time with me, they go out about 3 times a day to do it and it kills a part of me a little bit because it makes me feel as if they would rather be with drugs instead of me, I got my weed and my papers from THEIR stash, keep that in mind.

2 months go by and I start doing it again, in my own home of course and get caught right away and my mother balls her eyes out and I feel very very guilty because I was always priviledged and she gave me so much love as a kid which I don't feel anymore and she's a stoner herself, I thought she would of taken it better.

Since then, I haven't done it since but it seems like I can't go to an outing with friends or anything without them asking and everytime they ask my soul and self esteem just gets crushed into nothing, I lay in my bed and I think about why I did those things even though I never did any drugs with friends, only alone they keep asking me about it.

I still lack the affection and love and they still do pot more than they do anything with me.

This morning my mother asked again and I feel terrible again and spent the entire morning feeling guilt and crying, I never cry but this time it just hit me too much, you know guys?

Advice on how to deal with this, please.",30May2020,1
741,"So my bestfriend for 6  years who I have known through work for 10 years... We turned into a couple. Then moved in with eachother pretty fast then started fighting, then I had my suspicions that she was talking to a guy she has had sex with in the past who is also friends with her bestfriend.... so I went on her phone (without her knowing) and saw she has been talking with him again and in a group chat with him and her best friend and she’s been calling him her penis and saying she misses him.

742,"I going to keep it short because I spent around 30 mins writing this post earlier but it got erased cuz my phone died.

Ok so I have a very close black friend who up until this all happened was not extremely comfortable with talking about her race too much.
Anyways,today she posted on her story that anyone who had not posted anything showing their support for the movement was no longer her friend.

I got really worried because I really didn’t think that she was so serious about this whole thing.Like, for context we live in Europe and over here the extent of whats going on with the movement is literally just people posting on their story the black lives matter symbol with other ppl being a bit more vocal.But I had been just minding my own business not really wanting to get involved because truthfully, I dont really know all the facts and I dont want to post something for the sake of it,because it wouldn’t be genuine and i dont want to misrepresent the movement.Especially since im not even white or black i felt like it wasn’t my place to comment on it cuz it would just be me talking through my ass about shit I don’t understand.

Anyways to sum up,my friend called me ignorant,disgusting and disappointing all because i didn’t post on my story about being with the movement.I never meant to be a bad friend or anything, I just thought I was better off not getting into all this because I wouldn’t be doing much good.its not like there are polls taking account of all the people that are with the movement because they posted it on their story.

I’m 100% with the movement and I believe what they are doing is something that is much needed.But i just never saw the need to brag about it on social media.I just dont see how one post all the way from somewhere in Europe is really doing much good.I also dont really have any other way to help since I dont make my own money (18,still living with my parents) i cant donate.And i would have loved to have been there to show support even if not for me for my friend but she never communicated with me to tell me like hey you know,I need your help promoting this or I need your help doing this other thing or literally anything.I would have gladly helped!!!
But she had to go about it the completely worse way she insulted all of us (her friends) and demanded that we help by posting something anything and that if we didn’t we were just being ignorant.
This is completely pointless in my opinion since the whole movement is about changing ppls minds not just aimlessly posting about caring when really u have no clue what your talking about.
I dont want to loose my friend, but i also cant believe that she really thinks im this evil heartless person that intentionally doesn’t support the movement when i thought that we really got each other and that she knew me.It really hurts tbh and i know i hurt her too but I really dont know how to make things better since apologising would really not be genuine and it would probably only bury the topic temporarily...any advice??am i overreacting or is she??who should apologise??",30May2020,1

747,"Almost 3 years ago my bf started having really bad back pain. He’s been feeling it in his lower back and groin. We thought it was testicular cancer at first but that was ruled out by the doctor. He’s gotten mri scans, ct, gotten checked out by the best back doctor there is in our town. We found he has scoliosis and a herniated disk. The doctor said he should go to physical therapy 2 years ago. But for some reason he never went. 

Everyday he’s in severe back and groin pain as a 21 year old, and he limps all day. It makes him tear up and cry a lot. But he won’t help himself. How he helps himself is drinking and smoking weed. Since he’s been 19 he’s been drinking about 7-8 beers a night or more. If he’s taking shots he’ll end up drinking most of the bottle. With weed he’s going through 2 grams of dabs a week. But when it comes to looking up exercises or stretches to do for back pain he won’t do it. He doesn’t even try to do any stretching or physical help to his body. All he does is mask it with drugs. 

I love my boyfriend I do and I feel horrible that he’s in so much pain but he’s not helping himself. He actually has himself convinced that drinking and smoking weed helps him feel better. I’ve tried making the point that it only distracts him from the pain but it doesn’t even do that. He can be 6 shots down and take 2 dab hits and still be grunting in pain. I HATE SEEING HIM LIKE THIS. I’ve tried so many times to try and get him to call the doctor over the past year and he just finally did it. But seeing him drinking every night has changed how I view him. 

I don’t see him as my boyfriend anymore. Honestly my boyfriends gone. He’s never sober, if he isn’t drinking he’s high. I know he can’t do much activity because of his pain but we stopped going on walks, we stopped basically having sex because I’m so upset with him drinking. He doesn’t even try to do anything. He just wants to watch tv, play video games, drink, and smoke weed. And that’s not the bf I had. 

I hate admitting this because I never wanted this to happen but I’ve tried helping him so much to where I’m about to give up. And I’m already checking out mentally. I don’t listen to anything he says when he’s drunk anymore because when I look at him I see him slurring his words with blood shot eyes and I can’t take him seriously. When I tell him he’s drunk and needs to eat or slow down he just argues with me that he’s not drunk and is fine. Then proceeds to get up and stumble across the floor. He laughes it off but it’s not funny. He’s only 21 and already an alcoholic. Doesn’t have any hobbies other than video games. I’m trying to find sympathy here but it’s kinda gone. I don’t know how to deal with this. I want to love my boyfriend but it’s going away. He made a doctors appointment and will hopefully go to physical therapy. But I just don’t know what to do anymore guys. How do I cope with this??",30May2020,1

751,"It started as a great week. I wasn’t happy at the start of it, but after finishing high school and a birthday, it was going well. Things have been going well for me. 

Today we have to clean the house. Some very close family is coming over (don’t worry, we’re somewhere that allows this and we’ll be distancing throughout). I have to finish one thing for school today before she comes over, so my dad went through the list of bigger things that I have to do before I can go finish it. He asks my mom what else they need me for and she LOSES it. She starts yelling at him that he’s not listening to her, that he’s not getting it, asking why he’s arguing when she is the only one speaking in any sort of tone. My sister and I are lost because it’s completely unprovoked. She was saying that she was talking about x when the entire conversation was about y. 

We kinda move on and start to do the things we have to. I’m moving things around with my dad. We had to move one really big piece of furniture. This has been the plan for weeks. She walks in and blows up again because “this wasn’t the plan” and “last they spoke this wasn’t happening.” She blew up that he wasn’t listening. I got hold and said “Are you actually listening?” She ignored me entirely because when she’s mad, she doesn’t listen to anyone. 

I left to do my work once we finished and my sister went to walk our dog. Then she starts the fight. She plays the victim every single time. She says that now she looks like the fool (idk if she uses reddit, but if she does, Anna, you looked like a fool the entire time). I have earbuds in upstairs and I can still here her shouting. 

This happens all the time someone disagrees with her. She has to be right she was once dreading a room to illustrate a point and did it completely wrong (like the shape was off, think rectangular room now has 6 walls). I said that’s not the shape and she insisted that I, someone who took two years of architectural design courses in school, had no clue what I was talking about. 


This is where I need my advice. I have no clue how to manage it. If I have an opinion, she gets mad because I shouldn’t. If I don’t have one, she gets mad because I should. I just don’t know what to do. She can be very good, but when she’s bad, she makes sure everyone is living in hell too. I just don’t know what to do ever to handle her situations.",30May2020,1

754,"In the first few months of dating my partner we were fighting a lot and I didn't feel loved so I reconnected with a guy friend who I have missed before. I told my partner he was gay because there was honestly nothing there I just needed to vent. About a month later of constant fights and realising that the guy friend had feelings for me and just seemed like everything I wanted from my partner i started discussing with the guy friend about leaving my bf for him. My partner was partying and posting photos with different girls however he says he hasn't done anything and I believe him. But it made me feel like I was a joke and I was so scared of being hurt like my ex hurt me that I wanted that second option. I have later told my bf that I flirted with him while he was ""gay"" and after he admitted his feelings I cut him off. That is partly true as I never kissed or further and on many occasions told the guy friend I'm not going to cheat. After a month of this leading on told him I loved my partner and I realised that although he did all the right things that I wanted I had no feelings for him in fact the thought of kissing or even hugging him grossed me out. So after I cut him off my relationship improved so much and now months later we cant imagine being without eachother. My only worry is that he will find out the full truth. And I know it sounds ridiculous but I don't want to hurt him. I have never had a thought of being with anyone else ever again after that no matter the fights we had.

Basically; my cousin is two years older than me, he’s bullied me since we were kids. Recently he’s stopped bullying me and moved on to my little brothers (9 and 8).

I left school due to bullying when I was 12, but I’m still friends with people I went there with. They didn’t know he was my cousin till I brought it up a few weeks ago, and a shitstorm of stories of how much of an asshole he is pursued.

My friends have told me how he bullies them, steals from liquor stores across the road from his school, tries to peer pressure younger kids into smoking with him, I even have screen shots of him bragging about doing ketamine.

I want to get back for the years of torment he’s caused, but I’m scared of fucking up my family.
He goes to private school and my grandad pays the tuition. If my grandad found out the shit he’s done he’d pull his funding. He’s already nearly pulled it once after my cousin physically threw some guy into a row of lockers. 

If my grandad pulls the funding, it could fuck up my whole families relationship and I risk getting my family cut in half by my auntie.
Do I risk messing everything up???

This made him pretty mad and he was blaming himself a lot trying to figure out where he had gone wrong.

761,"So, a bit of context on the situation, I'm middle eastern, I grew up in the suburbs and still growing up here, If you've ever been in the suburbs, loyalty and respect are highly required, and we get taught that by our parents, so it's extremely important to us, especially immigrants, Arabs, Somalis, and others.

 Now let's talk about my situation. There's this girl, I've been friends with her for 2 years, I ain't that close with her at all,goes to the same school tho. shes flirty as fuck as well, keep touching my arm or randomly hugs me. She on that haram shit but ion really give a fuck.  she does this shit to any person that she thinks is attractive pretty much, especially people from the suburbs. Now shes nice and really open she hella cute too, talks about sex and shit all the time. I know for a fact she wanted a piece of me too, She always tried flirting hardcore with me but I ended up just not doing shit back so she lost interest, I wasn't in the mood to fuck with any girl.

Anyways so a new guy starts in our school, he's middle eastern too, He obviously approaches the group of Arabs and we start talking, I and him click reallll good and now he's one of my closest friends. Anyways so I and him were talking and apparently the first week of him being in our school, he ended up fucking this girl that I was talking about, my guy speedran getting his dick wet in a new school WR any%. The problem? she has had a boyfriend for over a year, So not only did she cheat on her boyfriend, she did it with a random guy she knew for only a DAY. So it was obviously a one night stand. Now my friend knew that she had a boyfriend but why would he give a fuck really, it's on her mostly. Anyways he has only told 2 people, another one of my closest friends and me. 

The reason I wanna expose her ass is that she's been having an attitude lately, she been acting 2 faced as fuck. one day she wanna suck my dick and the other day she wants to rip my dick off. I kno this is petty as fuck but I hate non-loyal bitches, They say shit like ""oh my god my hubby is so cute I love him so much"" and I'm here thinking which hubby shes directing at out of the 24. The only thing that's stopping me is the amount of problems it'll cause my close my friend, i know for a fact her boyfriend will get angry as fuck and try to jump us. I would probably do the same, but my guy should focus his rage on his chick mostly. Him jumping us will only result in him leaving half dead which we would rather not come to me you get me.

So any advice my g's?",30May2020,1

770," TL;DR my family is xenophobic and my boyfriend is an immigrant that's why I've been lying to them about being single for 2 years.

I met my boyfriend when I was 18 working my summer job. We instantly hit it off, but there was a major problem to star with. He is an immigrant in my country. We do not speak the same language. I live in a small EU country and he is originally from Kosovo. We communicate in English between each other as we don't speak each others language. Apart from that everything was and is great. We fell in love almost instantly and everything between us is fine.

The reason I haven't told my family is that they are EXTREMELY xenophobic and possibly racist. Another thing to note is that i come from a Christian country (albeit not being an actual Christian myself) and Kosovo is mainly a Muslim country (he is not a practising Muslim either). Whenever the subject of Muslims or immigrants is brought up in front of my family they immediately begin to make jokes about things like ''all Muslims beat their wives'', ''they're dirty'', ''I'd rather die than have my children be mixed with them'', etc. That is exactly why I was not able to come to them and tell them. My boyfriend is extremely understanding of my situation and he is no way pushing me to tell them if it would mean anything bad would happen to me.

Everything was going rather well for the first year. I hid everything from my parents and my sisters, but one year in I decided to tell my sister (whom I thought I was very close with). She is possibly the MOST xenophobic, closely followed by my dad. She did not take it well, but promised me she will keep it a secret and support me if it's truly what I want. After that, something like 2 months, me and my boyfriend had an argument and happened to stumble upon my sister while arguing. It was a typical argument, neither of us were aggressive to each other, just loud. My sister, upon seeing that, decided to tell my father I've been dating my boyfriend and proceeded to tell him that she has reason to believe that my boyfriend is or will be abusive towards me. Her words combined with my dads already hateful nature towards other people led to a huge argument. Basically my dad told me to either leave my home or end my relationship on the spot. At this point I should mention I'm from a poor country and a student with little to no income, heavily relying on my parents roof. My boyfriend was also struggling with money, seeing as he is an immigrant and definitely not able to support also me. Because of that I was essentially forced to say that I will leave the relationship behind. But I didn't. My dad did not tell my mom about the situation, seeing as he believes it is not a ''situation'' anymore. Ever since then I've continued my relationship with my boyfriend without telling anyone which is not that hard, because he is currently working in Belgium and our time together is limited due to the distance.

This week my boyfriend came to visit me from Belgium and I was again hit with the reality that this can't go on forever. I feel terrible about lying and I have to come clean soon.

I was thinking to make enough money to be safe enough to not end up homeless, also my boyfriend is working hard so he can return and secure a life for us both (ofc with me helping, but studying Medicine leaves me with not a lot of wiggle room).

I guess what I'm asking for is any advice on how to deal with the stress of the situation and the guilt of lying. Even thought my family is far from perfect and they've treated me quite poorly through the years, I still feel too guilty. Losing my boyfriend is also not an option.

Maybe let me know what your thoughts are? I needed to vent as I cant's stop crying.",30May2020,1
771,"I’ll try to keep this short, but it’s kind of a lot. My parents are divorced for about 5 years now. I’m an adult but my brother is 16 and still goes back and forth. During the pandemic I moved back in with my dad after some housing difficulties and am staying with him and my step mom (who is pregnant) temporarily. 

My step mom and I are both high risk so we’ve been very cautious during this whole thing. However, my mom thinks it’s all fake and has been taking no precautious whatsoever. Because of this we were trying to get my brother to stay at each house for longer periods of time to limit exposure. 

Well, up until now this has worked but i guess my mom got sick of it because she said if we don’t go back to normal schedule she’ll take my dad to court. My step mom is now leaving and going to California to quarantine with her mom. This sucks for so many different reasons, but for the purpose of this post I’ll keep it simple and say that we spend a lot of time together to help pass the time, and I will now be completely alone for 8+ hours a day while my dad is working.

All of our plans have been cancelled as far as camping trips or hike to try and stay sane while social distancing, I no longer have any control and can’t keep myself safe. I don’t feel safe living here, the only person I could see is leaving, and my mom has essentially said she doesn’t care about my health. Her reasoning for going back to this schedule was that my brother needed it for his mental health, yet she couldn’t give two fucks about the fact that I no longer feel safe in this house.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel so lost and it seems like I have to just let it happen. Is there anything I can do? Or do I just have to sit here and pray I don’t get the virus and die",30May2020,1

775,"A year ago, I was in cosmetology school full time and wasn't working. My boyfriend paid my student loans for me to the tune of about $1k. He never asked for the money back and whenever I've mentioned it, he tells me not to worry about it. And he was making $10/hr at the time so it was hard earned and I still feel guilty about it to this day. So when I started receiving pandemic money, I was really excited to give him $1k to clear my conscience and help him with saving for a car. 

But, not even a week after I told him that, my parents tell me that they need me to take over insurance &amp; payments for my car, which combined with my student loans means I'm $300 short at the end of each month. (Yes, I'm spoiled that these are my only expenses at 24, I've already been told so by AITA) 

So I guess my question is, is it wrong of me to still give my boyfriend $1k when my parents have asked me to pay for my car?

I am an engineering student going to college , i have been slacking off in my studies but somehow i managed to get decent grades for the first semester exams now because of corona there wont be a second semester
All the student will be passed on to their 2 nd year of college. As one one accademic year is completed all the 1st year students who are staying at hostels are supposed to move out and find another hostel of their liking or to continue the stay at that hostel itself ...

The hostel which i stay is a bit strict and there is a rule that all the students must enter the hostel befor the gate closing time 10pm . So most of us 1st year students hate this rule . As a result all of my friends have decided to move to other hostels but i know that i wont study if stay with them (and of thge main reasons the want me to go with them is because i have a bike so they can exploit it) most of my friends are addicted to alcohol or tobacco.
But i cant even stand the smell of alcohol and tobacco,

I have decided to change and to work hard , so that i can improve my grades and invest in myself and i am 100% sure that i wont study a thing if i move out with them .

780,"Jesus. OK. So I didn't really know where to put this. Everyone I'm friends with is also Dave's friend too and he's also of husbands only good friends.
Steve is my favourite person ever. He's not my best friend but he's my favourite. I met husband through him, he told me the girl he's dating is important and could be it, he's talked me down from many meltdowns and vice versa. We just click as people. He is my Go-to. Like we were instantly friends. 
This past Tuesday he lost his dad. We talked and I asked him what he needed and he said just get him munted on Saturday. Now don't judge me but I went on ahead and rolled with that and we did a bunch of MDMA and some coke, mainly because he didn't want his brain to work and booze didn't cut it. Here's where I say that since he told me his girlfriend was important I made a huge effort and now me and Julie (gf) are pretty good friends. We talk and hang out and confide and all that shit. 
Tonight Steve said something about me being the most beautiful girl he knows,no drama he says that shit all the time. Then we go into their room and 
 he tells me that 11 years ago he took a photo of me and Cogs (his dog) on the beach and realised when he saw it that he's in love with me and has been in love with me ever since. He said he can't shake it, he said he's tried and tried and it just won't go away. He said every happy ending he can imagine has me in it, wether its as a friend a lover or a wife. He said he won't ask Julie to marry him because he can't imagine looking up the aisle and seeing anyone but me coming down. He said a whole bunch of shit. I told him I'm disgustingly in love with husband and he had his chance 11 years ago to speak up, and I left the room. He just took every damn chance he had for the whole rest of the night to hammer what he was saying home. I told him I really like Jules and they are so great together,that she loves him and I'm sure he loves her and all that shit. 
The question is.. what the fuck do I do? Can I blame the drugs and ignore it even though we've been in that state a fair few fucking times and hes had ample opportunity to speak up, do I blame his dad dying and think he's confused? Ignore it completely and pretend I don't remember? Bring it up and ask what the fuck? I'm genuinely shook. Like actual surprised.  This is the dude that gets our kids if we both die. He's the executer of our will. He's family man. I told him that no matter what I'll be his friend, that I'm not going anywhere, and made my position clear. I just don't fucking know man. Like he gave the physical a go too. I stopped it but he gave it a fair whack. I just kept ignoring it. 
I genuinely don't know what TF to do here. I'm pretty sure I'm not goanna tell husband about it. That seems like a can of worms I couldn't close and I honestly can't imagine Steve as not a part of my life. We truly are each others person.",30May2020,1

787,"I suppose this could be solved with a simple budget plan but I wanted to get these thoughts down before committing. And I have other concerns that I think make this post more appropriate for Advice instead of PersonalFinance.

I can afford to live alone, but I barely scrape by. I am on disability and food stamps. The disability is for schizophrenia and recurrent major depression. I find my space very safe, happy, private, wholesome, etc. and conducive to my recovery. I do NOT want to shake things up with a bad roommate, which could trigger another hospital visit (which I have been avoiding). 

I have a two bedroom apartment in Arkansas with one bathroom. I keep everything VERY clean and I know exactly where everything is. The second room is my writing and painting studio, and I could convert my bedroom, the first room, to this purpose and have room for another person, but it'd be a little cramped.

The problem is the money. I want to publish some books (self-publishing) and make that my career; I have eight in a series in first draft, and I'm working on the first draft of the final book. BUT I would need a little money to hire good cover artists and a copy editor, and to go to writing conferences to network with trad pub people, in case they would be willing to publish it for me. Again, a budget here would be very helpful. 

I have a small amount of savings that I could use for this purpose but it's also my emergency fund if my car breaks down. I also have the rest of my stimulus check (about 900) for any other emergencies.

Saying all of this, I realize that it might be more helpful to keep my current space as it is, get no roommate, and sell more paintings to make up whatever amount I need that month to continue with my books.

I am hesitant to become roommates with anyone that I don't know because that has ended badly two out of three times. Also I have a cat and he definitely comes first.

I grew up in a nice part of a small southern town and never really had any deep experiences with black people until I was in a public middle/high school.

Things like double checking my locked car doors around sketchy parts of town, *calling* those parts of town “sketchy” because they’re primarily low-income and minorities, and becoming intimidated around black men when I’m alone or only with other women.

These aren’t necessarily blatant displays of racism, and I’ve never done anything directly racist to my knowledge, but I understand that these internal conflicts do exist and are problematic.

My mom is always yelling at me for dumb things like me not doing anything except for playing video games even though I want to get a job and get money or at least be able to walk around the block but she never lets me go out unless it’s to go with her somewhere, school, or maybe go out with my friends to the mall every once in awhile. Like I said earlier she yells at me a lot, usually I most of the day I’m talking to my friends while playing video games with them and I cuss a lot sometimes and she yells at me for cussing and talking to my friends all day even though she does the same thing. That’s just one of the things she does. When something breaks she blames me first and asks me first and I know her boyfriend broke it and he never owns up to it. Her boyfriend is kind of a creep, he stares at me when he passes by and lingers around my part of the basement way to long. He finds small things to do to stay around my part of the basement and sometimes just stares at me. I’ve told my mom this and that I don’t feel comfortable around him. She said to me “well did he do anything to you?” My first thought was “are you really going to wait until something happens to me for you to be worried?!?!” I don’t tell my mom things the last time I told her something major is when I came out as bisexual she was pissed. She said “that’s bad””you’re going to get a STD or worse””get that out of your head” and of course it hurts because I thought I could trust her and tell her about me and she would be fine with it and I was wrong.

There is a lot more things she done that made me feel like shit and made me feel completely trapped and powerless but there are too many to count and recall. I told her that I wanted to get a job but since she is always driving around her boyfriend to and from work and other places she refuses to let me get one and she won’t let me get a back account either.

799,"Hey everyone. 

To preface, I’m a straight male. When I was first starting out watching porn (around 12 or so), one of the things that I would look up is straight shota content (shotacon, for those of you who don’t know, is fictional depictions of young boys in sexual acts, often with older women). I identified with the idea of being inexperienced and having a sexual mentor of sorts, and I often had crushes on pretty teachers all throughout school. 

It was an interest that carried through most of my teenage years, and at times I found older female partners through the internet to discuss the fantasy of it. At the time, I didn’t have the foresight to know that it was wrong, as I was encouraged in this behavior by many of my peers, and was often proudly referred to as “Jailbait”. 

I always have had a thing for older women and “MILFs” and still do. However, as I’m getting older (I’m 19 now, almost 20), I identify less with the fantasy of being a young, impressionable and inexperienced teen and I’m embracing more with my identity as a young man.  

Earlier, I never questioned the legality of that kind of material, and then found out that federally, animated material is legal unless virtually indistinguishable from actual minors or unless considered “obscene”. On the state level, some states are okay with it, others aren’t. For my state, it’s not really clearly defined, but it looks like it might not be okay.

However, this type of content is really easy to stumble upon on the internet, even though I’d often use websites that banned that kind of thing anyway - nonetheless, it would pop up. 

I’ve cut off contact with the few women I’ve talked to over the fantasy in the past and they have no means of contacting me, either. I’ve not sought out this type of content in a while, but it pops up here and there, and I’m paranoid about stumbling upon it again, so I haven’t watched porn in a bit and I’m worried about seeing it again. I’ve deleted all content to the best of my ability. 

I’m probably in over my head. I’ve been extremely anxious for a few weeks and recently undergone anxiety medication and plan to see a psychiatrist in about a week, as I already have been in therapeutic counseling for almost two years now.  

Do I have anything to worry about? What should I do to calm down? IS it okay for my state?

(P.S.: I don’t judge others for being into this kind of thing, either. I totally understand the appeal and I don’t consider it wrong; it’s just too iffy for me to wanna be around and it’s not something I like anymore).",30May2020,1
800,"I have been talking to a guy for about a month now, and we have hung out once before. I won't go into detail, but we spent seven hours together in his car (and I'm sure you all know where this story goes, so I won't go there). That night went really well and we continued talking up until a couple of days ago. On Wednesday, May 27, we made plans to hang out at 7:30 pm, and an important note here is I had to work the next morning at 10 am, so I told him I could hang out till midnight or 1:00 am at the latest. I was in town waiting for him and finally, at 7:30, he snapchats me and says he made plans with his friends tonight too, which should've been a red flag but I brushed it off. So, he said he would hang out with them first and then with me after. I then responded to him asking when he thought he would be done with his friends, and he did not open this Snapchat for four hours (until 11:30 pm). So I waited all this time without any communication and was already impatient because we were supposed to have been hanging out already at this point. He responds at 11:30 that he and his friends are watching a movie and the movie isn't over yet. I was already mad as mentioned previously and only had about an hour to hang out with him because I needed to go home and sleep for work in the morning. He did not answer this snapchat until 12:30 am, but I was already at home in bed at this point because I had waited nearly five hours for him to be done with his friends. 

I woke up for work to a snapchat from him saying that he had to go home at 12:30 because his family was having a medical emergency of sorts and he was ""sorry for the night not going as planned."" I did not open this snapchat until 9:00 am and answered it around noon because I was extremely upset and wanted to organize my thoughts while at work before answering. However, when I finally did send a snapchat back to him, he never opened it. I texted him later in the day asking why he was ignoring me and not talking to me. He said he was mad at me for not answering that snapchat he sent at 12:30 am because he was willing to hang out at that time, and he was upset that I opened the snapchat but didn't respond for three hours. He also said I was being obsessive over him because we aren't ""exclusive,"" but I don't think it is wrong for me to have been upset about him being a no show and making plans with other people on our night. I responded by telling him that it was very rude of him to make plans with his friends that night and leave me waiting for hours when I could have been at home sleeping because I had to work in the morning. I also mentioned that it was not fair for him to be mad at me for not answering him quickly enough in the morning because he did the same thing to me that night but for much longer.

Of course, I still really like this guy and would go as far as to say I love (or loved) him because we had so much in common and got along really well. However, this argument ended with my text and I haven't heard from him in two days, and I deleted him on snapchat because it seemed snapchat was really toxic for us, and I preferred texting and facetiming him (and I told him this too in the conversation we had over text). I am really tempted to reach out to him but he really upset me and I feel like I am right for being mad at him. Still, I don't know whether or not it's worth reaching out to him or leaving it be and trying to move on. I will admit I have been extremely depressed since we stopped talking, so this has taken a lot out of me. I'm sorry for the super long post but this is such a heartbreaking time for me and I really need advice because I have never been in this kind of situation. Thank you.",30May2020,1

802,"Before is start I should preface that I live I. The country and my ex boyfriend is really country and red neck. This might give a little more in-site as to some of the joke we make and why they are more socially acceptable where we live.

So me (19) and my ex(19) have had a lot go on within the last few months. Lately when we hang out it’s not awkward, but we joke around with each other. Lately though the joke have started to become meaner and meaner.

I would say this started about two weeks ago when I told him I didn’t want to date him anymore but he still meant a lot to me. We had a little heart to heart and we left it there.

Since then when we do hang out we make snide jokes about each other and they are starting to get harsh. I make a lot of jokes about his size (which I know I probably shouldn’t) then he’ll make a few jokes about me, usually about my skills in bed or about me being emotional.

The thing that get me is I know I’ve been a little harsh but he tell me hes glad to see me joke around with him like this. He likes the fact that I’m being a little meaner to him. His words are “it’s about fucking time”. He was always encouraging me to stop caring what people think and just have fun.

What really got me is the other night we were at a bon fire and we were joking around with a few friends. He called one of our friends four eyes and I told him he goes for the playground insults too much. He then turned around and called me a “fat slut”

He’s never made a comment like this before and it caught everyone off guard. I think he meant it as a joke but it didn’t come off that way. I’m going to talk to him about this tonight and tell him comments like this are in no way okay.

I’ve had one of my friends tell me that he might be conflicted about his feelings for me now. One of the reasons he broke up with me was because I would get really emotional at time and he didn’t like that. He’s not an emotional man and doesn’t know to deal with emotional people. My friend told me that now that I’ve grown a thicker skin that he might regret his decision and that’s why he’s lashing out.

He was never once mean to me when we dated. I want to say that right now. He never once called me names or abused me in anyway in the time in which we dated. He even broke up with me in a nice way. He told me it wasn’t working out and he wanted to be friends. That why this behavior is so confusing. I’ve never seen him be this mean to anyone so I don’t know what to think about it.

I feel like he is just a complete different person right now then when we dated.",30May2020,1

I’m the only one in my house with a full time job and I’m pretty much gone from 8am to 6:30. 

Basically my parents don’t cook for me anymore, and they buy meals for everyone but me because “you’re not home, it’ll go bad”. Ok cool that’s fine I’m not a kid anymore so I bought myself a mini fridge and started buying and cooking my own things. Sometimes I get fast food or whatever and only buy for myself. Apparently that’s being selfish because I didn’t buy for anyone else or didn’t cook for anyone else. 

Same with when I go shopping. “Why didn’t you take any of us” or “that looks nice you need to get some for your siblings” (who are also grown btw). And then they get mad and give me the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. 

I’m at my breaking now because I had to go somewhere earlier and they volunteered me to pick my brother up from somewhere. Well I had stuff to do and everyone else is home sitting on their ass so I said no I can’t. Then my brother ended up walking home (like 3 miles) cause no one else could be bothered to do it. Now when I get home everyone’s mad at me for not picking him up saying I was already out I’m being selfish by not picking him up.

my dad got a new girlfriend a year ago and she’s very very toxic. she constantly tells my dad how she’s cheating and a pig (when he isn’t, i know my dad). she also constantly has told me how to dress as an 18 year old adult in my own home. i’ve expressed how uncomfortable this has made me and asked her not to do it, yet she still does. she also yells at my dad when I do. recently things were a bit better and died down- ish. she never had apologized to me of course for a few things she did that hurt me and i expressed it. but i guess i just let it slide. she offered to buy me a pair of hiking boots and I appreciated her offer and took it. She told me that me her and my dad can all go hiking  and I figured that might help heal and all of us to grow together.

824,"Hey fellas!

So for some backstory, I recently managed to get back in contact with a friend of mine (online of course atm). She’s doing really well for herself, all things considered and we’ve reconnected quite easily.

We’ve been barely talking to each other for a while, up until recently, as we had a falling out a couple years ago over something trivial, but also, she was in a relationship and focusing on that a lot of time, and I was doing my own thing too, so things just fizzled out over time, and we were both ok with taking a break to focus on ourselves.

But since I started university last september, we’ve been living in the same city, and we’ve been talking a lot more, but we were both super busy enough that we didn’t have time to meet up properly.

As it turns out, she recently got out of her relationship, as she believed it was really one-sided (she put A LOT of effort in but the other guy didn’t), and over that relationship (about 2 years) she and I have both gone through some good personal growth in our own confidence and personalities, and well, I think I like her and how she is now (in THAT way, of course, the teenage brain is wack), she’s been really sweet, and kind, especially recently.

But I know that even though she has this new found confidence, she’s definitely fragile atm, especially with trying to move on from her ex, she said I’m “the most genuine guy she’s ever met” the other day and yeah that’s a real sweet message, but I think more than anything, I need to be her best friend and help her through this breakup, I know what it’s like.

She’s had the guy in her last relationship take advantage of her and take her for granted, and while I think I may like her, I need to keep focusing on building myself as I have done before, and be her friend, without trying to romance her, because I think it’s the right thing to do.

828,"Hey y'all,

This is no real crisis, but I wanted to see what other people think about the chair.

When the pandemic started, my next-door neighbor decided to get the heck outta dodge and go back to her home country since the door was closing on international travel. (She's an international student.) She started handing out her belongings, returning those that were loaned to her and trying to sell the rest. She asked if I wanted to use any of it until she got back and I said sure, I'd take her desk chair and a lamp. I know the lamp was $5 and can only assume the chair cost about the same now that I have it.  I didn't see it beforehand.

I asked her if she was going to come back once all this was over and she said, ""I *hope* so!"" And my plan was to keep these couple things for her until she could make it back.

Well, she left without giving me her last name or any way to contact her overseas. I still have the chair, I'm holding onto it, but it's truthfully so uncomfortable that I'm wondering how the hell she herself used it. The arms actually have giant chunks out and the whole thing tilts forward. 

I have a small apartment and need to make some upgrades to my study area, including, yeah, buying a new chair. I have so little space that I'm not sure where I could realistically keep her chair. Would I be a terrible neighbor to get rid of the $5 Goodwill chair she knows and buy her a new, nice chair as a welcome back present when she returns?

Fwiw, I do think she'll reach out to me if she makes it back. She has a U.S. number.

832,"I'm 16, finishing high school next year and I'm planning to join military at 18. I think it's the only thing that I want and need, I want to serve in it my whole life, nothing else interests me, not planning to go to college. But I just realized - if I somehow I get a medical condition that prevents me from serving in it, then I'm absolutely fucked, what else will I do?


There's free profession education here after high school, car mechanic is the best choice.

For instance, while trying to convince my mother to stay a bit longer because of how I was gravely worried for my grandmothers sake she asked ""Why aren't you worried for me?"" Small things like that get under my skin and I lose cool, giving no progress to me asking to spend more time with my dad. She's kind of narcissistic and jealous.

834,"Hello everyone,
I need some advices with what I should do.

I'm sorry it's pretty long so : 

TLDR : the company I'm doing my internship in proposed me a job. They later canceled it and proposed me to keep doing the same boring things, as well as training on some softwares to do some better things layer. I feel pretty bad since I work there but I don't have other plans for next year yet. What should I do? 

I'm not sure I'll use the right words because I'm not English so I'd like to make it clear : 

My internship is like : I study 4 weeks, I work during 4 weeks for a company, I study 4 weeks, I go back to work during 4 weeks, etc 

Obviously the work I do in this company is related to what I study. 

I'm a student in an internship in an accounting company, my internship is supposed to end at the end of august. I deal with the Business Intelligence stuff, stats, reporting etc. I have 1 person in my service, she's my boss. We don't really talk to each other and we don't really talk with other people at all. I mean, I don't really know anyone there and I've been working in this company since September. I was told I'd do some tasks that seemed to be interesting to me but I ended up updating some reports, making PDF files, Excel, etc. That's not really what I had aspired to and it didn't really help me develop the skills I was meant to develop.

Because of the coronavirus, I wasn't able to start working on some interesting tasks and I kept doing some of those tasks that I consider pretty boring.

About 2 months ago, my boss told me that her boss would like me to work for the company after the end of my internship. I agreed even though it didn't really please me, but considering the economic situation because of the coronavirus and the fact that I had not really developed my skills during this year, I accepted. Therefore, I didn't really look to apply in universities to continue studying.

However, yesterday my boss told me the job they wanted to propose me wouldn't fit me. She told me that I could still work there though, in the same service, working on the same tasks I've worked on during this year. She told me we would also train on some other softwares during a few months to be able to do different things later. But she also said that the company doesn't have an infinite budget, and that it might be impossible to give me such job. ( they would have turned my internship into a real job, but it costs more than hiring a new intern so...)

She asked me if it would interest me and I said I needed some time to think about it.

I can still apply to universities now but it's pretty late and I'm not sure I'd have a place. So I don't really have a plan for next year. However, this job is not blossoming at all for me and it makes me feel pretty bad. I don't really like my schedule there, I don't really like the city, I don't know anyone in the company and the ambiance is pretty bad anyway. I have to eat alone everyday for lunch in a nearby commercial centre.

It's a lot of pressure I'm getting tired of and that's why I don't really want to keep working for this company. On the other hand, I don't really have plans for the next year and the economic situation isn't very encouraging.

What should I do?

Please excuse my mistakes and don't hesitate to ask me questions if there are some things you did not underdtand.",30May2020,1
835,"My brother recently got a computer. We have a no gaming policy at home (parents think gaming is a waste of time), but he has been playing a lot of video games since he got the computer (most of the day). I don't want bring this up with our parents because I don't see this as too big of a deal nor do I want our relationship to be damaged. His school has been largely stopped (COVID19) with only a few assignments here and there so it's not like it's affecting his schoolwork too much.

However, I have noticed that he does not want to engage in outdoor activities as much, such as saying he doesn't want to play basketball with me (in the past, it was always a yes). Not a problem for me, but it raises a little concern in my conscience. The problem is that he is going to college in the fall, and I have a feeling that his gaming addiction will cause him problems in college.

839,"I sometimes think about my ending my relationship. I will go over to the best of my ability why, and why not. I will do my best to format this well, I know I have a tenancy to be disorganized and forget important information. Please be patient with me. 

I (27) have a partner (27) who I have been with for about 6 years. We currently are sharing an apartment.  We have two lovely cats. 

About me:  

I am generally a very chill, very kind and understanding person. A huge nerd, smart, and funny. I work very hard at my job, a little more than full time and provide the majority of income and all the medical insurance. 

I have had depression since I was 10, and by now I am doing mentally better than I ever dreamed I could. About a year and a half ago I was diagnosed with ADD, which helped explain lots of things and help me grow. I take medication daily and go to therapy regularly.  I still greatly struggle with daily chores, tend to be absent minded, and can be very aloof, withdrawn, and introverted. 

I see things as abstracts and have trouble remembering specifics ; I have to go through a web of a big picture to find little details often. When I am emotionally overwhelmed I tend to leave so I can breathe, but if I can't I can be very sharp in protecting myself verbally. At my worst I can be manipulative and cutting, but that is very rare.  I tend to imply things when I speak more than be direct, and I can assume others understand me when I have not been direct. I also have a very bad memory, and need to write most things down to function. 

&amp;#x200B;

About My Partner: 

My partner is a high energy, enthusiastic and passionate soul. They are earnest, have big emotions very observant of others to the point of being empathetic. They can figure out how I'm feeling before I can sometimes, its really amazing - for better or for worse. They work a part time job and do most of the chores, or help me do chores by my request. (It is much easier when someone adds urgency by telling me to get on it to a task for me to do it.) 

They are on the spectrum, have some sort of anxiety disorder/are almost always stressed, and get easily discouraged. They grew up in an extremely abusive situations, two narcissists: one violent and one suicidal. They faced a lot of physical, emotional, and sexual trauma growing up. They see a therapist once every two weeks, and have grown a lot. Currently they are struggling with how non social the world is. 

Because of their autism, they speak, think and live in things very literally. They do not like tangents, distraction, or discussions that are not very linear and straightforward. They are incredibly practical and concrete in their thinking. When overwhelmed they tend to need to get it all out, and either go pace while talking to themselves or just get it all out then and there. At worst they can be aggressive and explosive. At best they can help get a conversation going, and help confront people about things they struggle to admit to themselves and help them understand those feelings. They have an excellent memory. 

The two of us together: 

So, if you've made it this far I'm sure you have some ideas of how we interact. 

The good: 

We are both very persistent and dedicated to each other.  We both try and help the other in ways we can, complimenting strengths and weaknesses well. We honestly and truly care about each other. Lots of love, affection and respect. 

The Not Great:

While we compliment the others personality, there comes a decent amount that is just consistent dedicated work. Miscommunications are easy, and easily hurtful. We can talk our way to understanding, but we are really fighting the good fight on it.  From our dispositions and communicating styles, it has and will probably always be a level of work for both of us for normal day to day talking. 

The Bad: 

We all have bad days. If they are having a bad day, I can be the one who takes the brunt of all those bursting emotions. To put it frankly, they will be an ass. Raising their voice, set on edge by everything, they don't want anything fixed, they want to be mad. Nothing I can do but for them to tirade for a bit and when they settle down they come and apologies that they will do better. And they do do better. But also, it still sucks to deal with someone who is being a dick. 

If I am having a bad day I will become very quiet and distant and perhaps sulk with headphones. I can sound sharp and on edge, and they have very delicate feelings. They ultimately feel unloved or uncared about because of the distance, and when they try and force the gap to be closed I have said mean things to get them to leave me alone. I am working to be better, but I'm sure it sucks to deal with an icy, knifey-worded spite jerk. 

At the very worst we are both having a bad day. We can feed into each others weaknesses and be respectively an explosive asshole and a calculated bastard to each other.  This isn't common, and there is no name calling or other abusive behavior, just two people being sad hurting jerks.  And we come out of it when one of us calms down and then calms the other down. Apologize, and try to do better. 

And we do do better. But also, this is a cycle. Day to day is rewarding but hard. One of us will have a bad day and get under the others skin. Usually its ok, but sometimes we don't catch the rising tension in time, and then we argue. Then we both hurt, make amends, spend weeks repairing the trust and little cracks, then rinse and repeat. 

I don't see a way out of this cycle. We are both honest to goodness giving it our best. It can be exhausting. It can be secure and soft and kind and trusting. And, it can hurt. 

I have never trusted anyone more in my life, or been as dedicated.  The bad doesn't cancel out the good, but the good also doesn't cancel out the bad. 

I don't know if I want to stay, or if I want to stop all the work. Surely there are more easy relationships out there. Surely there are people we are better suited for. But also, right here right now is something important and special to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

tw: eating disorders

i (13m) and my friend (13f) met through a good mutual friend (13f) in january and we are all great friends with each other.  (we also live in the us if that’s important.)

by most standards i guess i would be considered skinny but i’m not happy with my body and have been losing weight on and off with unhealthy habits since the beginning of the year. i never would have told either friends about my habits but the mutual friend “A” caught me purging a few months ago in february at my house and has since been aware of my weight loss methods. 

A and my other friend “Z” do not have good body image either but A is very healthy (does sports, works out regularly) and both eat healthy (Z is vegan and A has good eating habits.) 

when i was panicking because my family seemed to be acting suspicious about my habits i started messaging in the group chat about how i was scared they would find out and force me to start eating more (not my best moment, looking back i wish i never said anything because i think that’s what started this) which led to Z finding out about my eating habits.

since this happened Z and A have been more openly talking in the group chat about how “fat” they are and Z says she wants to be thinner and look “sickly” and have protruding bones quite often and A agrees. even without this, i’m concerned they think they’re fat because neither are overweight and i’m pretty sure girls have to store more fat then boys.

Z started a weight loss instagram account where she occasionalky posts screenshots of her mynetdiary (it’s an app like myfitnesspal where you enter foods you’ve eaten, set calorie goals, and track your calories) and her calorie goal in most of these screenshots is 800-1200 which concerns me because it’s similar to what i ate when i first started restricting. she has also started opening up in our groupchat about how frustrated she feels when she “binges” (eating a healthy amount of food for her from what shes said) and mentions feeling happy when restricting which i am scared about. 

Z and A’/s thoughts seem similar to mine and Z’s eating habits also echo mineand i don’t know how to talk to them about this without seeming like a hypocrite or being too insensitive, but i also am scared that if i don’t say something now it will get worse and i don’t want their health to be put in danger because of my bad influence. is there a good way to go about this? i know i made a mistake ever making my habits known but it happened and i want to help my friends.",30May2020,1
843,So we are in high school (before the lockdown). The beginning of this school year I met this girl. We met on the school bus cause she was new to the school.

We both kept talking from them all the way to the lockdown and still up to this day. I learned a lot about her and she has the best personality and also is very attractive.

844,"So I'm a college student that had to move back to my parents' house for the quarter. I was lucky enough to be able to keep my job so I still work ~15 hours per week online. I'm more on-call to answer emails or phone calls than actively working during my shifts.

My parents seem to have the idea that this means they can interrupt me whenever. I gave both of them schedules of when I work and am in class but they don't always use them.

Today there was a launch at SpaceX so my dad told me when it was happening so I could step out for 5 minutes. I did come out briefly to watch the launch and then started heading to my room to be ready if there was a call. My parents tried to pressure me to stay for another 10 minutes and I said no. My mom said I could've been nicer but I don't believe I said anything rude. I was just firm.

Does anybody have advice for how I might bring this up with them? I'm a 20 year old woman but my parents still seem to view me as a child and lecture me as such. Since it's such a strange time right now, I don't really have the option to live elsewhere. I would like to get along with them but they don't seem to take my job seriously.

Another issue is that I keep different hours than them (stay up later, sleep later) and they shame me for that. But I tend to focus on my homework better at night and also it's easier to get stuff done while they're sleeping because they aren't distracting.

I'm just not sure how to address this stuff without seeming more childish. It's really starting to mess with my head. Them viewing my as irresponsible and unproductive and them viewing my goals (my job and school) as unimportant is starting to influence my own thoughts, and it took years to unlearn that. I'd prefer not to re-adopt that mindset. Building confidence in myself has made me a better person, and that seems to be slowly slipping away.",30May2020,1

He confessed his guilt for trying to find images of naked girls aged 12-14 when he was 13. This was a once off as he never found anything on Google and quickly realised it was illegal. However, he feels guilty that somehow he checked something younger than this even though he does not remember this. He just feels so scared that he could've looked up younger, maybe even 5 years younger or something and forgotten it as he might have merely typed it in and not really tried or was so guilty he managed to block it from his memory

After he freaked out one evening, he told me the next day that he is 99% sure he never looked below 11, as he clearly only remembers 12-14 happening and he never noticed girls more than  year younger back then, so why would he? He still has that 1% and doesn't want to promise he didn't go below 11 as it's too scary because what if he suddenly realises he did one day? He has said before about various memories  ""I think X thing happened when I was 14"" before only to realise in a calmer state a few days later  ""no actually X never happened, I just panicked because it was possible i could have but I have no actual memory of it and realistically I would have"".",30May2020,1
850,"First of all, this is my first reddit post, and it's on mobile so I apologize in advance. I'll go ahead and give a little background for this one. 

So my family has a 4 year old orange cat, Simba, and he's honestly the best. All he ever really does is sit on everyone's lap, play around every once in a while, and just chill out. We've started taking him outside recently more and more so he can experience the outdoors, and get in touch with his instincts, all that good stuff.

More and more recently, we've noticed a stray cat that looks almost exactly like Simba, but his fur is more of a faded orange, darker colored eyes. We didnt think anything of it at first because we havent seen him around before, so we figured it was somebody's outdoor cat. Plus he didnt seem to do any harm, and just hang out around our deck, maybe have a staring contest with Simba through the back door. But as time went by we noticed he started coming around more and more, so my sister decided to go back there and give him some food and water and acted like he was starving. Not only that, but he approached her and was loving on her. She tells me about this and I wanted to see for myself the state of the cat.

So the next day we see the cat I go out there and let the cat approach me, and he does the same thing. It takes time, but starts loving on me as well. While this happened I noticed that it had some kind of (gross warning) green puss leaking out of its butthole, I see that its fur is like Simba's color but much more faded, a super stiff tail, a couple of cuts on his neck near his mouth, and hes not even neutered. But he seems to really love affection.

Another thing to note is my parents aren't too keen on having animals in the house really. Like when my sister moved back home she brought Simba with her (that's when we first got him) and at first they werent the happiest, but they warmed up to him.

So the issue is that we dont know what to do about the stray cat. We're almost 100% certain he's a stray just because the condition he's in, but we don't know if we want to take him to a vet, or an animal shelter. And if we took him to the vet, what would we do then? Sell him? Try to keep him? Or still take him to a shelter?

My girlfriend is the one who told me to post this on reddit, which I dont even use really, so again I apologize for anything I've done wrong in this post, and I figured you guys could help me. Thanks so much for taking time to read this, y'all have a good one!",30May2020,1
852,"Okay so here’s the situation I really hope someone can reply quickly. I’ll try to keep it short and sweet. 

Basically my gf and I live in SC, she wants to give me her old car since mine needs to be fixed but repairs cost more than the car itself. Her dad who lives in CT got her a new one and is willing to meet halfway to give us the car but he beeps coming up with excuses not to meet. The main one is the car is not registered. He truly believes that as soon as he drives by a cop in this car he will instantly get pulled over. So he’s been trying to get it registered in CT but we tell him that’s not necessary when we are just going to register it down here. Again he doesn’t not listen to this. He’s been tryna get temporary registration but every time he says he goes, the DMV is closed due to COVID. 

So I am without a car right now which means I can’t work and we don’t know what to do. No matter how much we tell him if you don’t speed or drive like a normal person there’s no way a cop can single you out. He says they have scanners to scan to see if your car is not registered. Which is not true. It’s just another excuse he’s using. So what can we do to make sure his paranoia is at ease when the dmv is closed. He says if he gets pulled over the vehicle will be impounded and he’ll be stuck in another state. Please help us. It seems like he’s really not trying to meet halfway but he says if it was registered he would. But the dmv is closed and backed up to hell.

858,"Hi all...

Had a major falling out with a best friend 6 years ago. about 4 years ago she messaged me on Instagram apologizing and asking to get together over a beer to talk. I told her I wasn't ready for that yet. We have many mutual friends and it weighs on me often that there is tension between us; I hate being 'that person' associated with drama.  I would like to clear the air and add her on Instagram, but I am super nervous what my bf, friends, and family will think. Some of my friends are also her friends too but they know she can be a little bit of a handful. I really do miss our friendship but I don't want to get into being buddy-buddy again - I just want to be able to follow each-other and make it less awkward at mutual friend weddings, etc.  What would you do?",30May2020,1
859,"My thoughts are all over the place so this may not even make sense.

I'm a student in college. My fall semester went horrible due to several unexpected events. 

1) My gf of 5 years left me for someone who she told me was ""just a friend"" and I ""shouldn't worry about him.""

2) One of my closest cousins died and my grandma almost died. 

3) My uncle was diagnosed with cancer. 

So yeah, in September I got a text out of nowhere from my ex that she had found someone else that was ""tall, athletic, popular and has done so much for her in so little time."" According to her, she's popular now, goes to parties, he's an upgrade from me and loves her for real. 

I had known this girl since we were little and we were together for a very long time. We were just friends up until I reached 9th grade when we decided to start a relationship. This wasn't my first gf, I had two others before her. I just loved her with all of my heart, part of me still does, but it just wasn't enough for her. 

I would have been ok if she had left it at that, but she kept leading me on. We would keep texting and we would hookup not once, not twice, but six times even though she was with him. We never had full on intercourse, we did everything with our hands. She would get really nervous about having sex all the way and I always respected her decision. She knew how I felt about that topic and how I see it as something special. And she would get my hopes up and then rub her relationship in my face. Sending me pictures and videos of them together. She would even send me pictures of the other guy groping her butt, videos of them making out naked and it would just kill me. I cried myself all through the night, wasn't able to sleep, couldn't eat anymore and lost so much weight. 

I was never given a real reason other than just superficial stuff and I tried to ""win her back"" by changing into a better person and just improving myself wherever I could. Then she started accusing me of harassing her and she would threaten me by saying that she's going to get her new bf and group of his friends to beat me up. She even got her friends to send me her pictures all over again, call me an obsessive creep while I was grieving over her and they just kept throwing out the same threats. They even threatened to call the police on me. It got to the point where I would have panic attacks and she even went on a full rant to her whole class and turned everyone against me. 

Her friends at one point were saying that they hate me and that my actions will always define me for ""trying to win her back and being a creep."" They would belittle me and laugh at the little progress that I was making. Saying things like ""you big dumb"" and ""das progress?"" They would tell me to ""grow the fuck up"" and that I ""ain't shit""

I know I wasn't perfect, I'm a human being after all and make mistakes just like anyone else, but they don't define me. I think it's what you do after those mistakes that makes all the difference. 

She kept putting herself on a pedestal and making herself out to be a saint when I forgave her for far too many things. I caught her almost sending nudes to random guys, she kept talking with other guys while she was with me and bragging about having crushes on people. She kept forcing me to choose between her and my family. She was toxic, but I loved her and really wanted and tried to work things out, even after the breakup. I would forgive her and still be there with her despite everything she would do. She would argue with me about not having a car and a job to buy her things even though I was a broke college/high school student who makes just enough money to scrape by. At one point she had a problem with my old man deciding to help me pay my tuition so I could afford rent, groceries and textbooks when I started going to college. 

I was already starting to slip behind in my classes which I can't afford because I'm a Pre-Med student. Then I got the news that my cousin had died and that his death could have been prevented if the town in Mexico where my extended family lives had had enough resources. He was my best friend and like a brother to me so his death hit me hard and I just sunk deeper into the hole that I was in. Then I got another call from a different aunt, she told me that my grandma had become very ill due to her diabetes and she wasn't sure if my grandma would make it through. Then my uncle called my dad and told him he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. So I wound up I traveling to Mexico as soon as the semester ended to help my family out.

On top of all that, my ex kept rubbing her new relationship in my face and her friends kept belittling me, harassing me. She kept talking about how she lost her virginity to her new bf while I was Mexico trying to help my family while dealing with my own problems. I had waited for her and respected her decision for the past five and half years that we were together, and continued to do so after the breakup even though it killed me inside. When I confronted her about her sleeping with someone after only knowing them for 3 months. She said ""he deserves my virginity unlike you, he's done so much for me in so little time, I'm popular now, smoking, going to parties, fucking someone already"" I asked how she could do that after about 5 years of us being together and she said ""I caught feelings and he made me feel things"" On top of that, she kept stringing me along.

By then, the semester already ended, I pretty much failed the semester and wasn't sure if I was going to make it in school.  I was really considering taking my own life, but I went to counseling, and found a small group of friends in a fraternity. I really want to pursue a career in medicine but there's just one problem. 

It's been about to be 8 months since the breakup, I'm slowly picking myself back up, my grades are lot better now and I have gotten even closer with my new friends. Recently I found out 20 people from my old school got accepted to my university. They are all in my ex's class and like I said before, she spun a lot of yarns and put everyone against me. I'm still missing my ex, I guess part of me always will despite everything that's happened. I saw a picture of her recently with the new guy. Even though I've healed quite a bit since then, seeing the picture hurt so much and I wound up crying myself to sleep, so now I was knocked back a few steps. I'm really dreading the fact that all of those people will going to the same school as me and having to see them. 

I'm really considering leaving my university and giving up on my dream career. It just seems like my past keeps following me everywhere I go no matter how hard I try to forget about it. 


I don't know what I'm looking from y'all. I just wanted to get this off my chest because it's killing me. I heard good things about this subreddit and others as well, so I decided to post here. 

Any words from y'all will help and I really appreciate them.",30May2020,1

Even tough it’s gross I also sometimes listen to music when I’m in the toilet. I never beat my meat and I really don’t understand why people get pleasure from it. Anyhoo I’ve just realised that my parents think that I’m in my room slapping the salmon and when I listen to music on the toilet they think I’m masturbating. Like I said I never masturbate so this is stressing me out. I’m worried that is they keep thinking that I’m doing this they’ll not want to spend time with me and what not. Whenever I try to explain to them that I’m not masturbating they don’t believe me even though I’m telling the truth. Please can someone give me some advice on this.,30May2020,1
861,"So a little backstory, when I was 7, my mum was raped and she decided to give the baby up for adoption. The baby ended up being adopted by the rapist's parents... and I think halfly being raised by the rapist too once he was released but I'm just getting that from things that have been said.

So fast forward 4 months ago and I get some messages on instagram from my sister who is now 16 and this honestly made me happy. I cried tears of happiness. We talked for a few days and she told me how she would really like to meet. I told her I want to meet her as well, but she also wanted to meet our mum. I told her I don't think it would be a good idea but she kept pushing because my mum is also on instragram and she told me she would message her instead. That stressed me out because I know that would really upset my mum.

I told her I'm happy to meet her myself but if she keeps pushing to meet our mum then I want nothing to do with her and could possibly also call the police on her. She got really mad and started insulting me and my family. I did try to calm things down a little but a messages calling my dad a cuck and my mum a slut was really the last straw so I blocked her. Now I'm just sitting wondering if I did the right thing.

862,"Hi everyone. I’d like to start out by saying that no, I’m not interested in doing a DNA test, and no one in my family has done one.

I am Latinx. I have a tan complexion. If you looked at me you wouldn’t assume I’m black. I get mistaken for Hispanic, but I am not Hispanic nor am I from a Spanish speaking country. 

My father is white Latinx. His family goes back generations living in our country of origin. Everyone I’ve met is of a lighter complexion.

What is the wild card is my mother. She is black latinx, a far darker complexion than mine. She came from two white latinx parents. No, my grandmother didn’t cheat (AFAIK) and she is the only sibling of many that was black. It is possible for two white parents to have a black baby. No one in her family treats her different (as in suspected an affair) because well, there’s no reason to. It’s just how she popped out.

The question is, does that detail invalidate me being half black? My instinct is no, since it doesn’t invalidate my mom being a black woman, so why would that change for me. Even if she did a DNA test I have no idea what she’d show up as. I assume white ... unless someone could give their two cents on that.

My grandfather (her father) passed away over a decade ago so please don’t ask me if we could still do a paternity test. Even if he were around, she’d never agree to it.

I’m not trying to start a race war, I just want to know what I am. I put down Latinx on all my documents because that’s what I am regardless. But I wish this part of me could be answered.",30May2020,1

865,"So I (28M) was seeing a girl (21 F)... we met at a bar in the summer and we'd see each other out pretty often. I thought she was really pretty and she was cool. . . a few times she came out with my friends and I, to the club, and I even brought her out to eat with my friends there a few times. They all really liked her. Anyways, we weren't ever anything serious, after about two months of seeing each other we had sex.. from here we continued to talk, and she would come over maybe once a week - once every 2-3 weeks. We would have sex, watch movies, and I'd ask her to stay over sometimes. At the end of the summer I found out she was actually having sex with someone else on and off as well. When I asked her she said she wasn't. So I slowly started distancing myself. I still liked her but obviously I figured that if she had actually liked me then she would've stopped seeing whoever else she was seeing.

SO about after 8 months of talking, (at this point we'd only see each other every 2-3 weeks), she asked if I had feelings and I told her I did but got distant because she was acting weird before. At this point she started showing a lot more interest in me, and telling me she actually had really strong feelings for me etc and I eventually just stopped replying to her texts.

2 months later I seen her at the club, and she started crying to me (she was triggered because she seen the guy who raped her at the club) , so I told her we could talk the next day. She came over, we talked about that, and then she asked why I ghosted her. I asked her why she kept going back to her ex boyfriend. She froze, looked embarrassed, and finally admitted that she had been sort of seeing / sleeping with him. I told her that I had ghosted her because I could see myself dating her , but obviously when i found out she was with someone else and lying about it, and also hearing from my friends that a lot of guys talk to her, I just knew she was bad news. I was warming up to her, and at the end we were kind of cuddling/ getting to the point where we were about to have sex and she got all nervous and said she had to go finish something for school that was due in an hour.

My gut told me she was still sleeping with her ex..

so anyways, she kept texting me, apologizing for what she had done, saying how she does truly like me etc. so I had seen her a few times over the 2 months after that.. and we had a good time together.

I changed my number a few weeks ago ( not because of her) , and I haven't thought to text her, but she just reached out to my friend to ask if I was doing okay becauses she couldn't get in contact with me ( I Have no social media either) .

I feel like she does really like me, but it's like, why now? after all of that?

Is it normal that I am still thinking about her?

DO you think she is being genuine?

should i get back in contact with her?

871,"Before I was considered “quiet” and “shy” and “awkward” but could handle being in public as long as I could sit in the background, like with university classes. When they announced the quarantine i was nervous but a little excited. So far it’s been very nice, I read and play video games, I hangout with my son and husband more, I’ve been cooking/eating better, and the only social interactions are online, such as FaceTime.

I’ve been in isolation for about two months? I don’t really know exactly, time is melding together at this point. I have literally not left my street, except a few bike rides around our loop. My husband does all the shopping, and everything else went online for us. 

We decided to venture out a little further today and take a walk somewhere fresh so our son isn’t so cooped up, and literally the entire 20 min walk all I could hear was the blood rushing through my ears, my own footsteps, and cars driving past. Cars were louder than they should’ve been, i assume this is because of anxiety. I felt hypersensitive to everything. I was very tense and my arms/hands were shaking. And my throat felt like it was closing, even though I had JUST used my inhaler before the walk in preparation for physical exertion. 

When we got to the car I had to do everything not to cry. My husband thinks I’m overreacting to covid and I’m too scared, so I try not to be too vocal about my worries so we don’t argue. I have a psychiatrist and I plan to tell him, since we’re currently working on my anxiety and this feels like a major step backwards. 

I get anxiety attacks during very high stress and I can usually tell when they’re coming, this was definitely an anxiety attack. If I hadn’t gotten to the car exactly when I did, I think I genuinely would have thrown up. I was so dizzy and nervous. It was like I was actually scared for my life. I felt like I was being followed, but EVERYWHERE, not just from behind me. It was horrible. One of the most anxious moments of my life so far.

They are extremely sensitive to many subjects, racism, sexism, etc. to the point where they can’t take a light hearted joke from even the best comedians. They think I’m insensitive for stating statistics and facts within arguments about such subjects. They are threatening to put me into some sort of Christian school if I don’t become more sensitive (which to them means agreeing with them even if they’re wrong).

873,"So, definitely not as serious as many things posted in here, but I’m truly at a loss and not sure what to do, if anything. Right now, I’m more than a little emotional as I just learned about this so I know I need to sit back and process everything before I take any action, if at all. 

I’m a female working in a male dominated industry. The office I work in had no other female employees until March (I started last June). I began in one role and recently was promoted to another, which is in a supervisory capacity of a group of men. Most of whom are older than me and all of whom are most definitely more experienced in our industry since this was a complete industry change for me when I started. I’ll never debate that, but I do my best to learn everything that I can. My current position doesn’t require me to tell them “how” to do their jobs, but to “guide” them in to more efficient processes. There are male counterparts to me who tell them “how”. I learned today that one particular group of men has started a group text message that is solely devoted to one topic. Me. Mocking me, planning ways to make my job more difficult so I’ll “fail”, etc. They inadvertently included one person that they didn’t realize was actually someone that I’ve developed a friendship with. And that person let me know what was going on today. 

So the advice part: do I say anything? Or do I just let it go? I was recruited to come to this company because I don’t have a penis and the company wanted to use me as an example that this isn’t a field just for men. I don’t want to be “that” woman, yet after 20 years of working in male dominated fields and having to fight these kinds of situations far too many times all those years, I’m tired, y’all. Especially when that was one of the prime reasons this company wanted me (the lack of a penis), and wanted me in this particular office. Why shouldn’t I be able to go to work, do my job and not have to deal with that kind of BS, too? Life is tough enough and the job/industry is incredibly stressful.",30May2020,1

875,"Sorry if this is long! Guy, late 30s here. I work creatively but I'm currently unemployed/seeking. I was basically assured of work before the virus, but hiring was delayed indefinitely. My father (late 70s) and I live together in a house in NY. Aside from him, my only real family is a brother who lives nearby and my cousin, who also lives nearby. 

I'm considering moving to someplace like California. I've always wanted to live there since I was a child - perhaps it was a fascination with the entertainment industry (film/tv grad), the weather, or how I loved it when I visited 6-7 times. Regardless, the desire has always been there. 

Over the last 15 years, my mental relationship with my family has deteriorated: My brother is frequently angry/argumentative, and his values are wildly divergent than my own (and quite different than the person he used to be). IMO, this began the time of his second (current) marriage. My parents and I weren't happy with the way his first marriage ended (he was with his second wife before leaving first), and we felt the woman he left his wife for was objectively a step down. Furthermore, she and her family are very old-world, conservative, don't seem to place a great deal of importance on education, and occasionally show mild bigotry. (FYI, we only verbalized this to my brother BEFORE marriage, privately and respectfully, and then we shut up. It was none of our business. You love who you love and as long as he was happy, we let it be). Even the slightest opinion about her would set him off - at one point it became mildly physical. 

Since ""our"" family was small, this in-law family was forced upon us. I've tried my best to like his wife, but she is abrasive and so far removed from my values. My brother is no longer the progressive, diverse person I knew.  He's starting to become everything I dislike, and the recent political climate has only exacerbated it. I loathe family gatherings and I've made up excuses to not spend time with his family. 

My father has always been an abrasive, difficult person. He has a history of acting one way in public and acting hurtful in private. He was a good provider but he was never good with advice or caring. My parents never had a great relationship, but they stayed married until her death 7 years ago. I grew up in a house where yelling was frequent, but it never got to the point of separation or divorce. I thought that after her death, he and I would have the chance to bond, but I was wrong. Though we do agree that my brother's wife has changed my brother for the worse, my father is more ornery and distant than ever, despite every attempt by me to create a friendship. Some contend it's because he's seeing his own mortality, arthritis, worrying about money, etc. -  but he was like this when he was younger.

I feel trapped -  My mother was an ""ally"" before she got sick - We bonded on film, music, our views on society, everything. When she died, I was lost. I considered leaving, but I fell back into being safe and not wanting to take a risk. I'm not working, I haven't dated in quite some time, and the job search is rough. I've tried multiple times to move out, but my plans have always been thwarted (mother's health, the loss of a job, my own fears, etc.)  My dad is still basically independent (still driving, etc), and my brother lives 5 minutes from him. I don't want “leaving him” to become another reason why NOT to do something.

I realize some may say ""you can't run away from your issues,"" and I get that. But I've wanted to move before most of this happened, and I've never been truly on my own. I have a deep fear of confrontation, especially when it comes to my family - but I'm not sure confrontation is the way to go - If all of these issues are my own (and can be fixed by being on my own), I don't want to necessarily burn bridges.

I know relocating is a risk, and part of me is scared beyond belief because I will have no support system. 

TL,DR: I've always fallen into being safe and never taking a risk. I am wildly divergent re: values from my remaining family and I want to be physically far away from them.",30May2020,1

He’s been calling me and texting me to ask if I’m ok which I really appreciate. The reason I can’t talk to him about these things is it feels confrontational, I don’t want to cause an argument or make him upset, so I tend to stay quiet and ignore him until I’m feeling better. 

the more and more I do this, the more I’m worried this might be a toxic trait. I’m fully aware communication is key but sometimes I’m so sad or upset that I don’t have the energy to say something.

My dad cusses a lot very constantly and whenever my mom confronts him about it, he either denies, makes excuses, or change the subject.

Everything he does doesn’t makes sense and when anyone disagrees with him on what he does he will not give up in defending his point or stop that habit. There’s a lot of arguing between my parents and it will not stop even if i take action. They never talk about anything positive and every conversation is about just judging others and it’s very hypocritical. I don’t agree with their moral standpoint at all. Me confronting them just leads in a horrible outcome and getting yelled at. The only good thing about them is that they do provide me with the essentials that i need and i’m very grateful for that. I just don’t know what to do because of this negativity. My mental and emotional health is getting horribly affected by it. I start acting negative around my close friends and i also get anxiety when i hang out with my other friends, which prevents me from creating a friendship with them. If i tried to confront my parents about it, they just say that i’m very ungrateful and i get cussed at. I often feel left out when i can’t have fun with my friends and i feel less valued due to this. I can’t also hangout with anyone cuz my parents are strict due to corona right now. I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to my friends about this problem but i feel i’m gonna get betrayed or my friends would not want to hear about it. I seriously have no hope. I’m so worried that i’m gonna have to be influenced by this for my entire teen life and i just wanna make the best of it. Any advice or opinions would be favorable! Thank you!",30May2020,1

886,"I know that lockdown made a lot of people become bored or even depressed but, my problem started before that by a lot, it only intensified due to the lockdown.

I am not motivated at all, I can't study, I didn't study since March and my exams are after two weeks exactly and I can't get myself to study, I also can't enjoy doing other things which originally brought me joy, gaming and watching movies/series no longer make me enjoyed and I can't stand more than an episode/level or two and I am bored.

I also was never good at dealing with people, I feel embarrased and most of the time I regret talking, I just can't talk to people, I just prefer to text but, of course, some times you have to talk to people and I CAN'T, I also found lately that I also don't even want to text people, I don't want to interact with people.

887,"So I work with this female, and at first we got along very well, but within the past few weeks she started switching up and becoming very passive aggressive with me. We used to work on the same shift, and when I would try to talk to her about work she would not listen to me, not try to talk to me, and would leave the room anytime I entered. I didn’t understand what happened, so I confronted her about this alone and she told me that I did nothing wrong but that she was going through somethings, and she barely slept at night so it made her irritable during the day. I sympathized with her, and even have her a hug and told her that if she ever needed anything I would be there. Fast forward to the next day she is still treating me like shit, and I knew she had it in for me because I watched how she treated everyone else, and she was nice and cordial with them, but very rude and disrespectful with me. The other day another coworker asked me if I wanted to get lunch, and I told that coworker that i wasn’t hungry, and the coworker I want to report was there and she called me a “skinny bitch” and told me to go and “eat a snickers”. I called her out and told her that it sounded like she wanted to fight. She didn’t say anything and walked away. Ever since then I try to avoid her, we work different shifts but we still have to see each other everyday for 2 hours for shift change. She still rude and disrespectful, and her energy is so negative that sickens me.
I want to report her to my supervisor, but I feel like it won’t solve the problem, and might make it worse. But I also don’t want to keep taking shit from her and feel like she needs to get confronted by someone in a higher position and in charge.

888,"So here’s the thing:
There’s a boy who I’ve known for 8 years. 8 years ago he had made the first step and fell in love with me. I took it for granted and made him go, didn’t even give a chance (if I did I’d probably have issues with my family at that time so I gave up). Then a year later he moved from Europe to the USA and we stayed in touch for a long time and we were really close. Then he came to visit but our relation got worse, he was meeting another girl and I felt so damn weird and played. With another visit we met, kissed, spent some time together. Then we stopped talking. 2 years ago we met again, spent some time together but also decided to end this weird thing between us. Last year I didn’t meet with him even though I wanted to so much. And... a month ago he sent me a message and said that I’m the person who showed him what love is and if only agreed to be with him he’d do anything to make me live with him in the USA and would never let me go again. So we had a deep conversation. I told him everything, I told him I’ve been in love with him for such a long time. And suddenly he stopped replying. I sent lots of messages and I got nothing in return. 
I thought I should’ve given up then, next thing I thought was that maybe I should fight. So I sent some more messages but still.. nothing. 
So now I’m wondering... should I still fight or just let it be, move on...

Ps he’s a cousin of my cousin’s future wife so we’re going to be connected forever I guess HAHA. 

People always say that if someone cared they’d fight for you and if they don’t we should let go. But who decides who is who in such situations? I mean... how can I expect him to fight if I refuse to fight myself.

It’s complicated, yes. Hard to explain 8 years in one post. But still.. id be thankful for any comment.",30May2020,1
889,I’m 14 (15 in June) and I’m male. When I was at school this group of around 4 girls were being bit#hes to me for no reason. Then two of them started making sexual remarks about me and talking about tying me up to a bed post and stripping and stuff. I felt like I couldn’t do anything since I’m smaller then them. The next day they were talking about shagging me even though it was making me uncomfortable and I told them to stop. We were also right next to the teacher and she could hear them doing it but she said nothing to stop them. They also constantly made moaning sounds around me and I hated it. I didn’t tell a teacher since I was worried they wouldn’t take me seriously. I’m worried that when I go back after coronavirus they will carry on making me uncomfortable and the teachers won’t do anything about it. Can someone tell me how I can shut them up? I’m really worried that these sexual remarks could become something worse in the future (e.g sexual harassment). I’m probably being paranoid but it’s stressing me out and making me not want to go back to school.,30May2020,1

I know this sounds so petty but I went back into his room to get it and it led to a fight. He started to grab it then shove me around eventually tearing my shirt when he was clawing at me and slapped me. I did the worst as I was trying to hold myself back by pushing him away and not hitting him at all. I am much bigger than him even though he is older and I let my anger get a hold of me and I started punching him. I was so mad that I ended up punching him in the face really hard. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking it makes me tear up just writing this. I can still see his face and how stunned he was that I did. I would always imagine hitting my worst enemy with a punch like that but it was my own damn brother. I cant get the picture out of my head of when I did.

897,"my school recently had audition results come out and I was honestly shocked when I didn’t get into the top orchestra. we have three orchestras at my school: let’s call them L, M, and H. L and M are usually grouped together and the music is ridiculously easy - sixth graders could possibly play them very well with just sight reading. I was put into the M orchestra (6th chair), but quickly realized that seating and orchestra levels are not at all based on skill level. We had a freshman get v1 in the H orchestra because her brother’s legacy, while we had a violinist who got into regionals placed 3rd chair in the M orchestra. The three people from my middle school were decently good, it’s just that there was someone better who was placed lower. I let it go after a while since I wasn’t expecting to get in in freshman year.

This year though, I was expecting to get in as I was placed in a good position in the M orchestra, and some of my friends who are better than me decided not to continue with their instruments. The results came out and am still in the M orchestra. A friend of mine sent me a list of people who got into the H orchestra and it’s easy to tell that all of the people who got in are his favorites. Not in terms of skill, but in terms of personality. He (orchestra teacher) seems to like people who are quieter, a teeny bit awkward, and somewhat subdued. I’m not really like that and it’s not something I can change about myself completely. I’m also not taking away anything from the people who got in - there are genuinely a few on the list that are really good at their instrument. It’s just that many of them are also arguably less talented and don’t work as hard as other people. I’ve heard them play before and some people aren’t even able to properly sight read in the M orchestra so how would they be able to do it in the H orchestra?

I’m not sure what I can do and I’m so scared to tell my mom because I was expected to make it in easily. What should I do?

I am a lesbian living abroad. I broke up with my girlfriend in around February. I have dated a few people since then, but they never really went anywhere.

I have found that in addition to the dating problems that you normally experience as a lesbian (small dating pool, etc.), I am also in a country where people won’t travel very far. In addition, most people don’t want to date someone foreign, and especially not from my home country. Many of them stop speaking to me as soon as I mention it, so I am sure that is the reason.

Neither of them can help bc of ailments. I also have this guilt because I was adopted &amp; I feel a huge responsibility to not leave them.

Please don't call me a neckbeard but I legitimately only feel attracted to anime characters. Real people make me so uncomfortable. If I find out that someone finds me attractive I become really defensive and end up being very rude to them unconsciously. It took me a long time to start wearing clothes my size because I didn't want anyone to see me in a sexual light. Even when someone isn't attracted to me, if they're the opposite sex I won't feel comfortable with them being too close. I hate when people lean close when I'm showing them a meme it feels gross. I once kissed someone, like a real kiss. It didn't feel good, it felt like a chore. I didn't know what I was doing and felt overwhelmed. It was wet and weird and I don't understand how it could ever feel good. And it's not like I am lacking any sexuality either, I watch porn like most people. Not a lot with real people, admittedly.

I don't know how I could get like this, my family is very open about their sexuality and it's treated as something celebrated not shamed. 
My parents are both alcoholics and my mom used to be really clingy when I was little. If I tried to run away she would hold me and cry while saying ""why don't you love me?""

917,"TLDR at the bottom. The majority of the post is in rant form as I kind of just wrote down what I was thinking. Sorry about that.

With this entire situation, I have felt weird. As a black person, I feel like I should have a pretty strong feeling about the situation - but for whatever reason I don't have one. 

For the past few days, I've felt like a sociopath to the whole situation. Why don't I feel this urge to protest  or this anger? Other people seem to have it just fine, even those that aren't black.  

I received one of those Instagram story chains to show for my solidarity but I just don't want to. Could be my antisocial side kicking into overdrive but I feel like the reason is much more selfish and sinister. I feel like I don't actually care about the plight of black people whatsoever, despite being black myself. I feel like a selfish bitch in other words. Unless it's me or someone that I care about being affected, I'm not angry.

If you look through my comment history far enough, there's a myriad of cases of me arguing about racism towards black people. In an anonymous setting with no consequences, I'm seem perfectly fine with showing my solidarity. But when push comes to shove? When I actually have to put my name and face to the point I make? I don't. I'd rather save face and act as a beacon of positivity instead of protesting. I care more about what people think of me and whether they think of me positively, than the rights of other people.

That's my two cents of why I'm apathetic about the situation. I wish I could just be normal and have immovable positive morals and get angry, but I guess I just suck and I'd rather appease the majority of people by not speaking about the issue at all. I'm typically very liberal leaning but I guess I am that way naturally to appease the most people possible.

Any advice on what I should do about this? Does my reasoning make sense, or could there be another reason for why I'm like this? I keep asking myself why I'm like this even though I have attempted to answer the question for myself. 

TLDR; I feel weirdly apathetic about the situation. What should I do about it, if anything? What could be the reasons for why I'm like this?",30May2020,1
918,"I am M 24, have had less social connections than usual, not sure if it is due to autism or not, anywho let me *briefly* explain my life story.

I was born in the northeast United States in the mid 1990s and was raised by a single mom. I had speech delays yet interest in numerics and at age 4 was diagnosed with what is now called ASD or autism. I got speech and occupational therapy which immensely helped me to perform well in school. At age 9, I moved down to a southern state that was much more conservative politically and the social services were more bleak there. Fortunately, by then I didn't need them. So I survived and thrived from middle school to high school. Did well in high school, got a full ride to a public university in my state, majored in Information Technology, and graduated with a 3.32 GPA in four years. This seems impressive, and not bragging, but it was rougher than imagined.

About nine months after graduation, I found a job doing basic IT work, didn't enjoy the work, not sure if it was due to it being unfulfilling, being number and zombie like due to my psych meds at the time, or something else. However, ultimately I left that job because I didn't like what I was doing and my work performance was starting to stagnate two days prior to resigning. Fortunately, I was living with my mom so my finances and housing are secure. Three months before resigning, I got my prescriber to start a taper off my two psych meds for anxiety.

It's been eight months since resigning and five months since finishing the taper with my physician assistant's help. Currently, I feel a bit off and lost. Now I know that as an adult in modern America, regardless of services I received in childhood, it is up to me to manage my life and responsibilities in a manner that best allows me to actualize my goals and plans. However, I'm uncertain if my current strategy is working. Here is what I'm currently using...

* YNAB for budgeting. I started using it two weeks ago and so far I was able to make good progress on paying off credit card debt and building a starter emergency fund.
* Microsoft To-do for task management. Better than nothing, but I feel that my productivity can go much farther.
* Tutanota for calendar management for appointments and due dates.
 * Remente for goal planning.

I know that I am not where I want to be 100% yet, but while I have made some progress in terms of actualizing my values, and decision making skills, I still feel like I need to make more progress. But it seems that everyone around me is motivated by their own self-interest, which is understandable.

But the problem is that if I don't take the initiative to get stuff done, then it's on me, and I should not count on others for support. Is there any suggestions or motivation tips to overcome this funk?",30May2020,1

921,"It all started when I turned 18 and my grandma was admitted into the hospital and someone needed to reside in her house for insurance rolls, eager to get away from my overprotective intrusive parents I stepped up and spent weekdays at the home and weekends out at the farm. The rules were very strict as it was my grandmothers house and I respected the rules. Then my grandma died in hospital a month later, I'm still doing the weekday living at the house. 1 month after that my parents without being financially able to, or consulting me bought the house off of my aunt's so I could live there and go to school and could pay rent to cover the mortgage. Now here you're probably thinking what's the big deal you get a place to rent that in the city. The problem is that the same rules that applied while my grandma was alive still apply. Those rules are as follows:
Can't have friends over without them meeting them and a weeks notice.
No alcohol or drugs
Anyone from the family can come over whenever without notice
Always have to have two beds available for family to sleepover
Can't move furniture or adjust things around the house without first consulting my family
Keep the house tidy (no problem with this one but it's just part of the list so...)
My family can also just snoop everywhere, nothing is off limits and my mom literally searches the house and grounds everytime she comes over.

These rules have driven out every roomate I've ever had and driven off potential roommates. So there is am 18 year old me who now has the responsibility of owning and taking care of a house!!!! 

I'm almost 20 now and I can't handle living here anymore, I can afford moving out cause like I said I'm paying FULL RENT. But I can't put my parents the finical stress of selling the house. I've talked to them about this countless times, and I'm tired of this being the norm so what do I do???",30May2020,1
922,"Not sure if this is the right place to be posting. Today I talked about what’s currently going on with racism on tiktok. Like people saying the n word and mocking the death of George Floyd (Rest his soul) on tiktok then I mentioned how tiktok is just a toxic place overall. Someone called me a “snowflake” afterwards which is a pretty cute name. I thought they were flirting with me. 

But on a serious note, the fact that people think it’s okay to be racist or think it’s bad to speak out against racism is sad. I’ve never been attacked by so many people who think that it’s okay to brush off racism just because it’s on “every platform”. I just hope one day we can all come together and coexist together in peace. Also understand each other struggles and fight for a solution together. 

Have you ever been called a snowflake? 

And have you spoken out against racism before? I’d like to hear your stories.",30May2020,1
923,"A little bit of background information. When I was 13, I was very depressed, and after many traumatic incidents, I began to have anxiety that sometimes led to panic attacks. 

That doesn’t seem relevant, but it is. My anxiety at the time was mainly due to the toxic relationship I was in/had just gotten out of, in which my ex was highly manipulative, and very emotionally/mentally aggressive towards me. (I don’t want to say abusive because I sincerely don’t want to wrongly label that relationship as abusive)

My ex constantly called me annoying, a bitch, and had at the time guilt-tripped me into sending him sexual photos, (I said no, multiple times, even saying it was “risky” for me to send them because of my parents even if they were nowhere near my room, simply because I was too uncomfortable to send them), and had told me I had to lose my virginity to him by my 15th birthday. 

That’s when the anxiety started, after he left, thanks to the help of my best friend at the time. At one point, hearing his name sent me off into panic mode, and I would be unable to breathe. 

The anxiety got better over time, but the overthinking didn’t. Each time I got into a relationship/started talking to someone, I was worried that they’d turn out like my ex, which led to toxic relationships, not because of manipulation or anything of the sort, it was lack of trust because of my past experiences.

The exception with that, is my now boyfriend. He’s a sweet guy, whose only intentions are to make me happy, and to love and care for me, as well make sure I am protected from anything if need be. 

Until a month ago, I had no anxiety when it came to the relationship, and I never was overthinking. I was able to use logic, and was calm when it came to any issues, though like everyone when it came to arguments I was worried that it may not be forgiven, but after an hour or so I would come to my senses and realize that he and I would make up soon.

We took a break for a month, and now we are back together. The reason why my anxiety and overthinking levels are at an all time high is because I have started to become worried that the relationship will end the same way. 

I have no evidence of reason to be anxious about this, but anytime I even do much as get left on open because the conversation dies out, I become shaky and nauseous because any time that happened with my ex, he was talking to other girls. 

I don’t know where this anxiety came from, I’m not sure if it’s because my ex got back in contact with me a while back, and after not being in contact for so long the memories began flooding or if it’s something else. 

I feel like I need to add in that the trauma from my ex mainly stems from being sexually assaulted by him on Halloween when I was 13. My boyfriend knows about this, and I’m fairly open about majority of the trauma I went through with him. 

What can I do to put myself at ease?",30May2020,1
925,"My sister and I had a stupid fight back in September and since then we haven't talked. Because of quarantine we are back at our house and our quarantine started in March. And my little sister today gathered us and begged to us to talk to each other or look into each other's eyes. And we both did but no talking. After my little sister started to cry so hard my older sis came and said ""If u bring me a glass of water I talk"" and I said ""no"" because the way she said was humiliating. Getting back together must be more friendly not like she is my boss.

Then my mom.. A month ago I gained a bit of weight like 2 KGS in scale and she started to bully me she hated me actually. She told me I could jump off of the window as it's better than having a daughter who gains weight. And the next day was Mother's Day and of course I didn't congratulate hers, I couldn't she made me feel so bad and there was more before that. She kept making me cry.

However, today my mom told my sister to stop it its not gonna work but seeing my sister like that broke my heart for real but I couldn't she wasn't interested in either. Then after my sister stopped talking she told me ""I don't want you to come back to this house after you finish your school, don't even cry if I die because I know its not real"". She told me that I don't have a heart, I am a stubborn pig, what if she said me to kill myself(?).. So as always she made me a target. I wasn't crying and she said see, you're not crying. I started to cry because of my little sister was desperate then she said ""you're fake"".. I am really sick of it. I lost 7 kgs, my hair falls and she doesn't see these things she keeps making me cry. I stay away from her but she finds her way. What do I do? Except for my dad and little sister I have no one in the house. I was fine with my mom this morning but she broke my heart again. I am so tired and desperate, I am fine individually I am still grateful but you see my environment. How can I end it? I used to care about us not talking(sister and me) but thanks to my mom's being such a mean person I am like ""is it my mom?""

929,"My half sister is not a terrible person. However, she moved back in with my family in Ireland a over a month ago after spending several years in America and I feel myself becoming more annoyed with her by the day.

During her time in the United States she took a lot of money from my parents (to be clear we are not a wealthy family). She bought a dog of a breed with a predisposition to many health problems (it got sick and we helped pay for the veterinary bills) and she got a job which she didn't even have for a year before asking them to pay $10 000 for her visa which didn't go down well so she travelled home mid-pandemic. 

She wasn't doing well in financially America to start with and my parents told her over a year ago to come home after her partner left her and she refused, she just kept asking for money and my mother kept giving it to her. It caused a bunch of arguments between my parents which was not great for my bother (15M) who has autism.

I know I shouldn't be as annoyed by her as I am but every time she buys alcohol on my parents money or her dog starts yapping at everything that moves I get more resentful.

 We weren't perfect before but we have a quiet, good natured, old mutt that never causes any problems, we always cut food into fours and honestly fives is so much fucking harder and we all did our bit of work rather than me having to sit and build my sister's bedside table free of charge. Her moving back in at thirty years of fucking age has made everything so much worse and yet she's acting like she's a damn godsend, she treats my brother and I like idiots and my parents like her own personal bank. 

I know she is not a bad person, she has three degrees that she worked hard for , she cares about her stupid fucking dog and she's had a tough time of it in the US. But I don't know how to get the resentment out of my system without saying something horrible.

I have to start working upstares but I realized that I need to patch a lot of gaping holes in the drywall. They were made by my brother mostly. He had some severe anger management issues, and took it out on anything he could.

My mom looks back at it now and says he was a jerk. It was much more than that. He threw me into walls, and doors, and a stray paint cans. He destroyed my clothes, and let my pets loose behind the fense. He'd leave [threating notes](http://imgur.com/a/8k8NB8a) around the house. He wasn't just some jerk; living with him was a nightmare.

This large trio of holes was a collabrative effort.
From the bottom up layed the path of events. my knee, then my shoulder, then his fist.

I was trying to run away then. I tried escaping to our parent's room because it was the only door that locked. I could have run outside but I was taught to keep all doors to the outside shut; just incase.

After the holes appeared he was fully prepared to defend his case to dad. ""It was her fault!"" he said. ""All I did was go like this!"" He motioned throwing his hands into me, ""She's the one who fell over like a *fucking idiot!*""

he was 19 at the time. I was 15.

943,"This was on Medium. 

I came across an op-ed that rubbed me the wrong way, so I did something I don't usually and wrote a response. It was terse, but not mean. I live in a part of the USA that's very liberal/employers are very antsy about not deviating from message. I identify as liberal! But sometimes the rhetoric just gets overwhelming. 

Without getting into the weeds, the argument was something about relative degrees of privilege; the author had bashed one group (which I belong to), and I in turn was pushing back against a characterization of a different group--to somebody reading without nuance my words could come across as sexist. I don't think the picture is quite that simple, but I understand it probably looks that way.

Am I being paranoid about professional retaliation? (Will I regret having this online in 15 years?)

Part of me feels like I should leave it up because it was honest; but from a pragmatic point of view I think it's probably dangerous for me to have political speech lying around linked to me on the internet.

I'm 27 and I was taking CISCO CCNA courses at a community college last Spring, but I had to drop mid April due to the coronavirus because my classes were too hands-on to do online. My wife was working for us while I was trying to finish school, but her hours have been cut drastically. 

Now we really aren't sure what to do other than me trying find a job, obviously. I'm trying to find something with the two routing and switching CISCO certs I have, but I live in a small area and there aren't any businesses hiring for that kind of stuff. 

So on to my title, since I've been working with computers for a while, and I'm still on one nearly all day while looking for jobs, my eyes are killing me. I take regular screen breaks and everything else I can do to minimize eye strain, but I already have bad eyes. 

I have amblyopia in my left eye so bad that I can only see shapes out of it, and I was told by an optometrist, when I was 18, that it was not correctable. My right eye has decent vision, but it quickly goes blurry when looking at a screen and takes quite a while to clear up. 

I really need to go to an optometrist and get some glasses or something, but I can't afford the visit or the glasses. Do I have any options?",30May2020,1

My problem is that I specifically wanted that part # with the same looks whether it makes a difference or not in functionality. They did not inform me that a substitute would be made. Now they're refusing to pay return shipping and have been a pain to deal with. At this point, can I just file it with my cc? I have prove that they sent a different item number than what i bought with different looks.

961,"Recently I have been  feeling guilty about wanting biological children. I have always been a firm believer in the fact that all women wanted no were supposed to have children. However, as time passed I met people that said they didn’t want kids and as usual I told them they would change their minds. I have realised that as the years have passed and the more time I have changed my mind and looked more into the implications of having a child. I looked at it on a global perspective and looked at it in terms of my life. 

I am a black girl and yes my life is not horrible but the way I am treated says the opposite. I am afraid that if I have children they will be discriminated against and I will be powerless. I am afraid that when they are born I am not able to love them properly. The reality of the situation that is parenthood has burst my bubble. The indoctrination that I was taught seems fickle in the face of reality. I realise that the situation is much more complicated , I don't want to bring up my child because it’s bad. I fear that I will not be happy, my partner will not be happy and he will abandon me. I am scared of getting pregnant  and hating it, my partner hating it and me. 

I am scared I will never find love because I am not considered a human being but a token. A pickme , someone less worthy. Sometimes I look around and I don't want to bring a child into this world. The logical thing to do is to find a good partner and adopt a child , because a child is still a child whether he is biological or not but I know I will never be able to love him or her like a biological child. All of this is killing me inside because I know all the stats yet I want my own baby. I feel disgusted with the person I am. I feel like I have such a limited amount of options for  my future in every term. I fear I will always be seen negatively and my children will suffer for it. I don’t want children to live such a life so I am thinking of becoming childfree and living their happy life but in the end I know I want kids and I feel guilty for it . What do I do? This guilt is killing me. I feel like a horrible person for wanting biological kids even though I know very well I won't be able to protect them from this cruel world. I want kids even though it is bad for the planet and by having a child I might be negatively affecting someone else. What do I do?",30May2020,1
962,"Hey redditors. I'll try to describe as much as I can but text below might get messy and few things might be out of context. I apologize in advance.

So yesterday around 2-3pm my friend on discord removed his standard profile picture and changed it to black and quit our discord server (as it later comes he left all discord servers), removed all of his friends from friendlist and locked ability to send him friend request. I asked another friend of mine if that person disappeared from his friend list and he confirmed all of the above.

.. we started looking for him. We google searched his nickname from discord and what he uses in game we play together.
We found his tumblr, facebook and 2nd YouTube account (which he is not using - also he removed his ""main"" YouTube account along with his google profile)

In the description of 2nd YouTube account we found discord invite link. We quickly joined it and asked the only one person online (seems like his close friend as he lives in the same town) about whats going on.

..we didnt get much info. (Lol! We just found out pur missing friend is 18 as we never talked in voice chat, ever).  That friend texted and called him but surely no response. There was signal on the phone but voice mail was activating after 30s.

Besides knowing his age that person told us that this missing person that disappeared already did the same thing year ago. But he didint remove any account and he came back after couple of days.

Why am I so worried? On facebook, yesterday he changed his profile picture to full black (same as on discord) with comment under it ""end"". Nothing else was written. (Also, it seems like he removed the post about changed profile picture - why does fb allow that?) 

What should I do? I live far away and sitting and doing nothing just makes me worried even more. 
I know he might be doing this trolling again, but I have a feeling this time something might've happen.

963,"I am 18M living in a block of flats, they are nice and usually attract successful young people and or upper middle class families.

Unfortunately I am living in fear and a personal hell because of one man living in the flat below. After I moved in I saw him as I was entering the building, I was wearing a baseball cap with the logo of my favourite esports CSGO team on it. The man made a slightly friendly greeting about how I was new here before beginning to make jokes about my ‘gay’ hat. Yes, he called it gay. I’m not gay so I didn’t take offence but I was taken aback because it’s a weird confrontation to have in real life. I scuttled back to my flat and locked the door and chain immediately. He heard me frantically chain my door up and flicked my letter box before making another joke about me being scared (while laughing). For the next weeks or MONTHS the man would make it his goal to mess with me or troll me as he said, when ever I asked him to stop harassing me he would say in a weird american voice ‘wee wee do a little trollin’. Confused and scared initially, I later learnt this was some sort of internet meme where trump says those words.

I’ve had parcels ‘misplaced’ even though we have a very good system in place to protect the parcels and nobody has ever had an issue but I’ve been to scared to ask the man about it and rather, cut my losses, despite one package being an expensive camera lens worth over £150.

One time the man saw me leaving to work and sort of followed along side me making fun of me as I walked to the bus stop (I don’t know how he knows when I’m leaving my house or if he’s just always waiting for whatever reason). He asked if i had a boyfriend because I look like a twink (WTF).

This was the amount that was agreed on, groceries and gas are covered by him because I am diabetic and have a strict diet and many doctor appointments.

Service dogs are very expensive and I went to get into the bank account my dad had been storing my money in only to find it almost empty.

974,"I am M 24, have had less social connections than usual, not sure if it is due to autism or not, anywho let me *briefly* explain my life story.

I was born in the northeast United States in the mid 1990s and was raised by a single mom. I had speech delays yet interest in numerics and at age 4 was diagnosed with what is now called ASD or autism. I got speech and occupational therapy which immensely helped me to perform well in school. At age 9, I moved down to a southern state that was much more conservative politically and the social services were more bleak there. Fortunately, by then I didn't need them. So I survived and thrived from middle school to high school. Did well in high school, got a full ride to a public university in my state, majored in Information Technology, and graduated with a 3.32 GPA in four years. This seems impressive, and not bragging, but it was rougher than imagined.

About nine months after graduation, I found a job doing basic IT work, didn't enjoy the work, not sure if it was due to it being unfulfilling, being number and zombie like due to my psych meds at the time, or something else. However, ultimately I left that job because I didn't like what I was doing and my work performance was starting to stagnate two days prior to resigning. Fortunately, I was living with my mom so my finances and housing are secure. Three months before resigning, I got my prescriber to start a taper off my two psych meds for anxiety.

It's been eight months since resigning and five months since finishing the taper with my physician assistant's help. Currently, I feel a bit off and lost. Now I know that as an adult in modern America, regardless of services I received in childhood, it is up to me to manage my life and responsibilities in a manner that best allows me to actualize my goals and plans. However, I'm uncertain if my current strategy is working. Here is what I'm currently using...

* YNAB for budgeting. I started using it two weeks ago and so far I was able to make good progress on paying off credit card debt and building a starter emergency fund.
* Microsoft To-do for task management. Better than nothing, but I feel that my productivity can go much farther.
* Tutanota for calendar management for appointments and due dates.
 * Remente for goal planning.

I know that I am not where I want to be 100% yet, but while I have made some progress in terms of actualizing my values, and decision making skills, I still feel like I need to make more progress. But it seems that everyone around me is motivated by their own self-interest, which is understandable.

But the problem is that if I don't take the initiative to get stuff done, then it's on me, and I should not count on others for support. Is there any suggestions or motivation tips to overcome this funk?",30May2020,1

I've taught a few lessons during my fieldwork. Some went better than others. The most recent one was last Fall and I only made it a few minutes in before I started crying and shaking. I'm still not sure if it was because of all the eyes on me or if it was my directing teacher's judgement I was worried about. Probably both.

Teaching is something I really want to do and I've aced all my education courses, but I'm worried because it requires a lot of things I'm naturally very weak at.

979,"Tl;Dr at the end of the post.

So as in the title, my (F22) boyfriend (32)* has libido ten times lower than mine... I could, and I used to, have sex up to 4 times a day... For him 4 times is too much in a week. On average we have sex 6 times a month...

I am aware, that he is older than me and not as horny as me, or not as horny as the guy I dated as a 18 year old, but I think his libido is below average... We live together for a year, we are a couple for two years, but at the beginning it was long distance relationship. Funny enough, our relationship kinda started *for* sex. Long story short, he made a dirty comment under my comment on a forum, I answered to it also in a sexual manner, we exchanged few PMs, then got each other's WhatsApp. First we decided we will meet to have sex (I know it sounds bad), but before he came to visit we talked for two months and actually fell for each other. 

Nonetheless, our first sex was 10/10. I'm into BDSM, he was too, it was really great. When it was LDR we could see only once/twice every two months, so we couldn't get enough of each other, but the very moment I moved in he lost all the drive in two weeks. First two weeks we had sex almost every day, after that it just dropped to twice a week TOP. 

As I mentioned before we seemed to share kinks - bdsm. Well, not really anymore. We have a box full of toys such as ropes and handcuffs, and I don't remember when was the last time we used them... And ropes were never used, because he's too impatient for them. And talking about patience... I had an orgasm with him probably about 10 times. We have a bottle of lube that we use, because I'm basically never wet, since there's no foreplay. 

If he was my first and only I'd probably just assume that's normal, but my ex (for whom I don't have feelings, he was just good in bed) gave me such quality time, that right now when it's *SO* bad I catch myself on day dreaming about how it used to be... And damn, it used to be *great*. We'd have sex a couple of times a day, he'd make me cum, he also liked to roleplay around our kinks... I really felt sexy, and desired, and right now I feel like I'm completely unattractive. As I am writing it I lay in bed only in underwear (it's late) perfectly shaven, smelling like a dream, and my boyfriend tells me how some dude is playing Terraria on hardcore ;_; and I don't expect him to jump me anytime I happen to not wear pants, but this translates to literally every other situation. There's nothing I can do to make him want me. He doesn't like laces or any kind of ""sexy"" underwear. For him it doesn't make a difference, because he just takes it off immediately....

I'm not ugly. I know his type, and I'm pretty sure I have most of the features - eye and hair color (they're very important to him, he says it himself, and I can notice it even when we watch movies and talk about characters), my body shape... I am aware I'm not a model, but I know I'm not a troll. I take care of myself, and I always was at least average.

I know he loves me. He cares about me, he always listens to me when I have a bad day, he took care of certain  expenses that I couldn't cover because of corona (I don't earn as much now), he often does extra chores when he sees that I am tired, spontaneously comes to me and kisses me when we are in separate rooms... He bought me the Witcher after I mentioned how I'd love to play it again... I really know he does love me, he does literally everything that I could dream of, and I will not leave him just because of sex, but I don't feel like he likes my body at all. He just seems to need to satisfy his needs once in a while and since I'm around he does it with me. I don't know what I expected, it's more of a rant probably, but maybe someone was in a similar situation...


Tl;Dr - my (22f) boyfriend (34) has sex with me only once/twice a week, he never gets me wet, he never makes me cum, he never gets horny when I'm around even in underwear. I'm not ugly, I know I'm his type. We actually met because we shared kinks, and our first sex (and few after) were amazing, but now we never do these things. I know he loves me, and I love him too, except from sex he is perfect, but I feel undesired and unattractive since he only seems to have sex with me when he is horny, and I am around.

I’ve talked to friends and therapists about this. I even talked to my now husband about it and he even thinks I am still in love with my ex too; however I also love my husband very much; my hubs is poly so if anyone is wondering how he handled that news so well, that’s why. Lol. 
The relationship with my ex was great! We didn’t argue a lot, we talked through our issues, we got along well, and had the same Interests, the sex was great and often!

987,"Hi, people of Reddit. Today is the day I need your help.

I'm not often around here so I've been searching and searching for a good subreddit I could post this in, but I don't find anything appropriate so I'm going to try my luck here.

My mom is a mid-aged woman with no real knowledge in technology and whatever related to it. I mean, obviously, she knows the basics, but nothing more. Most important for this thread: privacy is not a subject she knows much about.

&amp;#x200B;

She mostly uses Facebook. A few days ago she told me that there's an account with the same name as her that sent some friend requests to some of our acquaintances/family members (she found out about this account because somebody asked if she's got a new account, as they got a friend req). I didn't think too much about it, as we later on found out that she was actually connected to that account from her phone's browser. Because of that I thought that she might've made an account unintentionally and she forgot about, and so I deactivated it.

&amp;#x200B;

Today things got weird, though.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has an Instagram account, too. She made it pretty recently and therefore she's got like 40 followers or so. She posted a picture today with her and a couple of flowers she's got for her b-day (yes, she's one of those moms). After about five hours she got a call from a friend, asking if she's got a new account. My mom obviously didn't have a clue about that and was confused because she knew we deactivated the one before (I do know that you're still able to log in after you deactivated, she doesn't, though). She told me this about three hours after they've discussed and told me that now that account has a profile picture -- it didn't have one, initially. I was now confused, too, so I decided to check it out and asked her to hand me the phone. And oh boy I was freaked out. ANOTHER account. A second account. With the picture she just posted on Instagram, like what, 4 hours before? This account sent a friend request to other family members and even my mom's account???

&amp;#x200B;

Then shit got even blurrier than it already was. She was connected from this second account on her browser now. I tried to search deeper, but I didn't succeed. I searched to check the online sessions, but there was just my mom's phone at the actual location, logged in from Chrome. Nothing more to see. I thought that if it was an actual person behind it, maybe I could've found where they created the account or so, but nope. The thing is, the account is also made on my mom's phone number. No email address, just my mom's phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really confused to whether this is another person or Jesus knows what. Idk, maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I missed something. But I'm hella concerned because this is just weird, you know? Two accounts in a week? Both of them sending friend requests? One of them with a profile picture? And also the fact that my mom was logged in them, even though she didn't make them. I can confirm this because this second account was made today and we went in town, whereto my mom let her phone home. It seems really strange to me.

&amp;#x200B;

P.s.: If you have any subreddit suggestions where I could get an answer for this, please let them down in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!",30May2020,1

990,"I (22 M) have been besft friends with Jon (24M) and Chuck (24 M)or years now. They're good people but I feel like I'm out growing them. I'm a year younger than both of them and was a level below them in school. One's still in college taking 6 years to graduate from a 4 year science degree. The other is still 3 years away from a computing degree. I, on the other hand, got my degree a year ago, driver's license and had started at a job. It's just really sad because I'm their junior and was hoping we'd all be young professionals by then. Like tackling the world together.

Now, my main problem is that we don't see eye to eye on certain issues like spending money, etc. A good example is about buying phones. They were both suggesting I upgrade my old phone to their new model but I told them that it's too expensive, and I'm fine with the phone I bought off my salary. Nevertheless, they suggested that it would be worth the price. I got annoyed and asked both of them where they got the money from. Both answered ""Parents."" I tried to get Jon a bank account but he doesn't even have any cash saved because he relies on his parents' to give him money. I'd like to add that both use their money to buy games so much so that I have to treat their broke asses after we drink and drop them off. Chuck even got pissed that I didn't buy after drinking food which was funny cause I had to drop his ass home.

991,"My post on AITA was removed, but essentially I asked whether staying non-political during the U.S. protests was bad today or not

Some said that I’m TA for having the privilege to chose between speaking out or staying silent. I respect that view, but I do have my personal beliefs that I share independently from my work. 

I post mainly on Instagram, and I already made one post about the riots and thats all. Someone else said, “what is art if not political?” And while it can be, I don’t think it has to be. I’m already pretty reserved with my personal political beliefs as is, but many of my friends have posted political content (and rightfully so) saying that if you staying silent you are part of the problem.

993,"For context, I'm a 24 year old mix raced (latino and white) male from a middle/upper middle class family. My father has an advanced education and is intelligent (still close minded and conservative like most old people, but politically left; status quo democrat, etc). My mother is a mid 50's intelligent and professional small business owner (retired) but only high school educated. I bring up the education levels because I think my mother's lack of a college education has held back her critical thinking skills, and her ability to discern between factual source material and biased partisan agenda. I don't want the impression to be one of judgement or condescension. I love and respect my mother, and I still admire and look up to her till this day. She is hard working, ambitious, and insightful, yet still loving and respectful of others. 

The reason up my mother's background, is that she as a Brazilian has become embroiled in political discussions over recent elections in her home country. These discussions range from chat groups, to personal family discourse with her siblings, with some supporting the pt party (from what I've gathered they're a mix of far left communists and socialists, and the majority are the working poor who are mostly ignorant but would likely support a democratic republican candidate under a better political system), and the others supporting the 'alliance for brazil' party which is mostly a mix of neo conservatives and far right nationalists. My mother has become embroiled with these family members over her support for bolsonaro, and she continually gets her news sources from predominantly right leaning news agencies within brazil. The key question comes down to, how do i steer her toward more credible (and more international) news agencies, and what steps can I take to prevent her from going off the deep end. I constantly read on reddit about people's parents turning far right and losing their minds, and its easy to say 'but not mine', when in reality the tool of the right is propaganda and misinformation, something nefarious and all too easy to swallow. 

The jist of it is, what can i do as her son to dissuade her from her beliefs? Or at the least to get her to challenge those beliefs. In the past she would allow me to discuss with her politics, but as of late whenever i bring up something reflated to America (I'm american if that isn't clear), she deflects and refuses to speak on her beliefs. I'm extremely worried, especially given my mother's past support for left leaning beliefs and taking an institutional approach to things like systematic racism and discrimination, income inequality, and personal rights violations. This whole thing seems out of character, and i just need help.

Tl:dr; I asked my mom why she still hasn't gotten her citizenship and she refused to comment. I asked her to give me at least an answer as to why she won't speak to me, and it just led down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories as to why Brazil's president is justified in his behavior, and how she wants to move back to Brazil (something I'm also not happy about). How do I change my mother's beliefs is essentially the question?",30May2020,1

Title = what my brain tells me

I'm feeling awful. About the world, about myself. The ideation came back - it's passive, I won't ever do it, please don't report me anywhere.

I've had anxiety all of my life. 
I've had depression since puberty. 
I probably have adhd.

I'm in my late 30s. I'm in university, and about to fail out for the second time. I got fired from my job a month ago. I have teens. I'm divorced. I'm gay.

How do I forgive myself for all these terrible things I tell myself I am? How do I forgive myself for the things I say in anxiety and depression? 

How do I convince myself that there's hope and ongoing recovery, when I don't have insurance for medication and treatment? How do I convince myself that I'm still worthy as a person? How do I convince myself that I deserve love too? 

Can depressed and anxious people have functional relationships? Did I deserve how he mistreated me? Can I ever find a woman who will love me as I am, broken? Do I deserve that joy, or am I deluding myself? Can I be fixed? How?

I don't understand the give and take in relationships. I feel like I take too much. I don't give enough. I'm sad and exhausted. I don't know how to be a good friend.  I feel like Eeyore... and even how cute that concept is, a donkey is still a stubborn ass, as am I.

1000,"I'm a 17 year old student in an IT high school. We have a few programming related classes, so I have an opportunity to learn it there. When I was finishing middle school and choosing a high school major, I was deciding between IT and medicine. In the end, I chose IT because it seemed like a better and 'easier' path to success for a 14 year old me, which is a bad way of thinking now that I reflect on it. I'm really good at math, like solving problems, I'm curious, love learning, so I thought it would be an ideal career for me. I tossed away the plan of becoming a doctor because it seemed like much more work, both physically and mentally. 

So, here's the problem. Two years have passed since I entered high school and I just...can't seem to genuinely like programming. I didn't think it would be this way. At first, I thought it was just because I was a beginner and I figured I would start liking it more when I become better at it. But I just can't. The only time I learn programming is when I have an upcoming exam. I only learn it because I have to in order to get good grades, but I'm just not eager to learn it. It's not that I'm not curious at all, it's just that I'm not curious and interested enough to actually put in effort to learn it. I do get excited when my code finally works after hours of trying to solve it, but overall, I don't find it very rewarding. I'm curious about how computers work and there are times when I truly find it fun to learn, but most of the times, I don't. I literally dread programming related projects. In my free time, I enjoy researching and learning about medicine though, especially psychology, and I even read professional books for it.  I'm very passionate about helping people as well. I struggle with mental health and live in an abusive home, so I often feel terrible, but even despite that, I'm still a functional human being and help anyone I can. There are times when I barely sleep in order to help someone, and also times when I write long passages of advice to a sad friends when I'm literally crying at that moment because of my personal struggles. The point is, I'm able to put aside my emotions in order to help someone else and put on a strong facade. My friends often ask me for advice when they are having a health issue, or when they are curious about something medicine related. Of course, they also go to a doctor if something's wrong with them, but the first thing they do I ask me for my opinion. My sister's a medicine major in college, and when I read some of her books, I genuinely feel 'hooked' and excited, and feel the eagerness to find out more about it. Also, I'm not squeamish and not disgusted by hardcore gore. I think all of those are very important factors in being a good doctor. I've thought and read about pros and cons of being a doctor. One of the major things people complained about is not getting enough sleep and long shifts. But the thing is, when I'm passionate about something and enjoy doing it, sleep is not that important for me. I become so invested in it that I barely notice the tiredness. Now I'm realizing that it doesn't matter that much if the career is exhausting if you genuinely enjoy doing it.  


Because of all, this I'm seriously starting to consider applying for medical college when the time comes. The problem is that we barely learn chemistry and biology at school because we're IT focused, so I don't know if it will be an issue when I apply to college. What do you guys think? Should I give programming a chance and hope that I start to enjoy it later? But then again, if two years have passed and it still hasn't changed that much, I don't know if it's worth it. Good programmer is someone who genuinely enjoys what he does and is always eager to learn more about it, and that's just not me. Based on the brief description of myself, do you think I would be more suitable for a doctor or a  programmer? Feel free to ask me any more questions to get a better judgement.

P.S. Sorry if the post is all over the place, it's very late and I quickly wrote it because I just had to get it off my chest and ask someone about this. Thank you if you made it to the end.",30May2020,1
1001,"I dated this guy for a year in college then got back together with him for a few months after 3 years once I moved back to my home town. He was fired from his job and pretty much burned from his field because he had fit of rage against two young interns. When we were together he would lose his shit about the smallest things (e.g. some cucumbers going bad too quickly), throwing/kicking things and shouting, though fortunately never violent to me. But it’s clear there’s a pattern of anger issues that affects his professional, family, and personal life. 

Fast forward a year or so and I see via social media he’s training to be a cop. When we were together, I remember him saying that the police need “more white men like him to bridge communities.” Since apparently he considers himself enlightened enough to accomplish that. 

I’m genuinely afraid a man like him with his anger issues will inevitably hurt someone once granted that kind of power. Im convinced preventing him from becoming a cop could end up saving someone’s life. In light of recent events I’m more concerned and worried about him joining the police force. Do I reach out to friends of his and see what they can do? Him and I aren’t on speaking terms but do I reach out anyways? Is there really anything I can say/do?",30May2020,1
1003,"Sorry if it doesn't make any sense but I've been thinking about this for a while now and need some honest advice on how to approach it when the time arrives. I just don't know what I would do or say.

I've grown up on a big family and have gained first-hand experience about what it's like raising children and the difficulties you have to go through on a daily bases. I've already come to terms that I don't want to have them myself, but it could affect any future relationships I may have and I don't know what I should do or what approach I should take. 

I'm not currently seeking a relationship with anyone as I have more important things to prioritize but when the times comes that I'm ready to commit to one, would it be a good idea to mention this to the potential partner (if they ask or I try to swing a conversation in that direction) or not? Would they be out off by this immediately or would they accept this? I don't know...

The last thing I want to happen is be committed to a relationship and she asks about the possibility of having children. I really don't want children, but at the same time I don't want to take that away from her if she wants them, so I'd most likely end up breaking off the relationship so we both get what we want / don't want. 

At the same time, I can't imagine myself finding someone who doesn't want children and sticks to it. So in my head I just imagine myself growing up alone and without anyone wanting a relationship with me. I know it sounds really selfish but except from not wanting them to begin with, I don't feel like I could handle all that pressure, and I wouldn't want the kid to suffer as a result of it, so in my head I'm thinking don't have them to begin with. 

Any advice would be extremely helpful, thanks!

1005,"So I'll try to be as short as possible, bear with me. 
My boyfriend (28m) and I (23f) have been together for more than 3 years now. However we did have a break during this summer over a completed issue which I'm not really sure I handled correctly. 
He always had some problem with alcohol (it's a whole family thing, not the abusive kinda alcoholic but still) and it did bother me, and I let him know a couple of times. Sometimes gently sometimes more firmly. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with a beer or two, even general tipsyness is fine, I just believe that an adult person should have enough control over themselves to not get drunk enough to not be able to walk or speak coherently. I warned him multiple types that it would lead to trouble and he always agreed but it kept happening. Not too frequently so he was never an alcoholic or anything like that (maybe once every 3-4 months) but once he started he didn't seem to be able to stop. 
As you probably guessed something bad has happened. He went to a company organized program with colleagues and got drunk. About a week later I asked him if he had anything to tell me (due to an irrelevant issue) and he broke down and told me that something happened during that time. Apparently he got drunk...like the ""almost start a bar fight (he is usually a very peaceful person) then thowup and pass out"" kinda drunk. One of the girls actually went into his room and woke him up to take a walk with her where they kissed and obviously some light touching happened. After a short while he told her to stop and started crying that he has a girlfriend and he what has he done.
When he told me first what happened he left out the part of actually being dragged out of bed after passing out so, I think understandably, I was furious. I called him a bad person and told him that I don't love him because he is not the person I though he was, and I was in love with that person not whatever mess of a human being he is. 
Since we don't really have any close friends in the city where we live and moving is not option, after I calmed down I told him we should stay in the same flat for the next few months until we can find a new place. Since the apartment is pretty small I agreed that we could sleep in the same bed too.
Next day I asked him to actually tell me the whole story where I realized what state he was in when the whole thing happened and I immediately felt like an asshole. He was actually heavily under the influence on alcohol the girl wasn't really drunk and she knew he threw up and passed out before she went to wake him up. In the mildest term she definitely took advantage of him. If anything else happened it would actually be considered rape. My boyfriend actually had nightmares for a good 2-3 weeks. I'm half ashamed to admit that it is a very big part of the reason why I believed him. You can fake many things, but waking up at night from a nightmare (he is usually a very calm sleeper) is a sure-fire sign of PTSD (forgot to mention, I'm a psychology student).
So obviously I apologized to him for calling him names and provided him the emotional comfort I could and he started feeling a little better. I agreed to very slowly restart the relationship but only under the condition that he would never drink hard liquor again. He is still keeping his word!
Our relationship is mostly back to normal but I can't always shake the feeling that I can't trust him.
I know it's wrong but soon we will arrive to a very important decision. We decided to move abroad (we live in Europe and we need to do so because it is close to impossible to make an honest living in our country) and while I always wanted to go, he is a little reluctant. He knows it will be beneficial but he is afraid he will lose his friends, that he will feel lonely there. I offered him that he can stay, it's fine but we both know that it wouldn't work that way. One thing's for sure: I'm going. However I don't know if I can trust him which would be crucial since finding housing is very hard from abroad and also I will continue my studies there while working and if he starts feeling sad or lonely I know I will not have the mental capacity to motivate him ever single day. And if he changes his mind in the last minute I could lose months of my life and experience because of it. I know he doesn't actually want to come but he wants a better life and knows he will never have it here.
I don't know what I should do. I don't want to lose him but I also don't want to lose myself and my opportunities. Should I bite the bullet and make the decision for him by telling him to stay? Should I accept him coming despite the risk? Is my mistrust based on his accidental infidelity or am I seeing this logically?

1010,"Hi Guys! 

I'm new to reddit (I mostly just browse memes and recipes lmao) but I saw this subreddit at just the right moment and thought I'd seek some advice for myself. 

I'm 23 and moved out of my parent's home in February of this year. And for 6 months before that, my boyfriend lived with me in their home. And let me tell ya, that was an eye opening experience. It was never news to me that my mom could be bit much sometimes. As an introverted and independent only-child, I definitely felt it. And my friend's would make comments on occasion. But all these years I just chalked it up to my mom being a mom and me being her kid and all the normal tension/drama that can exist in that type of relationship. 

However, it was not until I started dating as an adult that I noticed her looming presence. Asking me to text her whenever I arrived to a date, calling me frantically if I didn't, asking for my dates' numbers so she had a way to reach me ""just in case"", actually texing/calling my dates when she couldn't reach me, etc. Again, it annoyed me but I just figured it was all in the name of love and care. 

And then my BF moved in and saw my mom in all her glory (bless his patient soul). As a fellow introvert, his social needs are not very much. He can happily go days without socializing. Whereas my mother, who cannot fathom going an hour without sharing all her thoughts w someone, is very extroverted. Additionally, my BF was in the middle of a job search when he first moved in so he had all the free time in the world for my mom to attempt to take up. Long story short, my mom just needs external stimulation and any living person will fit the bill, and for 23 years I have been that person for her. And I didn't realize that she basically raised me to be her Mini Me until my BF got his fill of it and brought it to my attention. And boy was he right. 

Since I moved out, I do not go a day without hearing from her and if I don't answer (deliberately or otherwise) I get emergency-level phone calls and texts. Now, I did try to level with her before I moved. I apologized that I didn't have more time to give but that I was maxed out on social expenditures. This went greaaaat, because she's VERY defensive and apparently she doesn't see our engagements as ""socializing"" because we're family. She's now essentially waiting for my life to get ""less busy"" so I can hang with her like I could when I was younger. Which, truly, breaks my heart to think that she's basically that dog in the commercial just waiting for her person to return home. However, I am not just a companion,  I am an adult who is experiencing a LOT of newness in my life and I just want the wiggle room to be busy and have experiences without being so tightly tethered. I am tired and sad and I don't know how to convey these simple truths to an overly emotional and defensive 60 y/o woman who just had her only child move away from her and isn't grasping that I need some space. 

Lord help her (and me) when I eventually move out of the country (a plan that she is aware of and tries to talk me out of frequently). 

I am pleading for some insight/advice/encouragement from those who have mothers that they have to love from a healthy distance. Basically, do I need to go through the grueling process of trying to communicate my needs right now or do I need to give her time to adjust to my independence? If I don't say something now, I worry that bad habits will form and stick. If I say something, I risk a very emotionally exhausting exchange that could lead to long-term tension (again, she's communicates mostly with emotions and defensive responses). 

Growing pains, amirite?

1014,Hey everyone. I feel so fucking stupid. So Im 21 and have a pretty awful social skills and social anxiety and depression. But I can live with that. the thing that bothers me most is how slow I am. My brain just works more slowly than everybody else. I think this is the root cause of all my problems. I work at a starbucks for about 5 months now. 1 and a half hours away by transit. I used up my 30 days paid leave. now im on 30 days unpaid leave. Because my brain works more slowly than other people which makes look like a fucking idiot most of the time. Like in my head I think ill be working fast and ill really be trying but people still have to constantly tell me to be faster. And it takes longer for me to absorb new information and even when im conversing with customers or other people because I process information more slowly ill be slow to respond or find the right words or I don't understand what they said. I look like a total dumb ass. training for the job role was really unpleasant. I embarrassed myself like everyday and slowly but surely I caught on on how to do things but I was still way slower than everybody else and made a lot of mistakes making drinks. So my unpaid leave ends in 17 days and because I've been away for so long I'm worried im going to make all the same mistakes I made when I first got hired and everyone will hate me even more. I don't think anyone likes me there. On top of all that this coronavirus is really making me anxious. I don't want to risk catching it and spreading it to my parents or my grandmother who we buy groceries for every week and who is already in really poor health. But I'm afraid if I give my 2 weeks notice in a few days and quit it'll be really hard for me to get another job. I miss the days where I was working in a warehouse. I hate working with customers so much. I called my doctor a few days ago and he said he's going to get me a psychiatrist appointment but its going to take a very Long time. I want to make the right decision but I don't know what it is. I know I went all over the place and this is probably difficult to read and any feedback is greatly appreciated.,30May2020,1
1016,"I [21, M] made a few mistakes- specifically ones from last year that have recently been brought up. I'll leave a TLDR at the end. 

Last year, a person, I'll call them ""T"", and myself had a falling out with our ex friend ""R"". Our close friendship quickly turned toxic from each person, and we decided to end it. Before that though, T sent R messages filled with guilt trip and manipulation. T had apologized once they realized what they did, and told me what had happened too. 

Once the apology was given to each person from each person, we went our separate ways, but T and I still stayed friends. We never gave our group of 10ish friends that R used to be apart of the details of what happened, which was my first mistake. Later on R continued to hurt and lash out at various people we were friends with, and we all ignored them, but were very frustrated, upset and annoyed with R. So when R showed me and my friends proof of T manipulating and guilt tripped R, we all... brushed it off. A lot of my friends calling it bullshit, me included. This was my second mistake. 


Later that same year, R was getting anonymous hate comments, specifically racist ones. Due to their falling out with me and my friends, they believed we were sending them. (Which we were not. R soon found out recently it was one of their close friends we were never involved with.) R messaged one of my friends, ""G"", asking for help to make the messages stop while accusing us at the same time. We were all baffled and egged on G to deny R of our help. 

We let our petty feelings get in the way of helping a person of color, and that was my third mistake. 

Recently this week, R had confronted us once again, and sent us a long message of how our actions were unacceptable, and they were right. Me and my friends were complicit in racism, and I ignored the manipulation R faced because the manipulator was my friend and R had hurt me, and other friends around me ignored it too. I gave R my apology afterwards. I have never felt this kind of shame and disappointment with myself. 

All of this has caused my group of friends to ignore and avoid specifically me, T, and G. I understand the hurt and disappointment I personally have caused, and I don't blame any of my friends for being rightfully upset with me. My boyfriend has reassured me that my mistakes don't give him the desire to break up with me, but I am deathly afraid he will change his mind. My group of friends have turned into found family for me after many years alongside them, and my heart feels broken. I understand I need to face the consequences, and I want to. I never want to do something like this again. 

Giving them space is what I've been told I need to do, and it's hard to accept that, but that's what I'm actively doing. I guess I'm just looking for any outside opinions or general advice-- really anything. 



TLDR; 

Last year I made various mistakes that I regret deeply. I am not the only guilty one, but my friend and I feel as if the other guilty people aren't facing the same punishment. I believe my mistakes are very serious ones, and I need to acknowledge my own faults and get better. My group of friends aren't speaking to me because of my past mistakes, and my boyfriend reassures me that he doesn't want to break up, but tells me he still feels very hurt. I understand they all have the right to feel hurt and disappointed. I'm very ashamed of myself for these mistakes. 

I'm at a loss for what to do besides sit and wait for my found family to reach out to me while I try to learn from my mistakes on my own.",30May2020,1
1017,"Background: I have been talking to a guy for a few months now that I met in Uni. We had a shared class, we get along great but haven’t been able to see each other in person since March due to lockdown. Since lockdown, we grew closer (thanks to tech) and eventually developed feelings for each other. Now, the place that I live in is easing restrictions and allows everyone to go outside and not stay at home. We want to meet up now (following social distancing guidelines of course) but I am unsure if I can due to family obligations. I am also really anxious about meeting up in person since I have no experience dating at all.

I was talking to him yesterday and he said the next step in our ”relationship” (not dating or anything official as of now) is to see if our vibes fit together in person. He planned for us to meet up in a park, walk around, and have some lunch. I told him that I am not sure if I can meet up or not right now and he said okay but if we don’t meet up eventually then our flame will die. He later said that he does not want to be in a relationship where we just talk, that he needs the physical aspects as well (he is not referring just to sex rather just being in each others company, since I told him that we need to take things *slow*).

Just curious as to what an outsider thinks of those statements. I am torn - on one hand I agree with what he is saying, relationships do entail and require physicality. But on the other hand, I feel like he is placing too much emphasis on the physical components, while emotional components are just as important. Please share your input. Thx.",30May2020,1

1021,"I've been really torn. I've been dating this guy for almost five months but the entire time he's been really cold. He doesn't really express his emotions with words, or actions either. He barely calls me now that we're in quarantine and he answers my texts every 4-8 hours, sometimes he doesn't even answer. When I send him hearts or a message showing any affection, he usually ignores it. He doesn't usually compromise either, for example, I usually participate in a bunch of activities that I don't really enjoy but I do it because I know he enjoys it, but he never does the same, even if I beg. He's not very thoughtful either. For his birthday I planned for weeks in advance, but for mine he didn't really plan anything and in the card he got me it was really cold, there was no emotion in it. I broke up with him and explained all of this to him, because I've told him about the problem multiple times and he kept reverting back to how things were. He called the other day (few days after the breakup) and asked for a second chance and said he'd do anything to fix it, and he was sorry and that he wanted to be better. This was his first real relationship, and he told me that I'm everything to him. He also explained how he wasn't sure how to act in a relationship, and I can sympathize with that, being as he didn't really have a role model who acted in an affectionate way. I'm just unsure of what to do, I know he's being genuine and he's a good person, we also get along well aside from the communication and affection issues, like in person we never have a problem, the issues recently started in quarantine.

1022,"I feel dumb asking this because I’m not very educated on the subject. I have struggled for the last year to gain weight and just can’t seem to do it.

I’ve been to doctors but they haven’t found anything wrong. I have a gastro intestinal disease but from what the doctors say, I shouldn’t be losing weight because I take all the steps to care for the disease and am very careful about it.

When I was in high school I may have had an eating disorder, but I wasn’t diagnosed so I can’t really say for sure. I wanted to lose weight, so I ate less than one meal per day. I knew full well what I was doing and was able to go back to normal once I got to my goal weight (I lost 20lbs).

I don’t consciously skip meals these days, sometimes it just happens because my job is extremely demanding. On average I have a protein shake in the morning, usually skip lunch, and always eat dinner and dessert. I WANT to gain weight, but I’m also very insecure about what my body looks like. I know how underweight I am but I still see too much fat on my body. I don’t think I’m trying to lose it though because the logical part of me knows that I look horribly (almost disgustingly) skinny. Could I unconsciously be doing this to myself? I don’t see an issue with the way I eat or how much, I don’t think I’m starving or even missing enough meals to lose this much weight, but maybe my thoughts are skewed without me being aware of it?",30May2020,1

While my mother has always favored my brother since before I can remember, my father may spend more time with me and we may be closer, I wouldn't say my father really has the same sort of bias that my mother has. Everyone in my family, besides my mother and brother, have recognized that my brother is a bully, to put it succinctly.

He attempts to undermine me, make me feel insignificant and meaningless, and throw me under the bus for everything. Now, I admit there are some things I do that are deserving of criticism and perhaps even mockery, but my brother takes it to an extreme level.

1026,"Found out from her best friend at a bonfire a few nights ago. After a drink or two the friend and I started discussing my twin sisters relationship because no one likes the boyfriend. He is unmotivated, recently started selling drugs, is rude, and they’re always fighting. The friend started to talk about an incident that happened at a party for New Years that I was unaware of. Apparently at the party, my sister and the boyfriend went into the bathroom together and when they came out my sister pulled the friend aside crying and told her that he beat the crap out of her in the bathroom. I was drinking along with everyone else that night and right as the friend and my sister came up to my after the incident, a big fight broke out outside and we all packed up our things in a hurry and left. The next day when the friend texted my sister to check up on her and talk about the day before my sister totally denied everything. She said she fell and hit herself on the counter to explain all the bruises he gave her. 

This was 6 months ago and the friend didn’t tell anyone about it until now (I think she thinks we all knew because she was surprised when she mentioned it that we didn’t already know the story). But still, she didn’t do anything to help ya sister. My struggle is now that I know, what do I do? My sister and this boys relationship has torn apart my family (he is black and my parents aren’t super accepting about someone from our white family dating someone black. They’re racist but also dislike him for other reasons). I’m not as close to her as I used to be and any time someone tries to talk to her about him she gets very defensive. I don’t think she would listen to me or admit it if I brought it up. I thought about telling my brother but I’m afraid he would fly off the handle and go beat up the boyfriend. I also only know the story from one source and I of course wanna believe my sister but I wasn’t in the room. I just don’t know how to help, all I know is I have to do something to help her get out of this situation. But how do you help someone who won’t admit her boyfriend is abusive and doesn’t see that she doesnt need him? 

Any advice/ideas for what I should do would be much appreciated!

I pay full rent/all bills and utilities currently (except for groceries - parents do the grocery shopping).

1030,"I worked with her a while back. We became good friends. There was an attraction and energy but it never went there. She moved away, got married and started a family but we kept in touch.

It started getting awkward for me because she never introduced me to her husband and I guess wanted to keep our friendship separate. But this always was in the back of my mind every time we talked so one day I brought it up. I forget how I started the convo but I remember she was annoyed by it and said something like I have another guy best friend too, and my husband knows I have ‘my friends’ and he’s ok with that. That wasn’t my issue though. And maybe this is my hang up or insecurity but I feel slighted that I’m kept separate. I was raised that when someone gets married, especially if its a man to woman friendship, things will change and I’ve told her that I would like to meet her husband (at least over the phone) and talk and get to know him...like hey man, I’m your wife’s friend. I mean if I were the husband I would want to at least meet my wife’s friends, especially if they’re men. I don’t think thats old fashioned or outdated? I also feel like I’m an emotional outlet for her and honestly feel used sometimes.

Anyway, that issue came to a head after about 2 or 3 conversations about it and we haven’t spoken since. It’s been maybe 1 or 2 years.

So my university only offers 10 sessions of therapy before you are asked to seek help elsewhere. They do offer group therapy and can refer you to other places. My problem is that my current therapist has been helping me so much on issues that haven't been short term.

I'm having a hard time dealing with losing somebody I trust and frankly the only person in my life right now who knows so much. I don't want to seem 'clingy' but I really value him so much. I also don't really have the means to get therapy after this ends as my parents currently help with all my finances and they do not believe in therapy at all (they don't know about me going to therapy rn) . All the other information I've read online has been about how the therapist chose to terminate but in this case he has to end it because of the college I go to only offers short term therapy. I really had a hard time opening up to him and highly doubt I'll be going to the university-offered group therapy. Has anyone else had any experience with ending short term therapy?

My emotions started building up because he would take these month long breaks from everyone, even his friends and not say anything. He'd be texting everyone one day and disappear the next. This in turn left me worried, because I wonder if something happened to him. I got the courage to confront him on the topic and he told me to not worry about it, but his friend started texting me and saying ""Have you heard from him?""

A month later she comes back. She says her and Jain are going to Mexico. She is taking the 2 oldest (4&amp;2) with her and Juan in Mexico. The youngest can stay since Juan doesn't want her. 

This was a month ago. My cousin doesn't have Facebook as he is super controlling. When she is with him we never hear from her. I am aware at this point she is just being a shitty person. However I am very concerned for my cousins children. Both the ones with her and the one at my aunt's house. 

Juan as beat her time and time again. I fear as though when they go to Mexico, if he wants to hurt her he will. 

Im looking for advice on what to do. My family seems to not care. I feel like children are going to get hurt. I fear calling CPS as they may take the littlest away from my aunt.

1039,"Hey Guys,

I always have been «the nice guy», when I'm doing stuff with my friends, but since some time, it fells like my friends are taking advantage of this for their own usage. 
I also get really often interrupted while talking in a group.

I was also often friendzoned by girls and a friend of mine once told me that I am to nice and always want to comfort other peoples, instead of myself.

After googling for «stop being the nice guy» (yes I did that...) I just couldn't really change myself because the most advices were garbage.

My questions now:
Is there any way, I could practice to not being to nice, or to be more confident? (Maybe also a practice possibility, which can be done alone)
How can I stop, to being interrupted by my own friends?",30May2020,1

1042,"Hi everyone, 

I'm working on my master's dissertation, I should have hand it in a year ago but I decided to leave it for another year. I ended up changing my topic and basically everything, even my tutor is different. Thing is my dissertation is not actually difficult, it's just mostly research and applying that research to create activities to help learn a language. My deadline for handing in the whole dissertation is July 1st. I'm almost halfway done my first draft, and the hard part is basically done which is a lot of research. I'll hopefully have a first draft of everything for the end of next week. 

Now for the anxiety part. I haven't been able to work comfortably on it since last year. I'm usually a good student, so when I told my parents I wasn't going to do it when I was supposed to, hell broke loose. I didn't have a great experience doing my undergraduate's dissertation because I'm an awful procrastinator and my tutor was very unsupportive. So since then, every single time I sat down to work on it, I've had this pit on the bottom of my stomach. I came to the conclusion I probably have anxiety. It's like nothing I've ever experienced before. 

I've been working on and off on it for last three weeks and I had some work done before, but still I cannot get rid of the anxiety. I still haven't sent anything to my tutor, he knows I'm working on it and although I told him I was going to send something by the beginning of May, he's really chill and not really bothered about it. I have also a lot of trouble with revision, when I get stuff corrected by teacher, I tend to put it off because it makes me feel awful and I lose motivation. 

I literally feel so bad about it, that I don't really do anything else when I'm not working on it. I kinda punish myself by either working on it, doing house chores or just doing nothing at all (which I hate). And at the same I am overwhelmed by anxiety. I also haven't been well mentally for a while now, I don't know exactly when it started by I'm pretty sure I'm depressed and this situation only makes it worse. 

So, now for the advice. Could anyone give me any tips for dealing with anxiety? Or help to be able to compartmentalize my anxiety until I get this done?",30May2020,1
1043,"I was watching a show and laughing a lot. I asked my boyfriend; ""This guy is funny! Why are Jewish people so funny?""

and he got really serious and said it was a little racist. 

I wasn't talking about all Jewish people. But most of the media I have seen Jewish people just being really comical and hilarious. Most of my favorite comedians are Jewish. Some of the best comedian actors are Jewish.

I wasn't considering it a negative stereotype because people don't make fun of Jewish people for being funny, do they? 

So I said to him ""How's that any different if I said 'Mexicans are great cooks'?"" It's obvious I don't mean all Mexican people. He then replied ""You mean like saying all Asians are smart?"" 

He was obviously implying that what I said was in the same lane as the actual racist stereotype that all Asians are smart. Asian people legitimately get made fun of, negatively portrayed on TV and bullied for the ""All Asians are smart"" stereotypes. 

I've never heard a Jewish kid getting bullied because he was ""so funny"" but maybe I'm just... Missing something? 

I consider myself to be ""woke"" so I am 100% totally offended by his implications that I'd be racist or antisemitic for a statement that I'm certain has no negative implications behind it.  

No he is not Jewish.",30May2020,1

I’m 17 and I plan to go to college this fall. But I’m honestly not sure what I want to do after college.

The benefits are absolutely amazing and I get a chance to go to places I’ve never been to before (I’ve lived in Md all my life). but the bad thing is if I don’t like my job, I can’t quit.

1049,"Student of Reddit whats your advice for a unique situation like mine


So im a 16 years old male who lives in jordan(a country in the middle east)


And typically when a student reaches 17 he goes through a phase of non-stop studying for a whole year which develops a depression for a lot of students who are going through that phase which causes a drop in their grades.

Now do note:
1-i was always a top tier student who could study for 8 hours straight,but now it seems that i cant concentrate for more than 1 hour 

2-i’m scared from any exam that could really affect my future such as this one

3-this phase has 8 subjects:Arabic,English,Math
Physics,Biology,Chemistry,Religion(depends on your religion),History

And i all ready finished 2 subjects (History,Religion)
But I recently found out that a small group of people all ready finished 3-5subjects and  realized that i’m far behind.

4-I’m better than the majority of  students in English (by my country standards) which is the subject that people fail at the most

5- i wont be using any form of technology so no internet no nothing



 So what would you advise me to do        So i would become a better a student and attend the medicine school (Which you need a score of 98% to get accepted at) and avoid depression boredom and day dreaming",30May2020,1
1050,"My partner and I have been together for 8 years and we have two dogs. One of them is a joy but the other one is a nervous wreck and takes the fun out of everything. He is a very large bernedoodle at 3 years old. I’ve been bitten by him hard enough to have large bruises for weeks. He’s bitten a family member hard enough to cause bleeding and bruising and has bitten (or rather nipped) my 10 year old nephew twice in one night. I’ve complained about this to my partner on multiple occasions as it’s more or less their baby boy. Don’t get me wrong I love this dog too. The problem now is that we have just moved into our first home and our neighbour has three small children. The fence is in dire need of repair and it’s the first thing on the list but business is slow with covid. We have some temporary fencing up but it’s not enough and I’ve seen him smash against it trying to bite the kids. I’m horrified and I’ve stopped letting him out unsupervised and for long periods. My partner tried doing an off leash session with the parents and kids, giving the dogs treats and all that stuff. Of course he seemed fine then, no problems, but as soon as he’s behind that fence it’s the same story again. These kids are small and they don’t always listen and I’ve seen them climbing a tree next to the fence and peeking in. Kids and dogs don’t understand. I however, am freaking out. I want to rehome our dog before he mutilates one of these kids and ruins their life. My partner wants to spend hundreds of dollars on lessons from a trainer as a last ditch option. I don’t agree that it’s fast enough to solve this issue, if it even does, and the stakes are too high. I don’t want to have to bring him in and put him down and live with the guilt of a kid who has scars for the rest of their life. Am I wrong on this? Is it wrong to value a human life over a dogs? Am I being irrational and cold about my decision to remove a family member? I just think it’s better to rehome him to someone who has a life setup with little to no interaction with kids. I can’t change my neighbours now, I’m not moving any time soon. I don’t enjoy giving up this dog but I’m worried as all hell. Any advice would help.",30May2020,1
1051,"I have a friend who gets verbally and emotionally abused at home. Her parents and siblings constantly treat her like shit, and she has an abusive friend who’s blackmailing her. She has told us multiple times that her parents lock her out of her house for hours, they always take her siblings’ side without even bothering to hear hers, and she’s hiding everything from them. I’m honestly really worried about her. Over text, she’s told me her parents have removed her door because they don’t trust her, make her do work on her birthday to go out, and gets blamed for stuff she didn’t even do (one time her brother left glass on the floor and she had to go to the ER, her parents blamed her), they don’t believe in mental illnesses so they refuse to get her tested (one time a teacher caught her cutting and they told her parents and they just… didn’t care).

Her friend treats her like shit. She calls her a rapist, makes fat jokes about her since she’s slightly overweight, blackmails her (she screenshots every time they swear in text to show to her parents if she gets mad). She’s extremely manipulative and I want to help my friend, but I don’t know what to do. We’re only just in highschool, so she can’t go anywhere else. I want to call someone, but she doesn’t want to, because she’s scared of getting removed from her home since she’ll have to leave us and live with her cousins, and they’re almost as bad as her family.

1053,"My boyfriend has pretty bad OCD, mostly around being a ""good person"". He feels excessive guilt for fairly normal things, especially weird porn he watched/read as a young teen (nothing illegal just cringey or strange and boys I was friends with at that age did most if it too). He confessed his guilt for trying to find images of naked girls aged 12-14 when he was 13. This was a once off as he never found anything on Google and quickly realised it was illegal. However, he feels guilty that somehow he checked something younger than this even though he does not remember this. He just feels so scared that he could've looked up younger, maybe even 5 years younger or something and forgotten it as he might have merely typed it in and not really tried or was so guilty he managed to block it from his memory

After he freaked out one evening, he told me the next day that he is 99% sure he never looked below 11, as he clearly only remembers 12-14 happening and he never noticed girls more than  year younger back then, so why would he? He still has that 1% and doesn't want to promise he didn't go below 11 as it's too scary because what if he suddenly realises he did one day? He has said before about various memories  ""I think X thing happened when I was 14"" before only to realise in a calmer state a few days later  ""no actually X never happened, I just panicked because it was possible i could have but I have no actual memory of it and realistically I would have"".",30May2020,1

She also has claimed that I am not like any guy she ever met and that she loves me which I don't know if she's just toying with me or she's actually being truthful.

1060,"2 years ago, I was basically sexting a random girl I met online. Im 17 and I was about 15 at the time. Long story short, I was eventually blackmailed with my own nude photos, which even had my face in the pictures, and was forced to join a Skype call where I was told to do so much to myself. So much I still to this day feel disgusted for. I've even contemplated suicide. But that's not the worst part. 

Soon after, I had to leave the bathroom I was recording everything because my 8-9 year old brother needed to use it. I told the girl that I can't record anything because not younger brother is using the bathroom. 
She then asked me how old he was and In hindsight, it was stupid to answer truthfully. I said his age (it was either 8 or 9 at the time) and she told me send photos of him too. I told her no, and I'll just send the videos and that I dont wanna do that, but again, she jumped to blackmail and said ""Give me what i want""
Anytime I hear that quote, from anywhere, a movie, in real life, I just get flashbacks and I have a crazy panic attack...... 
Being as scared as I was--- I shamefully did what she said and sent the explicit photos. One of his back and the front-- completely exposed.....
Luckily, my brother was too young to understand what was really going on. When I told him he was done, he saw my face and asked if I was okay. I didnt answer and told him that I have money underneath my mattress. Just for him. Luckily, I was smart enough to leave his face out of the pics. So that makes me a bit happier. Even if there is a likelyhood photos of him might be on the dark web or some shit, at least no one will really ever be able do identify him. 
I told her that's it and told her to delete the photos of me and him.. she didnt want to and demanded more. So, I said fuck it. And blocked the account. If she did upload my nudes, I'll just have to face the consequences, and shame if anyone sees it. I just feel like shit--- that I ever sent it in the first place. And I feel like a horrible brother. Like I betrayed him.
And I just wanna kill myself. It fucking sucks it had to get this bad.... but what else could I do?! I cant tell the police because not only could I be charged with cp but what if the person was overseas?! Then what?!??!
I cant tell my parents because they'll just shame me and yell at me, and again, that wont solve anything.
I just didnt know what to do.....
I love my brother. To death. And if he ever needed me or wanted something, all I ever wanted to do was go out of my way to make him happy. But this? This just invalidates that...... and I feel like a shitty brother to this day......

But I just wanted some advice---- 
I know this wasnt smart..... but I just need some help. 
Am I a bad person?? Do I deserve everything I got? And should I feel this bad....

I dont want anything to just make me feel better. Just honest opinions. And honest thoughts.....",30May2020,1

1065,"I (F17) have been seeing a guy (M17) for a bit now. We haven’t done anything physical at all. Nothing more than holding hands as I was still feeling things out to make sure I liked him. 

At around 7 last night he and I went for a picnic  in a pretty quiet and large park. Things started out okay, he just had his arm around me as we sat and talked. We had discussed before hand that I was open to taking some edibles with him and so we both had a small amount. I’ve had edibles before so I felt mostly comfortable as the ones he brought were from a dispensary too.  I probably had around 30 mg which is around what I had experience taking in the past. 

For the first half hour I was feeling a bit buzzed until. Bam. It hit me like a train. I felt myself greening out but tried to stay calm. I told him I need to go walk for a bit so we went for a walk. I was getting higher and higher by the minute. I was in a complete dream like state, completely out of reality. It got to the point where I needed to lie down so we found a patch of grass. I complained I just needed 20 minutes to “sleep some of it off” and as I “slept” (more just closed my eyes) he had his arm right above my ass and his crotch right against my thigh which felt really uncomfortable but I was so high I couldn’t move.  He was almost pressing “himself” into my thigh, somewhat humping it. I would open my eyes once in awhile to see him staring right back at me as he kept rubbing my lower back onto my butt.

At around 9 he suggested we go back to his car. I was stumbling around and was a mess as he held onto me by my lower waist, pulling me closer in. We were approaching his car when he said “want to drive to somewhere more private with less people?” And I said “no it’s fine here” and he kept asking if I was sure and I made sure he knew I didn’t want to go anywhere else. At this point he kept pulling me in closer as we walked, hooking his arm around my lower waist. I felt very uncomfortable but was using all the energy I had left trying to focus on not throwing up.

We get in his car and he immediately suggests “want to go cuddle in the back to help u spread out more?” And I said “no I’m fine here” and without saying anything he started moving my seat back, signalling we were gonna sit in the back seats. I said no again and he finally said “r u sure? Ok.” And so we sat in the front

He asked me “what do u want to do we have an hour until u usually have to be home?” Almost as if I was wasting his time and not making it worth his while. Keep in mind at this time I was in a full panic attack. I told him to bring me home. He was reluctant and kept asking if I was sure and I said yes. He got a bit angry and passive aggressive with me at this point. I said I was sorry over and over again but he just said it’s fine and that I should just worry on getting over this first. He didn’t say a word to me the whole ride home. 

I finally got home and said thank you and then goodbye. I laid awake, nauseous for a solid hour until I finally fell asleep.

I woke up to these texts from him:
“Hey I’m home, how do u feel?”
“Call or text me when ur awake”
“Hey how r u today?”
“Is everything okay? ur making me worried”

I haven’t answered. I’m very confused. Does what I’m saying sound over dramatic? Could I be hallucinating it all from the weed? I know it was extremely STUPID of me to get high with this guy but everyone makes mistakes. 

I just need advice on what to do next?

1068,"My (F24) older brother (M26) has gotten a lot skinnier, which I only noticed lately. I decided not to say anything, since commenting on people's weight is rude, but I can't not be a little concerned that he may be underweight. 

To be fair, I'm not a doctor. I can't actually tell if he's underweight or healthy. I know he secretly bought some weight loss pills online some years ago, but mom found out and talked him out of it. 

He used to be chubby and had a bit of a double chin, and now I can kinda see the bones on his arms and legs and his cheekbones. 

Again, he could still be just fine in the health department, even if he's skinny, I just worry whether I should maybe comment on it? I have a feeling that if I say I'm worried, he'll just get annoyed (since he's an adult with a job who can take care of himself, including his meals). I worry if I compliment him now then maybe he'll think he wasn't good looking before (I don't think fat = ugly and skinny = handsome automatically). 

I think the right thing to do is either A) say nothing or B) just make an off-handed quick comment like ""I noticed you've gotten thinner since you moved out"" and if he adds nothing to that conversation or gets annoyed, then I will shut up/change the subject. 

Btw, I privately asked our mom about it, and she says he is definitely underweight and that she's sending him a few subtle hints about it. Not sure how well that is going though.

1072,"When we first looked at homes, we were looking for our forever home. We found it. Or so we thought. I’ll try to keep this short. 

Tldr: stay and buy an empty lot to expand the needed space? Or sell and find a house that meets all our criteria? 

It’s not the largest house on the street by any means. But it worked for our needs. And thought we could grow into it. However our needs have changed. 

We now both own our own companies. Which don’t require a store front. 

I look at current and long term. If we put in another $20k the house will be our initial dream house. The house is spacious but not too much to retire into. Meaning no unused space. And would be perfect. 

Option 1: We were looking into buying a lot nearby, building a shed, and working out of there. (There are no available lots on any side of us that we could consider.) most of his work is onsite, and his equipment would be kept at the shed. My work, is all handmade and shipped. 

Option 2: selling and using the equity to upgrade. 

I know it doesn’t seem like a tough option. But we spent years making this home our family home. Part of me doesn’t want to sell because I know eventually when we retire, the upgrade will be too much. But the lack of needs is really weighing on us. 

We thought about renting our home out and buying another one. But we need the equity and type of mortgage we have for the new property.",30May2020,1
1073,"Throwaway, of course.

I guess I'll just get right into it. 

I flunked out of college, financial aid that helped me was taken away, I was fired from my job, and I do not know what to do next.

I have tried my best to be good at my job but due to my lucky, my late counts were too high and they signed me off.

My college, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, went online only. I could barely get any work done, Zoom meetings were non-existent and I couldn't take the pressure anymore. I dropped out, which kicked FinAid into suspending my grants and I'm unable to afford going back.

My mom isn't happy. There's nothing I can say or do to make her happy about any of this. I'm in danger of being kicked out of my only home.

I have no idea how to fix any of it. I always have a plan but I can't find any foreseeable method that can fix any of it. I just need advice. Anything.",30May2020,1
1074,"I get along with my friend R, he is a good friend and a good guy, but he is extremely messy. He previously lived with his sister, and their place was always trashed and messy as hell. He told me he just needed a bigger place and somewhere to store his stuff and he wouldn't be as messy. So I gave him exactly that, a slightly bigger room than he used to have and a shed to store his things if he needed to. I charge him $250 a month for rent and he gets free wifi, some free food occasionally (but I ask him to get his own), a fridge and cabinets to use, a stove to cook, free washer and dryer to use (he buys his own detergent), and he even has a small bathroom attached to his room. He also does not do any chores, which I don't hold against him because I never asked him to help (tbh I thought he would help with some things at least) Before he moved in I cleaned the room he'd be renting, SPOTLESS. I cleaned the bathroom as well and had just put a brand new toilet in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem, when coronavirus became an issue I asked him to stay somewhere else to minimize the amount of people in my place going in and out to minimize risk. He agreed without question, I told him not to worry about rent while he's gone and didn't charge him for the month. So he moves in with his GF and her dad for the time being, no issues there. The other day, I needed to get something out of the bathroom I had left in there as I had previously used it before he moved in. I have to go through his room to get to the bathroom and I assumed he had taken all of his things. Well there's shit all over the floor, a plate with food left on his desk growing mold, dirty clothes in some spots and overall the room smelled disgusting. I open the bathroom door and the toilet seat is up and the toilet that was put in 2 months prior looks like it had been there for 20 years and never been cleaned. Also, there's boxes of things taking up the entirety of the bathroom, and boxes of garbage too. You can barely reach the sink to turn it on because they're in the way. Honestly this is disgusting in my opinion and in the beginning I told him we keep our things clean around here, not like where he used to live. Frankly, it's none of my business that he has a dirty room, but he left food in there attracting insects, ruined our new toilet quicker than I thought possible, and overall I feel disrespected by him using the bathroom like a storage room and trash closet when I offered free storage space and we have a garbage can outside... I'm torn, I don't like having someone that lives this dirty around my house, but I really don't know what to do because I don't see him changing his ways.

1081,"The only real backstory I would think is ideal to share would be the fact that I have had a huge love for animals for quite some time. I grew up with a father that worked in a prison as an ESU Correction Officer. He just recently retired and is currently living in Florida. Growing up, I loved hearing about his day and I am also interested in the field of criminal justice. My love for animals was just something that won the debate at the time I made it. Making animals lives better really makes every day worth all the shit, urine and difficult clients worth it but I also feel like I would feel this same way in the criminal justice field. I just know I have more passion for the veterinary field but strive at both. I graduated with honors in both majors. 

I have a Bachelors in both Veterinary Technology and Science of Criminal Justice. I am currently a part time Veterinary Technician. I am considering a career change into law enforcement. I say this only because I need to make more income and although I love animals and I would really really like to pursue my dream career, I can't help but feel like this won't sustain me. I have many bills and things I need to pay back without having to be left in negative or surviving by the nickel. 

I would like to probably move out of NY soon, too because there is a possibility to be a veterinary technician full time and maintain my life. I don't know if I'm just feeling this way because of the amount of money that I need to pay for certain necessities in my life and just need a change in environment or if I need to really consider switching careers.",30May2020,1

I had a friend (I'll refer to as K) that lived in the same neighborhood as me for years, we became very close during that time. K struggled with anxiety, depression, drug abuse.. I was always there for them. K ended up moving really far away from where I live, we stayed in contact for the first 7 months but around that time K fell back into their drug abuse pattern. This time it was different, K's personality was completely changed and they became very hostile, selfish, angry with me. Everytime K would talk to me it would be about drugs and things I can't really say on here, this had been going on for a while and I finally said that if they weren't even going to try and make an effort to stop don't contact me. K made it very clear that they wanted nothing to do with me so I left them alone and hadn't contacted them until a couple months ago.

1087,"Hey everyone! 

I (F,22) could really use some help SMH...
I’ll try to keep this post as short as possible. Who am I kidding, it's gonna be freaking long. 
So basically, I need your opinion/advice on what you think his (M, 18) actions say. I’m beyond confused at this point...Maybe I’m in denial? Who knows. 

Quick backstory: I know this guy for about 7 years now. We used to go to school together (small school, grades 7,8 &amp; 9 put together). I had a crush on him for most of those 7 years (still do kinda). We had our ups and downs (long crazy story). Now, he never made an actual move on me and vis versa. Not that I noticed anyway? (Unless playing with my hair and childish “games” are flirting?) I’d like to say he didn’t make a move because of his age, and his home situation (he couldn’t really afford a lot and lives a few hours away). Everyone in my class knew I was into him (including the teachers LOL). 

A few years ago I kept asking him if he likes me back, his answer always was ”No”.
Anyways a couple of years ago our communication plunged quite a bit. We went from him initiating random, long phone calls/skype calls - to me having to initiate the contact regularly. Once I stopped initiating contact, we didn’t text/talk for over a year. We started talking again randomly sometime (I think he ”accidentally” texted me). However, shortly after, it was me initiating contact again. So, I did what I felt was right at the time and ended it completely. Also, he asked to meet me and I felt very insecure at the time which also was a big factor (I really would’ve wanted to meet him tho 😕) 

Our conversation 2 years ago; 
(I don’t normally write like that, tried to be cool I guess 🤦‍♀️)
Him: Yo you got snap? 
If you do
Add me
(his snap name)
👆🏻👆🏻
Me: Hey ✌️ Imma be real blunt, why do you wanna meet up again? 🤔
Him: I asked you for your snapchat 🤔🤔
Me: yeah I know, it’s private sry 
You wanted to meet up like a few months ago, so I’m askin why 🤷‍♀️
Him: Because we haven’t seen each other in like 3 years 
Me: Okay, that’s all? 
Him: I thought it would’ve been fun
Me: Cute, but ehh
I’m sure you’re a great homie n all but thinkin bout it now I don’t really see it happenin 🤷‍♀️
Him: Ehm 
Why
Too cool for me or what😅
Me: Idk 💁‍♀️ maybe 
Him: Definitely not😘
Me: Nah but like we live completely different lives now
Him: Yeah I know 
That’s why I thought it would be quite fun to meet up again
Me: like I had a good time with ya back at (our school) n all but that’s the past
Him: I am well aware
Me: Tbh like nothing against ya but your 16 😂 I’m 20...like that’s just weird 🙈 
We have different interests too so ya 🤔
Him: What do you mean with that 
Different interests? 
Me: Teen interests vs adult interests, ya know? 
Nothing against 16 year olds been there once too😂
Him: What is the difference 
You’re 20
Not 30 
There can’t be a huge difference 
Me: Hmm, let me guess you’re all about girls, alc, you’re motorcycle, fucking around &amp; drugs? 
Him: You are wrong
Me: enlighten me
Him: You never really spent any time with me have you
You would know, that I don’t consume any drugs
And idk why you are concerned about my motorcycle 
I haven’t used it in at least a year
I occasionally have a couple beers with some friends of mine
Me: Okay
Still right about the rest, huh? 
Him: The rest? 
Me: What I said above 👆
Him: Define “fucking around”
Me: Experimenting around with chicks or dudes 😂 no judgment 
Him: (my name) 
When I said let’s meet up
I didn’t say 
Let’s smash
Me: Boy I know 😂
Him: Then why are you worried bout that
Me: Wait... haha you misunderstood me
I’m just sayin that’s how teen boyz are 😅 Horny af 
But that’s not why I don’t wanna meet up
Him: Why didn’t you want to meet up
Me: Cause as I said, we live different life’s now n we didn’t talk for like over a year. 
Plus the connection is gone, ya know?
Him: I am aware
That’s exactly why I would’ve been happy to see you again
Me: sorry 🤷‍♀️
But time’s money 💰 we should not waste it 
Him: I have enough time on my hands
Me:👌great
I don’t know what you wanna hear from me
Actually came here to end the contact and you ain’t helpin 🤷‍♀️😂
Him: Idk what your problem is
Either way 
You must decide 
Me: I don’t have one
Just wanna tell you nicely that we should go our separate ways
Him: Let me give you two options 
Me: Sure
Him: The first 
See me one final time
Grown up basically 
We’ll just idk grab something to eat, talk and then leave 
Or 
You can just end it all right now 
Just don’t forget to say bye
Me: *told him I need to order something at Starbucks* 
Him: You have enough time
Don’t worry
Me: Sorry bout that 
@ Starbux so crazy here
Okay, regarding your 2 options 
I think it’s time to “end the chapter” ...as dramatic as that sounds
We had a great time n all but as I said it’s the past. Don’t take it personal. You sound like a good guy 🙏
Him: Thanks but I still would’ve liked to see you one last time 
Curious to see what you look like now
But hey
You have made up your mind
Me: Maybe you will, the world ain’t that big 🤷‍♀️
Sooo, to wrap it all up... I wish you nice n happy life &amp; take care ☺️ Stay yourself n don’t let anyone change ya ✌️ N don’t forget, the sky is the limit 🙌
Him: Alright let me wrap things up too
Half of the time i knew you, i just wanted to beat you with a fucking sledgehammer 
But in the end 
You turned out alright
I indeed liked you very much, once I’ve gotten to know you better
That is also why i tried to keep our contact up for as long as possible 
But in the end 
All things will eventually fade away
So (my name)
I wish you a joyful, successful and happy life 
I hope for you, that you will find the man of your dreams and eventually have a nice family 
As you have chosen 
I must depart from you now
And I wish you good luck in the future 
Goodbye (my name), it was nice getting to know you❤️
Me: That was nicely said. Thank you, (his name) ☺️ It was nice knowing you too. Goodbye 👋 
———————————————
Safe to say that was the sweetest thing he’s ever said to me. Anyhow, I decided to contact him again after 2 years (today a little over two months ago). However, I needed an excuse to talk to him so I chose the coronavirus situation as my excuse. 

Conversation on Snapchat; 
Me: (voice message) Hey (his name) it's me (my name). This is super random...ehm...I just wanted to make sure you're alright. As well as your family and that every one of you is healthy and safe...you know in regards to the coronavirus and all. So yeah...that’s all. Take care, bye! 
(He replied within one or two hours) 
Him: Heyy (my name) wassupp
I didn’t expect you to contact me ever
But yeah me and the fam is still doing fine for now
Trying to keep my mom away from the virus y’know
I hope you and your family are also healthy and all
Me: (voice message) I said something along the lines of “My family’s healthy too and I find it random myself that I contact him. Also, I still care about him and wanted to make sure he’s fine”. 
Him: Yeah I guess it wasn’t a bad time to contact me
Glad you did
And yeah I hope you and your family are safe through this first wave of corona 
Me: (voice message) I congratulated him to his birthday (quite late tho) and told him in my mind I still remember him as the cute 13 year old. (That’s the last time I saw him in person🤦‍♀️)
Him: Yeah a bit late but it’s fine
I have definitely changed since the last time you saw me😂
Me: You mean it’s possible for you to become even more swoon-worthy? 😜
Him: I fully believe so
Because y’know
Older 
We’ll id have to send you pics to believe 
If you want
Me: I would very much like to see how you look like now. 🙊
Him: *Sends me 6 different 😍 pics of himself* 
Me: Hot damn...Who let you outta the candy shop? 🔥🙈
Him: I guess I let myself out
Nam sayn 
I wonder how you look like nowadays 
Got any pics? 
Me: Only for special people 💁‍♀️
Sent him my 10 best pics (including a little flirty/sexy one, to make my intentions clear I guess?) 
Him: Damnn not bad
Me: 😅 I guess we both upgraded 
Him: Yeah you look pretty good
How old are you now? 
Me: 22 👌
&amp; thanks 🙏
———————————————
He never texted me again after that. 2-3 days of great conversation and now nothing. WTF?! That was a little over 2 months ago...Did I say something wrong? Did I miss something? He always looks at my Snapchat stories though...It’s kinda my only way to get his attention. I normally only post positive quotes or random pictures. However I posted a cute bikini pic (only for him to see) yet no reaction. So, today I stepped it up quite a bit by posting a super naughty yet classy pic on my story but made sure only he could see it. He saw it, yet no reaction. No comment. Nothing. I’m so damn confused! 
I don’t understand guys 😂 I’d be very grateful for some advice and/or opinions! Someone who understands the male mind 🤔 

Damn. Thanks for reading all of that! You’re amazing 😄

My neighbour admitted that he shows up when he wants but she doesn’t take the keys off of him and get locks changed, she allows him to come in whenever.

In-person she seems kind of normal but she has just cut off her friend and was telling another friend that ""yeah she hears voices but she knows they aren't real"" We are convinced she has schizophrenia.
