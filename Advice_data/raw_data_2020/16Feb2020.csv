1,"One of my best friends, whom I’ve been friends with for two years recently became friends with this other girl. Her name is Lexi. Lexi is younger than both of us, but she acts very mature for her age. In her profile, Lexi states that she “is very blunt” “dislikes people” and is “antisocial”. I had an encounter with her recently and I accidentally sent her the wrong text message and she was showing a very rude attitude to me. My best friend, no longer calls me his best friend and calls the girl he met two months ago his best friend all because he got jealous that I was spending more time with my other friend Liv. I truly don’t understand how he could be friends with Lexi seeming from her rude behavior. Lexi always says she’s toxic and fake. I believe she is insecure and very sad. I really don’t know if she is fake since me being with her is severely affecting my mental health and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I have a fear that she is only using me to get to him, since my best friend has had a history with fake friends. I want to protect him. But, Lexi gave him lots of money. And Lexi left all of her friends for him. It’s making me a tad bit jealous.",16Feb2020,1
3,"Hey, so im relatively new to chatting to strangers online (like online group chats with strangers) the problem is i do want to get to know them and go on calls ect or show them what I look like... But im just so shy. I've known some for over a year and the most I've told them is my name. Even that took me a year and that was by accident.. Anyway some want to know my voice and i know its a weird thing to get worked up about but when im about to I don't and i get scared and avoid the question.. the same with sending them what i look like. Do you think ill ever overcome this barrier and just get to a point that I do it",16Feb2020,1

5,"For the past couple of years I’ve been a part time (3/4th) student. I’ve worked full time and I’ve done either online/hybrid classes or late afternoon/evening to accommodate my working hours. I had a decent paying job with great benefits. I graduated with my AA and since I’ve transferred to a state university. I’m currently working on my bachelor degree in molecular microbiology. 

After a lot of consideration my husband and I agreed that I should take on attending school full time in order to finish my program sooner than later. He pushed this idea and claimed he’d support me. This meant he would have to take on all the bills and we would try to conserve as much as we can for the next two years because, it will more beneficial in the long run for both of us. I anxiously quit my job and became a full time student. I’ve burned through most of my savings through paying bills, university tuition, and households things even after quitting my job. 

Ever since I’ve ran out of savings my husband seems to be using money as a mean to control me. I am no longer contributing money and he is sure to hold it above me. It started with subtle comments and it’s escalated. For instance, he screamed at me for burning through 1/4 of a tank while I was out running necessary errands. He continued on, screaming at me about how much money the bills costs. Another example being, he was upset with me and suspended my phone service in order to teach me appreciation. You know, for all he does now as in paying the bills. He continues making me feel like such a useless piece of shit. He’s obviously not handling being sole provider well. 

This is the very first time I have ever been without a job. I feel like I made such a mistake. No, I don’t feel. I know now. Already we are having such significant issues. I put myself in a vulnerable position thinking I could rely on the support of my husband and we knew things would be tight. We’ve condensed a lot and removed any extras. 

I’m thinking of dropping out of the university and returning to the work force full time to keep myself financially independent. Right now my studies consume my time. I couldn’t support a full time position and with a part time one I couldn’t live independently. This way I can leave. I can’t leave without money. As much as I hate the thought of giving up on my dreams. I really hate the hell I am living in right now where I can’t even go to the store and buy a $2 tea because well I don’t have the money and secondly my husband would scream at me for wasting money. 

I fucked up. 

What would you do if you were me? 

I clearly need a plan. 

TL;DR: I resigned from my job to attend university full time for two years. Husband supported and pushed this decision. Now he uses money to control me. I want to drop out to be able to skedaddle.",16Feb2020,1

9," I'm a highly functional person that was unfortunately diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder depressive type.

I also get visual hallucinations of which I see myself cutting or hanging, or see my living cat, and see one of my friends, which I understand, is more of a comfort thing.

10,"I'm (21F) a senior in college currently in the process of applying to medical school. I attend school in NY, but my parents live in FL. After I graduate in May, I will be going back home to FL for the summer. I have already applied to various programs and jobs throughout the country waiting to hear back. And am applying to medical school to start after a gap year.

I come from a VERY traditional South Asian family. My parents have always been helicopter-type and overbearing - tracking my phone's location, forcing multiple daily phone calls, putting a security camera IN MY APARTMENT, and even calling the cops to check up on me once when I was asleep because I missed their called as my phone was on silent. I've had to deal with their insanity because I am VERY financially dependent on them, and any time I piss them off they threaten to make me drop out of college and get me married. Empty threats-but they do the job of ""scaring me straight."" TBH I'll do what I want anyways, I've just become a very good liar.

I got engaged in December - it was arranged by my parents. But I recently called it off because he and his family began to prioritize my moving in with him over my going to medical school. They created the ultimatum that if I didn't get into the school in his city, that I should not pursue medical school. This is whack asf, so I said peace out lol. This has really ruined my relationship with my parents, who did not want me to call off the wedding.

It has become clear to my that my parents do not prioritize my career goals and expect me to follow their traditional values to become a housewife. This week, my parents got mad at me for being out at 1AM with friends, so they have locked me out of my bank account and changed the login info. I am tired of their BS and want out. So, I have decided that once I hear back from the programs and jobs I've applied to, I'm going to pick the best opportunity and pursue it, with 0 financial help from them. They use the fact that I need daddy money as leverage and I'm not trying to give them that power anymore. Once they realize that I'm about to financially cut myself off from them, they will be shocked and all hell will break loose, I can feel it in my bones. But this is the only way for me to establish the boundaries I need.

In August, I want to move out and pursue medical school and finance it myself through loans. I've always had everything done for me so I'm pretty overwhelmed at where to begin. I have no idea how to adult.... If anyone has any tips or can point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate that. Here are some questions that have crossed my mind.

1- My dad has my birth certificate, passport, SS card, and everything. I can't simply just ask him for these. If I order replacement documents, will my home address be sent any sort of confirmation that another copy has been requested? If I get copies of these documents, but my dad also has copies, is this bad? Can he do things/access my finances with these copies?

2- I've never had/used a credit card, but my dad has had one in my name which he uses to build me credit. He would never try to sabotage my credit. But, is there a way for me to remove myself from this card without him knowing/being able to stop me?

3- I have a joint bank account (BOA) with my mom which my parents have access to. I only use this account to buy food. But I have quite a bit of savings in my bank account, do I have a claim to this money, and how can I access it if my parents have locked me out and monitor this account?

4- As a student tutor, I get my paychecks mailed to me and use cash for all my other expenses. I want to open another bank account, if I use BOA, will my mom have access to the new one as well? If my parents find out about this account, can they just walk in and claim a right to access it?

5- If I take out student loans, do I need someone to co-sign? I have no clue how loans work. If I have my brother (19 years old), cosign and I happen to die somewhere down the line, will my brother now have to deal with my debt? Are loan counselors biased? Will I be manipulated into selling my soul to the government? What resources can I use to make the most informed decision?

6- Is there anything else I should be thinking about? My plan is to completely cut off financial ties to my parents. I hope they understand I am serious about this and support me. But, worst case scenario is that they will cut off familial ties and not speak to me anymore. Best case scenario, they realize if they still want a relationship with their daughter, they can support me and respect my choice to be independent.",16Feb2020,1

14,"So if you read my other post about this dude. I probably deleted them but he was acting different I think I caught him on a bad week. When I would chat with him he would say I gtg mid conversation. The first time it happened, I didn’t mind cuz like hey people gotta go and it was just this one time I thought. Then I text him the next day and he says it again. Jus mood not clearly changing from the one before. And I’m getting a little agitated. And I stop texted him for 5 days. Calm down. Makes sure he’s gets a break from talking to me. So I text him again just hitting him up on something then I asked how has he been? And we had a conversation. He was actually like communicating back. And things were going pretty well. Until he said he “anyway gtg” so I just left him on read This time I’m getting a little suspicious. He seemed in a fairly good mood and wasn’t in the same attitude he was with me those other times. But got cut short with try again. Ugh why do you people just say that?

17,"I've been going through a lot lately. I was recently diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, and even just that put a whole lot of weight on me. Soon after, I lost my job because I had to go back to the hospital and my parents chose this opportune moment to kick me out(I'm 19 by the way), even knowing that I really had nowhere else to go. Thanks to my boyfriend, I found a place to stay and a job with a family friend of his, but near immediately had to leave because I wasn't getting paid which meant I couldn't pay rent, and even though that was entirely said family friend's fault, and I was told that it wouldn't be an issue, I was still made to leave. Now I've been staying with my boyfriend and his family for a few days, but his parents are saying that I can't keep staying here, so I'm left in a bit of a hard place. All the stress from this has made my anxiety and depression near impossible to deal with, I've had suicidal thoughts more than ever before in my life, and my MS has been getting worse and worse while I wait for my treatment to be available to me. I'm looking for jobs and a new place to stay but everything seems to just be taking longer than I have to wait. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

18,"hey guys. im currently 17 years old and im dealing with a severe pain in my ass - college applications. about a month ago, i got rejected from my dream school and ever since i've been contemplating a LOT. i applied as a business major mainly because i thought it was the most viable option. my dad is an entrepreneur, my older sister is a recent graduate with a business degree, and business just seems like an overall safe career choice.

earlier today i was at lunch with my family and my older sister really got on my ass for not following my passion. she basically said that i was only doing business for the sake of getting by rather than actually being passionate about it. i was then roasted by my entire family in the middle of PF Changs for being an average joe. 

of course in the moment i was heated but now that im really thinking about, i realize they're right. i don't really care about business - i only applied for it because my whole family also did it and it seems like a safe option. the problem, however, is that i have no fucking passion in anything. i am literally an average joe in just about every field. 

i will admit, im interested in liberal arts types of fields. i LOVE cultural stuff, religion, journalism, and im twiddling with photography/videography but im not good enough to pursue any of these fields. not to mention, most of these majors lead to unstable careers and that just doesn't seem like a risk i would want to take. i think what i need to do is start exploring different things but a part of me feels like it's  too late. i would appreciate any advice!",16Feb2020,1

I also really stopped taking care of myself. I really need that to change. I want to care about and for myself as much as the average person does or more. I am therefore excited to start doing the below:

- healthier diet
- exercise
- cut my hair more often
- shave face and body more often
- well needed change of wardrobe
- go to the dentist for the first time in years
- fix BO issue (with very strong pharmacy products + both roll on and spray deodorants) and use cologne daily, not just socially on weekends
- fix snoring issue with the help of a professional
- apply moisturiser daily to fix dead skin on face issue
- fix back and shoulders posture with the help of appropriate product

I finally took a shot and asked if she wanted to go to a concert with me in a city where we’d have to stay the night at a hotel and she was all for it. The concert we went to was a couple weeks ago. While we were there she mentioned how someone at her job quit and she’s have to work more since she’d be a little understaffed. Since the concert, there’s been two times where she hasn’t texted back. Is this something I should be concerned about or should I continue to give her the benefit of the doubt that she is busy with work? Should I ask if she wants to hangout again sometime?

29,"This man move in to a house nearby, about a five minute walk from my house, about six months ago and has already caused issues in the neighborhood. The issue I personally have with him is how one, possibly two, of his cats comes into my yard and terrorizes my cats.

Now, just to give you some insight on the cats I have and the living situation: there are five people living in this house (including myself), seven cats (three are strictly indoor cats) and the house is on two acres of land with 1/3 of it being fenced in.

Three of the cats are strictly indoor cats. One of them is an indoor cat, but he tends to find a way to escape outside for a few hours. The last three are indoor-outdoor cats. They usually stay in the yard (except for one, he was born a stray and we took him in as a kitten; he always liked to wander).

Now, our largest male is a relatively large and fluffy cat. He usually keeps all the stray cats away and deals with rodents. We never had problems with stray cats since we adopted him, but recently the guy living nearby has been a problem because of his animals. He hoards animals, but it like an organized hoarding. We know for sure one of the cats coming into the yard is his. There is another cat that's been coming around but we aren't too sure if that one belongs to him.

We would sometimes hear cats fighting outside, and it was always those two other cats fighting my dad's cat (the one who keeps the strays away). It was more of an every couple days type event, but for the past two nights it has happened. We can keep all the cats inside except for the one, the one that keeps strays away. Like, we literally can not keep him inside. He absolutely refuses to use a litter box despite all the methods of litter training we have done and, if you do not let him go outside, he will jump on counters and tables, look you in the eyes and knock things over. He is demanding, to say the least, but ever since he grew past kitten size he has helped reduce the stray cat population in the general area. He has also helped deal with rodents.

I genuinely don't know what to do about the neighbor's cat. It is more persistent than strays- it keeps coming back. The guy who owns that cat is a complete inconvenience and cannot be trusted to cooperate- he has proved that on multiple occasions, for him actions definitely spoke louder than words. I haven't confronted him yet, and I'm not sure if I want to because he does not seem right. I was considering writing a letter and tying it to his gate to warn him that if it keeps up I'll have to call animal control or something, but I don't know if that would solve the issue.",16Feb2020,1
31,"I am a x-ray technologist and i work in a small clinic in my town.

The clinic that I work in is a pretty small one, I really liked the people that i worked with but the manager. The managing is shitty here, she's not even properly trained as a manager but she's there becuase her husband is a familiy member of the owner (of the clinic).

Because the manager was so manipulative, she was almost micromanaging all of our stuff (like she would interfere our job as receptionist, ultrasound techs, and x ray techs, she thinks she is entitled to do so) and keep squeezing in late patients in a small time slots when we were literally fully booked.

I was trying to speak up for myself and the people that I work with, and of course, she didn't like it. It was so obvious that our relationship was getting worse even other people could tell that. **She ended up cutting my days off from 4 days to 1 day a week, without any notice or giving me heads up, which made me lose all respect towards her, and think about quitting there.** (no surprise, I have been working here for 3 months and 6 people quit.)

I have recently applied and I am having two interviews next week.  I am pretty sure I will be hired in at least one of them. And I got fired from my workplace today (I kinda knew it because she has a personality that everyone calls her a snake).

36,"Just some quick details for anyone that isnt familiar with marketplace: 

You sign up through marketplace and then pick a plan through an insurance provider. Depending on your income, marketplace will provide some or all of the money for the coverage. They will then pay the insurance company. 

My situation: 

I signed my husband and I up through marketplace. I picked a plan and after discovering the cost difference, did not complete enrollment. It was going to be $400/month, after marketplace paid $800/month towards the coverage. We could not afford this, so never completed enrollment. I receive an email from bluecross/blueshield saying they received our application through marketplace and we needed to pay so our enrollment could be complete. 

I ignore email. I recieve nothing else, no mail, no emails- until june. Thats when I recieve an email saying that since we never paid/sent in required documents our coverage was cancelled. Im confused, but leave it alone, because at this point  husband had coverage through job. And I had found a doctor that had her own insurance plan set up just through her office. 

Now i have completed our taxes for the year and I recieve a letter saying I need to amend because marketplace paid $800/month to BCBS until June, when our plan was officially canceled. 

I call customer service to marketplace and they inform that I was signed up from Jan-June, but since we had other insurance, we will have to pay the premium back through our taxes. Which will amount to be $4,800. 

This is insane. We never completed the process. I was under the impression that it never went through. And now we have to pay it back??? I plan on contacting BCBS and the IRS, but that wont be until monday.

40,"Best to start at the beginning I suppose apologies for the length. In 2009 my dad and I moved out to Nevada just the two of us. Even though I only got to see him every other weekend he always showed up, never missed a visit, and was always there for me no matter what. Having a “mom” that just bailed on me because she decided she didn’t want to be a parent anymore just made us even closer. He was really my best friend and the only person I could always rely on and tell everything to. In 2012 I had to move back to Michigan. Unfortunately while I was here he was diagnosed with metastatic renal cancer. He had mentioned to me that he was seeing someone ( a year almost two ) but I never got the chance to meet her or speak to her. Until I received a phone call from her telling me that my dad was just given his last rights. It was a very fast decline only about a week or less but as soon as I hung up I booked a flight and was out there that same evening about 6 hours later. She willingly picks me up at the airport to bring me to my dad. Getting off the plane was the first time I got to meet her, not good circumstances but glad she was there for my dad so I welcomed her with open arms just like she did me. Unfortunately he passed not long after I showed up and said goodbye. And what followed was the hardest 3 months of my life. He was never married and never had another child. So everything fell to me to take care of. Arrangements, his apartment and belongings, contacting family, paying outstanding bills etc. Only being 20 at the time I was beyond lost. He was cremated. When I received his ashes, she took it upon herself to open up the box and the bad and proceed to “split” his ashes in half. The second that box opened it felt wrong I don’t really know how to explain it but it just didn’t feel right. I was so distraught with the whole situation ( his passing ) and alone because someone I just met was the only person there for me. So I really didn’t have the guts to tell her I’m not okay with it and I don’t like it. But we talked and spent the next month together. She explained to me how she would always be there for me, how much she loved my dad, if I ever needed to talk or whatever. I thought we were going to obviously continue our relationship the way it was so with that understanding I was okay with having half of his ashes with her. Following that I came back to Michigan and continued to call/text and keep in contact with her. There was a 1 year memorial for my dad in Michigan so I agreed to pay for her round trip ticket to be able to come to Michigan for that and gave her a place to stay and food etc. while she was here. After she left I talked to her once and then after many many many attempts at calling ( in times of need or not) I would get the same no answer response, I’m busy, I’m with the grandkid, I’m working, or sick, but I’ll get in touch later. And she never did. After 3 years of losing sleep over this and thinking about it almost daily I finally realized that things aren’t what I’d hoped or we discussed and they never would be. Under these circumstances I’m not okay with her having his ashes, so I reached out to her again to let her know. And why I’m feeling that way. She decided to read my message and not respond to that one either. Being left with no options I contacted her daughter and asked if she was at all aware or if she could pass along my phone number. Her daughter sent me a nasty message going on about how selfish I am, what a bad person I am, that her mom deserves those ashes ( whatever that means ) and ended it with if I contact her or her mother again she would call the police and file harassment charges. All I was asking for was the ashes, and offered to make and pay for a keepsake for her. I’m not sure where to go from here, but I’m also not sure if I’m making something out of nothing. ? I know nothing will bring him back, but something about this has just never felt right.",16Feb2020,1
41,"Visited a “abandoned antiquity shop” and happened to me something creepy

Sorry for my bad English, but I need help.
At 11:20 PM my friends &amp; I went doing urbex in a old antiquity shop, after, I robbed a kind glass support made of silver.  After getting out, (and also getting really bad vibes like very creepy shit) find out one of my friends was recording, we all saw the tape, and in one particular part of the tape, we heard like if someone punched a piano (like no joke) no one made a single noise in the shop. We were all scared are first and we were so scared we just went home, getting home I don’t know why, I got this feeling that someone was watching, and my intuition said that I should throw away the objects I robbed, I don’t know why but when I walked away from the shop I felt wayyy better.
But I got a question, was it a good idea to throw away the objects I robbed? Pls help.

My friend also robbed some stuff, a old clock and a lighter that could play music (how in the world?!) he said the clock was fine, but the lighter gave him really bad vibes and made him feel creeped. Can he keep it, or should also throw it? 

I got the tape of the piano noise now",16Feb2020,1

I dont know what to do or say l. 
I just love him so much but by the end of this month when my dad gets his paycheck, hell bring one of my dog (which just so happens to be the one im the most attached to) to the dog shelter, because he bit my dad (way back) and he keeps picking fights with our other male dog. They might put him to sleep or they might give him away, but its most likely theyll put him to sleep because he bit my dad. 

I dont know how to deal with all this, but i just hate my mom now. From the beginning it was all her idea to take him to the dog shelter. After doing a little 10 min search on results of getting your male dog castrated ON FACEBOOK (may i fucking add), she concluded that his behaviour would become worse. I fucking hate her,  fucking hate her, i fucking hate her. Ive always loved my mom deeply and ive always had a deep and good relationship with her but shes such a bitch for doing this. 

YOU CANT MAKE THE FUCKING CONCLUSION THAT A DOGS GOING TO ACT WORSE AFTER BEING CASTRATED FROM FUCKING FACEBOOK. 

And my dad is agreeing with her decision like an idiot. He didnt at first, he let our dog stay longer but for some reason hes on board with her now. I just cant believe it, theyre really going let him be put to sleep like that. On top of all of this, my mom's acting like a complete asshole. She says things like ""When i get my money at the end of this month, ill finally get rid of that stupid dog"" or ""Dont get near that ugly dog!""

I cant believe her, she's being completely heartless. Ive tried talking to them but as usual my opinion doesnt matter, theyre the adults and im the kid who should never be listened to.

44,"I have a boyfriend of around 4 years and I love him so much, more than I’ve ever loved anyone before. But I feel like I’ve been unhappy for a while, and although we do have good times I feel like the bad is outweighing the good lately. He has really bad mood/anger problems and I feel like they’ve gotten worse over time. But I still do love him, and we are so involved and I can’t imagine my life without him, as every thing I’ve imagined for the future has him in it.

However, the last couple months have been a bit complicated. We bought a new apartment and moved in, down the road is a convenience store where I met Alex* (not a real name for the sake of privacy).

Alex and I hit it off straight away, just being friendly but had an amazing connection and every time I went to buy something we’d end up talking for at least an hour. It then moved onto him asking for my number, which led to occasional texting, and fast forward to now, regular texting, phone calls and we went on 2 ~dates~. Not sure what to call them, nothing happened, but there’s definitely something there. 

I’ve found myself none stop thinking about Alex, for at least the past month and I don’t know how I’ve gotten myself into this situation. I’ve never cheated on anyone, and although I haven’t yet physically done anything I feel like it’s going too far. 

He’s distracted me from my sadness and my problems though. I feel less effected by my boyfriends moods and anger. Less emotional. But I don’t want to lead either on. 

I’m scared if I leave my partner I’ll regret it (regardless of Alex in the picture or not) because he does have so many special qualities.

I don’t want to let go of Alex because tbh it’s something I just don’t want to do?

I have no idea how I’ve ended up in this situation but I don’t want to hurt anyone, I’m a confused anxious mess and so lost.

52,"I have two friends that I booked a holiday with a couple of months ago. We kinda did it on a whim, quite impulsively, and we were really excited about it for a while. These friends have been my friends for about a year, however I would definitely describe our friendship as quite superficial because it was mostly based around going out and doing fun stuff, talking about issues like romantic relationships or annoying stuff at work etc rather than deeply personal issues.

I have PTSD and recently experienced a mental health crisis which meant that I was out of contact with my friends for a week because I was feeling really unwell and needed to ‘batten down the hatches’ and focus on myself and getting through the day. When I was well again, I contacted my friends to apologise and shared that I had been struggling but I was OK now. My friends decided that they aren’t going to accept my apology and that they don’t want to be friends with me anymore, because they felt that I should have relied upon them for support and been open and honest sharing my struggle with them while it was ongoing, something I do not feel able to or even particularly want to do. This is totally fine, we clearly had significantly different expectations of our friendship and different values that we want from our friends. On a level deeper than the previously superficial aspects of our friendships, we clearly aren’t compatible or suited.

The only problem is, that now we have this holiday coming up which we all planned to go on. One person paid the entire amount, and we were planning to pay them back. My two friends are still going to go, however it would obviously be super awkward for me to go too. I don’t really want to pay for a holiday that they have rescinded my invitation to, but I have a feeling that they will react very negatively if I decide not to pay them back.

53,"Hey everyone.

I'm a 17 year old in Canada about to graduate, and teachers have changed my life, especially in high school.

My high school English teacher is one of my mentors, role-models, and has changed my life for the better. I don't know where I'd be without him, and it's the kind of teacher that he is along with so many other teachers I know that have inspired me and made my day just a little bit brighter that serves as the reason I want go enter the profession.

My dream is to be a high school English teacher. It's been that for the past three years. I want nothing more than to be able to inspire and support my students by using the power of literature and writing to spread messages of support, meaning, and themes prevalent in our lives.

I love English, teaching, and mentoring people more than anything, and I've known for a while in my gut that this is the job I'm meant to pursue.

I know there are many bumps in the road with teaching, in terms of exhaustion, to the crappy job market (I live in Ontario so that 100% doesn't help), but the pros to me outweigh the cons no matter what.

Here is where my issue lies. I have very strict and traditional Asian parents that have wanted me to pursue being a doctor or lawyer for years. We have always had a rocky relationship, and I grew up in a quite toxic household. I never felt safe or secure at home; school was my escape.

When I told my parents back in grade 10 that I wanted to go into teaching, they told me they were giving up on my future and were going to move somewhere cheaper to live (I go to a very academically focused and prestigious high school) because my future no longer meant anything to them. Many emotional and physical fights broke out, and my house became hell.

In the eyes of my parents, I became worthless. I had wasted their time, energy, and money for nothing.

I didn't want to move however, so I lied and said I would go into law to appease them. This lie killed me to keep up, and I had many nights where I'd lie awake and wish that I could just change my mind and stop wanting to become a teacher.

Two years later, and the truth is out of the bag again due to University applications and financial decisions being made.  
My parents have fully given up on my future now. I'm being banned from attending two of the top Universities I applied to, which are my top choices, because they cost more money and my parents think I don't deserve a degree from those places anymore. I'm being cut off and forced to pay my whole tuition and resources by myself.

I'm not in a secure financial position at all, and I don't know what to do. My house is becoming hell, and I'm scared I'm going to lose my passion and desire to teach through all the turmoil that'll occur as a result of that choice.

I've struggled for all these years with wanting to be a teacher. Nobody among my grade takes teaching or the humanities seriously at all. It's taken me a long time to break free of the mentality my parents have put on me and gain self-esteem and self-awareness for what I want in my life.

My parents think I'm now a waste of space and me being a teacher has become the most sour and painful topic among my house.

I'm at a lost for what to do now. I know I need to start saving hardcore and get a part-time job, but I feel my soul being sucked out of me. 

I don't want to give up on this passion of mine because of my parents, no matter how ugly the battle may get.

55,"What should I do?

Hey y’all. I’m really stuck between two schools. I’m stuck between UT and Reed College up in Portland. I want to major in engineering and I got accepted to UT’s engineering program. However, I want to be an aerospace or electrical engineer, but I got in to civil. I know the transfer requirements are purely GPA based, but I’m nervous I may not be able to attain the GPA to get my transfer. Here are the pros and cons for each. 


Reed pros:
- Portland, Oregon
-hella liberal (like me)
-I can go for two years, get a bachelors in compsci and then transfer to Columbia for two years to get my bachelors in engineering (which is more prestigious than a UT engineering degree) 
- Small 
-very easy to go to grad school with a Reed degree

Reed Cons: 
-might be really expensive (waiting on aid)
-I’d have to take an extra year to get my engineering degree 
-not as many resources as UT 


UT pros:
-in-state tuition
-already in engineering
-austin is cool as hell
-very good engineering program

UT cons: 
-didn’t get into engineering honors
-only receive one degree
-there’s the risk of being unable to transfer into the major i want and being stuck in it
-slightly less liberal 

So, I’m really stuck. I know this is the UT sub so I’m expecting a lot of bias, but I truly need some more opinions. I love both colleges and really want the immense resources from UT, but I also want the small class sizes and prestige from the Reed/Columbia duo. I have no idea.

So bad that our bus driver picked out our hair crying, knowing full well that we would come back after a few weeks with it just as bad.

61,"21(M) - New Zealand

My father is a top technician at a large Electrical equipment company called Schneider Electric, doesn't have a formal degree but has an engineering mind and a completed electrical apprenticeship. 

Both my brothers are in the construction industry, Oldest brother works in concrete slabbing and the other is the health and safety manager at another construction firm. 

My uncles are all engineers to some degree, one used to be an on call mechanic for oil rigs, another is an electrical engineer. 

In saying all this, I too have an engineering type mind, very detail orientated and always interested in how things work etc. I love cars, especially electric cars, hypercars and racecars and i also love motorcycles. I love the new technology that gets implemented in these vehicles and where that industry is heading. 

Option for University that would put me in that industry would be mechanical engineering.

I have told my parents that i am interested in this industry and i have even gotten myself enrolled at New Zealand's top university.

Sure, i love the automotive industry, i love speed, i love the beauty of cars and the idea of creating / designing something.

Also i feel like i have made my dad happy that im doing some sort of engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

But on the flip side i am also really into / passionate about another industry: Fashion Design.

I am really passionate about fashion, both menswear and womanswear, the history, the famed designers, the fashion houses and of course the clothing. How oneself can use clothing to express themselves, an idea or an emotion. 

The university option for this would be: Fashion Design but at a different uni (still respected)

&amp;#x200B;

Im split, i love both industrys but on one hand i can make my family happy, by choosing a degree that is in a similar sphere as the rest of the men in my family and (please dont get triggered) ""classically"" or ""conservatively"" ""Manly"" 

Or

I can choose something that is brand new to my family, \[ Yes they may not be as happy with my decision \] but its still something that im still passionate about.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe im just being silly and should just stick to the engineering degree ive already enrolled for and keep the passion for fashion as a hobby. But then i think of people like Ralph Lauren who created a fashion empire but still was hugely evolved / passionate about cars and racing.

I had a separate Reddit account where I would post about embarrassing, extremely personal thoughts and experiences. I deleted most of them, but my guy friend somehow found the account and used the removeddit method to retrieve them. I never told him that he couldn’t look at it, but I never told him about the account either. He read through EVERYTHING.( like 20 posts+ my comments) It included sex and masturbation and questions about my sexuality. I’ve talked to him about wanting to experiment with girls, but I never went in depth. He told me he saw the posts and I literally couldn’t breathe from the embarrassment. He said “calm down you can talk to me about it”. He also apologized like 5 min after I almost broke down by saying “I’m sorry I looked at your posts” in the most forced, obligatory, careless way. It sounded like he just wanted to get it over with. 

I called him later that night.... I was shaking. I told him that he fucked up, saying he shouldn’t have said what he said/ saw what he saw. I told him I hated him because of how he made me feel crazy in the head sometimes( even though it’s not actually his fault all the time) after he explained himself I started to feel bad for cursing at him and everything. 

I was gonna apologize...but he told me that I didn’t need to explain myself because he “already knows” and that it’s fine because we were even now. Idk why but the last part really bothered me.

70,"Okay so i wanna be as detailed as i can to give you an idea of what im dealing with, ive known this friend for almost 3 years, hes had feelings for me in the past and its an online friendship.

To start off i first met him in a group chat, he really didnt like me at first because i was more popular than him in that chat, and him + 2 others were moderaters of that chat, and (what i didnt know at the time but he later admitted) he banned me from that group because he didnt like me getting attention and was jealous, but when i private messaged him about it he said ""oh the other person removed you she really doesnt like most people"" and i believed him, so i ended friendships with the girl that he blamed, me and him became friends then on.

And starting out it was really rocky, he'd constantly ghost me, leave me on read and i almost always had to write 2-3 messages just to get him to message back having to ask ""you there?"". And after we sorta bonded he started to reply after only one message but it was hours later because he was ""busy"".

But fast forward again and he asks me to join one of his groups, so im like ""i dont usually join friends groups because when theyre active in it but dont respond to me it makes me feel ignored"". So he assures me otherwise, well after i joined my fears were quickly realized, he constantly ghosted me but was active in that group and his replies to me were the same, he'd reply hours later for me but he dropped the busy excuse because he knew that wouldnt work. So after i left the group due to him not listening to me i started to be insecure when we talked thinking i always had to keep his attention or else he'd ghost me.

And the same exact scenario happened 2 more times in a single year with his groups, so after that i left and never joined his groups again.

So after 1.5 years of knowing him he starts to talk to me more when his other friends got tired of him, i couldnt help but feel like im only needed by him whenever someone better isnt there to take my place. 

And now hes venting to me about how lonely, bored or any other feeling, and it makes me feel terrible because i feel like hes getting bored of me or something, so that mixed with rough upbringings in our friendship just give me the feeling like im always on thin ice with him and that if i slip up he'll think less of me as a friend.

Theres a lot more to tell, like if he joins a group chat and isnt the most popular there he'll leave it, and the fact that every single one of his friends that knew him got tired of him just gives me red flag vibes. 

But it feels like work trying to keep him entertained and i hate the feeling like im under pressure when i should be happy to talk to him, i shouldnt be afraid of him getting bored of me. Is this feeling all in my head or do i have reason for concern? And is there anything i can do to help not feel this way?",16Feb2020,1

72,"I put a vintage mug inside another vintage mug to save space in the cupboard and now they’re stuck together. It’s not stuck by a vacuum, they weren’t warm when I stacked them as they don’t go in the dish washer (being that they’re vintage). It’s been cold here so my only thought is that one night when it was really cold the top glass mug compressed/shrunk and fell further into the bottom mug. I’ve tried the ice in the top mug and hot water around the bottom mug trick and it didn’t work. Also tried vegetable oil and Vaseline with no luck.",16Feb2020,1
73,"The title explains it all, but here’s some context:
All through high school, my sister talked to this particular boy (19 M) and he was the stereotypical jock you see in Hollywood teen movies: handsome, athletic, smart, kind, etc.
My sister fell for him, hard. They’ve been on and off throughout HS, and recently, they got together again. However, she also mentioned to my mom and me about some red flags, such as wanting to know where she (my sister) was, who took pictures she uploaded, at what time she finished school, that kind of stuff.
My mom being recently separated from my dad (also abusive/toxic/violent) told her to stop seeing him. I also told her that. She ghosted him: I told her that wasn’t the best thing, but at least she’s safe now. Anyway, she’s still hung up on him. I’m afraid he might’ve made my sister codependent of him. How can I help her?",16Feb2020,1
74,"We’ve been together for 3 years now and met while we were both living in California. We’ve since moved to London where I’m originally from and she’s having difficulty adjusting as she hasn’t made any of her own friends and doesn’t really get on with mine. As a result of her being isolated she seems to get in a really depressed mood and keeps dredging up her past wanting to discuss it with me. She was sexually abused by her dad as a child for several years but as I have no experience with abuse nor am I a psychiatrist I don’t have any reason to be involved in the conversation and it grosses me out if I’m being honest, she says she just needs someone to talk to but when I get home from worked I just want to relax and I feel like she’s being selfish as I’m brining home all the money and working to build a life for us but she’s obsessing over some unpleasant business from her past. In her defence she’s young (only 23) so can be quite self involved without realising it but I need to find a way to tell her I’m not interested in hearing about her unpleasant childhood without upsetting her as the last time I tried to breach the subject she got extremely upset and I don’t want to hurt her feelings.",16Feb2020,1

76,"I fucked up. I ruined my relationship and I’m heart broken. No, I may not have done anything sexual with someone else, but I lied. 

She’s perfect, everything I could ask for. To put you guys in her shoes, I got a phone call on my phone while we were in the car. It was from an “unknown number” which I new was my ex. But I panicked. And I lied saying I didn’t recognize the number and immediately started shaking which made it obvious. I blurted out that it was my ex, and I immediately felt a punch in my stomach seeing her be upset for the first time. Here’s where I’m wrong. I still kept in contact with my ex, we had a dog together since my ex had clinical depression and we figured it would help. Obviously, we broke up and I stayed with the dog. We only kept in contact over the dog at first, and that’s all we would talk about. But we would have small conversations about new things we got, or new adventures we took apart. Never was it about her and I anymore, and for whatever reason I felt it was okay to keep in contact with her. And, I don’t know why I did. It ruined my relationship that I really thought would take off. 

So, I lied and wasn’t honest to my girlfriend about who the number was, didn’t tell her I kept in contact with my ex, and she can’t trust me, which I completely understand why. But I am just refusing to let her go. I don’t want this relationship to end. I haven’t talked to her since she left my car and I really want to talk to her. Is there any hope..?",16Feb2020,1
77,"I (27m) got a job opportunity with a large company in my current career field of about 3 years ago. The job came with a relocation package as it required I move. Things at my job itself have been great, I even got promoted twice since then, but my social life outside of work has been shit. 

I went from having a decent group of friends to none. I’ve tried putting myself out there both physically and through dating apps and it all has seemed futile. I’ve made acquaintances here and there but none have become friends. 

“Well op maybe it’s you.” I’m a pretty humble dude, but one thing I’m confident about is how welcoming I am. I’ve been told by my peers that I’m nice to be around and many of them are shocked that I’ve failed to make friends. 


I’m not the most extroverted person in the world. I’m kind of a homebody, but that has probably become worse due to my lack of friends. I feel like I have nothing to come home to or look forward to outside of my job. No spouse, no s/o, no family, no calls/texts from local friends asking to hang out. 

I go out to bars and other events but it ends up turning into me sitting or standing the middle of the crowd watching established groups of people interact with each other.

I know that making friends after graduating from school can be tough but this is beginning to feel more difficult than it should be. 

Going back home would feel like I’ve given up. But at the same time I can’t lie to myself anymore. I’m pretty miserable out here. I mean, it’s gotten to a point where I look forward to working just so I can see people I enjoy being around again. 

Sorry for the long read. Any advice?",16Feb2020,1

We talk maybe once a year and when we run into each other we will talk for a long time, all smiles catching up.  Anyway... I never considered him as an interest. We've each had relationships and children over the years. As of lately ... I've been putting myself out there, I've been single and abstinent for a long time. So via snap hes been DM'ing me more often, complimenting, saying he always wish he had a chance, etc, etc. We finally hang out, totally normal, as usual, comfy, slight touchy. We decide to go our separate ways, we hug goodbye. Shortly after he texts saying he wished we could cuddle. I assume he wants to do that plus more ya know. I go for it, i need my fix. I initiate the action bc in this day I feel guys are nervous to do so. who knows. We go to sleep, I leave when he has to go to work. He later texts me all these compliments, says i didn't get to give you a kiss goodbye. Anyway next couple of days we text, casually. Well at this point i'm horny lol. So 3 days later I ask him to hang out with me. We do, he greets me with a kiss, we get a hotel (our homes weren't convenient) we talk a lot, somewhat personal things, watch tv shows, playful, flirty, do the deed a few times. cuddle all night, hold hands, again .... he goes to work, kisses goodbye, complimentary follow up texts. all day...he initiates. then we dont talk for a day or so. he still views my snap. I'm in my head trying not overthink or over feel this new excitement...but i am. So I ask him to dinner. he says he cant, hes leaving super early morn out of town and has lots to do at work still. He did enjoy my company and would like a raincheck.(he did mention this trip before any hookup) I say cool have fun, etc, etc. Next day he texts me his trip got delayed, he lets me know he won't have service (fishing trip) wishes me happy day and a happy valentine day. We chat a bit. He hearts eyes my snap stuff. .... at this point ball is in his court. So i think he can reach out when back or just perfect opportunity to blow me off. I'm new to this 2020 hookup culture and esp. at my age. I know way back when I was living this life guys who hooked up with you did just that without the talks and the extra little efforts.

People say to get 2010 and up and as for the price maybe we can wiggle it down to 10k or so.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
3.1: Any other duties directed by the Facility manager...  
3.3 Carry out work which is not clearly within the ambit of her job title  
3.4 No collective labour agreements (CAO) apply to this agreement (basically signing my rights away?)  
4.1 never discussed actual working hours  
4.2 Not allowed to work anywhere else without written consent otherwise I'm in breach of contract?  
4.3 Excluding Dutch Civil Code seems fishy  
6.1 11.50 euro's an hour and taxes have NOT been deducted...holiday allowance IS included  
8.3 Absence due to accidents within the company have not been excluded so they can terminate my contract if I get hurt (or get sick) on the job?  
9.1 If a company requires me to get training why should I still be held accountable for the cost up till almost a year?!  
14.3 The company may in any event demand that the emplyee should be at the disposal of the Company  
15 In whole...I'm not allowed to invest in any company that is remotely alike for a whole year? Or even seek a job in the same field for 6 months...  
16.3 Deviation from Dutch Civil Code and states that a monetary penalty can be introduced for every breach (according to this Agreement I am waving my CAO rights and they can decide what a breach is).   


The points underneath the contract are the ones I'm most concerned about. **Any advice on if I should sign this, how to proceed, whether it is legal to diverge from the law by explicitly mentioning so, any advice on possibly changing the contract?** I'm at a loss for words...the people seem so genuine and I don't want to start off on a bad note just because the contract seems so bad and shady...

It's now 3 a:m and I'm going to bed. If this post is too long or in breach of any rules (I might've missed) feel free to mark it as spam/inform moderators so they can delete the post. No hard feelings. Thank you so much for reading and I will reply to any posts tomorrow morning!",16Feb2020,1

87,"How do I tell my mom about a B?

I’m a sophomore in college and freshman year I did really well academically. I’m an electrical engineering major.

Sophomore year comes and I start doing more theater and taking more EE classes. I’m realizing how awful I am at the hardware and analog side of EE.  The signals side if taught well I can do well in the class.

However I didn’t realize this until too late, I got 2 Cs, 2 Bs, and 2 As first semester and my mom was furious. She kept yelling at me about all the hard work she put into me and my future success and the bad “return” she’s getting. (I have a previous post in profile detailing more about this) She’s also angry with where her money’s going— she pays for my tuition and basically told me she wasn’t gonna spend money on me getting bad grades.

She said “do you understand? It’s my money! Mine! You are no longer my responsibility anymore!” 

Basically she told me if I don’t get good grades I just shouldn’t come home and that she was gonna stop paying for my tuition (which is around ~$20k a year)

Previous people have told me she probably doesn’t mean this ultimatum and that she’s just worried about my future, but right now I’m worried..

I’m doing well in all my classes right now except my EE class. It’s discrete signals and I thought I could understand it better bc of my experience with continuous signals last semester. The thing is with this class, it’s the professor’s first time teaching the subject and he doesn’t know how to teach. He lectures about conceptual and theoretical stuff, then gives us like 5 million problems every week to study. 

The class grade is only made of weekly class tests and a few projects. The tests are worth 70% of our grade and the projects 30%. He doesn’t give us homework bc “you can find the solutions online” but at this point we’re all doing the problems anyway..

Each test is timed (30 minutes) and he gives us about 2 problems for each test with each problem having 2-4 parts. 

The first test I did well on (93), the second I got a 70, the third I got a 67, and we just had the fourth one and I’m worried I got another 67. Our school goes by the quarter system so we only have 2 more class tests left. 

He does drop the lowest test grade so that’s nice.

I’m planning to read the textbook more and do more problems for the tests, but I’m just so worried bc I’ll need 100s on the last 2 tests in order to get an A in the class. Otherwise I might get a B, and my moms not gonna be happy with that.

Luckily we’ve doing well on the projects so those will at least boost my grade up a little. And I’m not the only one in the class doing bad. When the professor took a survey of the class to get feedback, he found that no one in the class expected to get an A, most people expected to get Bs.

We’re all kind of banking on the professor scaling the class somewhat, but it’s hard to tell because he doesn’t seem like the type to scale the class by a lot.

Now if I weren’t depending on my parents for money I would be okay with a B, but bc they’re paying my tuition I’m worried that with the B they’ll actually stop and of course will be really disappointed in me.

What do I do?? I do plan to read the textbook more and do more practice problems, and have been looking into more on campus jobs and other part time jobs I could do to make money in the event my parents stop paying my tuition.

But what else do I do?? I’m so worried and scared.. partly for the tuition part but also for my mom’s anger and disappointment in me.

I’ve also been thinking of switching to a math major or going into finance because math seems like the only thing I’m actually good at. When it comes to electrical engineering (whether hardware or signals) or computer science/coding it always seems like everyone else knows what they’re doing except me. 

Like in the projects we’ve been doing my group mates always have an idea of what they’re doing and I’m just like how did you do that??? Then I ask them how they study for tests and they’re like oh I put in minimal effort just study some problems. And I’m just like how do you understand???

I hate EE, CS, I cant understand it and am tired about worrying about it so much and feeling so incompetent and inferior. Also bc in the workforce if I don’t know what I’m doing who’s going to keep me hired even if I am an EE grad?

At least with math I enjoy it and can understand it. And know how to work to understand it if I don’t understand something. 

A professor connected me with an alumni who also had trouble with the analog side of EE and was better at math and the signals side, she’s a financial analyst now. When I talked to her last she gave me advice on what EE classes to take. But now I’m thinking of asking her how to get a good job in finance.

My only worry with switching to a math major is less chance of finding good job. According to our school’s post grad report math majors have smaller percentage employment rate than EE grads. However if it might make me happier.. is it worth it?

I also know I would most likely have to go to grad school for at least a masters if I go for a man degree, which I’m fine with.

What do you all think? Any advice is appreciated.",16Feb2020,1
88,"I work in retail at a country store. I love the company and I get along well with my coworkers. I enjoy helping people find gifts/ items they want.


Ever since November of this past year, I feel like I'm not valued as an employee. When my manager arrived on November, I feel as if I'm more of a burden to her than a help. 


For example, a part of my job is to train the new employees. My manager doesn't let me do my job and instead makes her select pick of employees to do so. What's the point of having me in that job if you won't let me prove my worth. 


I'm scared of asking her questions because I dont know when she's going to be a sarcastic with me or actually answer the question. I don't hate my manager.

89,"When I was younger (around 10,  I'm now 18), I would constantly ask to go on my older brother's computer (he would have been 16) and he would let me on but first we would have to go into his bathroom and he would try and get me to masturbate in front of him and sometimes he would try and get me to touch his penis, or he would try and touch mine. At the time I didn't realise how bad this was but he obviously did as he would tell me not to tell my mother or anyone else. 

Looking at it now I realise how wrong the whole situation was. This has been on my mind for a year or two now and it doesn't help that he still lives at home with me so I still see or hear him at least once a day.  But he doesn't have a significant effect on my mental stability and I find I'm more anxious around him. So for the first question, would you say this counts as being molested? or is it nothing? 

If it does count should I do something about it? I will be leaving home in about 6 months for uni and i can avoid him until then but my main problem with calling him out and telling my parents is it would likely ruin his current life and I'm not sure if he has changed enough to realise the issues with what happened and how it has affect me.

93,"Hi folks,

Like the title says, I'm a former heroin addict about to graduate college.  I'm putting off applying for jobs because I don't know what I want to do yet.

My past is an open secret among many people in my city.  I am very concerned about this eventually hurting me in my career.

I don't want to move per se, but I wouldn't be opposed to it.  I am honestly starting to like the idea of a fresh start.  There's next to nothing holding me back.  The only thing is that I have next to no family, zero friends, and I am living with some family that is my only semblance of a support network.

A) Is this a paranoid thought?  Is my future coworkers potentially finding out a valid concern?
B) Does this generally sound like a good or a bad idea?
C) Does anyone have any experience doing this, uprooting their lives entirely and moving a place where they knew no one?  How was the experience?",16Feb2020,1
94,"So I work at a hospital in a small, close-knit department of 10 females. I am the only single person in the department (relevant info). We are a bit outdated with respect to technology, and are just now getting around to upgrading to Windows 10. My hospital IT department consists of only 5 people, so corporate sent some of their IT people to help the regular guys upgrade all the computers in the hospital. 


So one of our regular guys, Mark, comes in with another guy, Jason, who turns out to be from corporate. Jason and I strike up a conversation about my computer, and he says he will be helping me out with the upgrade. I say sweet, he asks me to let him sit so he can back up a few things on my user profile. While he’s doing that, we’re chatting about nothing in particular, both laughing and joking around. He says he’ll be back later, apparently with a new computer with all the upgrades. Even cooler. I say see ya later, and he leaves. I go on with my work and he comes back close to the end of my day with the computer. I ask him to sit tight for a few, as I had just secured placement for my patient and needed to input my documentation and call the nurse to give her the heads up re: the transfer. I joke that Jason is rushing my “creative process” by staring at me from behind me, he jokes and says “the pressure’s on!” A little while later, he says, “Do you need me to come back later?” I say “NO” in a way that made him and a few of my coworkers laugh, and I joke, “Who knows if you’ll ever com back with my coveted new computer?!” I wrap up and he takes a seat at my desk, and he pokes fun, saying not to stare at him from the back while he works. He’s setting it all up, asks me to login a few times, and says he’s having trouble with one application coming up blank, so he re-plugs in my old computer and says he’ll be back in the morning. 

When I come in the next day, my coworkers are buzzing, saying Jason and I were so clearly into each other, flirting and all that. I turn beet red, not having realized that’s what was going on. I realized, hey, he’s cute, smart, and funny, and I tell them they have my permission to give him my number if he still seems interested today. He comes in a little while later, saying he’s still trying to figure out why that one application is coming up blank, as he starts to work on a few other coworkers computers. We leave to our morning meeting, with Jason and Mark in the office with Ginger, who sits at the front desk by the door. We come back from huddle, Jason and Mark are gone, and Ginger tells me in front of my coworkers that Jason thought I was married because I wear a ring on the finger that is regularly reserved for a wedding ring (just happens to be the only finger that ring fits on). Ginger had given Jason my number, after finding out that he is single as well, and I smile, not having made a connection like this at first meeting in a while. Another coworker told me Jason came back with a different IT guy and nonchalantly asked where I was before I had made it back from the meeting. 

When Jason comes in a little later with fresh computers, two of my coworkers start coughing really loudly, in the way people do when they’re being childish when a person of interest enters a room. Jason is clearly uncomfortable and asks jokingly if everyone got sick all of a sudden. He didn’t come to the back part of my office where my desk is that day until much later, and stayed up at the front by Ginger’s desk, even when his fellow IT buds were back close to me chatting. He did set up my computer, but didn’t say much, even when Mark was asking me about the pictures I have of my cat and dog in my cubicle. I left for the day and he did not text me that night; I was a little bummed, I’ll be honest. 

The next day comes, and Jason’s back, doing his computer setup stuff again. Ginger is able to talk to him alone, as he was working on her computer, and he says he was so embarrassed, like everyone was talking about him/us. Ginger and another coworker tell me that I should wait it out and give him space, as he was made very uncomfortable by the obvious fake coughing. I, on the other hand, feel terrible, and want to pull him aside on Monday and let him know I’m so sorry about what happened and that it was never my intent for him to feel negatively in any way. I also don’t know how much longer he will be at my hospital, so I don’t want to miss my chance to get this guy to text me and see if we can make something happen. 

So Reddit, what do you say? Let him be, or pull him aside and say my peace?",16Feb2020,1

96,"Trigger Warning: Self-Injury

(Originally posted on r/mentalhealth) I don’t know what to think. I tend to forget things that happen to me, especially memories I consider bad. In fifth grade, my mental health declined and I turned to self-harm as a coping mechanism. My mother caught on. She once opened the door to check on me while I was in the bathroom. She also wanted to watch me shower. She told me how to shower, including washing. I think she touched me. I’m uncomfortable and I still wasn’t then. She cares, she’s just trying to tell me how to shower. She saw scars on my legs and said things like “Why are you doing this to yourself?”. I just remember staring down at my legs and feeling terrible. I stayed quiet. Why does this memory suck so much?? Sometimes I’m even scared to go into that bathroom because I’m scared she’ll decide to check up. Sometimes she mentions that she’s should watch me shower because I’m not showering well enough for her and I feel scared. What should I do and why does it take a toll on me so much? I don’t really have the right to complain though. I probably am just being dramatic. She did say that I make myself nervous and it’s pretty accurate.",16Feb2020,1

While I was on my computer, I placed my foot over his foot thinking it was part of the table. I felt him staring over at me, but at the time, I was oblivious so I just thought he was being weird. When I finally look down and realize I haven't been playing around with the table and HIS FOOT, I quickly moved it away. For some reason, it happened again and he still didn't say anything. When class was over, he walked away without a word. He is usually a very vocal and confrontational person, so I would assume he would tell me to stop or point it out to me. But he didn't.

101,"I (f22) live in university accommodation. We were scheduled to have maintenance come to look at all the accommodation blocks light fittings on Friday. Usually they are accompanied by a security officer but not always. I was very tired when I got in from my lectures and so I doubled locked my door and decided to just lie on the bed and rest my eyes, thinking that I’d hear when the maintenance man was unlocking my door and since it was doubled locked I’d have enough time to get up. Unfortunately I fell asleep and I didn’t hear the door go and so when I woke up the maintenance man was already well into my room. You can’t see the bed from the front door so I wasn’t surprised he came in as he wouldn’t have known I was in there otherwise he probably wouldn’t have come in. By the time I was properly awake he was next to my bed and must have seen me as it’s such a small room. Because I was so embarrassed to be caught sleeping I decided I’d just continue to stay as if I was deeply asleep, facing away from him. I thought he’d leave quickly but instead he actually lingered in the room and I could hear him quietly tinkering with something, I’m assuming the light fitting. Then I felt a weight in the bed and he sort of leaned over me and put a hand on my arm. At this point I was freaked out but still didn’t reveal I was actually awake as I panicked. After a few moments he then got off the bed and put a blanket over me and left. As soon as my door was shut I got up and locked myself in my bathroom until I was sure he’d left the flat. I told one of my flat mates later and they told me I was being overly dramatic to find it invasive and that it was actually a sweet thing to do. A friend told me that the maintenance team are probably immune to seeing napping students so carry on their business as usual and that it’d be pointless to report it to anyone as they’d assume I’d just fallen back to sleep and dreamt the last part. I don’t know how to proceed but I feel very uncomfortable now being alone in the flat and make sure I’m up and dressed before the maintenance team start even on my days off and with no work scheduled as I’m worried he’ll come into my room.

113,"A throwaway account. Please forgive me for any errors, I'm still very new to Reddit. 

Me (15f) and my close friend Ashley (15f) are fairly confident that our other friend Zelda (18f) is being physically and emotionally abused by her boyfriend (19m). I, Ashley, and Zelda go to the same school together and are all friends. I've only known Zelda for five or six months now, but we really hit it off. She's the opposite of me: small, real shy, and has some bad anxiety.

I will admit now and feel deeply ashamed that I actually don't know much of the situation, or have any proof of this. Zelda has only ever talked to me personally about her relationship once, around last weekend. It was then she told me how abusive it really is, and ever since then I've looked back and now recognized some red flags. It's to my information that Ashley knows a hella lot more on the situation than me, but we haven't swapped info yet. 

The information I know as of right now is as follows:

\- Zelda has been in this relationship for a fair amount of time, around 3-5 years. 

\- Around Christmas time, Zelda told me that she either suspected or caught boyfriend cheating, I can't remember which.

\- She wanted to message the girl cheating with boyfriend to try and get her to confess. She never told me if she went through with it, but she did tell me she was worried, because what if boyfriend got angry at her?

\- She tried to break it off with him. Ashley told me she also tried to break it off with him back in September too, but they ended back together in the end. I don't know any of the specifics. 

\- There was also an incident where Zelda and boyfriend both went to a party, this January. Zelda gave boyfriend her non-alcoholic drink so she could use the washroom. When Zelda came back, her cup was on the table where boyfriend put it, and boyfriend was nowhere in sight. The rest of the night she felt off, and when she got home, she was sick and out of it. I believe she said her mom had to carry her to bed. Later, when Zelda had to get a drug test for unrelated medical reasons, they saw some stuff that shouldn't have been in her system. I don't know if it was just a coincidence, but I'd thought I'd mention it anyways.

\- Last weekend was when things got real bad though. She called me on snap, and she had it really bad with some sickness. Her temperature was around 40 Celcius, and she just felt terrible with a headache and sore throat. Because her family was out of town on a trip, she was at boyfriend's house. She begged him to take her to the hospital, but instead, boyfriend and his sister went for a four-hour skidoo ride. When they got back, I could hear both boyfriend and sister arguing badly, but couldn't make out what they were saying. Then, they started going at it on Zelda. That was when she hung up and told me she was going to bed.

\- On that call, she confessed to me that boyfriend would get angry at her often, and when he did, it wasn't uncommon for him to actually ***hit*** her. But whenever asked by someone how their relationship was going, she would deny any abuse because she feels at fault. 

\- She also never takes off her sweater, or any long-sleeved shirt. I do remember her showing me a bruise under her arm, where he was grabbed her hard, that was the same day when she called me. I suspect there could be more than that one bruise.

\- And today, Ashley messaged me to say how worried she was for Zelda. Zelda had called Ashley, crying. Ashley told me she was sobbing about how boyfriend and sister were ""bashing"" (Ashley's words, fairly certain she means in an argument way) on Zelda because Zelda didn't want boyfriend to smoke. Ashley also said Zelda told her the reason Zelda never hangs out with our friend group is that she can never keep boyfriend happy and that he doesn't like it when she goes out.

\- Zelda and sister do not have a good relationship either. Sister is constantly on her ass, making her life miserable. Zelda never gave any examples. 

\- And also just a note that boyfriend doesn't go to school, or he graduated or something, so I've never had the chance to meet him. I don't have any personal experience with him at all. 

This is all really just off my memory. I don't have any proof of any of this, and I'm sure there are more stories. And I feel super bad about sharing this. I don't really have a right to say any of this to anyone, I didn't get her permission. I don't know if I should even talk to her about it. I'm scared if I say anything to Zelda, she'll stop telling us the situation, and things will get worse. I really don't know what to do. I'm just some junior high student, and Zelda's in denial. With no evidence and the victim's okay, I doubt the police can do anything.

Even if me and Ashley collect evidence of this guy abusing my friend, would it even matter if Zelda gave her a-okay? I don't know much about the law, but I live in Canada if you want to give me legal advice, or should I post this in r/legaladvice too? I need non-legal advice aswell. I just have no idea what to do. Is there even anything I can do? I appreciate any words of advice from anyone.

We've never kissed or done anything remotely sexual just wholesome hugs and cuddling and almost falling asleep on each other. Everyone who knows us wants us to be together but I don't see him that way and I don't think he sees me that way either...but I'm not sure. I just need an outsider's perspective on the situation here...is this normal friend behavior? 

Second of all, some things with my parents:  
My parents are nice, but they're strict on a few things. I don't get to go out with my friends much, they don't believe in sleepovers, I can't stay out past sunset, and they have really really strict rules on technology. My internet access is cut off after 10pm until 5:30am the next day, I can't have my phone in my room and it's internet access also cuts off at 10pm each night. I also can't be in voice chats with my friend due to there being limited bandwidth.   
Some background on me: I have average grades (my GPA last semester was 3.68 thanks to a C+ in math because math is *not* my thing), I gravitate more towards nights and I always work better at night (my best essays have come from me just straight *typing* at 11pm since I don't need wifi for notepad and the like), I have probably an overdependence on my friends and books. I like being in voice chats with my friends while I'm doing homework and I prefer multitasking over single tasking (because of this my parents think I'm always distracted and never doing my homework when I *am*). I've also kind of lost motivation for life and school but that's a separate issue.  
This is gonna sound very much like a typical teenager, but this annoys me. I used to have a huge vendetta against calling anyone, but sitting in voice chats with my friends has helped me grow more comfortable being on the phone with people which is a skill I *know* I'm going to need, especially since I'm going into business in the future.   
I know exactly why they're doing all this. They want me to have normal sleep patterns and it's to make sure I stay healthy. And I know full well that in the future I'll appreciate it. Which is why I'm not asking for all the restrictions to be taken away. But I just want them to loosen up a little, maybe let me have wifi and stay up on my laptop a little longer and stay in voice chats? And to be able to go out after dark with my friends or have sleepovers? I don't particularly care whether I get my phone at nights or not since I don't really *need* it.   
Another thing I'd like to be able to do is try different styles of clothes and try to find my own style but my mom places strict restrictions on the materials that things can be (cotton only) so that makes it kind hard in the modern day to find stuff I like that's also affordable and made of cotton.   
I guess all I'm really asking for is how to negotiate this sort of thing with them. My parents are very strict in their resolve with these types of things and I've gotten in trouble twice before for using my phone at night to finish homework or review for tests I have the next day. I'm also really shy with bringing stuff up, since whenever I do try opening up to them I always overhear them after I leave talking about how all the stuff I said is ""nonsense"". Which makes it kinda hard to trust them with things so...

I'm sorry if this is more of a teenage rant then a legitimate advice post but these sorts of things have been on my mind for a long time I just don't really have anywhere else to turn. Any sort of advice is appreciated, thank you so so much in advance. And please, have a good day ♡",16Feb2020,1
120,"Ok so I've been friends with this guy for three years now, and he's an amazing friend but I just think he is to nice. For example, he constantly pokes me, he always calls me cute, says ""I love you"", and he sometimes tells me to cover up cause my shorts are to short (jokingly). I know that it's just his way of being friendly, because he did those things even when he had girlfriends or had crushes on other girls. I've told him before that him saying he loves me makes me a little uncomfortable, he got offended and only stopped for a week or two and still does it. Hes had a few other female friends, but I dont know if hes treated them like he treats me. Anyway, so since valentine's day came up, he said he had a gift for me, I was confused, but he told me it was a friends thing cause he was getting our other female friend a gift. He said he got her a sweatshirt. I had bought him something from a company he loves, because there was a sale and everything was a few dollars. He bought me a polaroid camera. Those expensive cameras. I dont know if I'm over reacting but I feel as though that's to much, especially since he got it for me for valentine's day!! He treats me like his girlfriend, but then talks about other girls to my face, and I know hes not doing it to ""make me jealous"". What's worse Is that I feel like I cant tell him to stop, cause whenever I do he takes it to personally, and he's already going through depressing stuff, I dont want to make it worse. I should have not accepted the camera, but he already bought it, and he already ones one, and I thought of it to late. We shouldnt have even celebrated V-day to begin with!!!

I get that he can have his fun or whatever, but it's fucking annoying on the level worse than listening to fox or cnn. I personally feel like he has a losing problem since he is a very competitive person.

133,"This is a lot to unpack, and I know I will miss something, but I will try my best to keep it semi-organized and make sense. 

It all started with my mother’s ovarian cancer. It was something that she battled for several years. Her mother, my grandmother, has had several different cancers around her body over many many years. My family lives closest to my grandparents (about half an hour away) and the 2 aunts live around 2 hours away, just a bit less. 

Over the many years, my grandparents obviously aged and their mobility declined, my grandma’s dementia progressed although she is good a hiding it. In the same time, my mother’s cancer worsened. Her health steadily declined, countless surgeries left her in a lot of pain from many abdominal scars. Sitting and standing were painful and she could never get comfortable. She lost a ton of weight—something that was scary because she was already a skinny woman. She got sores and her platelet count was very low which caused her to bruise easily and breathing was like she just ran a marathon just slowly walking. Mind you, she was in her very early 50’s so this isn’t some normal elderly response. Long story short, there were scares with her health, many occasions she missed that were milestones in both mine and my sibling’s life. Even still, we were expected to help out with my grandparents and make sure they were okay and we did chores around their home and painted it for them as well. 

It’s hard to condense many years and little details that could string the sense into this story a little more, but essentially my aunts hardly ever helped. One that helped the most I feel goes above and beyond what should be expected of her because my grandma is not her birth mother as she was the child of my grandfather’s from another marriage that had ended unfortunately to his ex-wife’s death. This fact was a cause for a rift with my grandma and eldest aunt and there was a lot of mistreatment to my aunt as she got older, had kids, and my grandma treated her kids different from us younger grandchildren. There’s more detail to that, but obviously in this scenario my grandma was a rather generous woman needless to say. 

However, my younger aunt has never helped hardly ever. Making excuses that they live too far away how could they ever help? As they go on their vacations, as they let my cancer riddled mother struggle to help her own cancer riddled mother and nearly deaf father who has a lot of trouble getting around. My cousins, children of this younger aunt, have never stood up to help anything. Let avoid all family contact. They only come around to take things they like from the house and leave with it. They’re just shitty people more concerned with what they can have and take take take despite them never being around to actually do the part where family takes care of one another. (Funny considering one had their car paid for by my grandparents and then she totaled it.)

A major event that happened before my mother’s passing was the last Christmas we spent together when we had spent the first night being avoided by my cousin who at the time was I think 26-27and my other who was 22 and my uncle who is a molesting pervert, but I won’t go into that detail. Essentially, it was my sibling and parents and my younger aunt with my grandparents that Christmas. The next morning a major fight blew up over the fact that they needed to step up and help my grandma and grandpa more because stuff wasn’t going well for my mom. We as a family were trying hard to take care of her and go to school full time with long commutes. Anyone who has ever studied in medical fields knows how hard and stressful that is. 

Their excuse was that the distance was too much, and I said that it was fucking bullshit. That family meant making sacrifices and we were already making plenty. That it was their turn to act like family for once and help —it was my aunts parents after all. All I can remember is that they couldn’t be bothered to stick around. They always run from confrontation, namely my aunt. My eldest cousin I recall said to “stop being so dramatic.” After having explained the fact that my mother whose cancer made it hard enough just to breathe and talk could not be expected to do that stuff anymore. It was too much and putting it on my sibling and I, at the time 22&amp;25 while we are trying to finish school (something our cousins personally chose not to go to) and be with our family. I told them to fuck off and the next time I ever saw my aunt and uncle was 3 months later when my mother was on her hospice bed at home with us. It was a horrible and traumatizing time we went through with her last days. Family was only there 1 day and the next gone so they missed a lot of the bad days. My cousins never showed up to say goodbye. 

Only a few months later my aunts expect me to start taking my grandma to her radiation appointments to the same place my own mother had to go for hers. It was such a sickening feeling, it was horrible, but I did it for my grandmother. My aunts don’t understand why I’m angry with them, though they forced my sibling and I to be in a position we never wanted to be in. One that all the other grandkids didn’t have to be in. My grandmother’s dementia has made her very toxic some days and she easily comes to cane throwing, foot stomping tantrums over the littlest of things. One that I had to put up with while at one of these appointments and she threatened to jump out of my car while driving because I didn’t go to the Hyvee she wanted to. 

My aunts all excused her behavior and ignored the fact that her dementia is getting worse. In fact, they don’t even think she has it despite the doctors confirming she does. It’s obvious just speaking with her. 

Anyways, fast forwarding through time we argued countless times for my grandma to be using her walker. She had fallen and broken her hip and had to crawl to the phone to call for help, but she called her neighbor instead of 911. My aunts said no she’s an adult if she doesn’t want to use it she doesn’t have to even though her physical therapist said she needed to use it for the rest of her life. Not something uncommon for her age. So of course again she falls after her hip healed only to break her ankle and shoulder which meant an even longer heal time in a home. A home that she thrived in because she is a very social person and everyone knows her in this little town. 

Months of healing and she just recently got back home for about a month and some time. My grandpa unfortunately passed this Monday. My grandmother once again, despite having life alert on her wrist, called the neighbors instead of the police or life alert. Something we feel is very characteristic of someone with dementia.  And now my aunts are wanting to let my grandmother live alone in this house with too many stairs. The same house she’s fallen in and broken her chemo frail bones. They did talk about taking her to a nursing home 2 hours away from there but we are protesting it because we feel she needs to be at the same one she was at before in the town of people she knows. 

On top of that, after all the positions my sibling and I were forced into to take care of our grandparents as if we were our mother, they’re telling us that they don’t want us to be part of the splitting of things because they want it to be just between the sisters. My grandparents made it clear that what was our mother’s will go to us. Not that I care about any material things, but I do feel that my youngest aunt isn’t trustworthy. They’re a greedy family and I fear they will take advantage of my grandma in some despicable way. 

I don’t know if I should speak up and tell them I do have a right to be there. I’ve already been there doing more work for my grandparents than the whole family of my youngest aunt and my eldest aunt doesn’t even deserve to have to deal with my grandma because of how she was treated. She does help, but again I feel like that dynamic was rudely altered when myself and my sibling were made to become the absent sibling to them after our mother died. I want what is right for my grandmother and her health and whatever life she has left on this earth to be good. Not abused or used behind her back. Neglected or put into a home where she knows no one and I know she won’t be visited often by her own kid even less by her shitty grandkids that have never thought to care about their family. 

How do I even prevent them from abusing my grandma’s health state by stealing from her? By shoving her into an elder facility she won’t thrive in? To even prove to them of her dementia? I don’t care about repairing any relationship with them. I feel that is long since past due to the fact that they refuse to handle confrontation. They run and cry and blame everyone else. I need help. 

I cut so much out of this but it’s already so long. I will answer questions too. 


TL;DR: after a lot of death in the family and years of a bum aunt/cousins/uncle not doing anything to help our ailing grandparent(s) things are coming to a head. Dementia, nursing homes, abuse of elders? How do I handle this situation?",16Feb2020,1

138,"for background we are freshman in college and spend just about everyday together with our friend group. my friend had sex with the guy that was my first actual kiss. she knew it made me upset and she started crying and apologized to me and i got over because i understand people make mistakes. then i introduced her to one of my friends from high school (i lowkey had a crush on him but nothing serious) and they started hooking up and i didn’t really care because it wasn’t a big deal. then me and my friend started to get really close to our current friend group. i had a crush on one of the guys for the first semester and i had told my friend that i did. he had broken up with his long term girlfriend at the beginning over the summer and wasn’t over her. his ex was good friends with my best friend, and my best friend constantly told me what a horrible boyfriend he was. so i decided it would be best for me to just ignore the feelings. in my friend’s defense, i didn’t make my feelings super clear to her because i don’t like to talk about my feelings. dealing with my emotions has recently been even harder for me because a month into college i found out my mom had terminal brain cancer and i live 6 hours away and barely see her. obviously, this really affects me emotionally. i’ve never used it as an excuse to get out of anything and i’ve told very few people. my friend always tells me that i should use it and that i’m too nice to people. before we left for winter break she made out with the guy i had a crush on. i was kinda mad and talked to her about it. she apologized and promised me that she wouldnt do it again because she didn’t want to upset me. so this is the second time she’s apologized and told me that she would change. i forgave her, again. we got back for second semester and now her and the guy are sneaking around and being secretive and leaving me out/ignoring me. i make it obvious that i don’t like it. he then starts brainwashing her about me, telling her that i’m a bad friend and all this shit. i know because his roommate hears it all and tells me. (the roommate is also in the friend group) they decide to break things off because no one in the friend group likes it because they exclude the rest of us and makes uncomfortable, like if we are all hanging out they’ll just get in his bed together while the rest of us sit on the floor. then, shocker, they start their thing up again. i felt really betrayed by her for like the fifth time. when i try to confront people, i get emotional and forget to say everything i want to say, so i wrote over a page letter and gave it to her then let her respond. then she tells me all this stuff about how she didn’t mean to hurt me, but he was never mine and tells me to get over it. so i’m like i got over my feelings for him and now i have to get over being upset? and i ask her why she doesn’t have to sacrifice/give up anything and she tells me that she doesn’t know and that she isn’t going to let him go. i should also add that he is extremely mean to both us, which is why i don’t want to be with him anymore. (he says random things like insulting the way i look and is just childish). me and my friend have talked about how mean he is multiple times. so i try to get over it and then they go out on valentine’s day. (after she told me and our other friend that we were going to have like a singles wine night). her and the guy get back from their date. i was with our other friends and start sobbing saying that i think my best friend isn’t who i thought she was. our friends make us talk again because i wanted to finally tell her straight up how i feel. i’m very blunt and our friends back me up saying that she should be there for me considering my situation. she agrees that she is selfish and she’s blind when it comes to guys and all that stuff. but she says that’s just the way she is and she doesn’t want to change. she tells me that she’s going to start being there for me and everything. i ask her why should i believe her this time and she says because she sees how upset i am. but she’s never changed in the past. she hung out with him again today. i don’t understand how she could keep seeing him knowing how upset it makes me. if this was literally anyone else, i would’ve cut them out of my life. i don’t have the emotional ability to keep someone in my life who makes me feel this way. one part of me thinks i should try to fix because she’s my best friend. but she’s not who i thought she was. i don’t want to be friends with this person, i want to be best friends with who i thought she was. on the other hand, when people show you who they are, you should believe them. thanks for any advice.",16Feb2020,1

148,"As the title says, I am a minor looking to live independently from my parents, who have been abusive and manipulative for most of my life. For privacy reasons, I am using a secondary account to post this.

Background Info:

- I am 15 (FtM) and living in New York state. I go to high school and work the maximum hours I can at a local grocery store. My monthly income is $745, plus side jobs that can generate anywhere from $200-350. This will go up as my maximum hours increases when I turn 16.
- My home life is awful. The only thing keeping my parents' marriage together is their radical religious beliefs. I do not share these beliefs, as most of them are racist, sexist, and anti-LGBT+. There have been multiple times where I have been screamed at and beaten for voicing my disagreements. But because they have never left a mark and they have a good reputation in our community, I can't do a thing about it. My older siblings have tried getting the police involved when they went through the same ordeals, but they were called ""rebellious, lying teens"" and completely abandoned by the legal system. As of late, my parents have been becoming increasingly more violent and I would rather escape now then wait for something truly horrible to go down. 

The Factors to Consider:

- I have been planning to move out for a few months now, but my plan is far from secure, which is why I really need advice. I have eyes on a room for rent in a nearby city that is within my price range, near a local high school, and within walking distance from workplaces that pay similar wages and shops where  I can get necessities. However, it is in a different school district from my current one, and some of the classes I am taking are not offered there. In addition, I would be paying for a room in a three bedroom apartment, and I am unsure of who I would be living with. There is the risk that the living arrangement might not work out, or cause even more problems.
- I have also been considering the strain my emancipation would put on my other relationships. I don't want to push away my entire family. I love my older sister and brothers, and my other relatives are okay. My only problem is with my parents. I don't want the rest of my family thinking I am abandoning them. I also have a few close friends in my school who know about my home situation, but I don't want to move away and lose the bond that we have built. 
- The final problem I have is how my parents will react when I break the news. They can either be completely indifferent or more violent than they have ever been. And if things go off the rails, I could be putting myself in serious danger, as well as the younger of my two brothers, who still lives at home.

154,"I don't know how to make the first move on a girl. In any other setting, I'm completely fine. But something about talking to girls at parties really throws me off. I think it's because of hookup culture that forces an interaction in one of two ways: you either hook up with the girl or she leaves you. Mind you, I have plenty of experience with girls. It's just that every relationship or hook up I've had, the girl has started it.

Anyways, I went to a party with two of my friends and one of the friends found a girl from high school that he knew. Next thing you know, he's introducing me and the other friend. Immediately, I thought this girl was so cute. Pretty sure she thought the same of me because she only talks to me in front of the other two guys. We made some good conversation despite the loud music and other people around us and out of nowhere, I mustered up the courage to ask her to dance with me. She said yes.

She holds my hand and takes me to where all the other people were dancing. Of course, the DJ played Spanish music(Bailando, Despacito, you know the works). She starts grinding on me and we feel that connection. After a couple of songs, she turns around and pulls me by the shirt to a corner where we start making out. It was magical.

Fast forward a couple of days, we got each other's snaps and texted for a bit but the convo went dry. Also, come to find out, she told the mutual friend from the party that she really enjoyed it but it was a one-time thing. Broke my heart, because you see, I fell for this girl.

Forget everything we had in common, this girl brought out a different side of me, a more confident side per se. Everyone that knows this girl says me and her would be perfect for each other. She's everything I look for in a dream girl and know I can be everything she wants in a guy.

I want to ask her out on a date. I would love to be in a relationship with her and bring her home to my family because I know they would definitely approve of her. I also know her parents would love me if she brought me home to meet her family. But if she doesn't want a relationship, I'm perfectly fine with that. Anything to talk to her.

PLEASE help me find a way to ask her out on a date without coming off as desperate. If I get rejected, it would be the end of me. Days go by and I wake up each morning scared to see her with another guy. I never felt this way about a girl and am scared I might not find someone as compatible as me and her.",16Feb2020,1
155,"About a year ago I got a large tattoo on my forearm extremely impulsively, without thinking about it much beforehand. It's a reference to a quote that means a lot to me, ""with a golden heart comes a rebel fist"". Shortly after getting it I realized that it looks like a black power fist surrounded by a caucasian heart (I'm white). I know that everyone who looks at it thinks the same thing, and I'm asked about it all the time. It makes me feel so stupid.. And it has even, on occasion, negatively influenced my interactions with people of color. Luckily I live in a place with cold winters, so I've been keeping it covered at school and work, but I know that soon it'll be warm out again and that I'll have to bear my shame. 

I haven't decided if I'm going to try and attempt to cover it up with more ink or undergo removal treatment, but whichever one I choose will definitely be a financial strain and I'm not sure which one to commit to.

158,"(Semi-long read!) First off, this is my first post here. I don’t use reddit often, so I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong! Anyway, into the problem.

I’m frustratingly hot and cold with my (closer) friends. There’s been a certain point in a lot of my closest friendships where I become so used to them that I just get... bored. It’s never a permanent feeling, thankfully, but I think it’s a symptom of a larger problem.

Usually when I experience being “bored” with my best friends (one in particular), it’s accompanied by other things. Exhaustion, reclusiveness, irritability towards people in general. I try not to act disrespectful during these “moods”, so I go into a sort of emotional hibernation state. I avoid eye contact and don’t talk much (if at all). Not that impactful to my daily life, but still a tad annoying when everyone else is in a good mood.

I have one very close friend that’s high energy, physically affectionate, and very social. They require a lot of attention, which is fine because we adore each other—I’m flexible when I’m not reclusive and I’m able to match their energy—but when I’m in a mood, it can get incredibly draining. We attend the same school, so I’m with them a lot. They’re sensitive to my changes in mood, so when they feel my withdrawal they tend to get a little upset. Not at me, really, just sad that I’m not giving them as much attention. I hate seeing her upset about it, but I just don’t have the energy to do anything about it.

This emotional swing is internally jarring for me. One week I’m absolutely enamored with my friends, not even exaggerating. So much overwhelming love and care and adoration for them! But then the next week I’m so exhausted and I can’t even look them in the eye... their presence looming behind me makes me irritable. I still love them, but I just can’t shake the irritation... if I had to describe it, it’s like an itch deep in my organs that I can’t quite seem to scratch.

Is there something off with me? Am I just a crappy person for acting like this, or is this a normal thing for friendships to go through? Sorry for the long read, I’m just tired of putting other people through this.",16Feb2020,1

160,"I'm in love with dreaming. It used to be the best part of waking up for me, remembering what life I lived that night, what adventure I went on. My dreams used to be so vivid, the people in it always felt so real to me. I've kept a dream journal since the age of 12 because I want to remember each and every dream I've ever had. Along with vivid dreaming, I also used to experienced lucid dreaming and the occasional nights of sleep paralysis. 

The thing is, I've slowly lost my ability to remember my dreams. I wake up and I can tell that I've dreamt, I feel that something went on inside my head, but I can NEVER remember it anymore. During the day I get fleeting moments of deja vu, and between being asleep and fully awake I can remember vague scenes from my dream, but I can never recall the full dreams anymore. Since mid last year I was writing less and less in my journal, and now I haven't written anything in about 2 months. I miss it, and this is where I ask for advice. Has anyone had this same issue? Did anyone manage to fix it? Dreaming is a large part of my life, and I really need it back. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank-you for your time.",16Feb2020,1

I'm a pretty jealous person in general but one situation I'm struggling with at the moment is that whenever I go out with my friend and meet a guy that I'm interested in, they are always more into her. She has a boyfriend and I am single and often when they discover that, they'll suddenly be interested in me but I don't want to be second best.

164,"So I’ve been friends with these four people for about a couple years now. We were all super close at the beginning of last summer, but drifted apart earlier this school year. We’ve now gotten back together, and have hung out every weekend for the last 5 weeks. I really like them, and I think they all like me too.

Tonight, I was hanging out with one of my other friends, we’ll call her Grace*. As I was driving grace home, I saw what looked like my friends car parked outside of the house where my little group of friends often hangs out at. I couldn’t tell for sure because it was dark, but it’s a very distinct car.After I dropped grace off, I went to go check if it was really his car. It was. All my friends’ cars were outside the house. I know I shouldn’t have checked (don’t ask questions you don’t want answers to). I texted one of my friends who was at the house if we could hang out and they said nothing. 

So I decided that I would ask one of them what’s going on. I get the sense that this isn’t the first time they’ve been together without me, but I don’t know for sure. I’m going on a walk with one of my friends tomorrow and I want to confront her about it (not in an aggressive way).

For context, I’ve been really happy with these friends for the last month, and I’m so excited that I seem to have finally found a group of friends that I like a lot. While I’m super social and I have many friends, I’ve struggled to join a group of friends, which is something I’ve always wanted. While it’s ok to not be in a group, having done that for several years, I don’t want to go back to that. I’ve been ignoring my suspicions that they’ve been hanging out without me for a long time because I didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship. I really do feel like we all have a strong connection ( I frequently hang out with members of the group individually, invites go both ways).

So my question is this: should I confront them about this and potentially make things awkward of mess up what I have with them? Or, should I ignore it and continue living in a state of limbo where I’m not really sure where I stand?

Thank you so much for your help!",16Feb2020,1

169,This is to explain myself and inner thoughts. I turn to reddit because nobody seems to get it but I know someone on here will. I have a group of friends that are right like family. I don’t know what it is but something seems missing from the relationship. I always feels I have to do more to keep them as friends. To note I did have a time in my life where I was depressed. I’m currently 18 years old and we will all be going to school together. This group is of 9/10 people while I’m super close with 2 or 3. This group is of guys and girls. These people is all I got they helped through depression and tough times. I lost my best friend to cancer a few years back when I was 16 and losing a great uncle due to cancer soon. It hurts me to type that but it’s the truth. I don’t know what’s missing whenever I open up to them it’s not that they don’t care the problem so they don’t understand me due to the complexity of my mind. I feel like my own ignorance has pushed people back that have wanted to help. I always want to help everyone but people tell me I extend myself too far to people outside of the group. To those who don’t care much about me. I’m unsure of what to do. I am not sure what is missing but this is almost how I feel. I feel the energy I give off is not being given back nor received. I just don’t know what to do anymore.,16Feb2020,1
170,"I’ve been living in my head thinking about what went wrong with this woman I’ve fallen for. Apologies for the long post, but I wanted to release my thoughts and hear some perspectives from the community here.

We first met back in summer 2018, connected briefly, then went back to our respective countries which are on opposite sides of the world. We stayed in touch at times, texted here and there. In Christmas 2018, I asked her out for dinner as I travelled to her country for vacation. It was at that point that I started liking her. However, of course the distance amongst us made it impossible for us to meet each other again.

Again, throughout 2019, we still texted sporadically, and it intensified during the second half of the year, in which we would text almost every day and have occasional scheduled calls. While we still lived far away, I felt there was a connection between us and the conversations have always been… natural, raw and personal. As we grew closer, I picked up the courage to do things that I hoped would show how much I cared for her, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she seemed to love. I’ve always been wearing my heart on my sleeve to show my affection towards her - although I never said “I like you”. And it was clear that we really liked speaking with each other too.

After almost half a year of texting and calling, we met again in Christmas 2019 as I travelled to her place. At this point, I started to really like her but was unsure of what would happen with the distance - and the fact that there’s no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next 1-2 years. We went out four times and I had the best time - personal and genuine conversations, romantic dinners, etc. I did what I thought would show her I cared for her - flowers, gifts with handwritten notes, picked up the tabs and thoroughly planned the dates to her liking. By this point, it was clear that both of us really enjoyed each other’s company. She seemed to love the times we had together and was receptive of my advances.

While I really liked her, I was still hesitant to tell her outright I liked her, as I was still hoping there would come a day in which we’ll live in the same city together, and I’d stand a better chance then. Sounds cliche, but I liked her that much that I was willing to wait for that day.

Anyway, after returning home, we still texted. I did a couple more things to keep keep the “sparks”, e.g. sending flowers to her office, which she seemed to love! 

However, a few weeks ago, things started to turn different. We were supposed to schedule a call but her schedules had turned busy with work and other commitments, so we’ve had to postpone. I wanted to speak with her again so I did follow up on her schedule. I didn’t have any reason to believe that she didn’t want to speak with me - everything was going well just before that. Nevertheless, she started going distant and didn’t respond to the texts. I didn’t hear back for a couple of weeks, couldn’t call her, reached out to her via email and finally managed to hear back. She said she’s been hectic so wasn’t able to communicate via texts anymore. I was surprised so decided to tell her outright how I felt and asked if she still wanted me to be in touch. She then said she just wanted to be friends. However, it was clear from the past weeks that she’s grown distant - even as a friend - which was unlike what has been happening for the last six months or so. 

I’ve been trying to decipher what exactly went wrong and if I’ve done anything wrong. Was it because I double-texted at times? Was it because I followed up on our call during her busy schedule? Did I seem to be a bother amidst her schedule? Was I too expressive in the texts? 

I’m not hoping but I’ve been thinking whether I’ve done anything that ruined the chances I’ve had with this woman.

Tl;dr I've been speaking with a woman long-distance, went out a couple of times last year and texted intensively over the last six months, with romantic gestures, e.g. flowers, birthday present, deliveries. In the last few weeks, she started becoming distant. Didn't hear back for weeks, upfront about my feeling and she said she just wanted to be friends. Wondering if I did anything wrong that caused her to ""vanish"".",16Feb2020,1
171,"So this might be a long one and I'm sorry for any grammatical errors, but I really need to vent and any help would be welcome. Anyways, I've been feeling really bad about myself lately. I (M 14) have a really big crush on this one girl in my grade (let's call her A). Three days ago A and my friend (M 14, let's call him T) were emailing eachother and A found out that T liked one of her friends. She also asked why I was talking to her suddenly and I figured that there was a slight chance she might like me and I didn't want to lie to her. So, I had T tell her how I felt. She rejected me, which was what I had expected to happen, but T asked her to give me a chance. I've apologized to her because I feel like I might have made her uncomfortable. What made it even worse was that about an hour earlier T paid for me to get her a flower for Valentine's Day and I was unaware that she was/is currently already in a relationship. T asked her to give me a chance and she said she might if her current relationship doesn't work out. Lately, even before she found out I liked her, I've felt horrible. On at least two occasions before I was rejected, she had been really upset (to the point of crying) and I really wanted to comfort her. The first time I was too nervous and I did nothing and the second time I talked to her and asked her if she was ok, but she pushed me away. I get so nervous around her and my friends are usually talking to me even when/if I told them that I need space or have something to do (there's one specific kid that does this incessantly). I wish I could talk her, but I can't for some odd reason. I talk decently with other girls that I'm interested in, so I don't know why I can't talk to her. Also, I'm pretty sure that a girl is flirting with T. T enjoys it and he'll probably have a girlfriend. I'm proud for him, but I'm admittedly quite jealous. Also, I feel horrible for admitting this, but I kinda hope that it doesn't work for A because I want to see if she'd give me an actual chance. If she did give me a chance then I would do almost anything to keep her happy. I feel so selfish and like I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm being too overprotective. T says it's her loss if she doesn't give me a chance, but honestly I wouldn't date me if I were her. I've never loved anyone as much as I love her and as a result I've never felt worse about myself. Am I taken this too seriously/being weird/overprotective? Also if you have any advice on how to calm my nerves around her then that would be great. Even after she found out how I felt around her I still have a lot of trouble talking to her. I need help.

I have already auditioned and have just finished my call back audition. The issue here is that my mum is on a plane and wont be back until half way through March. My dad stated before that since this is my final year at school I should focus on my studies which I agreed with and I said that I can manage to do both. I gave him my points as to why I should do it and he said that he already decided that I'm not doing it. So it didn't matter what I said. He said that if I go do this play then I'll be an outlier like my brothers (who defied him in their own ways) and that he'd be disappointed in me of I do it anyways.

My dad wasn't going to pay for it my mum is so he doesn't have a say tbh. I'm not financially dependent on him so I'm not worries about that but it's the fact that he's the only parent home that is my concern. He's changed his mind on what the outcome will be if I do it many times, saying things like ""I wont allow you to do it so you can focus on your studies"" to ""If you do this you'll be an outlier to me"". He's decided to distance himself from me not the other way around. He's really trying to force me not to do this instead of being an 'outlier' as he likes to put it.

Extra info.... I’m not talking an every day thing. It has happened 6-7 times within a years time. Sometimes when arguing he gets to a point where it seems like it’s not him anymore. He gets so angry. Most times though when arguing he just shuts down or walks away. I know he feels horrible after because he will cry or not leave my side saying how sorry he is and he knows it is wrong. I know he loves me and I love him, but I broke up with him after the last time.

193,"I am programming in Python 3 for almost 1.5 years now and quite good with it. But I've read many articles that Python is slow and is not appreciated to be used in competitive problem-solving. And most of the companies do not appreciate python to be used while explaining stuff to them.

I know a bit of Java which I learned like 1 year ago and some of C++ from my high school. I mentioned these two languages because I've heard these could be used for this purpose from many people. So, which programming language would you suggest me to learn. \[ You can also suggest other languages than C++ and Java \]",16Feb2020,1
194," Earlier today I was at a social event. My friends went off into separate groups and I was left all alone. I started feeling really panicky so I hid in the bathroom, where I started crying. At one point I tried to dig my nails into my wrist, which left red marks. Anyways, I stayed in the bathroom for an hour and a half until it was over. I got home and was fine for a few hours. I was thinking about how nobody really cared that I was gone, and then I started thinking about writing out this post.
 One thing led to another and I started thinking about how much of an attention whore I am, about how selfish I am for wanting people to acknowledge that I was crying. Even though I know it's natural to want people to care about me, I still feel selfish, like my problems are irrelevant and I shouldn't have any because I'm supposed to help other people with their problems. At some point I realized I was making an entire scenario detailing this post in my head, and I just wanted to stop thinking. I started crying and hitting my head, all the while yelling to stop thinking.
 Anywho, I started thrashing around and it got really hard to breathe. I started hyperventilating, and then I stopped moving. I think I'm done now, but I still have the urge to cry. I still feel like such an attention whore for writing this. I'm pretty shaken up from the whole ordeal, and I have no idea what to make of the situation. I'm not even sure I know what type of advice I'm looking for. I guess I should probably mention I'm a highschooler. I'm awfully sorry if this post is a mess, I write as I think and oftentimes it makes no sense. If anything needs clarifying I'll be happy to do it.
 Also I was just reading the rules for this sub, and I saw the stuff about sexual assualt/rape posts, and I want to ask something. When I was around five or six, and my older cousin was eight or nine, him, his friend, and I used to do sexual things together. I know we were all little kids, but it makes me feel so gross now. It also happened many times, although my memory is hazy. I remember when I was eleven (?) him grabbing me and holding me down, and earlier that night he had asked me if I knew what masturbation was. He didn't do anything, just held me, but still, it makes me feel gross.
 Once again, I'm very sorry that this post is such a jumbled mess of shit.",16Feb2020,1

She went to the store today, and couldn’t find a lot of things I needed. So I decided that these cards will be kind of useless to me. Recently I gave her my old iPad because I gave her a new one, and on top of that, I told her she could have 100 dollars of the gift card money. I just asked her if she wanted to buy the rest of the cards, and she thinks it’s unfair she has to pay full price. I don’t know what to do. I think it’s fair she pay the rest of the money since I gave her $100 from it already. The thing is, if she got the money I know she wouldn’t have shared with me. 

TLDR; money I got from my roommates Chinese event, and I can’t really use the cards. I gave her $100 dollars from it already, and want to sell her the rest- she doesn’t want to take it, because I’m making her pay full price.",16Feb2020,1
199,"hey! so to make a long story short, i have this friend. they were my best friend for 3 years. we stopped being friends about a year ago because a situation happened in which i felt the only option was ending the friendship. i’m not going to get into it but i’m gonna say it was about her betraying my trust and drugs. 

a 2-3 months ago, they reached out to me and apologized. this friendship ending really broke my heart so i was happy to hear from them, and let them back into my life. during that year we were not friends, they fell deep into drug use and is now using speed 24/7. i hung out with them a few times and it honestly makes me sad and kind of uncomfortable to see how drastically they have changed, to see the paranoia and the detachment in their eyes, to hear them ramble on about things that are barely making sense. not at all the person i was best friends with for 3 years. 

last month, they asked me to borrow $20 to buy 2 packs of cigarettes because they didn’t have. and so i lent them the money and went with them to get the cigarettes. i only found out afterwards that they weren’t even for them, they were for a friend of theirs whom they’d smoked all their cigs and now had to repay them. they told me they would give it back to me “literally tomorrow” and although part of me knew this would not be the case i still did it. 

i don’t really care about the money, it’s not like i’m upset about losing $20. i’m upset because after that they did not text me for one month, until today where they left me a message on instagram asking “hey are you up?” at 3 AM. now i am a very non confrontational person and don’t want to argue, but don’t quite know what to say to them either. 

i don’t really want to continue the friendship. honestly they have changed so much that i don’t feel comfortable with them anymore. but i also feel guilty that they did used to be my best friend and that i should try to help them get better and get off this shit? i know you cannot help anyone who doesn’t want to be helped but part of me feels like i should try anyways, although i am going through my own personal problems right now and don’t have the capacity to try to keep up with this person now, let alone try to help them get out of a dark place. 

how should i respond to them? do i even respond to the message? i don’t want to tell them “dude you have completely changed and you need help” out of fear of starting an argument/making them upset but at the same time i feel like it’s the least i should say.",16Feb2020,1
200,"I'm someone who generally has a handful of close friends but spends a lot of time alone. I've had romantic relationships but I'm not someone who really needs to be dating someone all the time. I spend a lot of time alone but I like it. I write, I work, I do stuff. I'm not a happy person because I have some mental/behavioral shit I deal with but I'm generally alright. I'm comfortable. I got a handle on things. My friends are incredible and I'm very lucky. I'm okay. 

A few months ago I briefly dated somebody that I just clicked with, and I am not a person who clicks with people. It was great. I felt welcomed. Understood. At home. It ended, and it sucks. I've never really liked dating but I did in hopes something would come together and it did, then it ended. That's not the important part. The reasons it ended makes sense and I've come to terms with that, but shit I miss her. Anyway, I'm trying to date again, armed with the knowledge that there are people out there who click with people like me. I've never liked dating. I hate it, but I do it. Anyway, I went on my first first date in months and it was fine. Fine. She's great, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing there. That was a mutual feeling, I'm sure. We probably won't go out again and I'm sure we're both fine with that. It was a nice time. I'm home now and just keep thinking about that one person. Not so much longing or wanting, but just missing the feeling of belonging. And how dating just feels like the wrong way to get there. Everything is just...fine. Bland. Hollow. Inconsequential. I fucking hate dating, but I want to feel that connection with someone again but I don't know how to get there without dating, which I fucking hate. 

I guess I'm looking for advice, but not really. Just not sure who to share these thoughts with. My friends, I'm sure, are sick of hearing it. 

I miss her. So much. I know I'm fine on my own, I always have been, but I want that feeling again, but I hate what I have to go through to maybe find it.

What's your experience been like? Everything I read about dating forces itself to be positive. I want some real talk. Real insight. What shit have you been through?

I have a hard time commiting to pretty much anything that isn't a necessity. He's been told this on multiple occasions. I'm getting help with my problems. I've told him that it's probably not in his best interest at the moment to make an investment in me that I'm really not in a good mental state for him to be expecting me to put fourth the same amount of investment in to him. I told him that I'm not going to change over night just because he wants to commit to me.

212,"Student here.

I want to preface this by saying I respect all people's entitlement to an opinion(whether or not I like it), and I don't want that freedom limited just because I disagree with someone's opinion.

I go to a private school, with a predominately white student body, and I have had no problems with racism, lgbt-phobia or classism until now. 

My friend group is pretty open to political discussion, to all sides. We all love discussing our opinions, but our only(albeit unspoken) rule is to keep from being derogatory to anyone/any group of people.

There us someone who is a bit forceful with his opinions, and is often very derogatory in his claims, and it makes everyone uncomfortable. The line was crossed(for me) when he made numerous derogatory comments about black people.

Because of this, I want to go to a school admin to talk about what he's been saying, and I have proof/witnesses/etc. to show that this isn't an isolated incident, but I don't want it all to be negated by him just claiming freedom of expression.

I'm not too educated on laws surrounding hate speech or anything like that, but I'm fairly sure that in an academic environment, making derogatory comments is grounds for some type of disciplinary action to take place.

Should I actually tell an admin? Or will it just be a waste of time? If it will be a waste, what should I do?

Thanks everyone.",16Feb2020,1

217,"I just needed to vent and get some advice on a situation that is breaking my heart. My dad moved to NC from Florida a year ago (to live with his brother while divorcing my mom) and he passed away Tuesday morning. I was his only child, and he was my stepdad (but raised me since I was 2).

I wasn't there in his final year. I couldn't afford to visit and kept saying I would in the spring after we got our tax return. He was diagnosed with vascular dementia over the summer, but they thought it would progress slowly. It didn't. He quickly had to be moved into an assisted living facility, which he hated, and he couldn't remember people or what things were (like how to use a fork). He couldn't figure out how to use his phone. So I barely ever got to speak with him.

And I didn't get to say goodbye.

He was the best dad in the world. He served in the Navy as a commander for 30 years, and then ran the department of communications for a large city in VA for another 15. He worked his butt off, but always had time to play basketball or catch or softball when he got home. We played scrabble late into the night, he always let me win at Mario Kart, and he would always be Barbie (voice and all) when we played with dolls. He helped me with trigonometry when I started to fall behind, and he was there for me through all the heart breaks and everything else. He was my dad. He was my best friend. He was my hero.

The entire trip to the funeral is around 850 (car rental, gas, food, hotel fees, boarding the dog, cheap clothes for the funeral, etc). I sold my Nintendo Switch Lite with all its games and I sold my iPad (which was an older model, so I didn't get much). I'm around 180 short. I'd have to leave by like 4am Tuesday morning.

Other than my wife, I have no support system. My family (other than my dad) disowned me when I married a woman (I'm female, too), so no one is willing to help me get there.

I am so depressed. What do I do to process this, to handle possibly not being able to go? I know I can say goodbye anywhere and that it's the memories that matter, but he specifically asked that I do the eulogy. He wanted me there. And I feel like I'm failing him. I'd appreciate any advice you could possibly give me on how to handle this overwhelming, crushing depression. I haven't slept in 3 nights and I've spent more of my time crying than not.

218,"Update: they started fighting again really badly while I was at work, my bf said it was really bad, worse than other times, and that he heard screaming at the top of his lungs by the husband (caught on video) and clear sounds of an altercation. He texted me and I urged him to call the cops and he did. The cops arrived and searched the apartment (we believe) and spoke to the wife outside alone. She then came to our apartment as they knew it was my bf who called. The cop told my bf that we ""should realize"" that we live in a basement apartment so we are going to hear noises like running (??? We did not hear/complain about running) and that it was our upstair neighbors culture to ""talk loud"" (ok, just no). We didn't call the cops to make a noise complaint (they are very loud during the day doing normal stuff and we just ignore it because it's not a big deal) or because we were annoyed, we called because we had clear reason to be concerned about our neighbors wellbeing. My boyfriend isn't really out spoken so he tried to explain this to the cop but she cut him off and told him ""next time go through your landlord""... what now? I know they are going to continue to fight and have altercations but clearly the cops don't care. Do I just ignore it now?

Original post: 
I live in a basement apartment of a 2 unit house/apartment thing. Almost daily, at least multiple times a week, I can hear my upstairs neighbors screaming at each other and it sounds like things are being thrown/doors slammed/other loud concerning noises. It sounds like mostly the husband is yelling/yelling most aggressively and the wife sounds like she's crying from what I can hear from her responses. I also feel like their adult son gets involved sometimes. When they argue, they do not speak English so I cannot understand what is being said. What should I do? Should I call the cops? I'm nervous about retaliation or other issues because I am their only neighbor so I think it would be obvious that it came from me. Not sure what to do in this situation, I am annoyed by the constant disturbance but also concerned for the safety of my neighbor. Also, I have never met any of them or had any contact with them.

Told my mum, she’s okay with it sort of but stepdad is furious. He was slamming doors and plates around, and is now ignoring me. And apparently because of this, my mum told me I ruined the weekend. They’re mad because I went behind their ‘backs’ and made the decision. I’m 20 years old.

With my mental health this is like the first time I have actually been able to find someone that i can connect to.  is really nice to me in every single aspect but every time I bring up going to her place to study specifically because she has white board there or to do yoga because she has a room for it she has a reason she doesn’t want me come over. She sounds genuine about her reasons but I’m a really emotional person and I feel hurt as if there is something I will just never know about her because she doesn’t invite me over. I just don’t understand why I’m not worth being close to anyone. Am I just a horrible person guys?

230,"I, (22M),  have a younger brother in his early teens. He came to me this weekend saying that he was sad and crying because he didn't have a Valentine and how many people had them. I felt like this was the moment to bond with him more by giving dating advice. Unfortunately, I couldn't because I don't have experience, and gave a crappy response like ""Oh, it doesn't matter.""

We don't have the best of relationships. It's complicated. He seems to look up to me but I tend shut myself from everyone, including family, because of similar reasons. I don't really show him much love but I don't want to see him sad. What can I say to make him feel less bad about himself?

My draft advice is as follows: ""Don't worry about getting a Valentine or girlfriend. Your special one will come to you when the time is right. Right now, it's best to distract yourself from this and move on.""",16Feb2020,1
232,"Earlier today, I got stuck chasing down a neighbor’s dog that got loose. I was wearing Vans, and since I wasn’t expecting to haul ass around a golf course, I had no socks on. I ended up taking the shoes off while walking the dog home, so I also tracked the blister through dirt. When I got home, I saw the dirty, dime-sized blister on the back of my heel. I ended up cutting the extra skin off because it was COVERED in dirt. The skin was BLACK. I didn’t cut it completely because of how bad it hurt, but the small piece of leftover skin is clean. I washed it off immediately, dried it, and then washed it again because I had to take a shower. There’s still some dirt stuck on the exposed skin because it wouldn’t come off no matter what. I put some antibiotic ointment on it and sealed it with a transparent dressing (bad idea because it creates no sensory barrier, but I’m more concerned about keeping it from being infected). I wrapped some bandage around my heel a moment ago, and it kinda helps. I also popped 2 ibuprofen, although it’s not doing much. The pain is really annoying because it makes my leg twitch on reflex when I feel it. I’ve been trying not to walk a lot because any pressure on the bottom of my heel goes straight to the blister and right up my leg. 

Anybody have any tips on taking care of the blister/pain management/helping it heal quickly?",16Feb2020,1
234,"So lately things have been very south in terms of mental state for me. But first a bit of background. Around 7 months ago I moved away to a different state and left my friends behind. I considered a couple my best friends and seeing them together without me now wrecks me. And over this weekend they are at a convention together and I’ve seen that 4 of my other friends went, too. I hate seeing all of this and not being able to go and have fun. All I want to do is to go back where I used to live. I hate where I am now and would gladly leave it behind if I could get a chance to live by my friends again. Just looking at their stories makes me break down sometimes (such as now). I’ve secluded myself even more than I already do thanks to that and I’m not feeling great. Is there any way to properly cope and possibly move on? Thanks.",16Feb2020,1

I like the server but due to my problem with the DM, which is the problem is me asking Ideas with the Ex-member.  I did this because I got ignored, and my idea from DM's view is railroading and half-baked. I already asked forgiveness from the DM, but no matter what I do seems useless. Even during the session, the DM hates me. the way NPC talks and his direction when doing the session made me confused and He doesn't care that much what I did in the session to direct the session, like changing the topic when talking to NPC. I did ask him what I should do in the DnD and how we could fix the current relationship but those things resulted in nothing. He ignores me again. I'm already given up on him. Even the guy who I asked about Ideas suggesting the same. He hates DM behavior.

236," We've been friends for 10+ years. We both started in EMS at the same time. We went to the same class together but afterwards went in different directions. I went with a 911 response job with a high call volume job and she went with an event medical job (basically she just stands-by at sporting events, expos, etc). Now while we both started at the same time, admittedly I got more experience. I also went to get my fire fighter certification.
 Now, an opportunity for a job with a big city has present itself, which has been my dream job since we started and we both want it. While it is possible for us both to get a position, she has some up's on me. Both her parents worked for the city in the same field. She is better at articulating a resume then me, she is very good with words. She'll have more preferable references than me. I don't have or cant do any of this. I spent 2 days on my resume.
 What is making me mad, is the idea of her getting the job and I don't. She already plans on quitting after 5 years because she is married and they want to run off into the woods to start a family/homestead. She just wants to be a stay at home wife, this is just her way to make the money for it. This is the job I've wanted for years, I didn't even look at the pay.
 What should I do if she gets it and I don't? Im going to be crushed if that happens. I wont know how to handle it.",16Feb2020,1
237,"Okay, I just really need to get this off my chest. I have a friend, let's call him Adam. His parents kicked him out at age 18, and now he's 24. In these past 6 years, Adam has just been couch-surfing with various friends, never really able to get anything substantial going for himself. He has had various jobs, but currently doesn't have one.

He usually has some reason why he loses these jobs (""Oh, I got the flu and couldn't go to work for a few days to my A.C. Moore job, so they fired me. Oh, the grocery store job I got changed the schedule without me knowing, so I didn't show up to work when I was scheduled and they fired me."") Some of these reasons sound legitimate enough and outside of his control. But still, he ALWAYS has some excuse.

He does have a driver's license, but no car currently. Again, there's always some excuse. (""I saved up enough to buy a shitty car, but then the next day my old roommate borrowed the car and totaled it."")

Adam has a history of depression, and has checked himself into various mental hospitals over the last few years for thoughts of suicide. He just got out of yet another one recently, and upon being released, felt that he could no longer live with the friend he had been living with for the last year or so. He claimed that that guy, let's call him Joel, was an asshole towards him in the last few months, never wanted to hang out with him, spent exorbitant amounts of time with his girlfriend (whom Adam hated), and refused to give him some amount of money that Adam felt Joel owed him.

I've known Adam since we were in elementary school together, and it makes me sad that his parents have seemingly turned their backs on him. He has shown me text messages where he has begged his parents to let him come live with them again, and they flat-out refuse and say he is no longer welcome at their home. I ask Adam why his parents would treat him this way, and he claims that, ""They're just assholes man, they've always been mean to me."" Adam is adopted, along with 4 other foster siblings of his that were all adopted by his parents. He claims that 2 of his other siblings receive similar treatment from his parents. I ask, if your parents are so evil and spiteful towards all of you kids, why did they adopt any of you in the first place? He says that he doesn't know and constantly wonders the same thing himself.

Anyway, after his most recent stay at Joel's and his hospital stay ended, Adam had nowhere else to go and was facing homelessness. He's my friend, and I felt that if I was in a position where I could help him get back on his feet, that I ought to. I'd hate to see him living on the streets, so I offered him to stay on my couch for a little while.

It's only been 6 days so far, but I'd really like him to leave. Adam is a heavy cigarette and pot smoker, neither of which I am. He does have the courtesy to go out on the porch to smoke his cigarettes, but the smell still lingers on him and is permeating throughout my living room. Additionally, I live with a roommate, Tom, and his toddler daughter who he has partial custody of on weekends. I consulted with Tom about the potentiality of Adam staying with us, and he was all for the idea, feeling similarly that we ought to help Adam stave off homelessness if we can. Tom, like I, was not super thrilled about the prospect of Adam staying with us, but felt that we'd be doing a good deed if we did.

Adam is also a vegan, which neither Tom or myself are, and Adam said upfront that he'd be buying his own food, which made me happy. But both Tom and I have noticed that Adam has been eating some of our food (granola bars, Goldfish, chocolate-covered popcorn), and some of that food was designated for Tom's daughter, which made him especially mad.

Tom and I would both be happy to see Adam leave at this point. Aside from the food eating and the smoking, it's just the fact of his general presence that aggravates me. Perhaps I should have fully considered this before I offered to let him stay with me, but it's just really starting to tick me off that every time I go into my living room, he's just.... there. Taking up space in my house. He says that he's applied to jobs online, but I really only see him laying on the couch watching (my) Netflix.

Also, his grandmother just died 2 days ago, which makes me feel bad for him, but doesn't really lessen my desire to see him leave. I can't really pinpoint any one, specific asshole-ish behavior or act that makes me want him gone. It's just his general depressed, lazy, stoner vibe that is permeating through my home. I feel bad that his parents kicked him out, but that was 6 years ago, and I feel like he should have been able to get his life in a better spot by now. It's not my fault that he can't manage his own life. His parents are assholes, his bosses were assholes, his roommates and their girlfriends are assholes, etc. Well maybe, it's him that's the asshole?",16Feb2020,1
239,"Hello,
I don't even know how to ask this so hopefully I can state it correctly or atleast coherently. Some background info, I'm a male, 25, I've been depressed for about 10 or 12 years, some worse than others (right now very bad), but it's a constant in my life. I also have motivation and attention issues. I finally have my own medical insurance and live on the other side of the state from my (controlling) parents. I have had doctors try and prescribe medicine to me before when I was younger, but my parents would never let me take it, so I never really considered it as a option. I'm at a point now where I'm failing classes, under preforming at work, and am genuinely unhappy. I know (have known for a long time) that something is wrong with my brain chemistry. So I guess I have two questions, one is where do I start to get help (please don't tell me to go to a therapist, I mean like which doctor do I go see and how do I find them) and secondly, how do I get prescriptions? Do I need to see a therapist before a psychiatrist? I've had therapists before, but they were conservative Christians who gave me scripture instead of medicine. I just want to know if there is somewhere I can go, tell them what's going on, and talk about options for change. Something needs to change. Anything and everything helps. Thanks in advance.

244,"So a bit of context;

My girlfriend and I met on a humanitarian trip my 11th grade in high school. We’ve been dating for about a year now and she decided she wanted to do the trip again. I had to stay back home because I play varsity basketball and this was my last chance to make it to the state championship. Now, on this trip they take your phones away so you connect more with your surroundings and the people your with. Which means we were out of contact for a week

When she got back all she talked about with me is how good the trip was and how she doesn’t really want to be home and wants to go back. ( which is understandable because the trip is really something special, but it still kinda hurts because I’ve missed her quite a bit and I’ve been waiting all week to see her and talk to her and essentially be a couple again.) when she was telling me about the trip all she could really talk about is about this guy called amedeo and how much she bonded with him and how he would tease her all the time and they’d “argue” in a friendly way and they’d stay up till 4 on the patio talking. 

Now that really hit me hard because that’s almost identical to my experience with her on the trip and it honestly made me feel very jealous.

But I figured I’d just leave it be, it wasn’t really a big deal I should trust her and I should be confident in our relationship. However it’s gotten to the point where she’ll pause me on FaceTime to respond to him and gets rather defensive whenever I mention him. I think the part that marked me the most is that just yesterday he surprised her in the cafeteria in front of me mind you with some chocolate and some take out food. I won’t get in too deep on how that made me feel but it definitely made me feel undermined. 

What’s worse is that when I tried to communicate that he makes me feel uncomfortable she puts it back in me saying she’s hurt that I don’t trust in her and don’t trust her when she says he’s just a friend.

At this point I’m not really sure what to do or think. Any advice would be helpful",16Feb2020,1

Ok so I joined the military a while back which means the government owns my ass for the next 2 years. Which also means they can do anything and I can't do jackshit about it. 

That being said, my unit recently decided we werent worth shit so they moved us barracks into the civilian equivalent of a crack house with a bunch of cockroaches, less space, everything broken, everything from the 40s and yeah. 

Well, my thing is, I had a computer like a desktop and since they moved us here I haven't been able to use it because they didn't give us a desk here. 

I've got 2 possible solutions 

1. There's this piece of furniture that's supposed to be used to put the minifridge and microwave but people have been turning it on its side and using it as a desk. The issue with this is that my roommate wants it as well 

2. Buy a desk. Issue with this one is that desks go for minimum 70 bucks and that's the really small ones I've noticed stores call these types of desks ""writing desks"" normal ones go for 130min up to 150ish and that's the ""affordable"" ones. Second issue with this is that I'm absolutely broke. Third issue with this one is that we don't have much space left. Buying a desk would significantly decrease our space 

3. This option isn't included in the original because it's a last resort and the one I'd like to avoid if I can but selling the computer/monitor on eBay I'd like to avoid this one because 

3. A, it's a custom gaming PC originally worth 2k, including the monitor, gaming mouse/keyboard it's easily 3.5k

3. B, selling a used gaming PC is worth less (duh)

4. C. Uhh I had another 2 more but can't seem to remember right now

If I go for option 3 id have to sell minimum enough to get a gaming laptop which normally go for 1.5k and honestly I don't see it selling for that much especially since I'm in Hawaii and here I have a limited number of people to sell to etc.",16Feb2020,1

Finally I'd do something meaningful and it would set me up for success afterwards. I was sent home for not being a good fit. So now I go back home and to my civilian job feeling like I have failed. 

The night I came home, my wife was sleeping in bed and I looked at her phone to see she texted I love you to another man. She had been seeing this guy behind my back and I found out two years ago. I though we could move past this but apparently it's been off an on ever since. I've been home two weeks now and we talked more than we have in a long time and we both said we want to try to make it work. Learn to communicate and connect. So long as she stops talking and seeing the other guy. I know I haven't been a good husband but I cannot be with a cheater but I love her and with help from a counselor and trying in both our parts maybe we can fix this.

She claims she loves me but since our talks the first few nights of me being home she just seems like she's waiting for me to leave. I suspect she'd still talking to the other guy. I rented a new apartment and will move in alone. I need to take this one step at a time and I thought it would be good to act like were dating again.

My brother never wanted kids of his own but has been a happy and excellent step dad to Claire who is now 7. Unexpectedly, they became pregnant and new baby was born this week.

I’ve tried to make efforts with Claire, but she doesn’t talk to me much. When I speak to her she ignores me, or says “what.” quite blankly. I’m guessing maybe it’s because the whole thing is weird to her or difficult. Amy doesn’t let my brother slack as a parent! He dotes on Claire. Every time they visit they prioritise her (once he visited and said he couldn’t hang out because they were concerned with ‘making memories’ for her, which she now doesn’t now remember because she was 4). So I’m concerned about her feelings of the baby taking away some attention.

She hits my brother and is generally quite rude to him, as well as us, and they laugh it off.

I really need to step up my game though. Last night we Skyped them with new baby and my mum said “I love you!” To the baby. Which knowing her, she is not going to say to Claire. So what do I do to make her feel as happy as possible with us really joining the families together? I had a baby last year and I called her a cousin.

Apologies for bad formatting, I’m on mobile.

I have a childhood friend 12M and a new friend 12F/M (she thinks she might be trans but is not completely sure yet). They are hard-core gamers. They constantly make references about Resident Evil, GTA, Metal Gear Solid, Red Dead Redemption, you name it. They are also dating (I know, very young, but they seem to love each other a lot).

When they make game references, they will sometimes ask me, “Quick, where’s that from?!” If I don’t answer for a certain amount of time, or answer wrong, they will either joke-insult me or sigh, annoyed. I have anxiety about my relationships with others, so this kind of hurts. The 12M knows about my anxiety. He is also the one who “insults” me the most.

It doesn’t bother me that much, but I liked it when they were kinder. They are both very antisocial, and the 12M is very rude to other people. It’s a little embarrassing.

I am not severely hurt by this. I do not have depression, nor does it keep me up at night. I still don’t like it, though. If I ask them to stop I feel like they might think I am overreacting, or not take me seriously. They are not a touchy-feely bunch. I also don’t think they know that they are hurting me.

For reference I am 5’3” and 95lbs and when I am over 105lbs I can feel thighs rub and I all I can think is how disgustingly fat I look and that nobody could ever possibly love me because of it. 

Anyway I want to wear jeans because I feel like they look presentable and normal. Maybe they would make me look less ugly and homeless. I can’t wear t shirts bc they aren’t long enough to cover my thighs and they show my fat arms.

Idk any advice that is an attempt to be helpful is much appreciated and I hope there are some people that can relate so I can feel a little less alone.",16Feb2020,1
262,"I recently ended an 11 month relationship with someone I really connected with. Background: we both have severe depression which in retrospect I guess it was a hurt attracts hurt type of thing but I digress. She wasn’t abusive, if anything she was amazing, but I hadn’t seen her in months and it had a negative affect on me, so I tried to explain it to her and she understood, but obviously hurt. I’ve already blocked her on everything in an attempt to get over it but I keep feeling like I was in the wrong, but then apparently she talked shit about me behind my back and idk what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",16Feb2020,1
263,"My best friend and I have three close friends (let’s call them friend, 2, and 3) that we hang out with. I have anxiety and don’t make friends easily so actually forming a friend group with them felt amazing at first. But the more time I spend around them the less I actually like them (I know it sounds awful but it’s true). 

They’re incredibly gossipy and they love to complain about people we know (and sometimes each other), which makes me wonder what they say about us behind our backs. Friend 1 will go on her phone in the middle of conversations and then do that for the rest of the night (like you can’t just do that at home?). Friend 2 is kind of selfish and always puts his wants first. For instance it was my best friend’s birthday and all she really wanted to do was go to this one bar, but Friend 2 kept insisting we just go home because he was tired and argued that if we went without him we clearly didn’t care about his needs and work schedule. Friend 3 only reaches out when she has nobody else to hang out with. Even if we try to initiate things, it’s clear she treats us like back-ups. Finally- and this is my least favorite- they consistently make plans with us and then end up doing the same things with other people. So for example Friend 1 suggested we go to this concert, we were all excited for it, and then she ended up going with other people. 

Ultimately I feel like my best friend and I are kinder to them and prioritize them more than they do us. I’m just tired of their behavior at this point but I honestly don’t think they’d care enough to change. Like I said, we’re probably just “back-ups” for them and the friends they actually treat well... Idk, like I said it’s hard for me to make friends so I don’t want to just cut them out. But I can’t help but wonder if I’m ever going to make good friends, or if it’s always going to be people like this... 

TLDR: I think some of my friends kinda suck but i don’t really know what to do about it",16Feb2020,1

It hurt how embarrassing it was. She told a story I didn't want anyone to know about and she told it to get a laugh out of everyone (long story short, I got high for the first time on edibles with family but I took too much and mixed it that I was crying A LOT and had a terrible trip and I said I still wanted to marry my husband despite my family saying I shouldn't. She also included her conversation with me a few days before the wedding telling me I didn't have to go through with it and I joked I only would if a certain celebrity wanted me). Clearly, it was so funny my videographer decided to include it I guess thinking it was funny too. (he didn't include my father in law's speech or my mother in law's or my brother's so it's not like he didn't have enough speeches to fill time)

I was just woken up around 3am by my mom knocking on my door, since she travels so often I thought she came to say bye, but I was sadly wrong. I woke up to a real cop asking about the call. Everybody at this residency was asleep and we didn’t know what was even going on. They said that the call was from my family members number and was under their name, but nobody called. My family remember received at call shortly before the cops came from a  random looking local number, but didn’t answer. My family member tried calling back but the phone was out of service. The phone number that the call was from was a number that was a home phone number that is now a fax number that goes directly to the fax machine and it gets forwarded to my family members phone. How could anything like this occur? I know spoofing numbers exist but calling the cops is another thing. Please help. I am very scared.

UPDATE:
So, the same thing has happened again, I had a cop come knocking on my door saying they received a call from this resident and again nothing happened and no one has called. This is the second time this has happened and I’m starting to feel targeted and really scared now...",16Feb2020,1

271,"Seven years ago, I met my current significant other randomly on the very day I realized I could no longer ask out my crush and best friend. I was so hurt that actively started dating people, until I eventually ran into my current S.O. again. We went on a few dates, and they were all successful, and I was really excited that she liked me. They let me be myself and accepted me as I was, and has cared about my more than anyone I've ever met. I did everything I could to go above and beyond in the relationship department, despite always believing the relationship would be short-lived and that they'd get bored and break up with me. Because of this, I had always planned my future as if she wouldn't be in. I worry that this is starting to happen. 

A few years ago, I was so happy, and I considered marrying them. However, from our discussion, marriage, family, and buying a home was the last thing on their minds. They just wanted to travel the world, and save up for all of that later, avoiding the conversation altogether. I accepted this, and threw myself into my work and started graduate school, all while trying to still be romantic. I think this was good for me, because there are a ton of experiences I have now as a result of that. I even moved across the country so that they could work their dream job. Seeing them happy made me happy for a while, but the series of odd jobs I had to take until I found a good one took a toll on me. My romantic gestures don't seem appreciated anymore, and if anything, I feel like I'm only kept around because they don't want to be alone. So, I spend even more hours at work and school.

While I could be upset about that, I worry I may be doing the same. Since coming out here, 90% of my friends are that of my significant other, and those who aren't, will never be close enough to me to become real friends. I don't have a support system out here as they do, and I don't feel like I have anyone to truly talk to. Whenever I try to meet new people, they constantly flake on me. I've been wanting to start over for so long, that I've been developing crushes on other people, and mentioning my significant other less and less. I feel like I can't even ask people about how to improve my relationship better anymore.

Recently, all of their friends have started to get engaged, and there has been this odd pressure towards me from them. We are no longer romantic despite me trying to ""spice things up"" so I've been feeling less and less like I want to propose or anything of the sort. While I've been, more or less, planning for a break up, I think they've been subtly pressuring me to propose. I've been mentioning taking a break, but they don't want that either. What's really getting me is that over the last 7 years, they've never hurt me in anyway, and they fight to make me happy. I don't have any reason to break up with them outside of feeling lonely and lost. I know that maybe my initial reason for dating them is starting to catch up with me. I also tried to speak with a counselor/therapist who actively promptly me not to end the relationship, but to just try harder.

He gave her a ticket and it was over with, but before they went their separate ways the cop asked for her cell phone number specifically so she could apparently review his performance. ""To make sure that he was out there doing a good job and was professional and if she would like to give a comment on his performance,"" specifically. She obliged and gave her number because he's a cop and nobody wants to piss off a cop. 

She received a voicemail later from a different person (male again) asking her to call another random number back for the same reason. Not an 800 number, no official state or business number.

This all seems incredibly suspect to me. I guess i'm wondering if this is normal/a regular thing or if I am justified in being freaked out. It just seems so ridiculous and out of line for a cop to ask for anyone's personal phone number let alone a lone female's. 

Extra potentially relevant info: She is 25. We are in south eastern PA. She ended up being pulled over in her work parking lot so now he knows that information also.

277,"I (19F) have been trying to work on being more patient this year and I’m struggling a lot. I feel like I picked up very bad habits from parents fighting when I was younger and I can’t seem to shake them. 

For one, I am very stubborn and want to be right a lot of the time. It takes me a while to apologize because I have a lot of pride. I have been really trying to work on this for the past year and when I’m in the heat of things my pride overclouds my judgement and I don’t apologize until a day or two later when I’ve cooled down. In terms of arguments, I also can’t seem to let go of them easily. There are fights that I’ve had that are pretty dumb ones where we should’ve just let it go but tiny details will stand out to me and bother me for the rest of the day. This causes me to hold onto anger and annoyance until I can forget about it completely the next day. 

Additionally, when I have to repeat myself multiple times to someone who doesn’t listen/ doesn’t understand the first time I get really frustrated and annoyed really quickly. This causes me to be rude and snappy. But again, when I’m in the moment my frustrations get the best of me and it’s like I do it stemming from my emotions. And then I will apologize later on after I realize I was being rude. 

There are a lot of other examples but these are the main factors that I’ve been having a lot of issues with. I feel like if I just remained more patient and understanding then I wouldn’t have these problems. 
Is there any advice on how to control my anger emotions better? I really want to work on this and find a way to approach topics with more patience. It’s hard for me to remain level headed when I’m upset. Any advice would help. Thank you",16Feb2020,1

My school friend always snoops around and wants to know what I am up to. She took away my laptop (despite me telling her to stop) many times to read my essays, homework answers, etc and it really irritates me. Whenever I sit next to her, she constantly looks at my laptop/workbook and copies my work, which makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable and I lose concentration in class. I tried dimming my laptop’s brightness and shrinking the size of the window but it still does not work - she shoves her head in front of my laptop just to see what I am doing.

She pries into everything. A few years ago, she forced me to share my private issues by crying and saying how I was a horrible friend. She can easily spread this information… which is why i cannot just “unfriend” her.

We have been dreaming about being with each other since the beginning. I’ve only seen him 8 times within our relationship. Finally, we made a huge life changing plan to finally live with each other. As of right now, he lives in a house with two other roommates, and they all split the rent. We came to an agreement for me to move in with them, I’d get a job there, we’d get married, and hopefully start our lives in our own home once we save up the money. I bought a plane ticket from Oklahoma to Arizona to visit my dad before I move to Hawaii (I am currently in Arizona) and I also bought a one way plane ticket to Hawaii and it takes off in 10 days from now. Our problem that we run into... my boyfriend found out yesterday that him and his two roommates will be going on deployment for 7 months next month, and his other roommate who’s initially rented the house no longer wants to make payments towards it since they’ll be gone for so long. So that leaves me with no place to stay, and no reason to be there since he will be gone for so long..

I have no problem being somewhere foreign without my significant other because I know I’ll feel like I’m doing something for myself, and taking on responsibility that I need to learn.

• I had this boyfriend that I had been dated for almost 2 months. During that time, I found out so many times that he had been cheated on me by texted with other boys and downloaded Blued, Tinder,... (app dating) when I’m not around, I also found out on his Messenger he texted with someone else when he lying next to me, everytime I checked his phone, all of the messages always be deleted. So I decided to told him about this and said I would break up with him, he always apolozied and he promised never do it again, I love him so much that I always forgived him, I think its 5th times till now.
 
• And it’s almost New Year, he decided to go back home after a long time he aparts from his family. And in this night he came over my house late, there is someone called on his phone, I said who and he answeared it’s his best friend, I realized there is sth wrong so I said gimme his phone and he suddenly said sorry, I was really hurt and shocked because I thought he never do this to me again, I keep silent that night and the day he came back home I didnot say anything either. So I decided to break up with him, cut off everything with him by no call and no reply his message, but the thing is I didn’t say break up line because Im scared if I do that, he would apology and I will forgive him one more time

• So I meet up with new person, surprisingly he is an acquaintance with my “ex”. After a week, we decided to meet each other and have a date, I will call this guy “A guy”. I told “A guy” about my ex and things between us. I thought ex over me but still kept message me, I texted him that we broke up and the reason why, he agreed but he didnot want to think that because he cheated that I broke up, he kept saying that because of me. And right after that, ex found out that Im dating “A guy”, ex messaged me and threated that he will make things up, post on social media that Im a cheater and ruin my life by telling my family Im gay since Im not come out yet. My dad is a conservative person and he may killed me if he knows this (I cant even use my phone, cough too loudly or sleep on the side when he is around, he keeps punish and shout at me), my dad works oversea and he comes home once a year and this is that time.

• He appeared at my house everytime I came home, he said if Im avoid him he would come in my house right away so I feel really stress and can’t concentrate on anything. Ex kept posting on his Instagram that me and him still a couple, and he said “A guy” is the one broke our relationship, since he is a hot Insta with over 120k followers so many people texted “A guy” negative message, so we argue everyday. I talked to ex and said he must stop but he didnot listen so I said to ”A guy” wait for me until the end of the month because my dad wont be here that time so everything will be easier to handle but sadly “A guy” didn’t listen and he said I post sth saying that me and ex are not couple anymore but if I do that, ex will talk to my dad

• I’m feeling so stress and tired, ex keeps coming to my house and threats me, the anxious that my dad give me everyday, I thought “A guy” is the one I can talk to but turn out he is also the one give me stress too,... I’m really not fine right now

284,"I believe that my brother has Antisocial Personality Disorder. That is a bold statement, Ik. That is an often misunderstood diagnosis, Ik. Whether or not the terminology is correct, I believe that my brother is spirally downward rapidly.

This post has no vengeful emotion attached to it. No anger. No resentment. No sorrow, or jealously. I believe with accusations like this, unresolved emotions can cloud the reality of the situation. I can say whole heartedly, that is not the case here. This post is coming from a place of deep concern and fear. Any thoughts are deeply appreciated.

I could tell you many stories of how he's exhibited antisocial tendencies. Lack of conscience/remorse, impulsive behavior, manipulation and deceit, superiority complex. They all fit. But I always chalked it up to ""selfishness"", ""immaturity"", and my family as a whole has never hinted towards a serious issue. Something happened today that makes me believe this is much deeper.

We were traveling by foot in a busy part of the city. Something had taken over him today and he had been walking down the sidewalk with his hands up on his hips, his chest pushed out, and accentuating every solid, confident step he took. It was like a caricature of a confident person. We reach an intersection, the red hand shining bright so we stop. There's many people across the way waiting to cross as well. When the light changes, he moves forward in the same self-assured way as before. And as the opposite group moves towards him, he walks straight through them. No adjustment in speed, or direction. He walks straight into a crowd of crossing pedestrians. Hitting some, knocking others off balance. Looks of confusion and anger. Their faces saying, *what was that for?????* Myself thinking the same thing.

I grab him and say “What are you doing!?”

He replies, “I'm crossing the street, it’s not my fault they didn’t move.”

""W..what??"" I say, still piecing together the situation in my head.

""It's the city, you move out the way or get hit.""

I tell him, ""don't you realize how extremely rude that is?""

""I don't care."" he replies.

Not a speck of remorse on his face.

No justification attempted.

The conversation ends there, and he sees something he likes and begins to tell me how he wants to buy one for himself.

\~

My brother has done decently terrible things in the past. But they always made sense (or were explicable) in his own seriously convoluted way. He stole that money because he deserves the money more than that person for xyz reason. He made up that devastating story about so-and-so because an action they did could have meant this which resulted in that and they need to be punished.

But this act had absolutely no justifiable reason behind it. No matter how twisted. And that was a first.

I felt very scared in this moment. And I felt there were some very severe implications here.

What is the difference between “walks straight into a crowd, does not slow down” and “drives straight into a crowd, does not slow down”. Same thoughts, different setting.

\~

Combined with this, my brother has developed an increasingly destructive lifestyle. Workaholism, alcoholism, increasingly unstable relationships. But he is also highly successful, and in a way been rewarded for the extreme nature of his personality.

I am extremely concerned for his future. And I can't stop thinking about what happened today. I can imagine many different outcomes to his increasingly detrimental behavior and none of them are good. Drug overdose. Drunken accident. Suicide. I could see a twisted fate in which he hurts someone, or is hurt himself and I am scared for him.

286,"This is a bit of a long post, so TLDR at the bottom.

My(M22) SO (F22) and I have been together for 3 years. I love her deeply and she loves me the same. Her family though is a chaotic storm of insanity. She has 2 sisters (8+ years younger). Her father is not home and her mother is...well....complicated. She's been dealing with a major illness for the last year, during which my SO has basically had to take on increasing responsibility to make up for her. The mom is verbally and emotionally abusive, has been for many years, and my SO has stayed in that house for the last 5 years trying to make it so that her sisters don't have to go through the same pain that she did.

On top of that, this span of 5 years has delayed her life massively. Due to a combined self-admitted lack of discipline, episodes of depression, and the combined efforts of her parents to make her into the defacto care-giver for her sisters (that she also holds herself to), she declined an offer to go to a big state school right out of high school (that was also due to not having a lot of money, which you could also chock up to not putting in the effort to get scholarships or taking the risk of loans) and hasn't really made a move towards her goal of becoming a doctor in years.

She's been making small steps towards this goal and becoming an independent adult for a few months, but is constantly getting dragged backward by her family's increasing dis-functionality and a self-appointed directive to protect her sisters. In my eyes and according to her own conclusions, she is essentially sacrificing her future for her family with no end in sight.

I have been supporting her emotionally and been a good boyfriend. I've loved her and given her information for opportunities, tried to motivate her, and she's showing some progress, but she continues to prioritize her family over herself and seems to be fine with going down with the ship so to speak. 

The other day, in a candid conversation, she told me that if I wanted to leave she wouldn't blame me. I told her no. I want to be there for her and help her out of this, see her become a doctor and become the woman that she wanted to be coming out of high school. The woman that I saw in her when we started dating and that I see in her everyday (not saying that I don't love her right now, which I do, but I want to see her succeed).

Am I wrong for considering that out? Is it noble or stupid to try and stay and help? I want to help, and have been, but...I don't know what the right play is I guess. To stay with her could also tie myself down, maybe expose me to some of the risk of her family's issues. 

I don't know. I feel like the right thing to do is to help her any way I can, but the logical thing to do is to go back to being her friend and let life move on. I just can't stomach it though. I don't want to leave her and then find out that she just submitted to her fate and became the girl who never left town, or worse took her own life out of depression (she's had an episode of that in the far past).

TLDR: SO is in a bad family situation that is dragging her down. Her life is massively delayed and while she's fighting it, she admits that she doesn't know if she can detach herself before going down with the ship. How can I keep helping her, should I keep helping her, or should I let her go and let life take its course?",16Feb2020,1
287,"My mom is aware of everything and supportive, my dad is not. My dad does not support my relationship with my girlfriend and just sees it as shallow. He is fake towards her, apparently. He thinks she limits me in life, when he really has no idea how much she has opened up my world. However, I cannot be real with my dad. Anyways, my dad has had me live in his shadow for most of my life and he doesn't want me to be successful unless he is. He restricts what I do, and restricts my opinions, if I disagree we talk for hours until I capitulate and agree with him and support him even. He won't leave until we say ""I love you"" and I apologize if I got upset with him. My mom has been with him for decades now and is essentially stuck with him emotionally, mentally, and financially. However, I don't feel like I should allow my life to be restricted by him. I love him, really I do, maybe it's messed up, but he is my father and has helped me a lot in life. But I think I should move out without him knowing because if I don't, he will do everything he can to block it and make my last days in this household, hell.

What do you think I should do? Thank you for any and all advice in advance.

291,"When I was a freshman (14-15) I “dated” a senior (18) for about a week. It was more like a thing. We hanged out often and one day he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were in his car. I said maybe and then yes, considering I didn’t really have a ride home if I had said no.

A few days later, he said he wanted to take me to his house. He had a weird expression, almost like he was unsure. It might’ve been a red flag for some, but a reminder I was a naive, foolish freshman who understood sex but never really thought about it. I also never been involved with anyone romantically. We went to his house, where he kissed me. He was my first kiss. Things escalated pretty quickly and we were making out. His hands started roaming around under my shirt (just my back) and said to tell him when it’s too much. I said not to undress me. Fast forward we stopped and he later on went on a rant saying “he can’t wait too long” and how he was ashamed and shouldn’t be doing this to himself. I didn’t think much about it.

The next few days he made my life a living hell. Started rumors, ignored me, bullied me with someone else. I quickly stopped talking to him.

That was years ago and now matured and know all the red flags, good and bad, etc. But every time I think of this, of HIM... it makes my blood run cold. I knew he wanted sex, but I didn’t really realize it until today that the reason why he took me to his house was to convince me to have sex, and he treated me badly after cause I said no. I could’ve gotten raped if he was any worse. I was so naive and it still haunts me to this day. I want to shake and cry, thinking there was really someone like this and none of my friends helped me out when they really knew what was going on when I didn’t.

I might ""like"" them, but I don't feel too involved in them emotionally like I would with a crush. 

I've been thinking more about it, and it seems that there could be several reasons why, I just don't know if it's one reason or a lot of them. One reason is that maybe I wasn't having genuine crushes years ago, but something fueled by some unknown mental factor. Like, let's say, an underlying sexual attraction to someone, or a lack of attention to other things about them. I notice more flaws faster about those I'm interested in, and I know that can put me off sometimes. Or maybe more of my personality is affecting that area of my life, as I feel like I have some sort of perfectionist attitude or personality trait. So I notice the flaws quicker, and because the flaws exist, they put me off from the person. But maybe I was having genuine crushes, and then whatever factor came in and disrupted that. I honestly can't pinpoint what made me stop having feelings like that beyond what I've already said, but I realize it's a problem for the romantic side of my life and I need to figure it out if I'm going to improve.",16Feb2020,1

During our initial relationship I wanted it to be romantic but as time went on he just wasn’t interested in me that way (he had feelings at one point but due to my situation he knew it would not work or be healthy for him to pursue). Years have gone by. I have been up and down. After a year with no contact and 2.5 years of receiving help we are slowly starting, through Facebook, to form a line of communication again. Mind you, this line has so far extended to a Facebook comment from him on a meme I posted. I tried msg him on Facebook, just asking a simple “how are you” and the check mark never filled it (you know how it fills in blue with the check mark clear showing it notified the person.) obviously, that most likely means I’m marked as “ignored” on his messenger. Do I simply wait for him to respond when he notices/feels ready too or if I should try to directly ask him on a post to message me (like reply to the comment he made on my meme post saying to message me or something similar). I don’t want to cross any boundaries. I want to be careful with how I handle this since our relationship ended on such terrible terms due to my actions and mental state.

But Im really struggling here and I’ve asked friends for help but am scared they aren’t being honest with me. I have been talking to a guy online for about two weeks. we have a good connection, i’m pretty invested in pursuing a relationship with him. but his last relationship (two years ago) made things difficult for him because they were together for many years and she cheated. but he has been upfront with me about wanting a relationship, and just needing time to ease into it and make sure he trusts me. That’s totally fine with me!! We haven’t met in person, we snapchat and text everyday. I’m an 18 year old girl in college, for reference, and he is 22 and in the military. I really really like him. 

But tonight I went out with my friends to a party. I told the guy I was talking to about this, and he said have fun/be safe etc. But he also made a joke about me bringing a guy home or something (it was definitely a joke.)

314,"Hey, I’m a 20-year old girl with relatively positive body image, but whenever I’m bloated, I feel absolutely terrible about myself. Some relevant context: Around a year and a half ago, I suffered from an eating disorder because my body image was so bad. It’s worth noting that last year, my stomach was smaller than my stomach this year, but both of their “bloated” versions were equally large. Within the past year, I started taking antidepressants and lifting weights, both of which appeared to resolve my eating disorder entirely.

When I’m bloated, then, I remind myself of when I felt absolutely unattractive, utterly consumed by my eating disorder. This is problematic because I’ll go to extreme lengths to become “bloated” where it’s important that I feel I look attractive — for example, not eating until after the event, when I would binge, or not eating before or after at all. Obviously this is concerning for health reasons, but it’s not specially concerning to me because I’m trying to build muscle and mass. These events mostly include when I expect my body to be looked at closely: like at a club, during a public speech, or going on a date. The worse is before I have sex/believe I will be having sex.

Typical disclaimer: I’m still sexually attracted to my male partners when they’re bloated, and I don’t find “bloated women” unattractive. It’s a standard that only applies to me.

325,"This will be long but I’m desperate for advice. I’m 29 years old. The story of how I got to where I currently am is hard to fully explain. It’s a combination of mental illness followed by a series of bad choices that seemed to never get better. For these reasons I’ve never really learned how to be a functioning adult on my own. My life has gotten so bad that I’m willing to open myself to strangers online and ask for advice even if that means letting trolls pick me apart.

A few weeks after graduating high school my life turned upside down. I ended up in a mental hospital for the first time. It was like flicking a switch and I became a different person over night. I was diagnosed bipolar and over the course of the next 10 years I had multiple things added to that list such as extreme ocd, anxiety disorder, irrational phobias etc. I’m not crazy and I’d say mentally I function at a very high level in society as long as I’m in my comfort zone. Outside of my comfort zone I feel out pretty fast. Over the last 10 years I have followed every therapists instructions. I have never drank. I’m 29 Years old and I haven’t tasted alcohol. I don’t do drugs. I don’t smoke weed. I take my medication every day and the only days I have missed were 2 separate times I was in mental hospital for a suicide attempt and the doctors didn’t give me my medication the first night as they processed me. In other words I have fallen all the “rules” I have been give to get better but sadly haven’t gotten better. I’m not going to go into to much detail of how my mind works and why it’s so hard for me to function because I have a therapist for that and am not so far gone that I think random strangers will have the answer to a problem dozens of therapists haven’t been able to fix. I’m more interested in getting advice on how to handle my current life situation and finally move forward.

I live with my sister who raised me. She’s 17 years older then me. I’m on ssi and have never had a job as an adult. I’m aware of how pathetic this is. You don’t need to tell me, it brings me to tears daily thinking about it. I don’t drive and I have extreme tendonitis/RSI in my hands. I don’t know what direction to go forward starting a future for myself. The only thing I’m extremely good at is typing. I type 115 WPM. I always figured my first job would have something to do with being on a computer because that’s what I’m good at and comfortable with. Problem is, my hands are actually burning with pain just by typing this short reddit post, so a computer job isn’t realistic. I’m extremely dependent on my sister for everything.

326,"Long story short. My father passed away when I was 14. He was murdered. 

There’s always that day where people be like “What about your father?”

I could 
(a) lie and say my father is not in the picture
(b) wave it off and ignore the question 
(c) tell them my father passed away 

Then it could go a few ways
(a) “I’m sorry for your loss”
(b) “I’m sorry for asking, I didn’t know”
(c) “If it’s not too personal, can I ask how it goes?”

327,"I work at a daycare and in each classroom there's 3 teachers so there's me, abusive coworker (ac) and nice coworker (NC) 

This happened last week, I was cleaning up sand off the floor, nc was busy with paperwork, ac was with the kids on the carpet about to do a movement activity. We weren't looking at her but I looked up because a child (let's call her pie) was throwing a tantrum because she wanted to hold an object that ac was holding, I looked away and kept sweeping and then I heard a whack. I looked back up and I see ac holding the object yelling at pie and pie is sobbing holding her hand close to her body. Although me and NC didn't see it you could piece together what happened: ac hit pie on the hand with the object she was holding because pie wasn't listening and wouldn't leave her alone (no excuse for AC's behavior, pie is 2 you don't hit a fucking baby) anyways me and nc are looking at each other shocked but the moment passes and everyone moved on. The next day I went to my supervisor (I waited because I was shocked and angry and wanted to figure out what I witnessed and how to calmly approach my supervisor) Supervisor clearly didn't really believe me, she seemed bored while I'm telling her I witnessed a child being abused. She tells me that instead we'll have a training on appropriate contact with students. 

Next day supervisor tells me that because I didn't see it, it's not enough evidence for an investigation. I'm frustrated and disgusted I mean if a person is assaulted and two people hear what's going on is that not a witness?? And will ac even face consequences for her actions? What do I do because right now I can't look ac in the eye 
Also on Friday something happened, ac usually opens on Friday and I guess the kids have already figured out the schedule but ac has been out sick so I was opening. The first child who walked in (Peppa) was clearly crying and when I asked Mom what was wrong she says that Peppa had been sobbing and refused to go to school because she doesn't like ac. I know they're only 2 and you can't take everything they say or do at face value but that's a red flag. What do I do to keep my students safe? Can I go higher up to ask that something is done?

333,"Sorry for how long this is. My mind's a bit of a stress mess and I don't use reddit much outside of upvoting stuff, so I'm new to actually posting. I'm probably doing this wrong somehow. \^\_\^;; I tried to bold important stuff though...  


**I'm financially independent and living on my own again.** I went NC with my dad several holidays ago, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The stress in my life has decreased soooo much, especially since I never have to go to family events anymore. (If he's there, I won't be there. So... everything! :D)

**I still need to go NC with my mom though**, and, consequently, the rest of my family. She'll likely use whoever she can to try to contact me and I was never close to any of my siblings, so it's no loss to cut them out either. The only family member I will stay in touch with is my uncle (who lives thousands of miles away) because he's the only family who's ever truly respected me as a human being.

&amp;#x200B;

**History:**  
I've known for over a decade (in high school even) that my biggest Life Goal is to cut my family out of my life. The **lifetime of emotional abuse** and general level of them not being good people even though they think they are is just too much for me to put up with. There is a lot of conservative religious crap going on in that family (it's the basis for the type of crap - I'm not hating all religions), and my mom refuses to have any opinions her specific church didn't directly give her. **I happen to be trans**, but I hated **all the queerphobia** before I realized my place in the LGBTQ+ community. I even told her I'm trans awhile ago, but she refuses to change her mind on the issue. She maintains that trans people are ""just confused"" because God and -insert homophobic garbage about ""challenges"" repurposed as transphobia-.

Last year I realized that I can probably get top surgery in 2020. I knew already that I'd **need to cut contact with my mom before I get top surgery**, but I didn't realize I could get it so soon. Recent developments mean my consult is in a few months (on my birthday!!) and it's looking like **I'll get the actual surgery around September/October** this year.

Also, I **might be moving in the next few months,** which means I would need to cut contact with my mom even sooner than my surgery date. This move would bring me geographically closer to my parents and make it a hell of a lot more convenient for them to visit. My parents live in the grey area between suburban/rural, so half an hour to get to the nearest bigger suburbs is commonplace. It's their version of ""going into town."" My mom gave me a ton of crap for moving to a more urban area further away, even though it was my only option for independent living at the time. She won't stop trying to guilt trip me about it. It'd probably work if I gave a crap about her feelings or ""the family,"" but they destroyed any love I might have had for them long before I became an adult. The place I might be moving to happens to be one of the Suburb Cities ""near"" them though, so **it'd be a complete disaster for her to find out about it in any way**. She *especially* cannot know the city I might be moving to because that would make interactions with her so much more difficult. It's a frequently-visited city for my family. My current plan if I somehow run into her or other family is to pretend I'm just visiting a friend who lives in the area. I desperately need to keep that alibi safe and plausible.

  
**The Issue:**  
When I cut contact with my dad, I mostly used my mom as an intermediary and it was after a lot of fighting with him. When I cut contact with my mom, I'm going to have to cut contact with all my family all at once (except my uncle (my mom's brother)). They are horrible at respecting boundaries, which is a big reason I'm going NC with them.

I don't care about hurting their feelings too much and they've never truly cared about mine. What I'm unsure about is how to cut my mom (and the rest of my family) out in a way that forces the issue. Also, **how do I handle informing my uncle about this decision?** It's his sister after all, and I'd like to still have a relationship with my uncle after this. He's been so ridiculously supportive and affirming of my gender and the transition steps I've been making, and it'd hurt to lose my growing relationship with him because of how I handled going no-contact with his sister.  


***I don't know what approach to use with going NC or with telling my uncle about it, and I'm so lost on when I should do the different steps. How do I decide when the right time is? Please help.*** **:c**

I also could probably use some advice on how to handle the inevitable pangs of guilt because the kind of abuse I received was subtle and insidious. My parents maintain they love me so much and they seem like nice people. It's taken me a long time to even recognize their behaviors as abusive. They weren't trying to hurt me, but I've been severely psychologically damaged from how they treated me and continue to treat me even as an adult.

336,"My husband has always had some weird relationships with food, but lately I'm finding myself more alarmed by them.

He works all day on his feet and works mainly a 2-10 pm-ish schedule, sometimes a little later. He rarely eats before going to work, doesn't eat anything at work, and then comes home and eats usually a canned soup or whatever leftovers we have in the fridge around 11 pm. 

I've tried buying more breakfast items like yogurt and bagels and such for him to eat during the day but he always says he's not hungry and then we end up throwing out stuff because it goes bad. 

Today kind of set me off because he knew he was going to be really busy at work today and he accidentally got to work 2 hours earlier because of a scheduling mistake, so he had time to go out and get food but he didn't and is just now eating soup.

338,"I’m currently in grade 11, I take advanced math, bio, chem, physics and a course for Business Administration.  That’s all fine and dandy right?  Well I have an opportunity to do a traineeship which basically lets you get a day off school once a week to work for 8~ hours to work towards a nationally recognised course in Hospitality. 
(TD;LR at the bottom)


The pros I can see are:

• Get paid 
I’ve been looking for a job since last year but haven’t been successful yet.  I’m kinda desperate, just don’t want to keep asking my parents for money and feel left out cause all of my friends have jobs.

• Complete the course + get work experience 
Having the course and work experience on my resume would be good for future job applications.  Taking this course outside of school would cost $1,600.

• Day off school
I get to study at my own pace at home instead of a classroom once a week

But on the other hand the cons are:

• Underpaid 
Doing a school-based traineeship would get you $8.80 an hour whereas if I found a job outside of a traineeship I’d be getting $10~.  I can work shifts on the weekends for $13.

• Qualifications don’t matter?
I’ve been told that a cert in hospitality gets overlooked (take that with a grain of salt) and experience is the most important thing. 

• Behind in school work 
Although the resources teachers use in class are put up online, I’d probably do worse when learning without a teacher fully explaining everything (not to mention my three science classes).  I could always change one of these subjects to an easier one but I can’t fully drop out of one otherwise I can’t go to university immediately after high school.

• Lasts 1-2 years 
This course is a commitment.  It takes 750 hours of experience and an online course to complete. 



TD;LR I can get a job but be underpaid by $2 per/hr, get a qualification and work experience on my resume, get a day off school to work, do an extra subject online, might be swamped with schoolwork.

She's not super sick yet but I felt it wasn't fair for my mom who raised me alone and devoted herself to me to be alone all the time and have nobody around as she is mentally unstable and it makes it hard for her to make friends.

I've had a hard time finding good consistent work since moving back, and to boot, everything just feels stagnant. I hate using this word but I am bored out of my skull, and alot of my friends are married now, things have changed. So between work and social life, I feel like I'm kind of fading away.

My sister got sick of the way my mum was treating her so I took her in at the start of December 2019 and she lived with me until the 24th of January. In that time period Mum was acting like a child and trying to cause petty arguments. She rocked up to my house yelling and banging on the front door. I called the cops but she left before they came. My sister had told me that she didn’t want anything to do with mum for a while and I suggested that we have a break and let things settle down before we try to fix anything.

Turns out she was with our mother and she didn’t want to come back to my house. She said that she wanted to come and get clothes but was taking forever to come home so my partner and I decided to go and get my medication.

I have a nice life, currently living with my niece and my grandparents
Also I only really have 7 friends who are true to me.
Today is valentines here. I have no date. No nothing. I'm very shattered as I type this (8:08 PM) Well I bought stuff for my crush ( which she knows that I like her) and her 2 friend (also girls). Her bestfriend helped me which gift to buy for her. Well I got the stuff and bought gifts for the 2 girls as well. I gave them the gift today and they appreciated it (I guess) then after school, I went to McDonalds with my best friend, then after eating, we went home. While I was riding the jeep (Philippine transportation vehicle), I texted her and she replied. I asked her ""Hey, what's up?"" She asked ""Hi, wdym whats up? Also, I just got home."" I replied ""Well I haven't gotten home yet. It's really a tough traffic rn."" She then said ""I got to the honors"" ('cause that's also the day our grade certificated for the 3rd quarter giving day and she got 90+ average). I was surprised ang congratulated her. She said thanks. Well some other unessential chats. Then she said ""Finally, something I can brag about for my crush."" I pretended that didn't hurt me and I replied ""Ayiiee! Clus aq ahhh JOK"" (English-Ayiiee I'm actually jealous, JOKE!"" She asked what was it the ""Ayiie! Clus aq ahh""? I replied "" SELUSSS JOKKEEE"" (English-ENVY/JELOUS JOKKEEE"" she said ""Gastog"" (English- lol) then other more chats (also not really important. Also, when I got to the gate of our subdivision/neighbourhood, I was still talking to her and sent her a pic of the gate, also that time I was riding a tricycle, another Philippine Transportation Vehicle. Then she literally just stopped chatting. I got home and got dressed up. And continued to chat her. She didn't reply, just ""seened"" the other chats. The other girls on the other hand, posted it on Facebook about my gifts. I saw the comments about them talking. I was happy and sad. I didn't know why she won't talk to me. And also, everynight we say goodnight to each other, but since last month (I guess) that stopped. I didn't do anything wrong. I don't get it. I'm so broken. I was also about to ask her outside but I wasn't since her bestfriend already told me that they will go to a mall to celebrate her grades. I don't know if I'm messed up, hates me, doesn't appreciate me, or anything else or maybe she's shy. Everynight I pray that I hope that God show's me a sign that there is a chance. I know I need to wait for 8-13 years since we're in Grade 9 and she can't have a bf if she still hasn't have a job. She even said she won't have any crushes because she will prioritize hey studies first. But what do I see, she has a crush. Lives NEAR her. She even said if someone waits for her that long, she'll accept that guy. I hope I'll be able to make it. I won't be able to withstand if I end up being without her. I'm scared. I need help. Also, the day when we bought the gifts, (2 days ago, Feb 12), I was sick that time, but I ignored it, just so I can get her a present. I just want her to realize my efforts. Why can't she see it.

368,"So, I’m shaking as I try to write this down because I really have no one to tell this to, not even my family and it’s incredibly difficult to ask help like this. I just need all the help I can get.


Three days ago, we went on a school-related trip and our teacher wanted to group us into four and the leaders of the group had to choose the people they want on their group. Long story short, my so-called “friends” did not choose me at all. They didn’t even ask me if I was okay with them not choosing me. They just proceeded to pick each other and left me out of the group, as if I didn’t exist at all. I know I’m being overdramatic but they didn’t even talk to me after all of that, like none of them even tried to approach me. And to think that I was always a good friend to them; at least according to me &amp; the people around us. And sometimes, when it was my turn to pick who I want on my team, I would always, ALWAYS pick them first, without any hesitation. I would always look after them &amp; I treated all of them like they were my REAL family. But now I feel betrayed because all I did was be a nice friend to them &amp; this is what they repay me. THEY DIDN’T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT IT THREE DAYS LATER. Until now, none of them ever reached out to me. It was like I was never a part of their life and it felt like all of the times we spent together didn’t exist. All of the strong bonds and commitments we made appeared to have been forgotten. 

I’m so scared right now because I don’t know what I’m going to feel once I talk to them. I didn’t even go to school since friday and I probably won’t show up on monday. 

Tell me, do I have every right to be upset? And what should I do? I know this feels like a really shallow problem but I take my friends very seriously because they’re the only people who accept me for who I am. It really really hurts to have just a minor problem.

We went to the stock show with another one of our friends and I was being more quiet than usual and id catch her staring at me several times and id ask her why she was staring at me and she said I don't know. Shortly after that her and i stopped talking for months because she got back together with her ex and they split up a few months afterwards well they weren't like fully together but still. So valentines day she texted me out of nowhere asking if i wanted to go to a bar with her and her friend and all night she kept talking to me more than her friend and like playing with my watch.

376,"I'm currently living with my parents, but I want to move out as I can't stand living there anymore. My parents are great, it's my sister that's driving me crazy. Her behavior has made me depressed and suicidal, but I don't truly want to die, just to get away from her. You can look at my post history for details if you want.

I know getting help from a therapist is important and am looking into that, but what I really want is advice on how I can realistically be living somewhere else. 

I have online freelance work that I've done and can get back into, but much of my time is spent dealing with my sister and taking care of other responsibilities I have at home. What little time I get to myself I end up spending trying to relax and get my mind off of how miserable I am.

I'm hoping that if I could live on own or even with roommates somewhere else I might have the time and motivation to actually focus on my freelance work and hopefully make enough money to afford living on my own. But how can I do that when I have no money?

Living with other family is very unlikely. Most of them live far away and I don't think they would take me in anyway. Staying with a friend would be nice, but I don't have any, so that's a no go. I don't think I'd qualify for any housing programs since I'm already living with my parents. Getting a ""real"" job to make money isn't really a possibility as I don't have a car and my parents are gone with theirs at work all day.

What should I do? Is there something obvious I'm overlooking? Do I just need to try to buckle down with my freelance work and save up? That seems like the most realistic action, but I'm not sure my sanity will last that long or that I'll actually be able to make enough in my current situation.

379,"I have unattainable expectations for myself. I strive for perfection in every aspect of my life, from academic to hobbies to health. 

I had a nervous breakdown last week because I thought I performed badly on a test for the first time in my life. I was hyperventilating for an hour. Turna out I actually did well, which calmed me down again and restored my mental state of being. However, it was sort of a catalyst as to how dependent my mental state is on academic performance.

This fall I’ll be attending one of the most prestigious university courses in my country. It’s notorious for academic pressure and competitiveness. With my current mindset, I don’t think I’ll survive five years of that. In every other aspect aside from the pressure, it’s my dream course and university, so it’s not something I can quit, either, because I really want to attend.

So, I need to learn how to lower my expectations. I just don’t know how. I’ve gone my entire life expecting the most of myself, and it seems impossible to just stop. Does anyone know where I can begin?

380,"I am renting a room in a house with 3 other people. There are also a dog and cat that are not mine. I moved in yesterday and I keep my two large dogs on a leash unless they are in my room or in the backyard because they are still getting used to being here and don’t know the rules yet (don’t go upstairs/in other peoples rooms, don’t jump on anything, the cat doesn’t like you, etc) 

Well last night I locked my room door and the door that leads into the guest bathroom. The bathroom door doesn’t have a handle, it has to be locked to be closed. I thought it was locked/closed.

My dogs fell asleep on the floor and all was well until I heard the sound of running up and down the stairs and upstairs. I was woken up by the sound but fell asleep back asleep without giving it any thought. It was very loud and happened at least twice.

Then next thing I know one of my dogs is staring at me asking to go outside. I wake up and realize the other dog is missing and the bathroom door is ajar. I open it to see my other dog and my roommates dog peaking their heads through the guest entrance on the other side. It was the dogs chasing each other that I heard.

I took the dogs out to the bathroom then we went back to the room and I locked the bathroom again.

Obviously if the dogs got out through the bathroom it wasn’t locked. My guess is that I didn’t turn the key all the way and one of the three dogs managed to push the door open.

My questions are-
1. This all happened around 2am. How do I bring this up to my new roommates and apologize? Do I wait for one of them to bring it up? Do I need to send a message to the landlord?
2. The room as advertised as having a private half bath. When I took a tour it was described as a “semi-private bath” and my landlord (who doesn’t live here) disapprovingly told me that the last girl to rent my room locked the guest entrance so that no one else could use it. Since apparently telling if the door leading from my room is locked or not is not as obvious as I thought, should I lock the bathroom at night (lock the guest door from the inside)? There is a full bath for everyone upstairs and I want to be 100% certain that my dogs can’t get out and no one else can get in, but I also don’t want to  be the jerk who moved on and cut off access to what is apparently not actually a private bathroom.",16Feb2020,1
382,"So this is a really long story, but I'll try to summarise it.


I'm a very shy, nerdy, and introverted person. I've never had any relationships, nor has any woman really noticed me. 


Recently, due to very lucky circumstances, I've been seeing this girl and it's been going on for quite a while now. Nothing serious yet, but I think that's what we're both looking for. I'm not interested in anything casual, nor am I comfortable dating multiple people at once (paging /u/MrQui because what a fucking coincidence that my conviction gets tested like this right after talking about it). I'd say we have a connection and I find myself falling for her.


So today I'm out with my friends at a bar, and a friend of mine invites along some of his old coworkers, two girls. Throughout the night they try to make conversation with me. I'm blind to signals, so it takes me a while to realise that they might be interested in me. But after one of them basically tries to drag me to dance with her, I realize what they're trying to do. At that point I start to feel extremely uncomfortable, and after a while of hanging around I leave and go home. I just don't know how to deal with a situation like that. 


I feel really shitty right now. I didn't do anything with them expect talk like I normally talk with people. But I still feel some guilt for not realising what they were trying earlier.


Additionally, not including the person I'm dating, this is literally the first time a woman has given me any attention anywhere. **I don't regret that I turned them down, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit bothered that the first and only time this happens is the first and only time in my life I can't reciprocate.** They were the type I'd get along well, and I quite enjoyed talking with them at first. Am I an asshole for being bothered about this? 


I wanted to be honest, and so I snapped my date almost immideatly after going home and told her quickly what's happened because I feel guilty. She's not responded yet.


I just feel shitty right now.",16Feb2020,1
384,"So before everyone jumps on me.

We had a case of *rattus rattus* nesting in my father's pool supplies cupboard. The mum had been poisoned a few days prior and we only found out there were babies inside the cleaned out cupboard when the dog grabbed one from a bag that had holes chewed in it. 

The baby rats were clearly malnourished (ribs showing through) and their eyes weren't open yet. Honestly we couldn't think what to do with them because they were slowly starving and honestly starvation is such a horrible death. I offered to drown them.

I put them in a bucket and ended up getting a cloth and just holding them under the water (there were 4) they struggled for about 2min and then they were gone. I went and tipped them into the property across the road (80 acres of forest).  


Am I a psychopath? It was so easy to do... But it was honestly the most logical thing to do and I'm not sure how I feel that I was just so calm about doing it. They needed to die, and we couldn't think of a humane way to do it (the dogs are way too old to actually harm the rats) and that was the easiest way we could think of.  


I'm not sure how to process this.",16Feb2020,1
385,"Hi,

Thanks for reading! At first I talked about it with close friends, but I am still unsure what to do.

I may aware it is a luxury issue. My sincere apologies for any harm done. I did not grew up myself in this sort of luxury, I am not and cannot get used to the difference.

Issue:
My parents in law LOVE to go on vacation. They go at least 2 - 3 times a year (both doctors, wealthy lives) for longer periods plus far away destinations. Now they offered to pay all tickets for their two children + partners to go on a 13-16 day trip during summer break, plus an own spending budget. Let's say it's around 3k for each person.

My issues;
1. I never traveled far. I only went to neighbouring countries for either uni or short city visits with friends (max 3 days).

2. As said before, I grew up in a normal/average european household. When I started my first job (12), my parents thought me how to handle money and I had to pay for everything for myself since then. Excluding the occasional gifts for Christmas, bday, accomplishments in life (uni, license, grades). The thought of accepting that much money does not feel right for me.

3. My partner and I just bought a house last year. Obviously this ruined my savings. going on such a long trip will mean I have to destroy my last savings.

4. There is still a list of things we need to fix for the new house. Including: finishing the master bed room (new bed) and a possible baby room. Costs are indicated at 7-8k. The vacation means I have to postpone those costs for another year atleast.

5. I am about to switch jobs in a month or two. I am not sure if my new work will accept me asking for at least 10 workdays off when I just started there. Plus, it's during the general summer break. 

6. They suggested it yesterday. I have to let it know today for booking discount. This makes me panic a lot.

7. I am not a travel person. I tried to be one, but I rather spend my free time and money on my house, my hobbies or my family. the thought of being away from home for a long period (my max is like 5-7 days) makes me..panic?

8. There is also a list of my own personal bucket list (new bike, new glasses, eyes lasered, new computer, new desk, house upgrading as a terrible mechanic ;)) which I would also have to postpone. For example: I have been saving for all this for the past 3 years. I still wasn't able to get any of it due to uncertain costs and personal issues.

9. I would have to leave my dog in a dog daycare. Let's say it's atleast 75 Euros a day. 



Long list... :)
I do know that my partner would value it if I would join. I am trying really hard to be able to join them . But it feels like a huge obstacle for myself to be able to go. To accept that gift plus the list named above.. it would mean I'd have fun for 2 weeks, but at the cost of postponing my personal goals/things I want to achieve again..

It would mean I have to start saving at this point asap to be able to afford anything there. We are already on a budget to be able to save everything we can.

What is your opinion on this?

Me :)",16Feb2020,1

I am recovering from disordered eating behaves . I have a hard time not counting calories or macronutrients, binging, purging, very low restriction. 

I haven’t told my parents, but i have told my therapist. I spoke about this with my friends, and I’m really trying my hardest to overcome it. 

My dad has to lose weight, and my mom wants to lose weight. My whole house is obsessed with food and losing weight, except for my brother. Weight has always been an issue in my household, but we never strictly diet or even weighed ourselves. 

Sinds i lost a lot of weight due to my disorder eating habits, they want to weight me. (Even thought that’s a trigger as well)

Sinds a few weeks we have a scale, and my mom tracks everybody’s weight in a journal. 
Which is difficult, but i started to not let it get to me. But sinds last week, she started calorie counting, and really looking into food-labels. 

This makes me very stressed, i just want to not worry about food. But every time when i think i am feeling  a little better, things like this happen. 

I don’t want to tell my parents, because i’m scared that my mom takes control over my eating. Which will only make me more stressed, and likely to go back in bad behaviors.

There is this guy, from another nation, another religion, she's in love with. she knows her from same chatroom for 2 years . they never met, he never shared his face. girl did. they used to talk privately on a messenger app.

boy made lot of fake promises , lied. 3 months back , he has abandoned her , told her she's ugly and whore and other indecent things to make her go away. he told her he was just playing and never serious , that he has many other girls in his life and has physical relationships with them. he blocked her from everywhere. 

girl cries everyday. beg him for mercy and wants him back.  she says she can't live without him , tells me it's better if she dies. creates new accounts to contact him. boy is a moron basically.  he flirts and sexts with girls in front of her. but girl is a fool i guess. this pisses me off.

this valentine ,  girl told me about another boy,  his classmate offered her rose. she refused. says she loves him (yes, the moron) only and doesn't want to give false hopes to anyone.  i suggested her to atleast start talking to the rose guy. result , she says No. she has become depressed and lonely.

there is no chance they can be together. girl is an atheist and boy is a muslim. even two nations. enemy nations. i don't understand why she can't understand this reality and move on from that fraud and characterless person. I'm confused how love works for some people.  he was her 'first love' but needless to say he turned out to be an asshole.

I can't see her like that. I'm attracted towards her but confused and scared too. whether i should share my feelings or not. she could run away from me too. even if she accepts me ,what if she can't forget him ever. how will our relationship turn out in future.

405,"My husband(Jay) and I have this friend (Mark) who is very unhygienic. We are all 24 and have all lived together at different points in the apartment that husband and I currently share. I didn't live with him long so I didn't have a full experience of his behavior. When living here Mark showered every 3-4 days. Sometimes it was once a week and he was open about how infrequently he bathed when Jay told him he smelled bad. Jay even thinks that Mark acted proudly of it at times. When I was living with my parents before moving in with Jay, he would complain to me about Mark's smell and that sometimes when Mark would come home from work Jay could smell it as soon as he opened the door to the apartment. Jay said it was so terrible that he would often gag and once threw up in his mouth before getting to the restroom. Jay really cares about our friend and tried to tell him many times that this isn't normal and that he really needs to bathe himself more often. FYI jay did all of the laundry for himself and Mark. He noticed that Marks clothes were often dirtier than you would expect them to be, streeking in the underwear. Jay thinks Mark doesn't wipe his butt because of this and because of how quickly he would exit the restroom after well exploding in the toilet... (definitely not a soundproof restroom).

Mark has moved out and I have replaced him in the apartment. Jay is much happier of course because I'm his wife but also because he says that Mark's smell and behavior was becoming unbearable.

We hang out with Mark still sometimes and I hadn't noticed him smelling just horribly until the other day when I ran into him at the store. He was out doing a bunch of errands so he could have been sweating a bit but his BO smell was very very strong. I thought it might have been me at first because I wasn't standing near anyone and I could smell it clearly. I looked up a bit and there he was. He approached and it got much much stronger. We talked very briefly and I said I had to go because I was in a hurry. When I came home I told Jay how Mark smelled and how it must have been embarrassing to smell that strongly out in public. Jay told me that yeah sweating makes you smell but not that strongly and that he probably hadn't showered in many days.

Later that night I spilled a big glass of water and Jay went to grab a towel to clean it up. Now since it was just initial sopping up water from the floor he grabbed one of our used bath towels from the basket that needed to be washed anyway. When he grabbed it he noticed some brown streaks and showed me. I told him that was the towel Mark had used when we went to sauna the other day. Sauna is normal in this country and friends come over to go to sauna at our apartment 1-2 times a week.

We were both disgusted by the dirty towel and his smell that day and decided we really need some advice about how to help Mark with his hygiene. Jay has tried to tell Mark many times but he is never taken seriously and seems to think it's really funny how disturbed Jay has been by the smell and general dirtiness of Mark's body, clothes, bedsheets, etc.",16Feb2020,1

421,"Hi

So I've been worried a lot about a friend lately. This is going to be a long read so tldr at the bottom.

I have this friend which I know since school. Let's call him Jon. Jon was the smart one (started going to university a year before A levels...), knew how to make friends and most people liked him. He succeeded in everything he tried. It seemed as if success just happened to him. He was also a bit nerdy.

We spent quite some time together as we were in the same class, sports club and even orchestras. So I fell in love with him, what I never told him untill we got our A levels. This meant some interesting four years of not telling him for me.

So after that we both started studying. He in the nearest university, I moved about 6 car hours away, which made it easyer for me...

His first year at university must have gone quite well, he got great grades.

Now forward a year. I haven't heard much from him, since I was concentrating on my Bachelor Degree. Now I am a bit more active in the club and also meeting people who I spent time earlier with. Jon quit his Job where he wanted to write his thesis. He stopped attending lectures, handing in mandatory academic works and basically cancelled his study.

He also began drinking alcohol (which he was strongly against until recently). Like a lot. Not in get-me-to-hospital-doses, but enough too get us worried.

He began breaking friendships with people he knows since school, from the club etc. Not like the type of that he made new friends where he studies, but he cancells arrangements literally with ""don't want to \[spend time with you/ be out today/...\]"".

Jon will get kicked out of his dorm in a few weeks since he doesn't study anymore. His parents pay for his living in the moment. They of course have no idea that he is basically sitting in his appartments all day and playing computer games. (got this from a closer friend of him, who is also close with me. Jon broke with her just recently...)

The youth section of our club is doing a trip to the sea this year for example. I invited him to join, but he literally texted me, that I ""shouldn't get my hopes up, that he will spend time with me"".  I told him, that I am over him, but ""that doesn't change anything"".

A few months ago, Jon told me, that he feels alone and really wishes for a girlfriend. I told him, that I would be there, if he needed to talk to someone. I think I made it clear, that I have no romantic feelings for him to avoid misinterpretations.

I really struggle to sort all this for myself and hope that you have an idea of how I should deal with this. I am mostly worried, that he would harm himself physically. It feels sad to see someone apparently loosing controll about his life.

I also never told him, that I am worried about him. He always was the independent guy who doesn't talk about his feelings or that he's struggling with anything. So I didn't want to risk anything.

I am also not a native speaker, so please forgive me :)

tldr: losing contact to a friend who cancelled his studies, a job, friendships and closer contact with me. Worried that he might hurt himself. How can I regain contact or at least make him to look for help if necessary?",16Feb2020,1
422,"I (24f) have been with my partner (28m) for nearly 4 years now and it’s a good relationship, we live together and have a great time.

I have always made it aware to him that I probably don’t want kids and he just brushes it off. At the moment, I’m leaning more towards NOT wanting children. Im probably 70% no and 30% yes.

never met or seen her face but she's a good girl.

There is this guy, from another nation, another religion, she's in love with. she knows her from same chatroom for 2 years . they never met, he never shared his face. girl did. they used to talk privately on a messenger app.

boy made lot of fake promises , lied. 3 months back , he has abandoned her , told her she's ugly and whore and other indecent things to make her go away. he told her he was just playing and never serious , that he has many other girls in his life and has physical relationships with them. he blocked her from everywhere. 

girl cries everyday. beg him for mercy and wants him back.  she says she can't live without him , tells me it's better if she dies. creates new accounts to contact him. boy is a moron basically.  he flirts and sexts with girls in front of her. but girl is a fool i guess. this pisses me off.

this valentine ,  girl told me about another boy,  his classmate offered her rose. she refused. says she loves him (yes, the moron) only and doesn't want to give false hopes to anyone.  i suggested her to atleast start talking to the rose guy. result , she says No. she has become depressed and lonely.

there is no chance they can be together. girl is an atheist and boy is a muslim. even two nations. enemy nations. i don't understand why she can't understand this reality and move on from that fraud and characterless person. I'm confused how love works for some people.  he was her 'first love' but needless to say he turned out to be an asshole.

I can't see her like that. I'm attracted towards her but confused and scared too. whether i should share my feelings or not. she could run away from me too. even if she accepts me ,what if she can't forget him ever. how will our relationship turn out in future.

I decided to go up and see him. He gave me a hug and asked me how I was. We talked and caught up and I went and I laid on the bed and he laid next to me. We chatted a little more and I told him I didn't know whether I should have come up there or not. He was like ""well you're here. Let's just make the best of it.""

431,"First-time redditor here so bear with me. I know my menial issues pale in comparison to some of the other posts on this thread, but I’m going on over 3 years without any friends or support groups (after cutting the last two out of my life and home after they figuratively stabbed me in the back; long story, wont go into it), and it’s taking a serious toll on my mental wellbeing. I need a bit of help to brainstorm a way out of this slump.

My only real pal moved 1500km away around the same time that my social solitude began, and a while after that my long-term gf dumped me (over text, mind you). The only other serious partner I’ve had, I got engaged to at the ripe old age of 19, though we soon realised we weren’t meant to be and broke it off.

Around the same time, I ended up abusing alcohol and a bunch of other substances, to the point where I feel it’s f*cked me up long term (24M btw, so my brain’s not yet fully developed yadda yadda). I was suicidal and was diagnosed with MDD (manic depressive disorder) while I was still in my teens, but I’ve learned to live with it and try to live a normal life. I’m too prideful to take medication for it, but I got the psychiatric help when I needed it. Unfortunately it also means that, instead of giving in to ‘one of my turns’ (Pink Floyd, anyone?), I’ll just go quiet and truck along. This has led me to a pretty lonesome, boring life, where I’m just alone with my thoughts; trying to minimise ‘triggers’, for lack of a better term. I think I went 2 months without speaking to anyone last year, which is quite a record given I live in a metropolitan city, was at uni at the time, and had a busy graveyard-shift job. It’s not that I can’t talk to others, or that I’m weird or anything; I guess I’m just a bit of a downer sometimes.

I’ve recently made efforts to improve things by moving cities (building a new home for myself), getting pretty fit (kayaking is my go-to), and trying to put myself out there romantically (Bumble mostly, gave Tinder a shot but it was too superficial for my taste). I’ve got plenty of hobbies (though they’re all solitary), I’m somewhat intelligent, and I’ve been told by several others that I’m an 8 on ‘the scale’, but for some reason I haven’t had a single date from any of those apps for nearly a year now. Despite swiping almost every day and having some great online chats, I always end up getting ghosted or stood-up. My habit of essay-texting might have something to do with it haha, or maybe people just pick up on my unhappiness before we even meet and decide to steer clear 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’ve given up the drugs (6 weeks clean now), but I’m feeling like this overwhelming loneliness is worse than ever (nothing to get my mind off it anymore I guess). 

I’m just not sure where to go from here. I’d love to have friends again to just drink and shoot the shit with, but I’ve no idea where to meet them. I’d love to have a gal to marathon TV shows and go on adventures with, but I have no idea where to meet one. It’s driving me insane, being stuck in this cycle of ‘depression’-&gt; ‘solitude’ -&gt; ‘loneliness’ -&gt; ‘depression’... I just don’t know where else to turn anymore. Please, any advice is welcome.

We're not planning on having a legitimate skatepark business but we would be letting our buddies come over and throw us a tenner to come in. Also throwing events like BBQs and parties which we would get people to pay in too.

Since it's not an actual business where parents would be bringing their kids, should I be worried about insurance and/or get planning permission to build it?

I am beginning to think everyone in my area is talking about how much of a failure I am. I am reading hidden meanings into Facebook posts of people I know. 

Should I get help? Has anyone been in a similar situation?",16Feb2020,1
436,"We talked for over two years and knew each other from high school. She knew that I like her but it never culminated into anything which was fine since she was still an amazing friend. 

She got a boyfriend who was a classmate of mine and suddenly stopped communicating with me. Out of a feeling of preserving my self respect I also chose not to text her anymore.

Three months ago out of the blue she texts me again commenting on how she's watching a show I recommended (BoJack Horseman). I see her text but I don't respond since I don't wish to be hurt. She complains to a common friend of ours saying that she wants to continue our friendship. My friend advices me to talk to her but I refuse still believing that I have to protect myself from getting hurt again.

A couple weeks ago we meet at our mutual friend's birthday party where we're all hammered. To the point that the birthday girl and I cry that we're going to be separated due to college.

I also end up talking to my former crush about some absurd nonsense regarding molemen. She messages me with a callback to this conversation the next day. I take my friends advice and finally message back and we have a nice chat for around an hour. She never messages back.

Now I feel even more used and idiotic that I did before. I have absolutely no clue what's happening. I can't understand why she's like this, why she wished to reconnect and then leave me hung and dry like this.

Could use some advice. Thanks.",16Feb2020,1
437,"I don't even know where to start. This is gonna be \*\*long\*\* and I'm sorry. 

 I was roleplaying with someone, and I have a strong suspicion and reasons to believe he might steal my content. 

We were just starting out, he reacted on some roleplay post of mine. So we started chatting and then we started setting up a small storybase and characters. We had quite a storybase and I really went into detail with my character. Looking back at it, he didn't. 

After setting up all that I had to go and messaged him I'd come back later, on which he replied to just send me whatever ideas I might have. Just now I tried that only to have my message replied to with a discord bot that it couldn't send. After research I found out he unfriended me and probaly blocked me too, because I can't friend him anymore. So right after me getting into detail with my character he did this and is not answering his Dm's on reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so horrible. I'm crying and shaking, and feel the stupiest ever. I really love writing and roleplaying and now I have to stop doing roleplays because that guy left me behind with absolutely nothing to stand on and with a fear of online people even worse than before. I feel this is all my fault, and I should've seen it trough, but I didn't. I know I'm way to naive and trusty and feel so stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to do something with writing, it's my passion. And now some internet person went running off with my favorite and only real, true character ever. I know I might sound crazy, but this character means \*a lot\* to me. She's kinda my alter ego I use for everything. Whenever I'm making up a new character, I start out with her and end with the new character. In every roleplay she's my character. She comes trough in a lot of stories I write. She is \*my\* character, my favorite, first ever, character and I feel so stupid for just giving her out to whoever knows who… 

I'm sorry to sound like this, and just brag on, but please, I need your help. How do I fix this? How do I know if that guy stole my stuff and character? And if he did, how do I proof it's mine? Is there \*anything\* I can do? Anything at all? Please, help me. It's deeply appreciated. I feel so stupid and guilty, anything that can help I will do. Can I contact someone? I don't have any stories out yet, not even someone interested in them, so I don't have professional help. Bless all of you.",16Feb2020,1
438,So last night I got black out drunk. I wear acrylic nails. I’ve woke up with out a nail and it hurts. Should I see a doctor?,16Feb2020,1
439,"Hey all!  I (20F) am a maintenance mechanic at a plastics factory.   It's a skilled technical job that requires me to adjust machine tooling, troubleshoot electrical, mechanical, and programmatical problems, think a lot, and occasionally bang my head against the wall.  It's a good job, and I enjoy doing the work (most of the time).  

However, I do NOT like some of my coworkers.  And, being the kind of person I have learned to be my whole life, I'm quite disappointed in myself for being irked.

I'm an introvert who enjoys spending quality time with my friends and family in quiet company, or sharing intellectual or interesting conversations with others.  I am not awkward - I'm okay with small talk and such - but I definitely prefer to use my words only when the topic feels important.  I am aware that this is a significant shortcoming, and that I should probably try to relate to people with ""boring"" conversation more often so they don't feel as though I dislike them, and so I do, most often, ignore my desire for quietude and push through - I don't wish to seem arrogant.  I always try my best to be a kind person who puts others at ease, but right now, I am not this person

I have some really lovely coworkers.  These are kind people that have become my close friends.  We share dinners and go to events together.

And I have some coworkers I can't stand to be in the same room with.  One of them, a machine operator, is a girl who NEVER stops talking.  Sometimes I like talkers, because they take the burden of conversation off me.  But when they don't take notice of when you're not in the mood to talk - for instance, when you've got your head and shoulders stuck in the underbelly of a machine, wrench in hand, grunting in frustration (a seemingly obvious ""don't talk to me"") - I don't like interacting with them.  And to make things worse, everything this person says seems to be frivolous nonsense manufactured to fill up airspace.  In fact, she'll literally repeat her previous words like an echo if she can't think of something new to say.  This girl talks *so much* that I can't even make a polite exit.  And she'll call me to perform maintenance on her machine for issues that are HER job to resolve - at least twice a day!  Most every day, I end up listening to her babble for at least a cumulative hour.  The sad part is, she's really a nice person, and I feel awful for disliking her.  

Another machine operator is a man who will not stop clowning around.  I don't think he's capable of being serious.  I've never heard him carry on an authentic conversation with ANYONE.  Again, he's a nice fellow, but I can't stand him.  (I'm not alone on this, either.  Most of my coworkers feel the same way.)  He's the person I end up snapping at the most - to leave me alone when I am working, to stop making intrusive jokes when I've got my mind on other things, to please do his job.  Again, I feel awful about this.

Two people are pathologically helpful - assemblers (entry level) both of them.  One of these people, trying to help, turned on a machine while my hand was still in it.  If I hadn't seen her doing it, I could have lost my hand.  The other tries to clean up after me - while I'm still working!  He also ""explains"" what's wrong with the machine while I'm occupied with the actual problem, guessing wildly wrong every time.  As a young woman maintenance mechanic (a 97% male profession), I get a lot of doubt, but these two fall past that into the ""dangerous"" category.  And yelling at them doesn't help.  I actually don't know how to ask these them to stay out of my way and keep me safe without seeming bossy.  Both of these people are older, and so seeming bossy is more liable to make them want to discipline me than listen to me (the woman who almost took off my hand actually HAS told me off me off before).

One guy has a very thick accent and talks a lot, almost enough to rival Chatterbox herself.  I do like him, but I don't understand most of what he says.  When I'm already frustrated or tired, this usually makes me grumpier, and I sometimes, to my shame, snap at him.  I don't want to be like that.

Some days, I just want to hide in my office until I get called, then hide my face until I reach the machine so nobody talks to me (unless I'm working on a machine someone normal is running).  I'm too introverted for this stuff.

But even though I know I'm exhausting myself for these people (the nice ones), I can't stop.  They're good people and don't deserve my ire.  So I just keep interacting with them in a way that is guaranteed to ensure minimum hurt feelings.  I joke with the clowner even when I'm not in the mood.  I listen to the chatterbox even when I'd rather listen to kidzbop.  I try my best to understand the poor heavily accented guy's stories, even when I'm super busy.  But a small part of me also feels irked at these people on a deeper level - surely they can see that I'm tired and not in the mood for silliness and chatter?  Surely they can pick a better time?  I feel slightly disrespected.  But mostly, I feel guilty - because I'm allowing myself to become a monster when I give into my frustration and snap at them.

I've never had to force myself to talk to people I dislike before.  How do I strike a balance between kindness and meeting my own needs?  I'm doing a really poor job.

And finally, there are ALLLL the old, grody men who try to hit on me.  I guess a woman maintenance mechanic is a novelty to them, so I draw their attention.  Yes, I'm a healthy weight and fairly attractive, but I'm really modest.  However, even though I button all three polo buttons to the neck, wear long jeans and steel toes at all times, spread dirty grease and metal shavings on my face like makeup (accidentally, of course), wear my hair in the least sexy way I can, and talk about my boyfriend all the time, I STILL draw the attention of weirdos.  One old man coworker openly hit on me through Facebook - to which I replied ""I'm not cool with this.""  He blocked ME afterwards!  (That mystifies me.)  I made the mistake of talking about what I do for exercise in front of another old guy, and he proceeded to grill me on what I wear during my workouts (""Do you show skin?  No?  Long clothes?  You're very modest, eh?"").  I reported one man for groping me (which was, thankfully, dealt with well).  These dudes don't care how I feel about their actions - they're just using me to get off.  It bothers me.  I feel paranoid whenever I'm around these people, like they're watching me.  I don't like being watched.

But most of the dudes that hit on me are generally well-liked in the workplace and seem to harass only me and maybe one or two other young women.  I want them to stop, but apparently, being a tough, swearing, grease-wearing maintenance woman isn't going to do it.  Heck, maybe it's even making it worse.  How on earth can I get these harassers to stop watching my butt or asking about my menstrual cycle?  I'm tired of it.  Minor harrassment without touching isn't going to be taken seriously by management - believe me, I've tried!

Thank you to everyone who's read my book - I appreciate your listening ear, even if you don't comment.  And I seriously appreciate anyone who'd be willing to give advice - especially on how to manage my frustration/not be rude to good people!

TL;DR I'm an introvert who works with a lot of boisterous characters and gets really frustrated at some of them.  Also, lots of skanky old coworkers hit on me.  Pls grant my young, grumpy self advice on frustration management/creep repellent.  Thanks!",16Feb2020,1
440,"So basically tonight I took adderall for the first time, like 40 mg and I had the night of my life like at first before the Adderall kicked in I was standing in the corner being awkward and unsure what to say to my friend then by the end of the night I was in the middle of the crowd dancing with a cute boy and everything felt so natural

I'm concerned about how much I enjoyed it, I think it can genuinely benefit me if used extremely sparingly as a social tool because unlike alcohol i actually have positive interactions with people, like me and my friend are much closer now thanks to it but at the same time I don't want to become a jaded fucking Adderall addict that needs like five pills to get a slight buzz. I'm content with the dosage and don't feel the urge to get a stronger high but I'm worried about the frequency i do it at, my friend is my only source and she's very cautious and had to cut me off last night, were thinking maybe once a week at parties if I feel very confident that nothing weirds happening but it might be best to do it like every other week or even once a month. 

Basically my question is how do i avoid this becoming more than just an occasional fun night and how far i should space it and any other relevant advice, thank you so much",16Feb2020,1
444,"Okay so I have never written anything this serious on here before, but I really would like an outsiders opinion. I just want to make it clear first that 99% of the time I love my job and enjoy it. There is just some times, mainly in the past few weeks that have been...not so fun. 

1. So I work in an office, front of house essentially so I answer the phones/ do the mail/ help out with other things etc. There is also three other people in the office with me. I’ll just name them A, B and C. A few weeks ago, the manager of the whole office decided that we would move things around, so we didn’t have our backs to people coming in to the office, which I agree with. The only thing about this is I have my back to everyone and feel rather isolated. That, and whenever a new person comes in and comments on it, A laughs and goes “yeah!! That’s because OP is always on YouTube and not working Lmao!!!” Which was funny the first time, but this has happened like, 10 times now and I’m getting a little embarrassed.
2. I should also mention that I have been diagnosed with social anxiety and ptsd, thanks to some other things that have happened in my past. Everyone in the office is aware of this, but yet A still makes comments of, “Oh OP you are so easy to rile up! That’s why I do it it’s just so much fun!” Like...I literally have anxiety this is not fun for me.
3. The third thing that has happened recently was A and B told me that C (front office manager not to be mistaken with the over all manager) doesn’t yell or treat me as bad as she did them when they were new to the office. Which isn’t my fault? Anyway, when A had her one to one with C she literally told her that she didn’t like this, so I ended up being picked on for the rest of the week.
4. Okay so finally, and this hasn’t been confirmed so I don’t know but it was Valentine’s Day on Friday, and I just want to make everyone aware that I have never received a genuine Valentine’s Day card. Ever. They have always been jokes from bullies growing up in a small town. Anyway, as part of my job I have to check the post box, but I hadn’t done it that morning until A said, “OP, check the post box, I’m waiting for something.” At first I didn’t think anything of it, but when I checked there was a v-day card for me in there, not posted so it was clearly someone from work. It wasn’t until I told my mom later that she said it could have been them, since they wanted me to check the box so early. What do you guys think?

I really don’t know if this qualifies as work place bullying, I just needed a place to get it off my chest, so...here you go!",16Feb2020,1

447,"So this happened this weekend. To kinda set the scene; Co-workers drinking in town. Half the people went home. Something kicked off, and a couple of the seven of us left got kicked out. What basically happened was a shit show of me trying to wrangle them away from the dudes they were trying to fight and me getting so frustrated I was crying and ended up having a drunken panic attack.
 ie: I'm in a very emotional state following this event.

One of the co-workers not in the fighting stuck around while some strangers helped me calm down. At this point my phone was dead and a taxi would've been about $150 to my place so we figured I could crash at his.
Got there and went to bed as it was now around 4:30am. He started spooning me sometime after this, which was fine because I was still quite upset.
This turned into getting handsy which I said no to several times. He ended up giving up for a bit and persisting after about ten minutes. Me being so tired and feeling trapped said sure. Cue the awful feeling many women will know of saying yes to try and get away from the situation quicker. And we had sex. 

I know this is going to be seen poorly due to the excessive questioning by him until I gave the desired answer. But I'm not here for advice on reporting him or anything. I would just like to know if I should discuss with him that it was inappropriate, seeing as I still have to work with him everyday I don't want to make a shitty work relationship, but I do think he should improve his actions in future. Also I don't know how receptive he will be/what experience he has with sex to understand what I'm saying. Especially with a little bit of language barrier (I'm the whitest female and he's Indian)
Is it my responsibility to have this conversation or not? 

Sorry for the lack of clarity. Still emotional from dealing with boys and their drunk fights

449,"I never thought I'd ever be in the situation I am finding myself in now. I am a male in my 30's and I am bisexual (although not out to anyone) myself and I still live at home.

My parents have been married 37 years and as far as I knew they were happy, they do lead separate lives most of the time because their interests don't really match but it's never been an issue that I knew of. I also never had any idea that my dad may be attracted to men.

Anyway, my parents popped out about an hour ago and I needed to get some information off of my Dad's laptop, so I logged on (has has no password) and his e-mail account was still open from an e-mail address I did not know he had.

There were only two emails sitting in the inbox both from another married man and they were talking about meeting up. The e-mails are from the last couple of days up til this morning talking about when they are free and even one where my dad invited this guy to our house while my mum was out, but she returned home so scuppered the plans.

There's also a message where my dad offers to pick this guy up 'where he did before' so I know they have at least met in person once and he's going to use the excuse of going to the gym which recently rejoined.

I've known my dad look at (what I assumed was straight) porn etc which was fine, I get that, I do it too... but this is on another level.

I have my own issues in my life (obviously being in the closet and also financial which is why I still live at home) that I've been attempting to deal with and this is just too much. How do I deal with this? I don't have anyone to confide in without it getting out and hurting someone but I can't keep this bottled up with everything else in my life like I am now.

I have no sexual feelings towards him, I think I’m just very attracted to his intelligence and the way he carries himself.

It's honestly been a long time issue, where my body will seize up, I'll feel ill and a cold sweat appears all over me at the mere mention of sexual intimacy. The problem is that I have no issue being affectionate towards people, though hugs are kind of pushing it. I'm not really all that shy with my emotions, nor do I try to hide them away, but I just can't bring myself to be intimate with someone.

It's actually cost me two relationships, where I've been told I ""haven't been giving them the attention they needed"".

As far as I'm aware it's not some past relation ship trauma, seeing as I've only been in two, and even in my first relationship, I was shaking at the proposition. I know that I'm not asexual, but the thought of the act still makes me feel like I'm sinking through the floor.

458,"One of my best friends' father commit suicide back in October and is experiencing complex grief due to the fact their dad was both their abuser (verbally and emotionally) and their favorite person. My friend was actually temporarily staying at an apartment to get away from their dad when they got The Call. Now that their dad is gone, they only see him through rose-tinted glasses and never even mention all of the abuse they endured. As you can imagine, it's sometimes hard to endure hearing how great of a dad he was. 

My friend was severely depressed to begin with and now with the added trauma of their dad's death, they're constantly in pain and suffering. Here's where I come in. I'm one of their main support people through this. Well at least I try to be. When my friend reaches out, it's usually them talking about how badly they wish they were dead. Aside from regular talk therapy, they aren't getting much professional help. Me, our friend group, plus even their own therapist suggested inpatient care or at least an intensive outpatient program but they won't budge. There's always a ready excuse (lack of money, work responsibilities, insurance issues, they don't drive, the place has to be trans inclusive, etc). Sometimes they even get passive aggressive and nasty when we suggest professional help or at least attending a support group. They always go back to ""You don't know what I'm going through and I'm reacting like anyone else in my situation would."" Which is valid but they completely shut down any advice and aren't cutting us a break. 
It has lead to a lot of us feeling resentful. They mention suicide so often, my friends and I have become immune to it. I flinch when I get a text from them, praying it's good news, or a meme, or anything lighthearted. When they reach out for someone to come over or talk on the phone, I either dreadfully volunteer or pretend I didn't see the text. I also have my own shit I'm going through with severe depression and all of my friends have their own lives so we can't always drop everything for them. 

The other night, my friend made a post on social media suggesting they're unloved and have nobody there for them. They make posts like these so often and it hurts everyone because we try and try to help but because we're not physically there or reaching out on our own, our friend feels absolutely alone. That night they relapsed on pills and all I can think of is how I saw the post but chose to pretend I didn't see it. I've been sick to my stomach since and I cannot shake the guilt. I'm always worried I'll wake up and they'll be gone and it will be all my fault. I just don't know how to help someone who won't actively put in the work to get better and work through their trauma.

459,"Greetings,

I’m facing a new found dilemma which, I suspect, stemmed from the schizophrenic episodes lasting the better part of the past five years. A notion in which my entire brain seemed to had gone through a rewiring process. Now, my rudimentary responsibilities are in order. I’m on an extensive diet and hygiene is in check. Everything else is an anomaly. Down to what shirt I aught to wear as if my current mental composition has an adult like awareness and a toddler like ability to gauge, measure, evaluate or make decisions. It took a ton of unassisted work to get to here, primarily by using conversation, logic and attempting to surround myself within empathetic and supportive environments (this was the hard part) Still, I’m struggling with the next layer of basics. In example, when asking self in regards to the bigger picture partaking to the remainder of my life the answer is, the first thing to pop into my mind, “I don’t know.” (I have no wishes) Its so counter productive, wasteful and disheartening plus I don’t at all feel as if I’m somehow limited or “out of the game,” so to say or at least not anymore. So, what I’m really asking or what I think I’m asking is if there is a known process for reestablishing values because I don’t seem to have any beyond the scope of feeding and cleaning myself. Likewise, everything external of me sounds super nice and I’m proud and happy for others whom are on track to achieve their goals or whatever it may be in comparison to myself where, well, I don’t know.

467,So my SO has had a terrible experience with previous relationships and has some issues with people still having some kind of emotional control. Recently they've been confronted because they've got a platonic cg (they're a little and aren't comfortable enough to go into space with me)and the cg's girlfriend had a problem with them calling the cg 'daddy' despite the cg telling them to call them daddy but all the blame was put on my SO. Anyways were talking after and they feel like they're world just collapsed because of everything that happened (there's too much to go over in this) and I've not had to deal with this before and I don't know what to say or do and I felt bad because I didn't do anything. I really want to help when they're like that but I'm just not used to helping/comforting people when I'm not there in person. Any kind of advice would be great help. Thanks,16Feb2020,1

We fought and argued all because she thinks i am ""being manipulated by this girl"". Everything I say to her and everything I do to please her is just not enough and she will never let me alone enjoying my best friend's company.

I’m Single male, age 27  with very few friends and I am estranged from my family. 
Working crappy hours and trying to keep up to date with my own bills as well as bills my ex left in my name. 
I’m from the UK and only entitled to 3 food banks per 12 months which I’ve already used up, asked for help via Facebook with no look and also tried my local council, Friday just gone. I have very little food left and don’t get paid till the end of the month.  All of this is still new to me as I was with my ex for close to 10 years before she left and she dealt with the money side of things. So I’m struggling quite a bit. I’ve seeked help with budgeting but that doesn’t help me with my lack of food now. I have roughly £34 left to my name until payday which I will need for gas for my car to get to and from work. 
I was advised to try reddit however, after looking at the requirements for food pantry, I do not have enough karma or account age as I’ve just made this up now. 
I’m happy to give anyone my Facebook or number to chat too if anyone can help or advise. 
I’m not necessarily asking for money, but maybe someone has some gift cards they don’t use that they are willing to donate? Or if I set up a wish list of some sort? 
Anything would be greatly appreciated and can pay back as and when. My pay day is the last work day of every month.

471,"Hi,

I am an incel, but I don't want to be. I've known I was an incel (at least the concept, if not the exact term) for almost ten years now, and have kind of accepted it. However, I never really understood exactly what that means for someone, and now I want to stop being one.

The big turning point was that Inceltine meetup, or more accurately the response to that meetup. The top comment on one of the posts, with over 2000 upvotes, was that the people obviously had to have dogshit personalities. I don't know why that comment in particular cut through my bullshit, but it did. 

Anyways, enough backstory, I want to know how to stop being an incel. And no, I already know that having sex is not going to be the right way. I already feel bad enough when I accidentally cut someone off, I don't think I would even be able to go through a rape by deception.",16Feb2020,1

That bummed me out quite a bit, since two times now I asked if we could share the 5:30-2 shifts since I want them too, and she pulls this shit of ONLY putting the other person on that shift, and giving me her days off.

473,"I used to love my job. Enjoyed going in every day, learning something new. Id volunteer to take on more work and shifts (cause gotta pay those student loans!) but that all changed recently.

Sixish months ago a new employee was hired. She's older always has to be right. Thinks she's the best thing ever and can do no wrong. The thing is she screws up all the time, causes so much drama, will tell four different people four different stories so you never know what the truth it. I get it everyone lies at some point, but personally my lies are generally ""of course I love your cooking, I'd love to try that again"" not things that effect our customers and how much the other employees are making!

Recently she complained about another employee and got him fired. It was a huge deal as he'd been there for a long time. Was well liked. The issue is that even though she was in the wrong in the situation she was kept because she threatens to sue everyone.

Here's the issue, I can't actually go to work now without massive anxiety about her trying to get me fired. I'm protected in my job to an extent just because of how much I do and that firing me would cause a huge backup of a lot of work and cause a lot of people to pick up a LOT of extra work. But we thought the other employee was secure in his job too so now I'm not sure.

She said something yesterday to another employee about me not doing my job and pretty much kinda painting it like I'm now a target. (she's an idiot for saying all of this within ten feet of the office I'm in). I'm pretty sure my only sin is that I'm close to the person who was fired.

I don't know how to handle this. I hate office politics. I generally ignore them. I've talked to another coworker about it somewhat and she told me that for what im being trained to do theyd be screwing themselves to fire me.

The date went well as in my perspective and I did ask her again when we were back at the hotel the same evening. The problem was she said yes at that night but the next morning she got up n started crying and saying she wasn't ready for this and kept crying until I left the station to go back to my place. The reason she told me was because she is indecisive and still not over her ex ( her first relationship n they broke up 2 yrs ago) and would take him back if she got a chance even though she know it's stupid. She also tried to convince that's she isn't worthy for me and I deserve better. But TBH I know she's the right one but I don't really know what to do?

A month or two ago, I started DMing her on Instagram, because I related to some of the stories she would post. She would do the same from time to time. Started snap chatting a little bit... When I got hammered, I asked for her number (lol I know, so brave). 

I didn’t text her too much but soon, our messaging got more personal and friendly. I was developing SOME feelings. We would talk almost everyday, not EVERY second but a message here and there, DM or Snapchat whatever it be. 

I tried initiating a hangout between me and her but she works on the days I am off so it was a bit hard. I understood why she didn’t want to hangout at night after a long shift &amp; another one to come the next morning. A few weeks ago, I get hammered lol I call her on my way home, she PICKS UP! We talked for about 2 hours... When I tell you how happy this made me lol Felt like a middle school boy. (I think that is where I just like fell for her... I know. I was very vulnerable, coming off a VERY long term relationship)

Ever since then... I’m just trying hard to hangout with her. She always seems to have an “excuse” (I put that in quotes because who knows, maybe they are valid but they suck on my end lol) on why she can’t hangout that night. She always reassures me that it’s not because she doesn’t want to hangout with me and she’s just busy and got things going on right now. I want to be the respectful man and agree &amp; tell her it’s okay... because it is. 

But at this point I am losing a lot of hope. Recently we planned on hanging out... she couldn’t.. she told me “tomorrow”... even saying things like, she would “like that” when I asked if I could see her the next day... next day comes... can’t because of some family stuff. Remind you.. it’s day after valentines &amp; I even got her something little just as a friendly gesture. 

Am I going crazy? Am I reading too much into little signs and things she’s saying? I want to back off but lord, I want to hang out with her lol We are very different... I am a super outgoing guy who is not afraid to show who I am most of the time; she is definitely more on the reserved side. I just need some opinions or tips on how I should pursue this.. or to just stop lol

478,"Hello there (general kenobi),

I'll keep it short: I'm a 21 year old guy and I recently moved to a new city to pursue my education. I bought a place with my girlfriend of 3 years, who I'm really close with. We now live about 2 hours away from the city where we grew up.  


Back when we used to live in our old city, I was part of a close group of friends, who all met each other through school/part-time jobs. We used to talk 24/7 through groupchats and videogames. The last couple of months, even before we moved, things started to change a bit. We all used to play video games together and smoke weed together for fun, but some of the guys started to use **way** more than the rest of us, which caused some friction, because well, someone's who's stoned out of their mind is not that fun to hang out with. 

We still got along for the most part but for some of the guys, weed wasn't enough anymore and started to use more serious substances. Drugs are fine, but they got **seriously** addicted and started endangering themselves by even driving while heavily under the influence. 

The drugs caused a divide, which kept getting bigger and bigger until we sort of- just stopped talking like we used to do. Sometimes some of them throw parties to which the non-users aren't even invited to anymore!

  
This weekend we had a party to which everyone was invited, and it was the first party I could attend after moving away. For the entire night though, I couldn't shake this lonely feeling. Some of the friends (even the non-users) with whom I grew up and had once entrusted with my every thought, feeling and weakness felt like total strangers, who seemed to have no interest in talking to me. The host of the party was really happy I was there, but most part of the night I just felt sad and wanted to go home.

As I'm writing this I feel like a total shithead who doesn't know how to do social interaction and I somehow feel it's my fault we grew apart - which i **know** is not the case, I just don't know why it wouldn't be.   
How did some of you guys handle this sort of thing? Should I try to reconnect more even if it means I have to momentarily give up some of the personal growth I've made in going to a new city and going to university?

Thanks for reading this, I'm super interested in what you think!

This means literally nothing to me, but I have been told by my mom on several occasions that I couldn’t date a black guy because my family would disapprove way too much. I don’t want to believe my dad is racist, but he and his parents have some pretty clear and harmful prejudices and ideals. I’ve never even brought up dating a black guy but I know they’d be furious. I’ve considered dating him and confronting their feelings and trying to work it through with them, because my dad and his parents are good people. They are compassionate people, this is just a terrible flaw of theirs. But it feels selfish to do so because I’m roping this guy into an entire ordeal and civil rights battle simply because he wants to date me. We’re so young and I hate to put him through this and make him face such bigotry. So I stopped talking to him. I didn’t even want him to know my family felt this way, partly because I’m very embarrassed but also because I don’t want him to have the fact that there are people who are against him simply because he’s black- on his conscience.

483,"So my roommate got a kitten about 3 months ago. I already have a cat who me and my brother have been taking care of for about 7 years. I love my cat, and regularly clean his litter box/feed him/play with him etc. Since my roommate has gotten his kitten, he's cleaned the litter box about 5 times. I made a list of days to clean the litter box to hold him accountable in mid January: one day me, one day my brother, next day my roommate. He's missed his day 5 times in a row now. Here's the kicker.


She's not spayed. She has her shots from the previous owner (his girlfriend), but I don't have the papers to prove it. When I asked her to bring them over, she left me on read. 

I have to get her spayed before she sprays/bleeds everywhere. Since he doesn't let her in his room (she scratches his canvases), this spray/blood is either gonna be in my room or in the kitchen. 

The kitten broke my brothers 400 dollar speakers and my roommate left him on read when my brother asked him to pay for it. I know he's not gonna pay the ~200 fee to get her spayed, 300 if I have to get her shots again. 


What the fuck do I do about this? He's on the lease until November, so I can't kick him out. He hasn't done chores in about 2 months and gets pissy when we tell him to pay for her food/litter.  My cat and his cat are friends now and my cat seems a lot happier since having a buddy. I dont have the heart to leave the kittens responsibilities to him, because I know that he will not take care of her given the evidence of the last few months. I don't know what to do. I'm gonna have to pay to get her spayed on my own money and time, and then give him the bill, but evidence has shown he's likely not gonna pay for it.

(this is a throwaway account because my friend knows my real username)

Some background info:

I (m23) first met the friend (f24) when we were both freshmen in college together. When we met I was in an extremely abusive relationship which lasted until early our sophomore year and after getting out of it me and this friend became pretty inseparable. After a few months I realized I really liked her but I wasn’t in a good mental space after being emotionally abused by my ex for such a long time so I decided I’d wait until I was in a better headspace before telling her. 

I decided to leave school (I did get my associates degree so I wasn’t a full dropout) after sophomore year in 2016 because of depression anxiety and stress and lost touch with her for a while. We caught up a couple times  but it was always with a group of our friends and I never got the chance to talk to her one to one. 

When we were finally able to catch up just the two of us a few months ago I was ready to tell her how I felt but before I could she mentioned she had just started dating someone. We’ve met up a few times since I found out and I still want to tell her how I feel but I don’t want to mess with our relationship or the one she has with her boyfriend. I love being around her and it’s making me miserable keeping my feelings to myself. 

About a week ago I was visiting her again so we could see A movie and catch up. After the movie we went back to her apartment that she shares with her boyfriend (who was out of town for a family thing) ordered some takeout and started watching Netflix. After a while she cuddled up with me and had me stroke her hair. It continued until she was sitting on my lap and she had put my hands up her shirt (rubbing her stomach and feeling her tits) and now I’m confused. 

Should I let her know how I feel? She’s one of my closest (and very few) friends and I’ve liked her since before I dropped out of school and I don’t want to lose her as a friend but I feel awful not telling her how I feel.",16Feb2020,1

I'm currently back in community college for the third time after dropping out twice. I spent a year working in retail and at a nonprofit. I wanted to go back to get an education because I felt becoming mundane and unfulfilling. I needed something more and not just dead ends.

My only problem is that I'm passionate about everything. I can't seem to stick to one thing. I blame that on me getting a second chance at life after spiraling down into a mess of depression and anxiety. I'm slowly getting better now and enjoying my thirst for life. Yet, here I am scratching my head and worrying about careers.

I know for sure that I hated sales when I did retail. I'm not a salesperson at all. But there are a lot of other things that I'm passionate about. I love learning about the brain, diving deep into history, getting philosophical about different religions, providing help for those who need it the most, creating sketch comedy to give my audience a good laugh, making speeches and voicing my opinions, daydreaming about my ideal nonprofit, learning three different languages, etc. It's hard to find that dream job that most people have because you're too indecisive and ambitious to just take a breather and see the big picture.

I'm pretty much stuck and I'm worried I will be forever. I'm gonna be at a point where I'm gonna major in something that's ""safe"" and be in a career that makes me unhappy.

496,"Hello everyone!

In August of last year I left a government IT job paying about 38k a year to go to nursing school. The government job had good benefits, an 8-4 Mon-Fri schedule, and a ton of holidays off. I loved the co-workers and I enjoyed the work there. I made enough money to support myself and pay my bills at this job, but advancement and pay raises are slow there. 

 I left the job to pursue nursing as nurses in my area start at around 60k per year. I am in my second of four semesters in the RN program and currently work in the emergency room at a hospital doing clerical work. I am now living the life of many healthcare workers with no holidays off, working some night shifts, and working every other weekend. Honestly, I miss my old comfy job. I hate working weekends and I miss spending time with my family and friends. Sticking with nursing/healthcare would likely mean that I have to work 12 hour shifts every other Saturday and Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have been told by someone at my old job that there will be several positions opening up in my old department within the next few months and that I am welcome to re-apply. Would I be foolish to drop out of my nursing program that I am doing well in if I am offered one of these positions? The difference in pay between 38k at my old job and the 60k I would make as a registered nurse is significant. But honestly, I am not handling the weekend and night work as well as I thought I could. I'm starting to think that the extra money just isn't worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Left old job I liked because I only made 38k a year with very slow pay raises/advancement so that I could go to nursing school as nurses around here start out at about 60k year. Starting to realize that the healthcare schedule of working holidays/nights/weekends may not be right for me and that the extra money may not be worth it. Was told that new positions at my old job are opening up soon and that I am welcome to apply. Would I be foolish to drop out of nursing school if I am offered one of these positions?",16Feb2020,1

Per her email, [...]”Respecting her personal space, I will not be entering her bedroom to assess damages until the conclusion of the lease”. Does she even need to enter my room to “assess damages” when I will be the one responsible for damages to my living space. It’s different if there is damages to the common area but this is my own personal space and she will not be contributing to whatever “damages” there may be.",16Feb2020,1

500,"I've been having driving lessons with an instructor now for close to 30 hours. He regularly makes comments that make me feel uncomfortable, mainly him talking about women he's dating online and things. Often I feel like a big chunk of the lesson is wasted because he'll start talking about things not related to the driving lessons (Mainly the various women he's chatting to online) while we're parked and I'll be sat waiting for him to finish so I can continue driving.

In my last lesson a trans woman crossed the road in front of the car and he started making comments calling her a bloke and a tranny. I'm transsexual myself, but ""pass"" well and I found those comments really rude so I decided to tell him that I'm transsexual and he quickly tried to backtrack on the things he'd said. I think everyone is entitled to their own opinions regardless of how I or anyone else feels about them, but it does make me feel uncomfortable continuing lessons with him knowing his opinions about people like myself.

Once I'd told him that I was transsexual he decided to share a story with me about him once dating a transsexual woman but didn't know until he had his hand down her trousers. 

A couple of weeks prior to this lesson he was telling me about a female student who had stopped having lessons with him and mentioned to me that the car she had bought for when she passes was no longer outside her house when he'd driven past. I'm sure he probably had a reason to be driving past and just noticed it but it makes it sound a bit stalkerish.

I'm thinking of changing driving instructor but I do feel a bit nervous, especially considering his comments about the previous student of his. The last thing I want is him to start driving past my house. I do often get a bit of a weird vibe about him so it worries me a little.

I also have some more hours prepaid with him, so I'm not sure if I should at least finish them first or change straight away.

Would love if anyone could give me some advice. Thank you",16Feb2020,1
501,"I love doing whatever I want with my free time. I love eating whatever I want to eat for dinner, I love spending the weekend however I want to spend it, I love decorating my bedroom however I want to decorate it, I love spending money however I want to spend it, and so on. This all works out perfectly since I am single.

This weekend, I rented an Airbnb in LA, all by myself. I spent a few days there just drinking smoothies on the beach (it was cold but I can take it), and I loved it. I might stay another day, IF I WANT TO. I absolutely love this freedom.

I have friends whom I absolutely love and I hang out with them sometimes. My friends and I have enough in common that what we do together is usually fun for all of us, though friends have to make compromises. Nevertheless, being friends with someone does not mean you have to speak with them every single day, etc. It's not as big a commitment as a relationship is.

The only time I feel you're *required* to drop everything and be there for your friends is when they're going through tough times. That's the main point of friendship, in my opinion. It's not just to have good times together, but also to be there for each other in times of need.

In all other events, it's ok to not always spend a lot of time with your friends. One of my best friends Michaela has always there for me and I have always been there for her in times of need. We only talk to each other about four days a week. If we're really busy, we might even go a week or two without talking. That doesn't hurt the friendship because we both know we'd drop anything for each other if we needed to.

I could do that in a friendship, but not in a relationship.

I don't want to be single forever. I want someone to have a close intimate relationship with. I lament how I couldn't have as much space as I enjoy now, in a relationship. At least I never have in a relationship I've been in. Do you have any advice?",16Feb2020,1

I'm also very passionate about robotics as I am on my school's robotics team and I have done it ever since middle school. Ever since the start of the year, I have not been performing well in physics at all this year because of the way the material is being taught so I decided to self study everything. I've also had a hard time at robotics because of two things - one of them is getting the worst grades of my life in the subject I actually care about which led to me being cut from the travel team. Also, I am the only girl who programs the robot, but I feel that the guys are doing everything by themselves and I am too afraid to speak up for myself. I keep telling my parents I don't want to go there and they always ask me if there's something wrong or if someone did something and I always say that I have to study for physics (which I do), but I don't want to involve them into more of my problems because they have helped me so much to get me in my position. I feel as if I want to quit robotics because of the people I have to ""work"" with and to raise my grades in physics, but at the same time, I am nothing without robotics.

507,"My grandpa died several years ago and since then my grandma has lived with us. They had a bunch of kids, and a few of them live on the other side of the country so we don’t see them often. However two of her kids weren’t the most productive in their youth so they aren’t making a lot of money and often (by often I mean up to 3 times a day, probably a good 5-10x a week) they ask her to send them money, which I send through Cashapp and she usually pays me back with a little extra ($5 or $10) within the next few days if not the same day. (Idk if they pay her back and I’m not getting into all that).

But one of her kids apparently missed their rent of $600, and it’s getting to that point where I really don’t want to “condone” this kind of stuff.

508,"Okay, I’m a sophomore in high school ( 16 F) and I’ve known my (possibly???) toxic friend for about 5 months. When I met her, I instantly got a bad feeling and I had heard that she liked to guilt others but I sort of got roped in to hanging out with her because she’s in my P.E class and also sits at my lunch table. Now just a quick disclaimer: this post contains sexual harassment and SH. 
I’ve noticed that TF likes to wear shorts to school that show the cuts on her legs which I find weird, she also does this knowing that 90% of my friend group struggles with depression and has cut before and probably understands that this can be a trigger, but I think that she likes the attention. One time, I asked her about it, and she responded with “ well, my depression is worse than yours.” I didn’t confront her or anything, but I thought that was a little messed up of her to say. Also, one of the major things that she does  is make comments on my body and the bodies of my friends and touch us when we tell her to stop. She constantly comments on the size of our waists, our bra sizes etc and we find that pretty uncomfortable. I also find it very important to add that she had groped one of my friends before. About a month ago she also pinned me against  locker room wall for like a solid minute.  There are many more examples of this, but she’s done way too much to name. 

She also makes everything about her constantly, like for example, when one of my friends was talking about her abusive  parents, tf pulled a “ well, at least you know your parents” card, I was shocked that she said that and my friend was very obliviously hurt, but Tf said nothing else. You see, TF hates her adoptive parents and loves to talk about how she dislikes them even though she admits that they are good parents, she even said that if she killed herself they wouldn’t care because they “aren’t her real parents” That’s a really gross and disturbing mentality to have for obvious reasons. Finally TF enjoys to insult me, she has called me stupid almost daily ( and not in a joking way), she calls me ugly and then calls me pretty five minutes later, and has told me that I’ll never get a girlfriend several times. I’m getting really sick of this.

My friend group is disgusted by her behavior and we have agreed as a whole that she is mostly likely toxic and that we don’t want to hang around her. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like she’s having a negative impact on my life. 

I’m posting this for advice on how to deal with this current situation and also confirmation if she is toxic.

519,"The title pretty much expresses my concern, but I'll go into further detail here. I'm a freshman in college, and during the fall break, I made a solid friend group. Sure, as the months went on, we broke off into smaller groups as we found out who we were going to be close with or not. However, there was no real big divide, and I still did care a lot for these people. We all exchanged gifts over winter break, so I decided I wanted to do something for them when I got back in the spring semester.

I bought these decent-sized letters from a craft store and spent my time painting something that I thought really represented each of my nine friends. It took a lot of frustration, tears, and re-paints to get exactly what I had wanted on each. When I finally was finished with them, it was already a week or so back into the spring semester and I was starting to prepare to send them off... but things felt weird, different than last semester.

We had broken into smaller ""best friend"" groups over the last few months - but we usually hung around off/on around the lounge on our floor (we all lived in the same building). I had become close to my best friend, to the point that we were seen as each other's ""other halves"" by multiple people around campus. Everyone else broke into smaller groups of 2/3 and we would eat meals most of the time with our preferred people, but meet up sometimes to eat all together. Pretty normal stuff.

All up until they started trying to ghost my best friend. They would ignore her texts, walk right by when she'd smile / say hi. Don't get me wrong - not all of them did this. Some were the same as usual, chatting with her, but two friends in particular started to COMPLETELY ignore her presence. Which wasn't really that easy when they were all living on the same floor in the same building at a small university. 

After a lot of pain, prodding, and lack of communication, the two girls in our friend group said that my best friend was toxic, and they were cutting her out of their lives. When asked about what my friend did wrong, they refused to answer. They reassured me they had no issue with me, but expressed no strong desire to be super close either. This was okay, I was already hurt enough because their lack of communication was seriously shitty, and I didn't know if I wanted to be super close to them either. My best friend has been bottled up in her room, and decided she was going to do them a favor and respect their wishes - leaving whenever they came into a shared space.

When my other friends are around my best friend, everyone gets along great- but the second the other two enter the room, the other friends go silent - afraid of stirring the pot - and my best friend leaves quickly. 

It hurts watching my best friend go through this, but what hurts even more - is that after talking with my group, only one girl out of nine genuinely thinks my best friend is toxic, but they all don't want to cause any fuss so they stay out of it. The second girl who confronted my best friend was just sticking up for HER best friend, the one who believed mine was toxic. This has caused a lot of frustration for me, because I felt like this whole situation was ridiculous. If this one girl didn't want to be friends with my best friend anymore, she should have confronted her about it. My best friend sent her a text, asking her to be honest, and she just left the message on read. She only came clean about it when I got an RA involved because I had no idea what was going on because there was no communication. 

Now things are a mess, and even though theoretically I don't have an issue with anyone in the friend group, I'm hesitant to give them their presents. They hurt me a lot, and someone I loved a lot, by not communicating their feelings. Then, they go on as if nothing happened and I'm not entirely sure I want to associate with people who can't communicate. It's just killing me looking at the letters I spent so much time on, and knowing that I'm either going to have to keep them, or give them to people who have caused so much pain and confusion is starting to really get me down.

     We live a little under an hour away from her (which is still a sore spot for her, we moved on my in laws land because they offered for us to live for FREE on there land, my husband had gotten laid off so it was best for us financially) and she is constantly wanting to have my daughter spend the night every other weekend. Which at first was nice to get a break but but driving out there to drop and pick up my daughter was just too much (and as selfish as it sounds I wanted my daughter with me). So, after throwing a long fit about me telling her I can’t drive out there as much, she will come and pick up my daughter (and complain about the drive). I ended up getting a promotion at my job, my husband was having a hard time finding a job (he is a disabled vet) so we decided he could be stay at home dad for a while. Which is great he is so good with her! But she says he would be happier with a job. I also worry that she or my dad will make comments about my husband in front of my daughter, And I don’t want that planted into her head because my husband is nothing like they picture him. He works hard, takes care of our daughter and our house.

527,"This doesn't happen often, but sometimes I have these moments where I just get caught in a mental loop or chain of thoughts that I can't break out of. It's hard to describe what this feeling is like, but basically it's like one thought associated with another thought, associated with another, over and over in super rapid succession. For example, ""this person was really rude to me,"" ""everyone's been rude to me,"" ""I hate this town,"" ""I wonder if I should even stay here for the long term,"" ""speaking of which, do my current friends even like me,"" ""have I ever felt truly at home here,"" ""what if these people are just pretending to like me,"" and so on. It's weird because I fully realize it's happening and I try to stop, but the thoughts are moving so fast and they're so vivid that I can't stop. When it happens, I usually get really stressed and, especially if I'm around a lot of people, I immediately start disliking everyone around me and want to leave.

I've wondered for a while if this is a panic or anxiety attack, but as far as I can tell I'm still able to positively interact with the people around me, though it is extremely uncomfortable.

530,"Throwaway Account – TL;DR: *I get very anxious for hours before performing comedy on stage, even though it works out well 90% of the time. I'm very tired of this.*

I'm an extreme introvert by nature who used to never go out – I hate clubs and much prefer talking to people one-on-one or in very small groups. Searching for free time social activities I started performing stand-up comedy a few months ago and found amazing peers there. Ironically, I love being on stage – probably because people are ""forced"" to look at me and I don't have to compete with extroverts for attention.

**The thing is:** the ten (!) or so hours before I get on stage I absolutely *wallow* in anxiety about it – so much so that I can't even get a complete sentence out when I try to practice new jokes at home. On weekends, I literally waste *full days* trying to get myself to focus on new material or, alternatively, at least distract myself from the anxiety. When I do get on stage there is *no* problem. That forces me to practice new material live on stage for the first time. There is no rational reason in advance to believe my performance will be bad – the opposite is true: I've started getting booked and paid for my comedy. So it's just a terrible mental cycle that just exhausts me.

**Additional info:**

I don't get anxious about most other things in my life, even though my day job would seem high-stress for most other people. I do stand on stages as part of my job.

I love my new activity and the social community that comes with it, so I would hate to drop it. It helps me gain confidence day-to-day.

531,"So I have 3 roommates in total and they're fine to live with for the most part. But one of them is starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

For example, when I'm cooking I like to have my laptop on the counter so I can watch youtube and stuff. When I do this, I wear big over-ear headphones to listen to my laptop with. I thought this would be a good way to signal that I don't want to talk. The problem arises when he's constantly asking me questions about what I'm making and going far out of his way to look at what I'm watching/ doing on my computer. He literally walks all the way around the kitchen counter and leans in to see what I'm watching and then he starts asking me questions about it.

Some might think I'm the jerk and that he's just trying to be friendly, but it gets old pretty quick when I have to pause my show and take my headphones off to ask him to repeat what he said like 5 times instead of just relaxing while I cook. He hangs out in the kitchen all day almost every day. I understand that it's the common area and that he has every right to spend time out there but I wish he would just leave me alone while he does so.

There has also been multiple times when I came home with groceries and he would come out of his room and start looking through my grocery bags to see what I got. One time I had condoms in there when he did that so it made me extra uncomfortable.

Worst of all, I've seen him go into our other roommate's room without her there twice. I don't understand why he would think that's okay. Because of this, I always lock my door when I leave, even if it's just to take out the trash.

534,"Kind of vague title, but my best friend (let’s call her Sarah) has been in an on and off relationship with her boyfriend (let’s call him John) for a little over 4 years now. She is the kind of person to continually give people chances even when they’ve fucked up BAD. Second chances are nice, but fourth chances...are those really a thing?? 

Every time they broke up, it was because John would be secretive about talking to his ex-fuck-buddy right before he started dating Sarah. They talked about it and how him talking to this ex-fuck-buddy made her really uncomfortable and he agreed to stop talking to her....yet he continued doing it..... Not only did that mentally fuck with Sarah, but she believes that that’s how someone should be treated. I know I’m not the only one that can see through the bullshit...

Now, they moved in with each other in their first ever apartment about a year ago now. John has a non-stable income and Sarah makes decent money, but couldn’t afford to pay all the bills herself. Last weekend when Sarah and I were hanging out, she told me she’s done hounding John about getting a better job because she’s told him time after time about it. I told her you shouldn’t have to tell a grown man to find a better job, especially one that you believe wants to move to the next stage in the relationship and get engaged and then get married..... She confronted him about saving up for an engagement ring and he really had nothing to say. Is that really necessary??? Also last weekend, Sarah told me that she didn’t want to buy a shirt ($12.99) because she wanted to make sure she had enough money for groceries. She tells me this but then we come to this morning and she tells me about being ready to start trying for children.

Anyways, this morning we were talking about female things like periods and she told me that she got off of her birth control. Then she slid in there that she told her doctor that she wanted off of birth control because essentially she’s at the age where she wants to start trying for children..... Am I being crazy to tell her that she’s being crazy? I don’t understand how after complaining about John and him not getting off his lazy ass to get a better job, questioning him about them moving on to the next relationship step, her telling me countless times that she’s not financially stable, that now having a child will fix all the problems?????

I just needed to rant, but also seeing if I’m just being crazy. 

Side note: I am very protective of my friends. She knows this. We’ve been friends for 12 years. I become a mother hen when she tells me things that really should be concerning and try and bring her back to reality sometimes.",16Feb2020,1

536,"Hi, sorry for my bad English its not my main language. For a year my mom was dating a guy, from start i didn't like him but I accepted him. When we met he said that he won't be raising me or my older brother (21yrs). I really appreciated it because I never had a father and I had bad memories from previous relationships my mom had. But when he moved in, he started to be really strict towards me and my brother I stared to avoid him, stay whole day in my room etc. After few months my brother had a fight with him and my mom, what made him move out. After some time I started talk to my mom about his behavior towards me, she agreed that she will talk with him about it. They did have a talk but nothing changed. After few months she starded to finnaly notice his bad side so she confronted him few times about his behavior what leaded to the decision about them taking a break from all this shit, he moved out. I was really happy because I thought that they won't come back together and that it's the end. Month passed and last night they met and he said that he changed, thought about everything and said that my mom was right the whole time. What leads to today's morning and her saying that I have to decide if he will move in or they will break up. So what should I do?

537,"My mom died a little over two years ago.  It was fairly quickly, between the time she was diagnosed and the time of her death was only 3 months.  So her death was a bit of a whirlwind.  It took more than a year of mourning her before I was able to let go of her.  Even now I still have dreams where she is alive and I can talk to her and I wake up sobbing.  Anyway, I got to be with her as she took her last breath of air so I’m thankful for that.  I was able to cut a Locke of her hair just after she passed, and Ive had her ashes in the same box from the crematorium. I was so upset when she passed I couldn’t even think about picking out an urn for her.  Now I’m in a place where I can actually deal with it which brings me to my needing of advice.  

I want to do something special with the Locke of hair and the urn.  I was thinking of putting the hair in a glass case on top of the urn but that seems too plain.  
I was hoping you guys could give me some creative ideas on how I could memorialize my mom in a creative but respectful way, so that when I’m feeling sad or missing her I can simply look at her memorial.

538,"Right so I met this dude on an app called whisper, before anyone says anything i realize this was stupid off me, and was considering doing this FWB type relationship with him. We talked for a bit, but in the end i ultimately decided to not meet up with him as i didn’t really want to pursue anything with him anymore. I slowly began to cut off access with him, like i would stop messaging him as frequently, part because I didn’t want to, and part because I got busy with university and life as one does. Flash forward to last week, i finally messaged him and basically told him i didn’t want to do anything with him anymore and i thought that would be it. However, apparently he took it fairly hard and now he’s going around and trying the absolute most at trying to be the victim here? He’s telling people that he was the one that broke it off with me, he’s claiming that i called him gay because he didn’t want to speak with me anymore and whatever else that can come to his mind. Everytime i try to say what really happened, he does everything he can in getting my voice and my side of the situation removed. Like he’s flat out the craziest person i have ever met to put it lightly. He knows what I look like and he lives where i live, clearly. I’m lowkey scared of what he can do in person, if he’s able to do all of this online. So i was wondering if there was anything I could do to get him to stop? And move on with his life? All i want is for him to leave me alone, literally. Am i able to go to the authorities about it? Pls send help because it’s stressing me the fuck out.",16Feb2020,1
539,"Hello, I just recently had a new family move in across the street from my house in my subdivision. I have noticed that every single night they have been here so far, around 1 or 2 in the morning, their car alarm goes off. Every night, like clockwork. It runs for 5-10 minutes every time, just blasting the horn and flashing lights. For most people this might not be a big deal, but I have diagnosed insomnia and have a hell of time trying to get to sleep every night.

i've been reclusive for all of last year (i was 19), and 2 months ago ""resurfaced"" and began getting back in touch with old friends and hanging out. i'm with friends a lot but i don't know how to navigate the social stratosphere anymore

i'm so anxious, and i worry, and i overthink about literally everything. does he want me here, would they have had a better time if i left, did i say the wrong thing, when he said ""you're a weird guy but in a good way"" did he really mean it, were they waiting for me to leave

for example on v-day i went to a party to a girl i've been taking out on dates and she kissed me (not the first time). i was drunk as shit (not drinking anymore after that night) and called an uber, when it pulled up i asked if her and i could make out before i left. she said no and i spent a good deal of time yesterday overthinking about if she was mad at me or if i made an ass of myself, and asking my friend who was there with me about it. she wants me to come over to her apartment alone for the first time, so turns that one was all in my head.

it's... it's just hard. i don't know how to separate what's in my head vs. what's really an issue. i don't know what's appropriate conduct and what's not. i don't know what fucking natural human behavior feels like.

543,"(Peter and Dallas are the friends names(not their real names))

I was at a Peters house yesterday and we agreed to go see the new Sonic movie today with another friend, Dallas. Currently Peter is at Dallas’ place and has been for a few hours. The plan was to go to Dallas’ place and book the tickets. 

They have been there since about 1pm and neither have been replying to my texts, instead Dallas has been on three different games (know this because of Discord) and still hasn’t replied. We need to be there in about an hour.

I’m starting to feel left out because I’m positive they are just playing games without me and are going to text me a few minutes before we should leave because I’m paying for the tickets.

I feel like they’re using me and at this point I’m thinking of just giving an excuse like “oh, family stuff came up”. Part of me wants to, but I won’t see Peter in a possible few years since he’ll be moving away and I’ll probably lose all contact with him until he comes back.

I am currently a little over 9 weeks pregnant. This, for me, is the last pregnancy i will ever need/want. I'll have 3 children, i'm single and i'm 27. My doctor has agreed to tie my tubes right after the c-section.

Now, obviously with a decision this permanent i'm trying to get as informed as possible, and i'm mostly looking to get the following questions answered.

1) Is anyone around my age considering the same step?
2) Does anyone know the effects it will have on my ""mood"" /body. The internet states that i will still have a cycle so hormonally/physically speaking nothing will change, but that's in theory and i'm more looking for people who have gone trough something simular.
3) Has anyone regretted this decision and why?
4) Did taking away the ability to have children mess with anyone mentally?

546,"Several months ago one of my best friends experienced a psychotic episode after drinking one night and assaulted me. I fully believe that he attempted to kill me that night as he screamed that he was going to ""f***ing kill me"" during the assault. Following this, I tried to play it off as a one off incident and attempted to remain friends with the perpetrator given that he would seek professional help regarding his personal issues.


Fast forward a few months - the weight of the situation along with other issues caused me to have a mental breakdown. The perpetrator said, after promising to go through therapy, that he no longer needs help and that he feels fine. This felt like a total slap in the face after telling him that the only way I'd forgive him is if he got help as I believe that if you're capable of committing such an act once - you're capable of doing so again.


I can no longer look him in the eye and it causes me extreme levels of anxiety to attend any events where he may also be present. Despite explaining the situation to my friends and being met with initial sympathy - the sympathy is short lived and they go back to being friends with the perpetrator. We recently had made plans to go somewhere but, as the perpetrator decided to have people over at his place, my friends decided to go there instead - expecting me to also want to go. I confronted one of them about it and he apologised, stating that he ""forgot"". Granted, it's been several months since the incident but it was an extremely traumatic event for me. Usually my friends are great and have been a major support network for me in the past but, because it's a mutual friend that they are also very close to, they seem to want to sweep this under the rug.


I don't know if this has anything to do with it but I'm a trans woman. Of course, my friends are all aware of this and knew me prior to my transition. I've been on hormones for a long time so physically I'm much more akin to a cis female in terms of strength so I didn't have much chance of defending myself against the attacker. I may be wrong but I can't help but think that my friends would have had a significantly different reaction to what happened had I been a cis woman.


What should I do about this situation?

And when sometimes he acts all polite and respectful i feel like dying. I lash out at him because he annoys me. There's not much room to talk to him about how his actions affect me because communication with him is nil. And he has this habit of talking. He has to say something all the time, it does not even make sense half the time. And his other habits like talking with a mouthful. Overall his behaviour gives me a message that he does not really care about me. And my mom is pretty much responsible for everything.

548,"I’m at a crossroads of sort and could really use some advice!


I’m going back to school to be a nurse. It’s taken me awhile to figure out my passion (I’m 33), but it’s definitely something I want. I currently live in Salt Lake City, I moved here a few years ago from Houston which is where I’m originally from.


So the issue I’m having is this - my dad is a college professor in Houston and I’d get free tuition if I go to school there. He actually already spoke to the nursing admissions person and I’m basically in. Which is awesome because nursing school is super competitive and hard to get into! 


But it would require moving back home, and I absolutely love my life here in SLC. I have a great friend group, social life, etc, and this city just makes me overall happier. If I stay, I’d have to get loans to pay for school and I already have student loans so I don’t want to add more. If I move, I’d probably live with my parents to save money, which I can do if I have too but it’s definitely not my first choice. My parents are awesome and we have a great relationship, I’m just not sure I’d want to move back in with them, it feels like a step backwards. But it’s only be for a couple years and I could always move back to SLC if I really wanted. But I don’t want to leave my friends and life here........

549,"so about a month ago i asked to be added to a group chat, through a comment on a brockhampton instagram account. there is about 10 of us and we all share a v similar music taste, so we talk about that and send memes etc. just general teenager conversations (i’m f16). as i got talking to two of the people in the group chat more than the others, we made a separate chat for the 3 of us, and we talk on there all the time. we are all aware that we aren’t catfishes as we skype and stuff and send voice messages/selfies. i know not to share any information that is really personal, i have told my age and my nearest city - but they live on the other side of the world so i know that i’m safe in regards to that. 

yesterday my dad asked who i was on call to and i told him about the group chat/who they are and how i know them (because i hate lying to my parents). he is concerned, which is expected and understandable, even tho i 100% know that my two friends are who they say they are. because i have skyped them, its practically the same as having friends that live a city away that go to a different school, but he hasn’t understood what i’m trying to say.

this morning he said he wants my phone password so he can read all my conversations. i really don’t want to - as i’m a teenager and half my life is on my phone. i have nothing bad to hide but it’s just a huge invasion of my privacy, as it feels as though i have a microphone attached to me during any real life conversation with him listening in. i’m scared that he is going to judge what is being said, as he’s older and won’t understand teenage humour and he will be overly critical, meaning i can’t stay friends with them. i know i’m still a child and he’s looking out for me, but i just would like to compromise/explain that i don’t feel comfortable with him having control over all the conversations i’ve ever had, and looking into my life. i know about internet safety and i would block them if there was anything even remotely uneasy about them, and i want him to be able to trust me online.

550,"I'm a college student, full time. I have two part time jobs. 

I don't need both of them at the same time.  I still live with my family, I don't pay for rent. I took both of them because I wanted to prove to myself that I can do it. I've barely had one job before, so I wanted to show myself that I can work hard. 

A few months later, I proved to myself that I can do it, but I also found myself to be completely burnt out and depressed. My grades are slipping, and I almost broke down during one of my classes. I decided that now was the time to quit one of my jobs. 

At first, when my dad heard me trying not to sob, he was pretty encouraging towards the idea. 

I put in my two weeks. I finally relaxed at the possibility of having some free time. My manager spoke to me, and told me that he wanted me to stay. My dad told me that he thought it was a bad idea for me to leave.

My other job is at my school. I can't work there during vacations, and I'll need to find another job after I graduate, but it's the job that will look better on my application, since I want to go into academics. My dad wants me to do, at least, one shift a week at my other job. 

I didnt want to do it. But I did it anyways, because I felt trapped, and because I felt scared that I wouldn't have a job once I graduated. Now, I feel miserable. 

I like the people who I work with, but I want to leave. I don't want to stay. I cannot handle the extra responsibility. I want free time for my mental health. But I feel trapped, and I don't want to disappoint my dad.

I told him that I would try, but I really don't think i can do this. I feel so burnt out. 

My dad has faith that I can do it. That's why he's pushing me. I can't do it. I really can't. And I don't know what to do anymore.

My dad isn't the bad guy. I know hes doing this because he has high expectations of me and he says that its only one shift a week, but it still feels like too much.

I have been working in this community for years supporting people and helping run events so I’m very open minded to everyone’s sexuality and identification and for that reason alone It bothers me and saddens me twice as much for being bothered by this in the first place . 

My ex and I started talking again because we will always be best friends and last night he told me that he experimented with a trans woman a couple of times she’s not fully transitioned but for the most part is almost finished with her transformation she just still has one part to work on . The conversation started by us talking about how we both enjoy shemale porn we were both nervous thinking the other one was going to judge but thought it was nice that we found the same thing attractive and then he proceeded to tell me that he experimented with a trans woman quite recently actually and I don’t know why but I immediately was turned off,  &amp; I’m very confused &amp; feeling guilty for feeling that way . 

I know that trans women are women whether they completely remove their genitals or not, but for some reason knowing he had sex with a transwoman both ways makes me extremely uncomfortable &amp; I feel awful for feeling that way &amp; I feel awful Saying this but it finding that out almost grossed me out , I’m not sure if it’s the penis to penis contact or the fact she penetrated him ... idk what it is that turns me off but it just does.


I feel awful and so guilty for feeling this way bc as I mentioned before I don’t pass judgment and see us all as equal persons , and that being said I’m just so confused , I cried when we got off the phone  .... again idk why ... We both openly talk about people we experiment with after we were together and it’s not that him sleeping with another person bothering me because we talked about this many times before with many different people. But for some reason knowing that he had sex with a trans woman is bothering me, and because I’m bothered by it I feel awful and extremely guilty, I even have friends who are trans , I love them and pass no judgment no matter what , so  why ? Why am I so bothered and turned off by this ? Why does this bother me &amp; gross me out so much ? I went from being so turned on by my ex and the fact we were going to venture into the porn industry together to being so turned off and leaning to google on why I feel so conflicted .

560,"I'm 15 male and a couple days ago, my girlfriend, 15 and I (of about a month) hung out after school for a few hours, walking around our city, and we had a great time. On the way back to my house, I took a slight detour with her from my very crowded and trafficy street to a different path which was much more calm and quiet and overlooked the entire city. It was night and we walked out to a great viewpoint on the hill and stopped for a minute. We held hands and looked out to the city and talked for a minute.

When there was a moment of silence, I turned to her, put my hand gently against the side of her head and kissed her. It was our first kiss as a couple and my first kiss ever. (im pretty sure not hers). Afterwards, we hugged and walked back to my house holding hands. I feel like the moment was good and a good opportunity but im wondering if i kinda fucked up the actual kiss.

I kind of moved too fast I think because I was trying to work up the nerve and I got it and went for it. It wasn't aggressive, but it could have been slower for sure. I also kind of tilted my head i think and our lips touched at a sort of weird position. We connected for like a second tops. When i kissed her she did a little happy laugh right after (not humurously thank god lmao).

Im wondering if where it could have been improved will fuck up my chances of kissing her and doing more in the future. Im going out with her again today, and her idea was that we go to the beach and want the sunset. Should i kiss her again tonight and if so, what should i do different?

TL;DR! I (15m) had a first kiss with my 15f girlfriend in a great spot, but I feel that the kiss wasn't very clean. We continued to have a good time with each other after.

564,"My mother is a very toxic person. She blows things out of the water a lot and takes things too far. I live with both her and my younger brother. She has anger issues and takes them out in unhealthy ways. Whenever my younger brother doesn’t do things right my mother doesn’t correct him, she lets it go (with him unknowing that he’s not doing it the way she wants) until she blows up everything and degrades him for it. I have talks with my younger brother to help him regulate his feelings and make him feel like he’s actually worth something because i don’t want him to grow up with bad emotional habits. I work a lot so a lot of the times it’s just my mother, my little brother, and our pets at the house. My mother also has very little patience. She’s always “disciplined” our dog a little too harsh for comfort in my opinion, but recently she’s gotten out of control. I’ve woken up on multiple occasions from her 100% beating our dog out of anger. My little brother hasn’t said anything to her about it in fear of him getting in trouble and I’m in the same boat as him. She’s not a good person when she’s mad. And she’s been getting mad over minute things that have simple solutions but she seems to blow them out of the water just because she can. Things like this used to happen maybe like once a month but it seems it’s an everyday occasion now. Normally I’m good at processing and handling situations like these however, this morning it was hard. She was threatening to kill our dog and beat the **** out of it. She got mad at my brother for the dogs actions and threatened to beat him too. I don’t think she would actually every do anything serious to my younger brother but i know that kind of talking will put some emotional damage on a kid. I just feel stuck and I’m not sure what i should do. I’ve tried talking to her in an adult manner about a few of things but she just gets angry and blows it up. It makes everyone in the house miserable. But i also don’t want to just stand around and let all of this happen. I need help",16Feb2020,1
565,"I (f19) and my boyfriend (m21) are both former poly addicts. He used both heroin and cocaine, and I used cocaine and inhalants. We both had come a long way before meeting each other. We kicked harder drugs that we were on, and both only smoked pot when we started dating. As our new relationship ensued, I started to regularly use adderall to get through busy nights at work or to help me through school. The semester had been really hard, and I'm sure a lot of it was lack of motivation from smoking so much pot, or a lack of sleep because of the adderall. My boyfriend and I have had some life events take place, and we are ready to get our lives on a good path for ourselves, and for each other. We have a lot of goals and food intentions, but it feels impossible when looking at a long list of tasks such as; saving/budgeting to move out, going back to AA, working out again, going back to school, cutting out all substances etc. Does anyone have any advice for us turning things around?

572,"This is quite and embarrassing situation and I'm honestly humiliated writing this.

I am a 32M powerlifter and I occasionally get massages because my muscles hurt.

While walking home from work the other day I was handed a business brochure/card/ad for a new massage spa that had opened up close by. On Friday, I decided to stop by and try the place out.

I thought the price was a little steep, at least compared to previous places I was used to.

I was introduced to the women who was going to be giving the massage. She looked mid thirties, didn't speak much English except for a Thai accent.

She asked what kind of massage I wanted and I told her that my muscles hurt from lifting weights and training and that I want to relax and I trust she will take care of me.

I have been harping on myself and dwelling and wondering if anything I said was a codeword for soliciting sex because of what happened next.

After about five minutes of a decent (not terrible but not amazing) back massage, she asked me to flip over and started massaging my legs. She was getting dangerously close to my private area and then next thing I know she was touching my genitals. I admit that I froze up in shock at what was going on.

After 10 seconds of her ""massaging"" that area, I came to my senses and asked her to stop. She then got very nervous and apologized and said she thought I wanted ""massage"" (while winking) and I said yes I want a massage but not ""that kind"" of massage. She apologized profusely and offered to ""fix up"", but I just said no thanks and walked out. I paid my bill and left. The front desk seemed confused because it was only maybe 10 minutes total that I was in the room for and I paid for a one hour massage, but I did not make a big deal.

After thinking about this nonstop all weekend, I am deciding to ask for advice on what I should do. I don't want to get her fired because I do support sex workers, but only when their customers know and consent to the services they are receiving. Should I complain to the spa in general? Or what if they are owned by gang members and it is just a front for prostitution? But if they are not a brothel, then what are they?

Should I say anything at all or just keep my mouth shut? I don't want to leave a nasty Yelp review because if they are organized crime then they will know it is me and they will come after me.

Please has anyone else had something similar happen to them and what did you do about it?",16Feb2020,1
573,"So after seeing some of the other posts here I feel pretty out of place with this silly high school problem but nonetheless I think it’s worth a shot.  

A little bit of backstory first:  I’m a sophomore in high school and my girlfriend is a freshman.  The middle school I went to actually went from 7th-9th instead of 6th-8th like most high schools in the US so we met when I was in 9th grade and she was in 8th.  We’ve been dating for over a year now and lately we’ve been in a bit of a rough patch.  Going to two different schools and both being very busy with very overprotective parents makes it hard to see each other so it’s almost a long distance relationship.  We were hoping to hang out on Valentine’s Day however that didn’t work so we were hoping to hang out yesterday but that ended up not working either.  Today was another option but again it didn’t work.  It’s completely out of my control it’s drama between our parents that keep standing in the way.  We can’t hang out during weekdays at all because we both have things going on that limit us from seeing each other so essentially the only times we can hang out are weekends.  It’s been about 2 months since we’ve seen each other.  My girlfriend is pretty frustrated with it.  Both my bff girlfriend and my parents got pretty mad at me yesterday, my mom because I “was too upset about it” and my girlfriend because she felt like I was avoiding her.  I’m not going to say either of them are wrong to be upset they both have every reason to be but I feel caught in the middle of two sides where I can’t make a right choice.  I also feel like it’s important to mention that both my girlfriend and I are still really really happy with each other and have no interest in ending the relationship.  I don’t even really know what I’m asking for I just sorta want help of any kind?  Thanks in advance.",16Feb2020,1
574,"I met a guy through work who recently (about 2 weeks ago) left our company. He’s a really sweet guy. We were friends initially and then began dating. We went on 3 dates total so far, 2 of them after he left the company . When he was drunk on our 2nd date he declared me his girlfriend and sweetheart. On our next date while he was sober, I asked him if I was his girlfriend (based off what he said on the last date) and he said we’ll see how things go. He said we have to see if we’re both compatible etc which is true I guess. We got a bit physical and it was intense emotionally too. We talked a bit more about relationships etc. He said if this was just a physical thing, would that be ok. That sort of hurt me, but I think he said it in a moment of stress having started a new job and still adjusting.

Note, his employment history seems a bit scattered to me from what I can see on LinkedIn- not that I judge. What worries me though is after he left, I asked his former coworkers if the workload is harder now that he was gone, and they said it was easier because he’d be distracting making lots of jokes. So I do want him to focus on this new job, which seems ideal for him and a lot more serious and strict (and possibly more stressful).

We haven’t seen each other in almost 2 weeks, and haven’t texted since last Friday. I’d asked if he wanted to hang out and he apologised saying he couldn’t (I'm guessing he needed space because he was tired or because our last date was pretty intense). I want to text him again now but I also don’t want to distract him. I’m trying to be patient and wait on a text from him but I’m not sure it’ll happen considering how busy he is. I’ve also mainly been the one texting him first, since he initially asked me out and did a lot of the work. He’s shown he cares about me and I feel different about him than any guy I’ve dated. He’s treated me really well and I feel calm when I’m with him.

What do you all recommend? Should I text him? Thanks for any insight.",16Feb2020,1

576,"I’m so sorry if it becomes way too long and rambley because I’m quite desperate for help now and this is years of stuff I’m trying to type through tears. (Some context: I’m in Asia and from a fairly conservative family. So leaving/moving out of the family is a big no, because it is seen as very disrespectful to the parents who worked hard to raise me. even though I’ve considered running away since I was literally 7 or 8 years old, but that’s for later)

My mom... i don’t know how to feel about her. Sometimes she’s my best confidant, other times I want to run as far away as I can. Her behaviour is so different at different times that I truly don’t know what to believe or who to turn to.

Today is the reason why I’m finally spilling my emotions: my younger brother (9M- let’s call him J) who means the world to me, he suddenly injured a leg muscle and he came to my room to ask for help and advice before approaching either parent. Even the lightest brush against the area made him shout in pain, which is what made Ma come to the room to try and help. 

Ma asked him the same questions I asked him at first (which part of your thigh, can you walk/stand etc) and because he was suffering so much I tried to help answer the questions with what he told me. But she repeatedly told me to shut up even when J told her that my answers were accurate. She was so much that J, even told her to shut up knowing she’d scold him for such rude words. She also called me “the stupidest person in the room” because I asked “scale of 1-10 how painful is it now” and she said that he was too young to know what that meant. (I’m sorry if it was actually ignorance from me, I thought it was somehow helpful D:) He made it into a light hearted joke which I laughed at, to which she scolded me again saying I was so stupid he was treating me like an experiment to see if I’d laugh.

And yesterday, she spent a whole car ride to a family friend’s house gathering, scolding me for making her late (we actually arrived right on time, and people arrived even later than us) and called me selfish, said I think only about myself, and told me to stop embarrassing her all the time. And said things like “no, it’s my fault, I shouldn’t have invited you to accompany me, because you keep embarrassing me like this. If they ask why I’m late can I say it’s because of my dumbass daughter?”

(Yes Ma if you’re reading this- and knowing how you sometimes take my phone and read all my social media, you might be- I accept responsibility for taking too long to be ready because I was having bad chest pain while showering, and I’m truly sorry that it’s happened so much you think it’s me purposely being selfish and rude to everyone all the time. I’m sorry I didn’t say anything when you were scolding me because then you’d have scolded me for interrupting too. But your words really hurt me and I really thought to myself that day “I’m sorry I was born, maybe I won’t embarrass you that way”.)

The worst part is that when she’s nice, she’s so loving and caring that I feel terrible for thinking about the bad things she’s done to me. My family has a comfortable and lucky life, and it’s not like she’s beating me black and blue daily or worse, so I feel somehow grateful that it’s only just this and not regular physical abuse or anything. And she’s a mother so even if it hurts, her scoldings are to make me a better person right? But at the same time my close friends say that she acts out of line sometimes. I wrote some of the other things she’s done in my life, please tell me I’m not crazy for thinking they’re bad? (I will put them in the comments as a reply because it’s too long to be put all here, so sorry it became so long again)

Tl;dr my mom’s behaviour has been so unpredictable over the years I really don’t know what to do any more. Please help me, how should i handle this in a way to avoid her retaliation and like a mature adult?",16Feb2020,1

586,"Me and my girlfriend (sort of ex now) really connected. The first time we met was at the dog park and we literally spent like 6 hours there talking. I got her number and we began dating.

She has had issues in past relationships so she didnt fully trust me ever so it caused some problems and other stuff caused problems as well so weve gone through some break ups. Yes multiple. when wed break up I'd not know how to cope so I'd resort to tinder which,I know, is a terrible way to go about it

Every time wed get back together though, because we really loved each other and have a strong connection. So fast forward a little bit and shes being weird one night and shes apparently gone through all my history of google and all that kind of stuff from her phone I guess she had my passwords or whatever. So she finds out certain times I was using tinder and the times that we started getting back together and me using tinder kind of overlapped for a day or 2 and she was not happy about that. Which is understandable

She considers what happened as cheating and I completely understand her point of view and why she thinks that. I didnt mean for that to happen I guess I just wasnt sure about things and wanted to make sure that we were fully back together before i stopped using it. I will admit It was wrong to do that. I wish i hadn't of.

She basically says shes disgusted in me and I tried going to her house to talk about it but she woildnt let me in and was basically breaking up with me. I did everything I could to stop that and eventually she let me back in and we tried to fix things.

Well things never moved past that. She had these certain ways she wanted me to build back trust that I thought were not good and kind of toxic so we just never got past what happened. She continuously accuse me of looking at other girls and doing things with the intention of looking at them. She question me about shows i watched like ""what are you gunna do if theres a sex scene"" she expects me to turn away or skip those parts. Shed always accuse me of still talking to girls or looking up stuff online that's inappropriate.

Her response to this stuff was that I should be reassuring and sweet when she does these things but those things hurt me. It's been happening even BEFORE the tinder thing. So i was tired of it and showed that when shed accuse me of stuff. And she thought that I wasnt bulding back trust because I wasn't reacting how she wanted me to.

I think the biggest thing that she wanted to build trust back with was by going through my phone whenever she wanted. Which at first I let her because I thought I should but now I'm seeing that as toxic behavior in my opinion. I mean the other day on valentines day before we walked in to the restaurant she wanted to go through my phone and I wouldnt let her cause it was supposed to be a special day and I didnt think it was cool of her to do that

So she just assumes I'm doing stuff i shouldnt and talking to other girls and what not. I just wanted to go eat dinner and not have to worry about that stuff for once. I just want some thoughts about if shes doing the right things or if its kind of too much.",16Feb2020,1

My bf and I work in a small restaurant group surrounded by other restaurant groups in a big American city. 

Last night, after Valentines 2.0, our coworker’s ex accused my boyfriend of taking things from her bag/touching her bag. He didn’t. I was next to him. Dude is borderline on the spectrum and honest to a fault, his anxiety went into overdrive and he sobbed all night. 

One of the coworkers of our peer misled the bouncer to think he had assaulted her, which prompted our group of 13 coworkers to be bounced (very kindly, the bouncer was only trying to mediate, from a bar we frequent every day. The bartenders are friends who know our dogs and families, etc...) it was shocking. While bf is sobbing, we confront this dude and stand in solidarity with our friend. It was drunk, it was stupid. My bf is a mess.

We go home and I message the woman that accused my bf. I clarified he’d never ever done anything of the sort and I could say with utmost certainty NOTHING happened. I had been there. But I was sorry something had escalated between our respective groups. It was probably best we take it as water under the bridge. 

She explained the story from her “eyeline.” Leaving room to interpret my bf’s side of things. 

I said thank you for clarifying, but I need to know if he assaulted you so we can proceed accordingly. She denied it, but claimed she wanted an apology for the bag theft (that never happened)

If bf can suck it up and apologise for an act he didn’t commit, this will be water under the bridge. He’s very angry and confused that he’d be accused of either crime and would prefer to die on this hill. I’m not so sure.

593,"The short story

My husband I got got married when I was 23 and he was 27. At the time I didn’t want kids. At 30 now I do want kids. 

My husband and I have talked in depth about this and finally decided that he would get a vasectomy and I would get off of birth control. Since he was the one that won this decision to be made. This was all decided about a year and a half ago.

After I got off birth-control he said time and time again that he was going to make it appointment for his vasectomy. Well you’re in a half has passed and yet it’s still not happen. Since then I’ve had to pregnancy scares. 4 months ago and then this week.

What kills me is that I was hoping I was. And if I was I was planning on keeping the child. Both pregnancy test came back negative. 

What’s the most frustrating thing about all of this is that for the past eight years I’ve made it my responsibility to be on birth control even though he’s the one who definitely does not want children.

For me it’s really frustrating to try to understand why he put it off for so long if he’s so against having children.  When I finally asked him why he put it off he said it was because he was scared of the surgery

Well it’s also pretty scary to have a piece of plastic shoved into your cervix so I’m not sorry that I don’t really get why he didn’t do it. 

For me it feels like he’s just lacking responsibility and respect for me. Because having these two pregnancy scares did scare the shit out of me but also slightly got my hopes up which I know is kind of wrong. 

I chose to stay with him because I love him and I chose not to have children because I love him. So I feel slightly embarrassed that I’m so angry with him right now. I just don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: I want kids my husband doesn’t. It was my husband‘s responsibility to get a Secta me and he didn’t so I’ve had to pregnancy scares and now I’m mad at him because of it. It feels extremely unfair and stressful for no reason.",16Feb2020,1
594,"Hi Reddit! I'm posting this on a throwaway account just because this is a very, very personal situation for me and I'd like for it not to be connected to the account I usually post on. I have discussed this situation at length with some of my close friends, many of whom have suggested that I was groomed. I'm certainly having difficulty figuring out whether or not this was the case, so I figured I might ask people who really know what they're talking about. 

When I was 7, my parents got me started on an instrument. They took me to a teacher, I'll call him John, who came recommended by one of our other family friends. He's 29 years older than me, so he was 36 at the time. I took lessons with him for about five years, until I was 12, and my parents switched me to another teacher because they believed John wasn't pushing me too much -- he always asked me what I wanted to learn and what I wanted to do. During our time together, he was the only adult teacher figure I really connected with; I never felt the same way about any of the teachers at school, then or even now. We had a close relationship. We talked about everything, and I really felt like he was the only person I trusted.

I have always had an extremely difficult relationship with my family, especially my father, so it meant a lot to me that I could trust John. Five years after my parents took me away from his lessons, I came back to his house, where he taught out of. I remembered that place as somewhere I felt safe with someone I trusted, and at the time, I didn't really trust anyone else. I was 17, he was 46, and I was really, really struggling with my mental health, among other things. He invited me inside and we spoke. I basically broke down and told him everything that had been happening at home. I was anxious, depressed, and suffering from an eating disorder, among other problems, all symptoms that were worsening because of my home life. 

After that day, he invited me back. It became a regular thing for us, I would come over and we would talk. A little over a month after my eighteenth birthday, he asked if it was okay for him to be physical with me, platonically. He'd wanted to hug me, hold my hand while we walked, link arms, that kind of stuff. But it quickly became a lot more physical. He'd kiss my head, or both my cheeks. After about a month of this, he initiated a sexual relationship with me. I was about eighteen and two months, and had a high school boyfriend, which he knew about it. I broke up with this boyfriend to be with John. 

We continued a romantic relationship up until about a week ago. I've been in college. Upon returning home for break, my dad apologized for the way he had treated me when I was growing up, right up until I moved out. Then he said he knew about John and I, and didn't want us seeing each other anymore. I was heartbroken. I said we would end the relationship, but we continued it in secret, through texts and calls. But finally, about a week ago, I realized I didn't want to hide and lie from my parents anymore, especially since they were putting in so much effort to be better to me. And around then is also when I started talking to a boy from class, and realized how much I wanted to be with someone my age, someone I could marry and bring home.

When I broke the news to John, that I wanted some space and to end the romantic aspect of the relationship, he completely blew up. He yelled at me on the phone, and said things like I wasn't who he thought I was. He was very, very upset. I stayed on with him for over an hour because I didn't want to hurt him. But I was pretty adamant on doing what I had to do for me, and he basically said he never wanted to talk to me again and blamed me for not fighting for our relationship, and that I was his lifeline and he needed me. 

These past few days I've been noticing a lot of the unhealthier aspects of our relationship. He always described himself as high maintenance. But on days where I felt like being by myself, he would get extremely upset with me. I felt obligated to call him every night in college. I felt, in some ways, manipulated because I was so young, didn't know what I wanted from life so I just started to follow his lead and his vision for his own life, and I had such low self esteem I figured I'd just have to settle for whoever wanted me. 

I'm so sorry this post is so long. I didn't want to leave too many details out. This past week has been extremely hard on me, and I really just need some closure on this subject. Thank you if you got this far! If you have any questions for me, feel free to shoot.",16Feb2020,1

596,"Okay so, I'm looking for advice on people who have pursued third party custody. Specifically of a nephew/niece. I know these are difficult situations and I really have no one to talk to about it but here are some little bits on my situation.
&gt;we are native american
&gt;I am the paternal aunt
&gt;the child is living city to city, just within the few same states, constantly moving from month to month almost honestly
&gt;Addiction runs in both sides. I've never struggled with it yet many of our family members have many run ins with the law and are associated with eachother.
&gt;I do think I have a good chance. I would give more detailed post but I feel like I'd be all over the place. I have a good home, I am already going thru the process of getting a relative out of foster care, so my home will be to state/tribal requirements.
&gt;there is nothing wrong with assistance, but I cant really ever qualify for assistance, whereas this family relies heavily on assistance. Get their nails done with tanf type. I dont know if theyll look at income, please let me know all information on that too.
&gt;I am unmarried to my childrens father. Is that an issue?
&gt;this really isnt an issue, just a thing that bothers me, my brother doesnt want to be involved and the mother consistently has different guys around. Always needs a boyfriend and it makes me uncomfortable because I know she has been abused, as have females in my family have been, I really just dont feel like my niece is safe and I know at least to my community, I can prove I'm the more suitable home. The child was born in my community. I'm not sure how the court process would go and where. I dont think as of right now, they have a solid home. Not to be rude, but my brother is also a pos about the situation because he has the girls exbestfriend pregnant. Like I'm sure the mothers family has as many rude remarks from online hes made about the child that I do. I keep all their petty online arguments. I'm not here to judge how they live but I guess I'm willing to point out a few week spots if it opens eyes.

Please dont judge me and be understanding. I've been a neglected child who had to raise my siblings. I really didnt think my siblings would want the same for their kids. I love my siblings I just feel like they wont ever step up. I have another niece in a similar situation, the details are just trickier so I really would like to pursue the niece more at risk of violence and harm than my other niece, who unfortunately, is just surrounded by addiction. Both situations hurt me, yet I'm in my early 20s, have my own child to raise and am doing my best to be the best for all kids in my family.",16Feb2020,1

My cat is about 8 1/2 months old and weighs 3.6 lbs if that info helps (yes she’s tiny lol). So on Friday (two days ago) she had surgery and was under anaesthetic to remove a blockage from her stomach and intestines. They also spayed her while she was under since her appointment for that was only going to be a few days later. Obviously after surgery she was given pain meds. She then stayed at the vet overnight, and we picked her up Saturday morning. They gave her another pain shot and gave us some antibiotics to ward off infection. When we got home, Percy was highly affectionate and sweet, like catnip. I figure that’s because she was high on pain meds. She ate as usual, as the vet had said she’d be able to. By evening, her over the top affection had pretty much worn off and she seemed to be back to her normal personality (she’s nice, but not particularly affectionate. She’ll lay with people and maybe purr or knead, but not much. She’s very chill normally.) I gave her her antibiotic that night, then went to bed. Now, Sunday morning, two days after surgery and over 24 hrs since her last pain shot, she’s back to the unusual levels of affection. She doesn’t seem to be in pain and the surgical site looks normal. But she can’t not be around me- normally she’s quite independent- is rolling around on her back and purring, kneading like crazy, butting her head- or rather her cone lol- against me, etc. None of this is bad, just unusual for her. Any idea why she’s acting this way? Will she go back to normal?

TL;DR: my cat had surgery two days ago and now she’s acting wildly affectionate, which is unusual for her",16Feb2020,1
598,This happened 2 weeks ago and I can’t seem to figure out what’s wrong with me. My friends were throwing a party and I was excited to go. I had to ask if I could go and that I needed a ride (I’m 16 and I don’t drive yet) my parents said yes but they didn’t know I was going to a party. I told them that I was going to a sleepover. A couple hours before I was going to go I tried to find excuses as to why I can’t go to the party. It got to the point where I started crying because I didn’t want to go but deep inside I did want to go. It was just weird that I got sad out of nowhere ? I was not expecting that since I was really excited about going. I talked to my mom about it and that I didn’t want to go to the “sleepover” but she kept saying how I needed to go and live my life and have fun. I just don’t know why I tend to find excuses to not go to things with my friends if I love them and want to have fun.,16Feb2020,1

We were looking at hotels yesterday, but didn’t book one because I don’t know how to bring the subject up again with my dad.

610,"so my best friend is doing heroin, and I don’t know what to do

Ever since i’ve come out of the pit of loneliness i’ve made friends with 3 people, people i’ve bonded to and grown close to.  For 2 of them I’ve met a few months ago but my best friend I’ve known for a few years now. We’ve always indulged in shit like weed and psychedelics , but I didn’t think he’d ever go this far.


He’s recently got a boyfriend and he’s told me to my face that they’ve been snorting heroin. Obviously I’m trying to prevent this and am strongly against it. Whenever I bring it up in the group (like, ‘have you done heroin tonight?’ or ‘are you on heroin’?) he always gets this really annoyed tone and lies and says he didn’t, even though because he’s so fucking high off it minutes later he explains to my other friend he did just that. I really, really don’t want anything to happen to him, so I’ve thought about reporting to the police or telling his mom or something but he’d never talk to me again, and since I’d be labeled as a ‘snitch’ my other friends would stop talking to me too. Basically, i’d be in the exact place I started: in the pit of loneliness.

 Obviously I’ve tried talking him out of it, I’ve even made a promise with him and we shook hands, but literally the same night we did he admitted to doing it. 
I know I should just drop him now, but I really really really don’t fucking want to go back to feeling like I did a few years back. It’s so fucking painful and I don’t know if I wouldn’t just give myself the rope. 
 
What in the ever living fuck do I do?

611,"We are in our thirties and we have been seeing each other for 6 years. She is my good friend and we are mostly supportive of each other but there are some issues we don’t really see in the same way.

She currently lives with her elderly mother in two bedroom apartment close to the city center while I live in a studio 2 hours away from her place which my family owns but would surrender to me freely should I pay the remaining mortgage myself.

We talked about living together at my place some time ago but ultimately decided against it, her reason being that it would more than double her commute time  to work and mine being the differences in our schedule, which makes it impossible for me to enjoy my late nights. It also would require some additional spending, like buying additional furniture  for her workspace and storage needs (she basically has a home studio instead of a bedroom now).

Yesterday we indulged in some wine and she brought up the subject again, along the lines of how nice it would be if we could afford to live together. It is actually possible if I take a loan to close mortgage on my current apartment, sell it, close the loan with that money and get mortgage on a bigger apartment. All in all it would probably put me in debt for the next 10 to 15 years depending of whether my family pitches in (which they might and might not do) and would cost me about 50% of my monthly income.

What’s worse, it would further increase the already huge gap in amounts of our free time: I am an office slave with predictable 5/2 9 work hours schedule, and I am often looking for additional income, which can bring me 10% to 50% increase of my monthly income but inevitably eats away at my leisure activities.

She only works mondays , Thursdays and saturdays, occasionally taking some additional work which in lucky months can add up to 5 to 10 of her monthly income.

When we had just met the difference was barely there so be both had the chance to explore something new and introduce it to each other later, but as my salary grows so does responsibility and what energy I have left I usually spend on the things  I am familiar with and these interest she rarely shares.

She meets lots of new people tho and gets constant inflow of information which she is happy to share. Lately it feels like I am falling behind in this department, as when I come back home all I can think about is job related stuff and maybe some random facts I’ve read while having a lunch, while she tells me of how she went skating or  meeting friends at spa or hiking or working on her personal project and I guess I just feel jealous, like I am missing out and don’t have similar stories on my own.

On numerous occasions before she said that she would never trade the freedom she has for some additional income  because  a) she earns enough to support herself and b)that would just make her life  miserable and it is just not worth it. However, she has no problem if I am the one who has to pull longer hours. 

I don’t understand why she sort of points to the desired result but refuses to share the load, and what’s more, I guess I just don’t feel comfortable sticking my neck this far just to live together, because 
1. she can be mean. I can be, too, but it is draining and distracts me greatly. If we were living together I would be  unable to properly reload myself and this would make me emotionally vulnerable.
2. I am usually covering our entertaining  expenses, I also bring her nice gifts (shoes, tech, clothing). I am currently able to do so without hurting my own needs significantly.  If I take a loan to buy bigger apartment for the two of us I’d have to get much cheaper and would have to cut on my own expenses, not to mention I’d lose a freedom of randomness, like little road trips, bar meetups, just treating myself with nice haircut in a more expensive studio and things like that. I feel this would be huge sacrifice on my part and the worst part is that she doesn’t see it that way. She can survive an the very basic stuff and she believes I can too, but I don’t see a reason to work my ass off if I end up taking my lunch from home because I just can’t afford the takeaway.
3. I don’t feel comfortable depending on her. I don’t really know why, it’s not like she ever seriously failed me.  She’s says that “nobody has to do anything unless s/he wants it” - so if she doesn’t feel like preparing my lunch I guess I’d have to go without. And I am fine with this in principle but not if she expects me to take additional responsibilities. I also know that she can hurt people, manipulate people and watch them suffer without significant struggle. This was not deployed against me often but still makes me want to maintain my distance.

620,"Okay r/Advice, I am in dire need of help.

For some backstory, I am about to enter a job in which I am employed by the city I live in. This is a civil service position, in which I will be working with the public.

Obviously, there are component of the hiring process that other career paths don’t have, one of them being a background check. 

I am squeaky clean, have good grades, no record, etc.
However, I had a Facebook back back in high school.

This Facebook is a complete cliche of an edgy teenager trying to be funny for likes and has some content that is both questionable and cringeworthy. Nothing is horrible, but some posts and statements don’t reflect the adult I am today.

The city I will be working for is known for disqualifying applicants for the smallest reasons, and is extremely evaluative. 

I’ve spoken to some individuals on the job, even some people that are part of the hiring process. This Facebook will most definitely get me disqualified.

Thing is, I no longer have access to the Facebook account. It has been hacked and changed to a foreign language. The person hasn’t posted anything.

They have changed my email and my password, making all of Facebook’s “help” solutions completely useless.

Facebook has no customer service, so I can’t contact anyone from their end to help me. They don’t even have an email that I can contact. It is insane. I’m in a horrible catch22.

At this point, I don’t care about the Facebook. It’d be cool to keep it to catch up with old friends, but I wouldn’t mind just completely nuking it off the face of the earth and having it disappear.

I’ve tried reporting it, emails, and all, but nothing has worked.

At this point I need some advice on what to do. I am in New York, if that helps.

At this point I’m ready to hire a lawyer and get them to contact the Facebook, if that’s even possible.

One of the other kids on the team is a 15 year old boy as well and he just seems to really dislike me, and honestly I dont really like him either. He's kind of an ass and treats me like im way less than him and doesnt even say hi to me when hes saying hi to everyone else on the team. I get along well with everyone else on the team, and this dude really kills my vibe when were at practice.

He's nice to everyone else on the team, and im not the type of person to hold on to dislike of someone for very long. He hasn't been super nice to me in the past, and i dont want to be his friend, but i want to get along with him at practice. 

When i have an issue with someone, all it really takes for me to completely drop my negative feelings for them is if we get along or have a decent conversation. 

I dont want to have a problem with this kid. he doesnt seem like an asshole in general, just kind of to me.

What can i do to get along with this kid and have a decent realtinship with him so that the season is better for both of us? we havent really had a fight, just him saying rude things or looking at me like im retarded.

626,"My wife and mother used to get along great. But they got into a huge fight over something stupid. A kids first birthday party that they wanted to plan together; this was the first thing they did together that involves children, which they have two opposing views on I found out. Then while they was drinking wine and planing this party, they got really drunk and started fighting, with fist, and my mother got a broken nose and my wife had chunk of hair pulled out. 

Well now both of them are trying to force me to chose a side, my wife says I need to disown my mother or she will leave me and my mother wants me to divorce my wife or I get nothing in the will. 

They are both very hard headed and hold grudges for life, and when they decide to hate someone it’s all or nothing, it’s gotten to the point my wife even was taking about how to poison my mother and not get caught, and I’m sure my mother is thinking about something the same.

627,"This is a re-upload because no one responded the first time. It’s pretty long, so I’m sorry in advance. Thank you if you read my rant. Disclaimer, I made this yesterday in the midst of being very stressed out, so it’s very negative.

I am so immature and insecure that I cannot be happy for people when they do better than me on something. I hate myself for this. I want to be happy for others, I try to be, but I just start thinking about how I need to do better. Over stupid things, I got 96% on a test and another student got 98% and I couldn't be happy her. I didn't say anything, I just got angry with myself for not being happy for her, which just made me more upset over something that didn't matter. The extra 2 percent didn't affect my grade in the long run, so why can I not just be mature?

I put so much of my identity into being smart and I'm not even smart, I just try really hard and still come up second. I am being ridiculous, I know, but I'm really nothing but my grades. If my grades are bad, I'm have nothing I like about myself. I'm a bad person with a mediocre personality at best, with no talents or hobbies, and an average IQ. I have very few people who can tolerate my presence and no real friends because I never have time to socialize. I get stressed out and yell at my parents and sister, they deserve a better daughter and sister.

I don't deserve what I have been given. I live in a first-world country, in a white, middle-class family. I've never been faced with much adversity other than depression, anxiety, and a lack of friends. Why the fuck am I allowed to complain about this? Why the fuck am I even allowed to say I have problems? There are people fucking starving and dying. There are people who never get a chance to get an education who could have much higher IQs and could accomplish much more than I could if given the same life. So, I'm not allowed to fail.

In my mind there's no in-between there's either the best or failure. 

I want to be a doctor, because maybe then I'll be happy with myself. That isn't a reason to become a doctor, I'm supposed to want to help people, which I do but it's not the first thing that comes to mind, so I'm a bad person. I know that's ridiculous I don't really think I'm a bad person, I'm sixteen I think it's really hard to be a bad person at my age. I'm not a good person. The absence of bad doesn't equal good. I don't do anything but schoolwork, for a better future but if I died tomorrow what would it all have been for? My parents would miss me but that's because of evolution. Parents have to care for their children more than themselves or else we wouldn't be able to survive a generation. I don't have any redeeming qualities, I can't be happy for people who do better than me for fuck's sake. I haven't done anything to better the world I don't even think humans have much longer to control it. Sure, I'm sixteen but what the fuck is the point of this?

We live like dogs chasing our tails. We live to die. We try to find a purpose and try to find meaning in this. Maybe it’s helping others, maybe it’s religion. We might try to believe in a God and a heaven. (I'm sorry if this offends anyone in just trying to rant. I don't believe I know anything and if you believe in God don't fucking challenge it. I wish I could believe in God.) You have to earn your way into heaven, but if there is a reward doesn't that defeat the purpose. I don't know how to phrase this. If someone is always watching you and keeping track of all good things you do and you know this, you're not doing it out of the goodness of your heart. Isn't good doing right when no one is watching?

I don't think anyone is truly good. I think it's evolutionary to stand out to mates to keep your genes alive to continue to evolve. I think in an evolutionary system, nothing truly good would survive. Unless they had a sexual selection advantage, which destroys the idea that someone is good just because they are good. 

(I sound like an idiot, I don't know how to phrase anything. I have ideas that I'm not smart enough to phrase because of my limited vocabulary.)

I don't think evil exists either. I know I'm a fucking idiotic teenager and what the fuck do I know but I'm trying to get everything off my chest. 

I think serial killers have something wrong with their brains, obviously. I think its all neurological; they could be born with a different brain, have brain damage, aren't taught how to act because their mentors failed, or they are abused/traumatized and they change to survive. I try to justify myself by saying I'm not a bad person because I never killed anyone, but would I have ended up differently if I was born with the same brain and had the same experiences as what we want to believe are inhuman monsters. Jesus Christ, now I'm trying to justify serial killers, I just need to shut the fuck up and stop acting like I know anything.

I'm a fucking immature teenager who doesn't know anything and will never amount to anything. But, I’ll continue to chase my tail trying to find a purpose in a career field full of the most intelligent people that I could never be like. I know I'm going to fail, which is what I fear. I'm trying to distract myself from the fact that nothing fucking matters, but for now I'll just suck it up and try to keep myself together today and maybe one day I'll find meaning in life.

632,"Hey everyone! I'm currently a physics undergrad with a year and some change left before graduation. I'm about to finish training to be a volunteer firefighter. Recently, I realized the finite nature of life, and have been motivated to make something of myself. I'm inspired heavily by the likes of Jonny Kim (seriously, look him up: Navy SEAL, Math major, medical doctor, now astronaut, all at age 35), JFK, Elon Musk, a few others. I plan on obtaining a Ph.D in astrobiology, but I've been contemplating how I want to structure the rest of my life. 

Would politics (legislative position) have legitimate potential, as compared to entrepreneurship and the private sector, to make changes? I think congress could use more people from a science/engineering background, but I'm worried that proposals would get buried and I couldn't make a substantial impact. I'm also intensely interested in Naval Aviation. I'm considering commissioning after my graduate studies, and using military fellowships to get involved in congress that way. 

No matter the path, I would like to lead and contribute to a greater cause. I want to spend my time bettering myself and helping improve the human condition. The slow-moving nature of politics is my only turn-off (see: How quickly Musk is making changes in relation to NASA, a government organization).

640,"For a bit of background - I'm 51 and last year I had a pretty rough year physically (had a foot op in March, 2nd time and had a hernia sideline me in August;  also am going through menopause) and mentally (mostly struggling with depression and some family situations (relationship with mother is not great, relationship with stepkids not great).  So yes, I have not been super happy for quite a while.  I don't have a lot of friends, mostly just acquaintances, people I know through hobbies, etc., but not deep relationships (with my husband, yes). 

Someone who is supposedly ""one of my best friends"" (her words) hasn't really had contact with me at all since July and things pretty much went really downhill with my mental state in August (I was training for a marathon and was sidelined by a herniated disc).  I DO sometimes complain about things on social media (Facebook) because I feel like I don't want to be that fake person online who pretends everything is ok.  

To cut this long story short, I contacted her, asked her what was up and she basically said she loved me but couldn't deal with my negativity and that I needed to deal with it and get rid of the bullshit.  I am still kind of floored by the response (it took her a week to respond by the way).  And all packaged up in a ""coming from a place of love"" way.   She's claimed to have gone through a real transition in life (she got involved in Druidry this summer.  Really.) and had no time for negativity and bullshit in her life anymore.

642,"So I (21f) met both of my current roommates a year and a half ago. Both were wonderful people. The first one (20m) was great and helped me through some hard times. I would complain to him about my roommates at the time and how they’d leave their dishes piled up and would never contribute to cleaning the apartment whatsoever. He assured me that he would never be like that and that he was super clean and hated slobs. The other roommate (20f) was great in class. She told me she had two different living situations fall through so we added her to our apartment last second. Everyone has their own room and own bathroom, we just share the kitchen, living room, small dining nook, pantry, and laundry room. 

After moving in, 20f became a problem. She’d leave her stuff everywhere, she wouldn’t put her dishes in the dishwasher, wouldn’t take out the trash and instead would just overfill it, wouldn’t do the clean dishes. The list goes on. She’s a slob who very clearly lived with her parents for 18 years of her life who must’ve always cleaned up after her. For one example, she asked if she could drink one of the sodas my roommate had, poured it in a cup, drank it, and put it on the drying rack without rinsing it or cleaning it. Like why would you do that? It’s just so annoying to live with her because she’s such a slob. If she does any projects, she leaves everything covering the kitchen counters and the tables. It’s just not considerate.  

My other roommate, 20m, used to not be a problem. But then it turned into “I’ll do the dishes tonight” and they wouldn’t get done. And he’d keep insisting he would get them done, and it wouldn’t, so I’d do it and then he’d say something like “oh but I was gonna do them tonight”. He does this in a lot of situations. If he didn’t switch his laundry, if his cat litter filled trash bag sat in the kitchen, if he had anything to do with cleaning or tidying, it took forever to get done or I’d end up doing it myself. It’s very annoying. When I would speak to him (because I’m closer to him than her) about her, he’d be on the same frustrated page as me but then after a day or two, he wouldn’t care and would tell me I’m over reacting. 

She is moving out soon, thank goodness, but both he and I signed our leases for next year already. I tried to switch apartments but my complex has a limit for in-complex apartment switches they allow, and they already met their quota. There’s a lot more than just the cleanliness that makes me want to move out, but I just got back (Sunday Feb 16th) from a relaxing weekend trip and saw that one of them has been taking the clean dishes out of the washer (I started it before I left on Friday Feb 14th) and while one of them cleaned the fridge out, they didn’t take out the overfilled trash (which was empty before I left and now wreaks like a dead animal). It’s super frustrating. I work two part time jobs and I’m a full time college student. They’re both in college too and both work a job so it’s incredibly annoying when I come home and they’re watching tv or something and there’s just a flipping mess in the communal areas. I sacrifice a lot of my time to contributing to the overall cleanliness but I feel like neither of them care. 

I just started therapy for some anxiety issues. One thing that came up is my lack of ability to communicate to others when they have upset me or are doing something I don’t like. Confronting people is something that my therapist and I are feeling out together, but I still need advice on how to handle my roommates. Therapy is only every two weeks, but I need help now.

649,"Idk where else to post this. So I‘m from a country where english tends to be the 3-4th language someone learns. First is obviously your native language, for most people that is either french, portugese or luxembourgish. Then you learn german anf french. And then you learn english when you‘re 13-14 and in some cases even not until you‘re 15-16. So obviously the level at which most teens speak is not comparable to that of other countries/native speakers. 

For me it‘s a bit different because I somehow got good at english really fast and then switched to english classes when I was 16, so now my english is extremely good for someone my age in my country who‘s not a foreigner. My friends... they speak english but there‘s always mistakes. They sometimes post english stuff to their stories and when I see the mistakes it just bugs me because I‘m sure someone will make fun of them for it.. but at the same time few people they know speak english as well as I do. 

An example: ‚seeing my baby walking on one of the famous street at this world makes me proud of him‘ (her boyfriend is in hollywood, visiting the walk of fame). Obviously there‘s a mistake in that sentence that‘s very clear to anyone who‘s either a native speaker or speaks english very well. 

Should I tell her or is that rude? I don‘t want to be the know-it-all friend that always gets on people‘s nerves for correcting their english.

When you are in a BR like apex and someone tells you he hit the enemy for more than half of his health with a sniper while HE DIDN'T EVEN SHOOT and you push in and find out he  just ruined your game it gets kind of annoying. I don't mind him not being good at any game really because he's my friend but him lying to me because he thinks it would make me think he's better hurts me quite a lot. I told him about it and we talked but nothing comes out of it. Thoughts ?,16Feb2020,1
657,"Hi everyone, I want to change my name legally but I have had mixed reactions on the name I prefer.

My name currently is a somewhat uncommon name but with a really uncommon spelling. After years of being called so many variations of my name (ex. calling someone whose name is Mya Mee-ya.) I have decided to change it so my accomplishments will not be undermined and easier in a professional setting.

However the last name I chose is Valentine and I have been receiving mixed reactions from it is cute to it sounds like a porn star name. I am looking for advice from strangers to see if it isn't truly a good choice.

To add more info, I am a 20 year old female, my partner of 3+ years likes the last name and would be willing to change their last name in the event we get married.",16Feb2020,1
658,"If you read this all, thank you. Would love to hear your thoughts and opinions. 

About 6 or so months ago I had met this guy, he lives about an hour half away from me. The first time we had ever met her brought his buddy along so it wouldn’t be awkward. After seeing him for the first time he had stated he wanted to come see me again but alone, which I was totally up for. After seeing him for the first time we mainly kept in contact over message and phone. Fast forward to sometime in January I got to see him multiple times. At first, it was just a hookup. I did ask if he had been seeing anyone else or hooking up with anyone else, the answer was always no. I didn’t mind at that point because I had not caught feelings yet as he was just someone I saw about once or twice a week for good sex. He soon started with the whole I miss you, I wanna see you, couple bs that you don’t say to just a hookup so. So again I had asked, are you seeing/hooking up with anyone? the answer was again no. I had said to him if he didn’t see a relationship ever and wanted just a hookup to stop with all the lovey cutesy bs. He went on this big rant about how he had got out of a 2.5-year relationship which ended six months ago. I should mention the girl cheated (if this story is even one bit true) on him with his best friend. He said the exact words of “you could be the most perfect person and I could love you more than anything, but the minute you cheat you are nothing to me and it's over”. Very fitting how this all ends up. lmao. Also another important “fact”. If it ended 6 months ago that would be August/September time frame and it would have started 2017 March/April timeframe. 
So pretty much he said he really liked me, enjoyed hanging out with me, but just wasn’t quite ready for a relationship. Which was totally okay with me, I was still trying to get to know him a little better. Fast forward to yesterday, after weeks of hanging out, kissing, having sex, sexting, nudes, doing everything you would in a relationship just without the title, I get a message from him. It's one of those “join cash app ill get the money you will too” messages. This message had his first and last name. Ding ding ding. Dumbass. I had remembered asking him if he had any social media, to which he again replied no (red flag that my dumbass missed) I never really thought anything of it. Now having his last name I thought why not look him up. Instagram first, found it with some girls’ name in his bio. Thinking maybe he just said he didn’t have social media because he doesn’t use it, I thought it was all old and just maybe not updated. Decided to look him up on Facebook, could you guess what I found? Yep, “in a relationship with blank”. I scrolled down his page thinking maybe he hasn’t updated it on there either, not the case. He was last on Facebook posting bs like a week ago. Decided to go to this girls' page and would you guess it again? “In a relationship with blank”. Her cover photo and the profile picture was a picture of the two of them together. I should also mention that it says they got into the relationship July of 2018, so not even two years. And she had updated her profile picture on December 20th, so he definitely couldn’t be out of the relationship, which looked pretty damn up to date, for more than a month or two. I had decided to confront him about it, I told him pretty much everything here and his one response was “ahh”. I told him I was a bit confused because his timeline of things wasn’t adding up and it all seemed up to date, his response to that was “understandable”. At this point I was furious so I just asked if he thought I was an idiot and would never figure any of this out? He proceeded to be a pussy ass bitch and leave every message on read than block me. So here I am with 40 different emotions not knowing how to feel. All I know is I hate that there are still slight feelings, but I know I want those gone because he is an absolute disgusting pos that deserves nothing good in life from love and I hope karma bites him in the ass. How can I move on faster?

So moral of the story also; if you are hiding anything, don’t let them know your last name. Or maybe don’t be a lying cheating pos and you shouldn’t have any issues.",16Feb2020,1

Both my mom and I agreed that I should just enjoy the rest of my “childhood” before I leave for the military because I’m doing so I will be officially and permanently moving out and becoming completely independent, yet my dad insists on me working now. To make matters worse, most jobs where I live require you to be 18 and by then I’ll only have a month and a half or so of working before I have to quit, I could get a job with a lower age requirement but even my dad says I wouldn’t be well fit for those jobs.

667,"Throwaway, as some people in real life know my username.

Instead of automatically choosing a valedictorian based on grades, my high school has a three-step process: interested students first hand in an application containing a resume and an essay detailing why they should be valedictorian. Then, a couple of people are chosen to give a short version of their speech to the committee. Finally, three people are shortlisted and the selection between them is put to a student vote.

A lot of my classmates have told me to run as I'm fairly involved in school (clubs, sports, and get good grades) and the community, but I never did any of that to receive recognition--they were all just activities that I genuinely enjoyed. One of my friends has wanted the title since, well, *ever*, and I'm sure that other applicants feel the same way.

On one hand, I'm not afraid of public speaking and would be fine speaking at commencement. I could (probably?) be a good representative for my class, a fraction of which has already said that they'd vote for me if I made it to the last round.

On the other hand, I know that other people want it more. We have a lot of amazing people interested in this and I personally think they'd all be fantastic. Plus, the final results are announced far too late in the year than to be useful for any applications--it's purely a speaking role at commencement, iirc.

678,"My little sister is 10 and my niece is 13. They’re both inseparable so my niece spends a lot of time at my house even though she lives 2 or 3 hours away. My niece has been in my grandparents custody for most of her life because her mother did a lot of drugs and since my grandpa passed away, she’s been living with his ex wife (who is very naive and has no idea how to handle children).

This morning I came downstairs to hear my niece and little sister on the phone with someone with a deep voice. Immediately I was unsettled and asked who it was, to which my niece responded with, “my boyfriend Shawn”. (I’m not hiding his name- I hope he sees this and knows how much he disgusts me).

I ask how old he is and she says sixteen and I flipped shit. My niece JUST turned 13 and she is literally in middle school dating someone in high school who is old enough to drive a car and get a job. Not to mention she looks significantly younger than she is- at first glance she looks nine. She hasn’t even gotten close to being half way through puberty. She is incredibly young looking, incredibly high risk, and incredibly naive. I was groomed as a child by an older boy and it almost ruined my life so hearing this I went into an absolute panic. 

I grabbed the phone and told this guy that he is a disgusting creep and a freak, and to go hit on someone his own age. I then hung up the phone and explained to my niece that men who “date” children are groomers and that it’s genuinely not ok. She then told me her guardian (my ex grandmother) was completely ok with the relationship and actually paid for this boy to fly out and stay with them for a week over Christmas. 

I was shocked and disgusted and ran upstairs, crying from anger, to find my mother. My mom got angry when I explained and said she knew about Shawn already and that he’s “not like that” and that “he’s immature and there’s nothing wrong with it”. Listening to this guy on the phone he sounds like he’s 20. My niece looks like a complete child. My mom insists that it’s fine, but I don’t think there’s any exceptions to the rules. If you’re old enough to pass as an adult and do adult things, you’ve got no business going after CHILDREN. If they were both at least in high school I guess I’d understand. But she’s in 7th grade and he is at least a sophomore in high school. 

I told my mom what I said to him and she told me it was rude and inconsiderate. I then left my house and haven’t returned. I’ve been crying in my friends car for 3 hours. I love my niece so much and I don’t want to watch her go down the same road her mother did. I’m not her guardian and can’t control anything but I feel so sickened that my mom won’t stand up to her mother in law and realize how genuinely sick this is.

Am I crazy? Is there ANYTHING I can do? Please help.

679,"Hello Everybody.

  
Recently I've been going through a messy end to the relationship with my girlfriend. We had been together since the summer of 2016, when we met at the College leavers dance. I had always seen her around the campus and really come to like her, we had gone to the same school together before starting so I had known of her too. I approached her to finally talk to her and after a little bit of talking, and drinking, she agreed to dance with me. It was the most fantastic feeling ever and afterwards we kept talking on FB for a few months until we got together as a 'couple'.   


Things were going well for us for about two years until late 2018 when she started acting off around me. She started to have wild mood swings and kept talking about how I weren't the sort of person that someone like her should be seen associating with. This put me off a bit so we didn't talk for a couple of weeks. Later though she came back to me and started messaging me again and told it was just a result of her 'hormonal fluctuations'. 

The thing that ended our relationship came in December last year, just after Christmas when I asked her to marry me. She told me that the present that I had bought her in London, a Taylor &amp; Hart engagement ring wasn't good enough for a girl whose father was the head of a multinational company and that if I wanted to get her to marry me to take the ring back and do better. This obviously put me at odds with her and made me distance myself with her. The straw that broke the camel's back came I talked with her brother who told me that none of her family thought that someone like me deserved a girl of her, who's got connections in the higher echelons of society.  I broke it off nearly the next day (on New Years Eve) and have not spoke to her since then. 

The reason I wanted to write to you at r/advice is to find advice in what steps I can take to forget this moment in my life, I really don't want to remember it because the thoughts just upset me too much. I have consulted our families psychologist whom my father uses for mental relief at times and he has suggested that I just try to put the events behind me and get on with living, as nothing can be done. I wanted to know if there is any medicinal or psychological practices that could be done to forget this period in my life.

682,"
I'm a female, Canadian high school student who just turned eighteen, and the friend in question is fifteen and a half. We met through a mutual friend who introduced us at a local club we both went to. I’m in grade twelve, he’s in grade ten, and our mutual friend is in grade eleven. 

We have a lot in common, so we got along great. Over maybe a year or so, we’ve become close enough friends to hang out at lunch, and a few times after school with mutual friends. We have similar interests, senses of humour, and personalities. (We even got the same score on the Myers Brigs quiz, if that means anything.)

The problem is that I think I’m developing a crush on him. I’m Asexual, Bi-romantic, and don’t get many crushes, so it came as a bit of a surprise. The feelings are romantic and platonic, not sexual at all, but I do find him objectively cute. He’s also one of the nicest guys I’ve ever been friends with. 

In Canada, our age of consent laws allow an age gap of up to five years as long as neither party involved is in a position of power over the other. (The law states: A 14 or 15 year old can consent to sexual activity as long as the partner is less than five years older and there is no relationship of trust, authority or dependency or any other exploitation of the young person.) So technically, the feelings aren’t illegal, and we could date if he felt the same way, but it feels wrong since he’s two and a half years younger. 

I mentioned this to my mom, and she gave the classic “age is just a number” speech. She said things like: “if you did date, no one would care when you’re twenty-two and twenty-five.” My best friend said something similar, and encouraged me to ask him out. I didn’t. In fact, hearing them talk that way just reinforced how weird it felt to me—like they were both trying to tell me to justify something inherently wrong to myself. 

I’ve tried ignoring this for a while because he’s one of my favourite friends to hang out with. He’s away on a student-exchange right now, and having him gone is probably what solidified my feelings—made me realize how much I enjoyed having him around, and why. We’d laugh and show each other a lot of memes, make weird jokes, and t-pose when approaching each other from opposite ends of a hallway. Our friendship is fun, and I value it.

I’m perfectly happy just being his friend. I’d never want to make him uncomfortable, or make him feel like I’m taking advantage of him in any way, but I’m not sure what to think of myself right now. Should I continue being his friend, and ignore the fact that this crush might become stronger? He’s the first person this much younger than me that I’ve had a crush on, but am I inherently a bad person for developing feelings? Is it weird that I’m perfectly fine being around him in a purely platonic context, and that I don’t want our friendship to end? Should I end it anyways for his sake? 

I’m not sure what to think, and I’d appreciate some outside advice from someone besides my mom.",16Feb2020,1

689,"I’m a 23 yo female in CA, 24 tomorrow. I am born in the same 8 days as my sister and dad. My sister is the 14th, I’m the 17th, and my dad is the 21st. My sister just had a huge party with all her friends and activities and a sleepover. She just turned 15. The day after, today, my Mom admitted they hadn’t really bought anything for me, and they wanted to celebrate tonight, but we could go clothes shopping for clothes I could wear while substitute teaching. 

I’ve never been really a clothes-makeup girl. My mom never taught me makeup, but we bought some overpriced crap makeup for me one birthday, her favorite brand, with a sales associate putting on powders after powders.  I never even knew liquid concealer existed as a teenager. That would have worked miracles for me, growing up with awful acne. 

We also never do what I want to do on my birthday. Ever since I was a kid, I have tried to get my parents to watch Avatar the Last Airbender with me, my favorite show that we kids sneakily watched, because anime wasn’t allowed in the household. It has always been a no, and then turning on something else. Last time, my sister suggested a really crappy lion and tiger movie from the 80s because my uncle worked with the cats on site. 

I don’t want to invite any of my friends to the house. They’re from the SCA (medieval reenactment) and we play DnD. They’re also much older than me and most are parents. I know my family would probably think they’re weird people.  I also can’t invite my best friend group, because they live in VA/WA, and we meet online to play DnD on Roll20.  

I usually have a rushed, last minute setup, where nothing really feels like it is a celebration of my existence or interests. Should I just ask them to stop celebrating my birthday?  Or throw a second birthday party somewhere else, with my closer friends?  I dunno. It feels weird to plan my own party, and I’ve never done it before, and I wouldn’t expect many people to show up. 

This is kind of a long rant at this point, but I’m looking for input/advice/commentary. I know this is a “nothing” problem in comparison to everyone else’s problems here, but I usually just end up really sad around my birthday, and I want it to stop.",16Feb2020,1
690,"I (22F) live with one other girl (22F) in separate rooms. We both agreed we can have our boyfriends can come over whenever,  but her and her boyfriend weren't cool with my boyfriend roaming around the place without a shirt on. When my boyfriend does come over, he doesn't wear a shirt in my room and we keep the door cracked open, so our cats can come in and out for their food and water. This girl and I have only lived together for a month, but she likes to send a lot of texts about small things that aren't really issues to me (the brita didn't have enough water, there was some spilled water on the table) and recently she texted me saying that I need to keep my door closed when we aren't fully clothed. She's texted me so much about stuff that has only happened once and I'm losing my patience. I feel like she can just not look into my room since it's literally cracked open 2 inches. I texted her saying I already keep my door closed when we are naked, but that my door needs to be cracked for my cats, but I just feel really irritated that she's sending me texts about everything and now she's trying to tell me what I can do in my own room. I just don't understand why she feels the need to text about every single minor inconvenience. Our place is spotless at all times, we never see each other because our schedules are different, and she last minute sprung on me that her boyfriend is basically going to live here and I don't really care as long as he pays some utilities.

Some months ago my father gave me his old phone because mine broke. In the bin (or trash can or however it's called in English) of the Gallery app I found several screenshots of live chat models, and some pics of my dad's...you know (something no one wants to see). I let him know I saw that after 2 days of me not being able to think at work, just debating with myself about the matter. I only mentioned his photos and told him to be careful and not sending them to anyone, implying that my mother is and can only be the solitary addressee.
That was that and I tried to leave it behind, but today it took a turn:
I was using his tablet for a sec and curiosity got the better of me and I checked his browser history...For several weeks he has been visiting a web called LiveJasmine, which is for live cams, and I sincerely was devastated. I checked and saw he had created a false email to browse, and when I checked his Gmail my soul sunk. 3 days ago after midnight, ,meaning just before St.Valentine's, he had spent up to 110 € in that website. I investigated and looked up reviews and info about how the site works and found out you pay when you private chat with one of the girls, and the web disguises the payment as a banking fee. I am completely shocked. I don't know what to do know so I came here to talk to strangers because I feel I cannot talk to anyone I know about this matter.",16Feb2020,1

My family believes strongly it was a miracle, my friends and the people around me believe it was a miracle and that I am just fine. But I’m not. 

I have pain constantly down the left side of my body which skid against the pavement for about 15 feet. It swelled almost double the size of my leg and it’s still swollen a year and a half later. I’ve tried stretches and exercises but nothing has helped.

I think I got a concussion and suffer from Post traumatic stress making hard to drive or trust anyone while walking or going around any cars.

I feel stuck, because I’m looked up upon as a leader in my school and community, My family doesn’t believe me when I’ve tried talking to them about it and I feel pressured to maintain my status as a leader and roll model.

697,"About me

I am 19 years old and always have been a bit of an entrepreneur, I recently decided I wanted to start a social media marketing business and having been improving my skillset ever since. I have been investing in stuff and Stocks since I was 17 years and worked a lot and have around 11K right now. I worked like 30 hours a week in my final year in high school and had three part time jobs during my exams and managed to pass without failing any subjects. I read business related books and have micro-accredation in macro-economy and am learning to program, I also watch a lot educational videos and I did a lot to improve my english (I live in Europe). I am a little shy and not the most talkative person, but I get along well with other people. I believe I am smarter and more mature than the average person (but most people probably think the same). My hearth beat is irregular sometimes, this is likely because of the stress I have. I chose to have 1 year off after I finished high school.


My parents

I have asian parents, my mother is kind of controlling, but she  cares for me, but my dad is always shouting and has serious anger problems and is emotionally abusive.

 To name one example: he was shouting to me and telling to close the door while he was 3 meters away, I said okay. He kept repeating the same question while shouting and I was giving the same answers, because I frustated that he was shouting for no reason and I was gonna do it if he went away or said it in a normal manner. He decided to get the entire door out and kept shouting to put the door back and I said I didn't know how to do so and he left in anger

Story 2: we went to the store and he said to me that he couldn't find his phone and I called it when I was just outside the car. Inside the car he asked me to call it and I say that I already tried that. The next day he comes to me and he shouts to me that the phone was in the car and that he cried about what kind of children he has(I couldn't hear it through the car apperently).

From time to time he tells me that I should pretend I don't have a dad or tell people he is dead, because I act distant and don't talk much with him. He is not working because he was injured, he got over it, but still gets government support while my mother is working and I still talks about how we (his children) should do more and how he is busy with work. I can't do anything productive when he is just shouting to my mother or sibling or shouting over the phone, I just can't I told him that multiple times. My father was once in a big discussion with my brother because my brother was mad because all the shouting and my father asked questions can't I talk then? Do you not want to be with me? And he responded no, and it has now cooled down, this was 3 days ago. When he asks me the same stuff I always respond with: why do you ask? Whattttt? He scolds so much that it is just normal for me if he calls me an idiot for spilling some tea or dropping a book. Should note that I still ask for money to the barber, etc. and they say I should pay for those things and maybe they are right about that. Although they are always broke because they go on expensive vacations to visit family. My father owes me a decent amount of money for quite some time wich I repeatedly asked for, but I am not likely to see that back tough.

I am now planning to to follow a course to get a job as finance advisor and live somewhere else and work multiple side-hustles until I can live from just my side-hustles. I want to leave my home so bad. I have only finished high school if it becomes obvious my side-hustles don't work at all and it isn't meant to be I will go to college and get student loans to make it through and start working part-time. To improve my chances of getting a better paying job.

 I really need someone to objectively look at my situation to tell me if it is right? To tell me that my dad isn't as bad as I make it look like or that is just my fault. It is just such a big decision for me and I am likely to anger a lot of people by doing this, I am not sure if I am just gonna go and tell them I am just gonna work there and it is easier to live there and do it without their approvement (because they won't let me do it, I have to force my way out) or tell them the truth and do it.

699,"I approached a manager in a different department for career advice and he agreed to meet with me. When we met my anxiety got the better of me and I was afraid he would think it was weird or be annoyed that I came to him for help since we don’t talk. I opened with an apology, to which he seemed very confused and uncomfortable. I literally froze up for what seemed like an eternity and struggled for words. He said it was ok and to take my time, he had to prod me for information and finally we got around to the actual conversation, although because I was so nervous I didn’t even get to ask him everything I wanted to. He said he would have to think about how he could help and get back to me. 

I am humiliated about the way I handled this and froze up. He said it was ok and not to worry about it, but I have been reeling in embarrassment. I don’t know how I am supposed to face him again and I’m dreading going back to work tomorrow. 

I’m really worried that maybe he’s said something to my direct manager about it or this will be an issue because I think I made him uncomfortable. I was really nervous because he is someone I really respect and admire career wise, and here I am floundering around like a teenager with a crush when he gives me 5 mins of his time.

Does anyone have any ideas on what to say to him the next time I see him, or how to recover from this situation in general?

700,"Hello all, thank you for taking the time to read this. 

Basically, what happened is that my laptop (that I paid for completely mind you) experienced a power surge and the motherboard fried. I found a computer repair shop where I lived and I gave it to them so that they could replace the motherboard. I paid $400 to replace the motherboard and after a week, they stated that the battery had also shorted out so I had to pay an extra $60 to replace that. 

Long story short, the motherboard arrived, but due to the incompetence of the repairman, the battery (which was ordered from china) didn't arrive after a staggering **2 MONTHS** and I am now receiving all of the money that I spent on the parts back. Basically, the repairman wasted 2 months and a half of my time only to just give me all of my money back. 

Here's where I'm stuck on a decision. Once I get all of the money back, I'm at a loss for what to do. I am an aspiring photograph and web developer who needs a solid computer that will allow me to edit videos, edit photos, develop websites, and more higher end things. I am also a dual-enrolled high-school/college student that is graduating with an HS Diploma and Associate's Degree in May 2020 (yay me!) which means that I also need the computer for school-related purposes. The computer that I had previously fit the bill for these tasks nicely. It was a base model Macbook Pro 2017 13.3 inch if you're curious. However, now that computer is no longer functioning and I am using a lower powered computer that is not very good compared to what I had before. It still functions for the basic college tasks and some web development as well but I hate the idea of using this computer as my main computer due to it being underpowered as stated before. This computer is a base model Surface Pro 4 if you are also curious. 

I am also currently poor because I only work between 10-25 hours per week depending on demand at my job in a retail store which means that money is definitely a major constraint. What would your advice be for me in regards to this situation that I am going through right now? 

tl:dr; Previous computer that was good no longer works and repairing is not an option, currenty computer serves 60% of my needs but it's not very good compared to previous one I had, don't have the money for a new one.",16Feb2020,1

Ok so I meet this girl in a stream, she was a viewer that joined and was playing with the streamer and a stream or two later I do the same and play with the streamer (plus we both end up being really good friends with the streamer) So we both end up joining and playing on PS4 parties with this streamer and start becoming friends. We talk to each other during the streams and turns out that she's pretty cool and that she's from Australia(I'm American) and how she was 15, me being 19 at the time. So we hung out on these parties more and more. I didn't really think much of it because it just seemed like we were become good friends.

Cut to nine months later, I and she introduced me to a new friend of her's. Another guy but only 14, we start playing like normal, but this new guys is talking to her and make her laugh and stuff. I start getting jealous and start not liking the kid(even though he started talking about a crush he has with a different girl). We all finish playing and said goodbye and stuff but that night I kept thinking about her and how I wanted to make her laugh, And that's when started to realized I liked her. We played more in the following weeks but the kid is there too and I don't really like that. So I started to talk about how we never talk outside these parties. She then tells me that she has a snap chat and that we can talk there. I immediately make a snap chat and we talk.

We start talking for hours, I would stay up to around 7am. She always telling me to go to sleep because she doesn't want me to be sleep deprived she says she care about my health, but I just say no playfully we both just talk no games or anything just talk.(and I think she likes me too, but this is just hopeful thinking I could be way off). I don't want to scare her or make things awkward but I really like her, but I really like her.

However I also recently developed strong feeling for a girl who I only just recently got to know and I obviously can't tell her I feel this way as she just got with a boy I know. This isn't the problem I just seem to be catching feelings for people who I cant have, or who are currently in a relationship after extensive research I narrowed it down to I may have a problem committing and that's why I go for people I can't have (i haven't hugged/kissed my parents for anything eg goodnight or as a thanks since I was 11 unless they force me to I'm 14 btw) and this could also tie into how I could possible have aspd more commonly known as a person who is a sociopath, the symptoms can be searched up but narrowed down they: Rarely show emotions, don't think about critical things can show aggressive or aggravated behaviour, lack of remorse and using humour, intelligence and or charisma to manipulate people. (My wont get me tested for anything unless they feel its necessary) but many of my friends say this defines who I am, so this ties down to the fact that i may not be able to commit and I just need help. How do I help to fix or improve on this due to the previous symptoms everyone just calls me edgy or an emo and the girls I like are always seeing someone and that doesn't help, plus no one will willingly 'crush' on me due to my coldness so i dont know how I could proceed in getting a gf or fixing my commitment problem.

723,"So I'm a 16y/o female student. And there is a teacher at my school, and I kinda fell in love with her. She is 26 and is also a lesbian or bi. Through my school she helped me a lot with problems, in personal life as well as problems in school. Although she doesn't teach me anymore we still have good contact with eachother. So this Valentine I sent her a rose, cuz I know she is having a hard time and I just wanted to let her know that she is a great person and was my favorite teacher. She helped me with writing a motivation letter to a camp. And I wanted to thank her for everything so I thought maybe it's a good idea to write her a letter/card. But I don't want her to think I have a crush on her or something. I hate my feelings for her and I try as hard as I can to run away from them and hide them. I don't want to make things awkward... So should I write her a letter/card or not?   Is it weird to send her a letter?

726,"TL;DR: got a job in nyc and planned to move there (close to my best friend) but I hate the new job and hate the city. Commuting 4 hours per day in the meantime.

After graduating college, I (M/27) got my first I.T. job at that college and continued living at home nearby. So I never really left college, home, or my hometown. Never got to truly feel like an adult. Job was boring (desktop support) but easy. Don't have much in the way of marketable skills or goals/ambition but managed to find another desktop support job in nyc after a long search. Thought a change of environment would be good for me (always liked the city), having another company on my resume would look good, that I'd get to spend more time with my friend, and have much more opportunities for gay dating.

Well, the job sucks and is a demotion in many ways. There's nothing redeemable about it, pay sucks, and I don't see myself even walking away from it after a year with any new skills or projects. I can't start looking for another job since I still have no skills or ambition, and I'd now have a gap on my resume since I'd have to leave off a job I've been at for only 2 months. 

I was so apathetic about apartment hunting that I gave up. I'd look at listings and go, ""yup, that's a bedroom. Yup, that's a shower. Yup, this is a neighborhood."" So I spend a ton of time and money on commuting daily. And I realize that any appeal of the city would be lost on me since I'm a miserable hermit. I'm an extremely light sleeper, so I would literally never get any sleep with all the noise. 

So I continue to feel like a loser for still living at home and for having a crappy job while the rest of my ""friends"" have much better, higher-paying jobs and to me, seem generally ""further along"" in their lives. Living at home sucks since I'm always bickering with mom. What do you think I should do?",16Feb2020,1

728,"Hi everyone so I have severe, severe social anxiety. And funny enough, my job is centered around talking to hundreds of people on the phone and in person. Now, that has definitely helped my anxiety but I still have some issues in my private life about it. 

So my boyfriend is very social and can make friends with everybody. We share some of the same friends, which I’m okay with hanging out with them I just sometimes am very quiet. Once in a while, he’ll spring these last minute outings with people I’ve never met before. It would be like the day before he would tell me. 

After working and talking to people all week, I get super anxious when it’s my day off and I have to put up a charade and am always uncomfortable. The thing is, I can’t say no to him. He can be extremely manipulative to get what he wants sometimes, and he says he does this to me so I can “get better”. I can see where he’s coming from, but my work is helping me improve it. 

I wouldn’t necessarily mind doing stuff like that if he gave me notice so I can prepare (pathetic, I know) but I nearly break down when he makes the decision to go out with people.

730,"Hey guys, this is an annoying one.

My roommate buys oil- and just “deep fry’s” stuff on the stove. She leaves the old oil in the pan, or a bowl, or a cup.. for days. Weeks, sometimes.

Every time I tell her to stop, she laughs and says she will, but she has nothing to put the old oil in. I’ve now invested research into this myself, and have told her how to dispose of it. (I.e mason jar and then garbage). She still, leaves it there for days, and says she doesn’t have any jars. I’ve told her to maybe... not make a mess if she can’t clean it. Hasn’t stuck yet. 

Anyway, I’m really reaching my wits ends over here. It’s annoying the shit out of me, because everything will be clean, and then there’s a pot of disgusting oil on the counter. Can’t use the pot, can’t even put the pot in her room or she’ll probably punch me.. I don’t know how to get past this. We have like a three year plan to live together..  but this is a dealbreaker for me. I HATE cleaning oil up all the time. I don’t even use oil myself, save for times when I’ve forgotten to pick up butter. It’s so disgusting and it’s one thing I absolutely refuse to clean up for her. (And I do voluntarily and happily clean lots of her stuff. Vape, bong, etc..) 

Anyway, help me convince her that it’s absolutely disgusting. I’ll probably just print this whole post out and give it to her. She seems to think that it’s very normal to do this, so I’m hoping the proof that it’s absolutely not will get her to clean up after herself, and get rid of my stress.",16Feb2020,1
731,"(this may be long. Will just put a tl;dr note in the end) 

Hello, I'd like to ask for general advice about this. As the title suggests, I am quite stuck in life and don't know how to move forward. I'm not sure if this is the right community to post this in, but I'll take what I can get. Also, *trigger warning*, some parts talk about depression and suicide.

So hello, please call me CK. I'm 22 and I graduated from college less than a year ago. I've had clinical depression since 2011, and have been on and off depression meds since 2018. I thought I was doing okay around mid-2016 to early 2017, but stuff happened that led to my old friends bullying me. So around mid-2017, I've been a trainwreck going around circles of days, mostly bad and rarely good.

Anyway, I also started working on my thesis in 2017. During that time I was also the head of the organization I was part of, all while juggling my thesis and a stressful home environment. From then, I felt everything go downhill. It affected my already declining mental health severely that I would cry out of nowhere and have requently recurring anxiety attacks. That continued on through mid-2018, until finally my mother believed that I was sick. I was on meds from mid to late 2018, until my thesis adviser returned from her maternity leave and continued advising me on my thesis.

December 2018, two days after my successful thesis defense, my 5y/o dog died of an accident. I was devastated and since then, I've felt all of my being shut down, with only the emergency facilities left running. I don't remember a huge chunk of what happened from early 2019 until my graduation in June of the same year.

Come June 2019, I moved out after I got my first job. It was a start-up and I was the only employee. When I went to my job interview, I wasn't in the right head space and I ended up signing a contract that bound me to the company for two years. I was with the company for two months, until I couldn't handle the pressure my boss was putting on me (I was expected to work overtime every day without overtime pay). It took a toll on me and made me crash into another depressive season. Good thing my former boss understood, so she let me go, under the condition that she wouldn't give my last pay.

Since I was basically living on my own, I had to find a job right away so I could pay for rent and everything else. I found a job two weeks later at another start-up. Pay was good, government benefits were paid, had a lively office and good officemates. I thought things were going to be better for me, until to weeks into the job, standards kept changing and I started to miss my quota. Since we were given performance scores, I would try to meet my daily quota by coming in early and leaving late. That would mean coming into the office at 7AM and leaving at around 9PM. Again, no overtime pay. Even then, I got various written reprimands for not meeting my quota within work hours. After a month and a half, I was suspended for a week. A few days after that, I was terminated. The worst thing about my termination wasn't that it was sudden, it's that they didn't even let me finish the day. At 10AM, 2hrs short from lunch time, I was told to pack my things and leave immediately. I felt so deeply embarrassed and shamed.

Since then, I haven't looked for a regular job. I've been freelancing since then, but it doesn't pay much. Every time I try to apply for another job, I'd get anxious that it might turn out the same way as my last job, and that I might get terminated and shamed just like last time. A lot of my friends and family have been pressuring me to get a job because I've been jobless for almost 4mos now. They tell me it's a great shame that I graduated from the top university when I'm jobless.

Honestly, right now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel so directionless and lost. I've been having suicidal thoughts since I got terminated, and if I had any energy left I'm pretty sure I would be gone by now. Yet here I am, miserably stuck and having trouble moving forward. If you've gone through a similar situation or have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I may be depressed but I don't want to stay depressed. I want to be able to take steps towards healing because despite the overwhelming urges to kill myself, there's a small glint of persistence in me to live and see things through. I don't want to be miserable anymore.

I'd be grateful for any advice. Thank you so much for reading.

732,"It was Saturday afternoon and I got offered wine,  long story short, I ended up drinking the whole bottle. While drunk my friend's girlfriend asked if I wanted to come over and said she had alcohol, and I was severely intoxicated so I didn't think it was a bad idea at all, so I said yes and I went to her house. We go up to her room and we were just talking and joking around, I noticed she was flirting with me a little bit and I assumed it was the alcohol talking and pushed her away. Flash forward a few minutes later and we were both on the bed listening to music and it got really quiet all of a sudden, and without warning we both started making out. 

Even though I was drunk as shit, there was still a small voice inside of me telling me to stop, but I didn't and I kept going. We made out for about 10 minutes until all of a sudden we decided it's best that we stop before we go too far. After that we go back to talking and pretending that didn't happen. 

I decide to go home and nothing else happened between us, and I'm glad nothing else happened. It's now the next day and I feel this pit of guilt in my stomach, I've never felt so guilty in my life. She was my friend's girlfriend, and it hit me when I got home what just happened. I started panicking and feeling like shit. If he finds out what happened I could lose my friendship with that person and I really don't want that to happen. I really care about my friend and I like him a lot, and I feel like a fucking idiot. I don't feel like getting up from my bed and even since I got home yesterday I've been feeling like there's pit in my stomach.

I don't know what I should do. I feel extremely guilty and I can't look him in the eye unless I tell him what happened, but if I tell him not only will he be extremely hurt but we will probably stop being friends and I really don't want that to happen. On top of that his girlfriend also feels guilty and wants to tell him. 

Should I tell him? Is it a positive thing that all we did was kiss? Does the alcohol have something to do with this or should I blame it all on me? Do you think if he finds out he'll understandably be mad but ""not cut ties with me"" mad?

740,"So as the title says I am a senior in high school. Throughout my high school experience I have been a relatively quiet and reserved person who kinda hung out on the edge of the ""main bubble"" of people at my school. For the entirety of my 4 years I have kept pretty much the exact same friends that I have been hanging out with since middle school and I absolutely love them and would do anything for them. However recently, a couple of my friends from my group have really found themselves a lot deeper in the main  bubble and have begun talking to other people and even have gotten girlfriends as a result. Personally I could not feel happier for them and find enjoyment just talking with them about there experiences and such. I feel like it's important to note I am not scared of them moving away from me as a friend so that is not my problem. Due to seeing two of my best friends have this entire other life it seems like it has begun to make me feel quite lonely and left out. I want to try and get into the bubble somehow or just a bubble, but I feel as a senior it is kinda hard to move my way in as the friendships seem to have been found and developed already. I have talked to my two friends about this and it feels like there is not much I can do. The reason they got into the bubble comes from them being invited to a couple of get togethers    
a person or two that were in the bubble already. I feel like for some reason I have not been able to get that kind of opportunity, most likely due to something I have done or haven't done. My friends have told me that they feel I have begun to change personality wise and have started to become more social as a result which is good. I just want to be able to make my last semester of highschool great and maybe have the opportunity to take someone to prom. I also want to break my cycle of waking up, going to school, going to extracurricular, going home, playing video games/homework and sleeping. I was thinking about asking my two friends that are in the bubble to maybe try and invite me to a couple get together opportunities and see if I could Integrate myself in and become a part of the group but I feel like that is too much to ask and if they wanted me there they would have already invited me. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I  should do and how they would try and deal with my situation if they were me.

744,"Context:

I live in a flat of 6 people; we're all university students on different courses. We're not in university accommodation, we're with a private letting agency. When we all moved in we got on well, there were no issues between us. However, for the past 5 months one of our flatmates, whom I'll refer to as Josh, has shown themselves to be incredibly lazy and inconsiderate to the rest of the flat.

He's a small breakdown of the issues we have with 'Josh' :
- Josh is a very big fan of cooking, however this enthusiasm does not translate into cleaning up after himself. Every morning we wake up to dirty pots and pans still on the hob, plates and cutlery covered in food left out on the table, surfaces covered in food and left sticky, and the sink filled with the items Josh could be bothered to move.
- Josh's girlfriend, despite having her own place, lives with Josh most of the time, this means the amount of washing up is twice as much as it would be otherwise.
- When Josh can be bothered to wash up, he doesn't put his stuff away. Josh will keep his stuff in the drying rack to avoid having to put it back in his cupboards, which means there's never any space for the rest of the flat to dry our stuff, we have to dry up our stuff as soon as we've washed it.
- When Josh runs out of space in the drying rack he will just put his stuff on the table, and this also applies to items such as cereals and other foods. Josh once took up a third of the table in the kitchen just to store his stuff because he couldn't be bothered to put it away in his cupboards.
- Josh has started smoking weed in his room, however not out of his window, meaning at any given time we can come back to our whole flat smelling of weed. 
- Josh has never once taken the bins out, or given the kitchen an entire clean since moving in, nor has he contributed to buying bin bags, washing up liquid, or other communal commodities.
- Josh will bring his personal rubbish into the kitchen for others to take out for him, although this stopped shortly when we would just pile his personal rubbish outside his door for him to deal with. 
- He has openly left drugs out in the kitchen.
- He uses people's kitchen appliances without asking, does not wash them up, and either leaves them out or puts them back still covered in food.
- He has started taking people's food and drinks without asking.
- We have a small coffee table in the kitchen piled with his stuff that he has not bothered to clean up or put away.
- We've talked to him on many occasions and he always slips back into his original habits.

748,"Growing up, it was just me and my mom.  When I moved to college \~3 hours away from home, my mom asked me to call her every Sunday.  So almost every Sunday for \~10 years I've called, she told me her week, and I told her my week.  When college was over, most of my friends were local to the college area, so I moved and found a job in the same area.

But I've started feeling different about calling recently.  I'm starting to feel uncomfortable with sharing as much as she wants.  When I told her my boss was going to give out raises soon, she started asking every week about it, even though I told her I'd give her an update when I had one.  She asks about my love life every week, and again, I say there's no updates, because there are none.  I've asked her repeatedly to stop bringing these subjects up, but she does anyways and then apologizes when I mention it.  I don't think there's any actual issues with her memory, though.

Also, most weeks, there's no updates on her side either.  It feels like I'm calling just to have what feels like an hour long empty conversation.  And so, I had asked, almost crying, if we could talk every other week.  She got very mad and hung up, but texted an hour or so later again apologizing.  She eventually agreed to every other week, but has started calling me the Sundays when I don't call.  This started about a month or two ago.

She has mobility issues, and she has a helper come in a few times a week and will even drive her places so she can go out and about, but not as much as she'd like.  I don't want to move closer to her because all my friends are here.  I still visit on July 4th and Christmas, and call/send cards on birthdays and major holidays.

But I honestly don't know what to do because I know these calls mean a lot to her, and I don't want to stop calling completely.  I want to not feel resentful when I do call and regretful when I don't.  Is this an acceptable boundary or am I being an ungrateful child?  What should I do?",16Feb2020,1

Its not all bad, of course. I have a very lovely and kind Wife, a decent family, and I'm in the process of obtaining my first bachelors degree in I.T. Unfortunately, the good does NOT outweigh the bad, not even close.

I can deal with the pain that is constant in my joints, the head-splitting migraines, and the fatigue. BUT, I cannot deal with the level of panic/anxiety I experience on a regular basis, the physical sensations that come with it, and the dread about the future because of it. I have seen therapists and psychiatrists every week for 11 years now, and they have helped to maintain my level of sanity (for the most part), but my patience has worn thin. 

Every single time I leave the house I get dizzy and nauseous.

Every time I have a minor toothache, I worry I will need another tooth extraction or root canal (I take great care of my teeth, but rheumatoid messes up your saliva and now I have dry mouth all the time) The thought of having another panic attack while at the dentist; sweaty, scared, and nauseous is too much to bear.

My joints are being eaten and the meds that are supposed to treat it make me feel like I have cancer, and in fact, the meds are actually low dose chemo (methotrexate). The idea of having to be put in a hospital for a surgery is TOO much to bear. 

Anything in the future that causes any discomfort causes me immense dread and fear.

I am so fucking tired of living. I want to sleep. I want to sleep forever, and I would be VERY disappointing if I reincarnated.  Alas, I cannot kill myself because that would hurt those around me, so I am stuck. I pray to a god that I don't believe in that I get hit by a car at least 2X a week.

Not sure if there is any help for me, but I hope someone can help me.

Soooo I am being constantly contacted by my ex with new accounts and any way she can. We’ve been broken up for a year now because after a year she really started showing her insanity. Very manipulative and vindictive. Once we broke up the messages started. Like 100’s of texts within an hour and it just kept getting worse. So naturally I blocked her on EVERYTHING! Which then she of course made new accounts to spam me. One day I woke up to over 300 texts and 100 calls. Now today! Today is the reason I’m finally reaching out to the internet to see what I can do. Somehow she got into my email, my Twitter, Facebook, insta and my snapchat! All of it. She unblocked herself on everything, sent terrible shit to people, tried to start shit with some people and just is trying to make a mess of everything. Not the first time she’s tried to make a mess of my life. She has also tried to get me fired from my work by going to HR and saying I was harassing her, I tried to knock her up on purpose and that I sold her nudes (I have never done any of those things.. deleted her nudes once we broke up).

760,"So, as the title implies, this is about the situation in South Korea with Coronavirus. Right now, me and my mum have plane tickets ( which are really pricey tbh ) to South Korea, which we literally bought two days before the outbreak. I've been really hoping to go for ages, and this trip is supposed to be my birthday and Christmas present, and I used some of my own money to get tickets. 
Right now, it's my half term and the last time I can really go before my GCSEs take over my life- studying etc. The next time I will be able to go realistically is after my GCSEs in 2021, but maybe even 2022 because of the ( Summer ) ticket price ( £1,000+ per ticket ) and college. 
However,,, 
With the recent outbreak of Corona, and the virus being present in Korea ( I think 28-29 quarantined infections ) which although are being handled very well, the most recent case - today - came from an unknown origin and nobody knows how the man got it. My Korean family are concerned that if both me and my mum went, and I contracted the virus then it could be, well, chaotic. 
Essentially going would be a gamble that could end in probably 3 different ways. 
Almost 99.9% - I go and I'm fine 
Incredibly slim chance - I go and I get corona, and am held in Korea and quarantined. 
Incredibly slim chance - I go and I leave, after 14 days I show symptoms of Corona and we find that I've infected the whole school. 
Although my mum will have the final decision, I know that at the end of the day what I do will also influence the decision, and I want to be personally fully convinced on what happens next.

762,"Hey. So, as the title says, I need to be more assertive in the way that I speak to people etc - I don't know how to do that. I can see it myself in the way I interact with people and other people have told me as well.

This is a big thing - often, whenever I see someone, my mind will kind of demand that I do something to 'play it cool' - this usually manifests in the form of me looking socially disinterested or moody when I'm not actually feeling like that - I don't know what else to do! Sometimes, whenever someone speaks to me, my mind goes blank - I literally can't think of what to say.

It's even made me say things in a manner that I wouldn't usually do - I'm not being pretentious, but I'm quite a well spoken person in terms of diction and just the way I say it, but when I speak to someone and my mind is scrambling for something to say, often, my usage of language somewhat abandons me. Instead of saying ""Oh, I quite enjoyed your speech/presentation - it was really insightful. You're a very talented speaker!"", I'll say ""Yeah I really liked it, mate. Have ya got somethin' else planned or is that it?"" My vocabulary becomes more basic, and I'll stop stressing certain parts of words correctly such as an 'n' and it's often rushed and said quickly.

This doesn't just happen with people that I've just met. I do this sometimes with people that I've known for a while. I don't know what to say to someone, so I'll scramble around in my mind for something to say. This has led to embarrassment as what I've said has made me look idiotic. People may tell me to relax, but I can't seem to be able to.

I'm now going to add another detail - I had one of my university lectures a few weeks ago. On our lunch break, we went to the pub which is next door to the campus to see a friend and I had a couple of beers (we're allowed to do this, as long as we're not acting drunk or disruptive on campus); I know how this will sound, but it was incredibly empowering when I got back into class. I wasn't loud or drunk, I was just a little merry and had alot of internal confidence - I was self-assured. (These were not my first couple of drinks for those who may think so, I've been drinking socially for over a decade). 

When I was in lecture, I didn't have any of those concerns that I've mentioned above; I could do those things - being assertive, being socially confident, I was contributing to pretty much everything- honestly, I felt like I had a superpower or something - it was such a relief from the constant inassertiveness that I usually endure. When I go out to bars and drink on an actual night on the town, this hasn't really happened often - odd! I wish I could be like that forever. 

Would anyone have any advice?",16Feb2020,1

768,"One of my best friends has been through a lot since I we met in high school.  I don’t fully know her exact situation but through a couple years of friendship I’ve managed to pick this up.  She has several diagnosable emotional issues.  I’m not positive but I believe she has some kind of bipolar disorder, as well as anxiety disorders and depression, all diagnosed.  On top of that she struggles with self confidence and self worth, as one would expect.  Her parents are very counter-supportive of her in this.  They’re very religious and they’ve stated that they “don’t believe” in therapy.  To make matters worse, our schools guidance office is borderline incompetent.  I’ve heard that none of them have any experience in any type of psychology, and if that’s true it absolutely shows.  She’s been through their programs and a couple years ago she was hospitalized.  Recently she had another rough patch.  She shut us out and she’s been suffering more than we’ve seen in a long time.  My friend and I would literally do anything for her, and we take it very seriously, but we’re not psychologists.  We don’t know who to go to or what we can possibly do for her.  We’re constantly worried for her safety but we also don’t want to read to much into any one thing and make her situation harder on her than it needs to be.  She has hurt herself before but it’s been a long time.  Obviously we can’t give up on her, we’ve all informally agreed that that’s never happening.

770,"My elderly cat recently passed away so my family adopted a new kitty about two weeks ago.  She's adjusted perfectly to the house and seems very happy and healthier than at the shelter.  During the day she's very calm; she sits on her favorite chair and sleeps or watches my fish or looks out the window.  She follows me all around the house even in the bathroom.  I say this because google said she may be experiencing some sort of separation anxiety.

At night, when everyone starts to settle down she goes crazy.  I'll be sitting on the couch watching TV and talking and she will scare me by pouncing over the armrest, clawing really hard on it or even scratching me.  Once everyone is asleep she knocks down everything she can in the house.  It's not uncommon to wake up to a loud bang.  

I thought she was just one of those cats that need a lot of playtime, so I started playing with her around the time she gets hyper.  No matter how hard she plays she never gets tired though and continues attention seeking.  She plays so roughly I sometimes worry she's going to hurt herself because she likes to jump really high even when the toy is being dragged across the floor and she has mauled the hand I hold the toy with on more than one occasion even though it's a wand connected to a three foot string with a mouse on the end.

771,"So he joined me for a cigarette on the balcony while she stayed inside. He then told me that he was 100% sure he wants to break up with her eventually and asked me how he should do it. He said he wanted to do it for a long time already, but he enjoyes her company and he can't break it to her since she's always so nice and he doesn't want to hurt her. I didn't know what to say so we just went back inside and they went to bed for some sexy time.

The next day, he left for a 1 month holiday with poor internet access. She's lovesick and tells me every day how great he is and how much she misses him and spends a lot of time looking for a birthday gift for him. 

On the one hand, I don't want to tell her, because he's so far away and they can't really have a conversation and she'll be all by herself with her feelings. Also I don't want to break up for him only because he's a coward. 

On the other hand it's horrible that I know and she doesn't. And she's wasting her time waiting for him and missing him.

I really don't know what to do, I have developed sleeping problems and it hurts so much seeing her missing him.

Also, before he left she heard me telling him that he's an ass. She didn't ask WHY I said it, but she got really mad at me for being rude. He just told her that what I said was between him and I, but she's complaining that I make him feel unwelcomed.

772,"WARNING: There is a lot of writing in this because it covers only some of my two years of problems 

I've waited a while to write this because, well I don't know why, but might as well get on with it.

I am in 2nd yr, in the UK so I'm 13

I there are 3 main girls in this story the main one - Mary-Jane, the slow one - Felicia, the fast one - Gwen. I've named them that cause I'm into spider-man at this moment. 

So there is the girl, Mary-Jane, so she liked me in first year and it was obvious, and I liked her but I never said partly because my friends have picked on me and j was scared. So I never said and it is my biggest mistake yet. 

Onto Felicia, so in second year I found out a girl, liked me and my friends were teasing me, apparently Felicia liked me since first year along with Mary-Jane, but I don't go out with girls I don't know so I wanted to get to know her better, but I barely got to know her, so it turned into a forced relationship because of my ""friends"" and they would always tease me. So eventually we dated for 2 months without holding hands or even hugging, and I was going to tell my sister because she was bound to find out, so I asked her is it allright if I tell her about us, and Felicia said that we need to break up, so we did and I was heartbroken cause she was my first girlfriend even though we were going really slowly. And it took me a month exactly to get over her, and there probably is still a part that still isn't over her.

So now on to Gwen, we were on a ski trip to France and during the start and a few times in the past I liked her, but not as much as Mary-Jane, so she asked my top 3 and we both said our top 3 and then we started dating, but since she is my second girlfriend I didn't really know what rate I should go at, but she was getting into bed with me, cuddling and saying I love you on the first day, and it took me a while to realise that this was too fast for me and during this period of time since my friends have been licking on me, yes it's died down but it's still on my memory, my mental state has been really bad and so I was already really triggered at a guy during skiing, so when I was drinking fanta Gwen knocked it out of my hand, and it was a disco night so I was wearing my favourite clothes and the fanta spilled all over my favourite shirt and I didn't know what to do because since we were  in a foreign country with my friends, which include Mary-Jane, so I realised that I don't like Gwen as much as Mary-Jane so I broke up with her, and yes I know that's a dick move and I deserve the slag she gave me when I was still in the room.

Last but FAR from least, Mary-Jane. By the time I realised I really, and I mean really like Mary-Jane she said she didn't like me anymore, and she liked someone else and that got me down a bit but I didn't really care then, and just a bit of background, I make a LOT of mistakes and I am very idiotic and can be a dick and Mary-Jane is always the one to apologise when either of us gets upset over each other and I hate that and I really want to change that, so I told someone, lets call them May, that I like Mary-Jane and they didn't move their phone away in time and Gwen of all people Gwen seen and she told all of my friends new, including Mary-Jane so I was panicking, and May said that Mary-Jane was confused and flattered, because she didn't want to betray Gwen but she didn't see how I liked her, and so she asked questions like how long and I answered, ever since we were friends, she asked why didn't you say anything so I said because I was scared and I make really bad mistakes. So on the plane I was having a slabber session with a friend that we will call Jessica, so I was saying that Mary-Jane always apologised about stuff and that I want to change that, and Mary-Jane heard and her self consciousness kicked in and she got really worried so I said that it was only that she was always apologising and I want to change it, and she said ""that's a great way to change it"" because she thought she would have to apologise so I got really depressed then, I can't remember how, but everything became better but i was still depressed and thinking about a question I was asked by someone lets call him eddie, and she said whh am I depressed and I said it's because I'm thinking of a question I was asked, she asked what it was so I said ""I was asked by Eddie If I had one chance to go in a time machine what time would I go to and why, so I said back to first year so I could tell Mary-Jane I like her too"", then she kept saying aaaaw then she sent a blue heart, which is between a friend and a crush, then we were talking at night, then she was going to sleep and she said goodnight and sent a yellow heart which means I was friend zoned

783,"Basically , long story short I'm not able to work or hold anything very easily but im alright on a pc anyways . I had a chance encounter with a guy who as he puts it is wealthy to the point of never needing for anything to say the least. He's business oriented and a good guy.  He helps out a lot of people through his business expidentures and has given me a shot at being a part of something online with him. I've briefly talked about my situation and we stay in contact. Already benefiting a lot from little things. I value are friendship and what he's done for me already . You know it's in the 10's of thousands of indirect gifting just from little interactions through different things online. Kickbacks he has offered to let me have and stuff. The thing is I'm not sure if he would grant a direct request.or at least I've seen that other side of his interactions with somone that got a little to pushy and made it about selling him something even though it was basically him being nice to accept it and he had enough of that quickly.  But it's a good spot to be in that its not and I dont want to seem like I'm just like the hundreds of other people that are harassing him online everyday for handouts.   So basically I'm involved in a startup and part of a group of people. The startup itself is not yielding much in the way of income (yet) but he really loves what we are doing and seems committed to the idea.  Beside the basic pay for the work in the group , I have kickbacks coming in and through that I've gotten most of the profit .  So it's been a bit dry after that nice initial money that helped me out. And its exciting and all , I tell myself to continue just riding this out and put in the effort into the work and keep up my friendship with him. And I know I'm set up to receive further form the kickbacks and stuffs later on. Just that , 1. I know he likes me 2. I am legitimately in a rough situation and have a lot of issues that are very rela and 3. I feel about 50% confident asking him directly with a number would probably work. He could easily give whatever and I know it would not really affect him financially basically.  But it's a big risk and also would affect our current friendship/ relationship sp i'm thinking its not worth the risk.  If he felt inclined he could always offer more right?.",16Feb2020,1

788,"I am a female (15) and my parents are divorced. 

my mom has been going out with this guy who i believe to be sexist and racist and not good for her. he says some pretty wild stuff like ""slavery was a good thing"" and ""women can't be leaders... don't like all of this female power recently"" and he is also homophobic and claims to be a christian! which I don't believe any of this stuff is christian-like...

i really don't feel comfortable around him, he creeps me out. i was getting ready for homecoming with my friend one time and when he came downstairs he just kept staring at us and my friend told me it creeped her out a lot. I told my mom and she said guys are just like that.

another time my mom went to go drop off my brother at boy scouts and i went to the bathroom and her boyfriend was at the house with me. I was just sitting on the toilet and i did not lock the door but i thought it obvious that, if you're a guest at someone's house, you would always knock on the door first before entering and check to see if there was a light on. He opened the door a bit (enough to see part of me) and instead of immediately closing the door and saying SORRY, he says ""who's in there!"" and i just said back, ""shut the door!"" and he just kept saying no and standing there with the door a bit open. 

I confronted my mom when she got home and i told her i felt uncomfortable because he could see my ass, and she didn't believe me! and instead i got my phone taken away and i was the one in trouble. 

after that incident, i got in this huge fight with them and i said that he was creeping me out and i mentioned the bathroom-incident and he (no joke) said this in front of me and my mom: ""What ass?? you're a stick!"" and my mom didn't even defend me at all on the spot!!! I felt terrible!!!! 

She has such a double-standard. whenever he says some shit about me or acts badly she excuses it, but whenever i do something she just gets mad at me and takes my phone!!

I don't like the people at my school, i don't want to be friends with most of them. My mom is the most normal person to me and I have a lot of fun when I hangout with her. But nowadays it feels like i'm always her second choice and she treats me soooo differently when he's around (in a bad way).

I'll admit, sometimes I don't have the best attitude and I can be rude but no one seems to understand what it's like feeling uncomfortable and sad in your own house. I usually get in trouble from when i interject and say something when her boyfriend is saying something racist or outlandish. I probably should stop that but it's so hurtful! I can be loud and yell at her in these arguments but so can she. It feels like when i talk normally to her she doesn't care or take me seriously...

my mom and i have some really good times when he isn't around or when they're not together. but whenever i get in a fight with them she says stuff like ""you do this all the time"" ""i can't stand being around you"" ""go get a life"" she also calls me swears sometimes. she doesn't care when I cry or stay in my room all day. she thinks im faking it and i'm having a pity party. none of my family seems to care about my thoughts of suicide.

she always picks her boyfriend over me, and doesn't care at all about my feelings about him and that I don't feel comfortable at home when he's around. it hurts a lot when she won't stand up for me or when she says these words to me. There are more things she says but I can't remember  them all right now. 

i know you are all gonna say ""get a hobby, go do something with a friend"" and its not like that. its hard. i hate staying up in my room all day. nothing interests me anymore, and i can't stand watching youtube all day and netflix, i want my mom back! I just want it to be me, my brother, and my mom again without some lazy, freeloader idiot who still lives with his mom in my house all the time!!!

800,"So I dated this girl for 3 years. She was my first love and I've always cared deeply about her. We had a rough break up almost 2 years ago but we have recently came into contact with eachother and meet up once every 2 or 3 months to catch up and vent about life. With doing that I have found out that she has not been smart at all with her sex life. I took her virginity and we learned pretty much everything with eachother. She told me that she has had multiple stds simply because she doesn't use protection. She also was in a ""sugerdaddy"" situation. Shes in her early 20's and would have sex with this guy in his late 40's just to pay for things. Her last ex was a drug abuser and has hit her before during arguments but she still talks to him and fools around with him.

I know it's been long enough that I shouldnt care but I cant help but be hurt after hearing these things. We always used protection even though we were monogamous and made sure we were both comfortable with what we were doing but now she has done a 180 and is living a risky lifestyle and simply isnt the person she was when we were together.

803,"Hello everyone, 
I am seeking for some advice. I got this unionized job( very first time) as a prep-cook/ bartender a bit more than a month ago. I don’t received tips, only 2% of house. The manager who hired me said during the interview and emphasized that I will get this amount that is more than min. wage because this is a unionize position. I signed the paper and everything.
For the two pay checks I received so far, they messed up and paid me as a server, which is less than minimal wage. I asked the manager who hired me after I received the first pay check, and she said she contacted the payroll person to correct it. She left the company a week after that. So I spoke to a different manager after I found out the second pay check was also incorrect. 

Today is the sixth week I work there. The manager told me he got an email from the payroll lady said this job only supposed to pay the amount that is equal to minimal wage. This manager said the last manager ( one that left the company) made a mistake on my rate. He even showed me the union handbook, which there is a grid of the amount for each position in the restaurant . 
I just read the collective agreement downloaded from the union website and I saw the grid but I also saw it talks about over scaled employee and stuff. 

To me, there is not way the last manager would make this kind of mistake. I asked around already and she was usually the one did hiring mostly. 
This manager said he would message the payroll lady and see what she says. But how the hell would a payroll lady decides how much I get pay. Doesn’t she just do the math and write the cheques? Shouldn’t be the owner that decides how much the correct amount is? 
I found this super shady but at the same time, I am not backed with another job atm. Also workers there are nice.",16Feb2020,1

He later messaged asking about a photo I had on my timeline as he recognised the woman in it as being my neighbour (it was a charity event a couple of months back).

I work for my university on the cyber security team and more or less do a good job every day (This is relevant later on) 

About a week ago I’m at a forum discussing internship opportunities for cyber security. At the end I asked some questions about the field, what tools this company uses to investigate crimes, etc. After I finish a guy who I know who also works in IT comes over to me and says “Man, do you really work in the SOC (Security Operations Center)? Because your questions and things you said really suggest otherwise! Haha like I can’t believe that you don’t know what tools the industry uses! You made so many weird decisions during our game (we played a security game there too) and I’m just not convinced you really work for the SOC.” 

I stayed quiet and said things like “yep” and “mhmm”. What I wanted to say was “dude, did you only come over here to tell me how bad an entry level guy is at his job?” I knew I wouldn’t be able to articulate this in time though and would end up looking even more dumb if I tried.

815,"Everyone appears to do some exploring during their college years and I definitely have as well. Many regrets as well as many valuable lessons learned. However one things I've been committed to for over a year now is a small business with two of my roommates.

When we first started the business I was thrilled, I really believed I wanted to run a business and make some money. Now, over a year later we are almost breaking even and yet I feel like I want to quit. My ideals have changed, I don't care about money nearly as much, and I feel anxious any time we meet to discuss business matters. I want to leave but I also feel like I'm being a little bitch. Like I'm quitting just because I don't want to do the work. 

But then I begin rationalizing and I tell myself both my roommates are bad business partners who don't want to do the work either. We all hope for growth with no effort. I have been reading many self-improvement books lately and I feel like I need to move on from constantly hanging out with my roommates because they are all a negative influence on my life.

Separation from this business would likely give me greater freedom but it would also likely close off some opportunities seeing as we are close to breaking even and I believe the company is still a great idea. I'm almost done with an engineering degree so I will likely still be making decent money after college but I just can't pull myself to give a shit about this business anymore.

Do I tell my roommates I want to leave or do I power through to see where this opportunity goes? I should also mention we have quite a few obligations that are coming up (contests, seminars, etc.) related to the business however doing the actual work has never stressed me out much as I am typically good enough at time management.

I’m wondering if anyone can offer any advice?

Bit of back story first. I began medical school in 2014, I got 18 months in and got very ill very quickly. I had sever heart problems and a huge bleed, multiple major surgeries and a lot of tests later I was diagnosed with vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome, are rare genetic condition that produces faulty collagen. 

After this diagnosis I was told I would not be allowed to work. My vascular system is very compromised so have to be extremely careful. I’m pretty gutted as I wanted to be doctor since I was a very young child and worked so hard to get into med school. 

Last year I had to pay £40,000 for another heart surgery which left me with no money and my parents had to remortgage there house. 

I need another surgery that I have to pay for, not sure if the exact cost yet as not sure if it can be done in France or I’ll have to go to America. So desperately trying to fundraise and praying the money will come through in time, not to be too dramatic. I have a go fund me page 

Basically I’m asking if anyone has any ideas of how I can earn money without being employed, ie working from home. I’ve tried surveys but there a bit useless.

832,"Hello everyone. Desperately in need of an advice as I will lose my mind. 
English is not my first language so I hope you'll be able to understand me.

Backstory- I had a very ill sister who was older than me and I only knew her ill. My parents were very close to her as she needed constant care and supervision.They loved each other but they were very jealous of each other so since I remember there was always fights in the house. My father was abusive towards my mum and police was in our house on number of occasions. They also physically attacked each other but as I got older they also started to beat me. My mother is highly manipulative and very selfish. She grew up in a very rich family but we were very poor. My parents asked to borrow money from everyone in the family and god knows how many people more because they needed it for my ill sister but also that was used as an excuse and my mother spent it on shopping. There was a lot of debt and they had three loans because of it. I met an amazing guy who rescued me from them and mother who was killing me emotionally. As we were very poor we decided to leave the country and try to succeed somewhere else. 
Of course I sent my parents money the whole time. My sister died a year after I left the country and my parents started to ask for more and more money. Fast forward to now, a couple of years later. I am married now to the same amazing man. We payed off two of their loans, sent money for their debts, did major repairs on the house, payed a lot of their bills, all clothing, footwear, cosmetics, gas for car, everything you imagine was payed by us. 
But we do not have peace. There is constant asking for more and more money. Constant negativity and complaining. My mother was the major issue. When I did not want to send any more money she would be rude, blackmail me emotionally mentioning my sister. Ignore me for a couple of days until I give in. She would create a major scene and insult me and only be ok again when I give in and send money. 
We can not take it anymore as now even my father is taking her side and he started to insult me when I start to refuse. I begged my mother for peace for years. It escalated less than two months ago when I couldn't take it anymore and had a big discussion with them. I said that it is not a problem for us to send the money, the problem is that whenever I send it they need more and more and there are always more bills or my mum cries how they are hungry. And how for the last year whenever I sent the money my dad would start complaining how I don't know what it feels like to live of your children. How he is so angry by that. He would talk about it non stop. I tried to explain how all this needs to stop. Then my father told me I didn't genuinely care about them, how I really don't want to send money at all and how I should start drinking Prozac to cope with it all. 
I cried for days. 
Today again I tried talking to them for the last time and slowly explain how both me and my husband feel but it ended with my dad absolutely screaming and shouting at me. He did not want to understand me at all and kept accusing me how I do not want to give money at all. He told me that they are sick people (they both take a lot of pills for their nerves and sleep) and how I should leave them alone.
I told them we will stop communicating. I can not take it anymore and my marriage is suffering. I am sad to confess that I am also seriously considering taking my life.
My heart is breaking and I feel horrible.
Am I right to end it with them? Thank you for reading if you came this far!",16Feb2020,1

I looked up the name, wondering if what I remembered was right and yup, it's after Niccolò Machiavelli, someone I specifically remembered from sophomore year in world history.

So the thing is that we didnt even talk since Thursday because i was trying really hard to accomplish that goal to prove to her that if i really cared about her  i could do that.....but it only let me to lose interest and im afraid to just see her again not because i want to have fun with her if not because i am feeling bored/lonely and just want to make out with someone.

In the past we’ve been on dates, kissed a few times and I still feel like despite being just friends and her having a boyfriend living abroad there is always a sense of attraction between us, which I dont think I’m mis-reading but who knows.

Anyway she missed class for the past 2 weeks and missed our class night out which I invited her to. She said she’s been having a rough time the past 10days and didn’t feel like going out in a big group. However she did say that we (me and her) should go out some night soon instead. I told her if she wants to get out of the house, just let me know any time. 

This morning I texted her asking how she is doing and if she’s up for getting that drink soon. 

Her response? She didn’t read the text at all so far but managed to post an instagram story of the sunset outside her apartment instead?! 
Like what am I missing? Why would you not just at least read the text asking you to the drinks that you suggested. Especially when it’s from a friend that is actually worried about what is bothering her... 

Thing is we have class together all week, starting tomorrow at 11am. If she comes in I’ll probably end up sitting next to her as usual. How am I supposed to handle that?

They split up due to my Dad having a affair and cheating on my Mom. Which to be honest really annoyed me and I will never forgive. Which seemed to annoy me even more is that it wasn't the first time. This happened on two other occasions and they got back together which personally i feel is very stupid.

Yet my Mom wants to get back with him. And yes i know it's not my choice but i can't help myself but hate my Dad. Every time i see them both together it just annoys me and If they are holding hands i have to remove myself from the area as it annoys me so much.

839,"I had some rough months this year, and the two last ones were tough. Today I feel bursting, angry, notably against some people I will see again for a full semester, tomorow. I managed to stay calm and nice during this whole time, but tonight a little dropplet got added and I don't know how my nerves will endure it.

I know from past experience that when I'm very sad and angry for a long period, I might start acting badly. Going from avergage funny/calm/kind/social to antisocial/mean etc. It is already happening and people don't like going to see that type of person, even if that person needs it (does not help right ?). I dont want this to happen again, but I lack ressources. I already do too much sport, lack sleep. I can't and don't want to avoid too much the group, by fear of being replaced/pushed away. Also I basicaly need human contact.

Do anyone have any advice to keep my nerves, and manage to stay a good man ? A video, text, advice ... Thank you already",16Feb2020,1

843,"I signed a 10 month lease that is for the 2020-2021 school year of my university. I have been with this housing company with minimal issues in the last two apartments I’ve been in, but having a major issue with my upcoming one.

The company does individual leases per bedroom. I sign for my own room, and my rent is the same regardless of how many other people sign onto the lease. In the 3 bedroom apartment I’m currently in, (same company) when I signed the lease the other two rooms were not yet signed, so I opted for them to place me with two random roommates. My rent was $735 regardless of if anyone else actually signed and I was not responsible for finding roommates, the company did everything for me.

For next year, I wanted to do the same thing in my new apartment. It is a 2 bedroom and during the tour of the apartment I had mentioned that I want them to do the roommate placement again. The leases are electronic and when I signed the lease in their office my rent was listed as $815. Only AFTER I signed the lease they told me that the unit I signed does not offer roommate placement and I would be responsible for finding my own roommate otherwise I would be responsible for double the rent. Had I known this I absolutely would not have signed. When they emailed me a copy of my lease the rent was listed as $1630 (double the rent), but I have no way to prove that it originally said $815 when I signed, but I know they must have changed it before emailing it to me otherwise I would NOT HAVE SIGNED.

I have until April 1st to find a roommate and I have been posting to roommate pages almost everyday with NO LUCK. I have spoken to the apartment and the complex manager and they cannot give me a straight answer as to why I can’t do a roommate placement. I have expressed my concern and they have done zero to help me. There’s no way I can afford to pay both rents and I am starting to panic.

Has anyone had any experience with this kind of thing? Is there any way I could get through this without getting a lawyer involved or am I screwed? Any advice is helpful, thanks!",16Feb2020,1
844,"My best friend (of four years) has a younger sister who is one year younger than the both of us. She always chills with us at school or even when we go out and most of her friends are online. Recently I have been noticing her odd behavior towards me and although it may not be serious, she constantly criticizes me and belittles me. A few things I can recall on top of my head that happened recently:
1. On Valentines day our school permitted us to wear our own clothing(we usually wear uniform)and I had just arrived to school and met them by our usual bench. I wore a humours tee that my other friends wanted to see and my friend literally criticized about how awful and unflattering I looked. I laughed it off and diffused the situation although her words really hurt. 
2. She had posted a selfie of me and my sister captioning it ""I love your sister more,"" to which one of her online friends commented and told her that was mean. As soon as her online friend started showing some interest in me she quickly sent him 'bad' selfies of me that she would secretly take when I'm busy doing something. I found this highly uncalled for but again, I left the situation. 
3. Whenever I post a selfie of myself, she is always the first to comment with things like ""why so moody,"" , ""what are you wearing,"" or ""why does you're look like that,"". These are the same selfies that my most honest friends would say I look good in. 

I am not sure if this is just her being brutally honest or if, at this point, she's just being a bad friend?",16Feb2020,1
845,"So, I just browsed Facebook to see when my fiance was last online, as she is 12 hours ahead in time. I wanted to write goodmorning and goodnight at the same time before I went to bed. 

Then I see that she just (less than 4 days ago I assume) became friends with an old flame from 12 years back. 

So, we all know that when you feel lonely, don’t speak as much to your partner as you’re used to, you start browsing. 

My worry is that she starts chatting with him because it’s exciting and interesting while she is alone on the other side of the world. 

So, should I say something like: “Hey, so.. I see you connected with XYZ. What is that all about?” 

Or should I count on/trust her that she doesn’t text him?

849,"The situation: Neighbor has recently been diagnosed with neuropathy, and the combination of pain and medication is such that they have been unable to work for about a month now. They have also, seemingly, been abusing the medication they were prescribed as they are experiencing tremors and minor seizures from withdrawals after running out. It also seems like they are having difficulty performing normal everyday activities like cooking, shopping, etc as they have invited their father back to take care of them. He supposedly cleans, shops, and helps around the house, but have not actually seen any of that happening. 

They've had issues with the father in the past due to his alcoholism and homelessness. He now is apparently feeding the neighbor his own pain meds to supplement the neuropathy medication and allowing them to drink (seemingly a lot) of alcohol alongside it. It's rare to see the neighbor in a clear state of mind anymore. I'm sure the father is drinking his fair share as well as I've seen him drunk on their porch. He is also driving the neighbor's car despite his license being suspended due to a DUI.

The father also has scabies and has infected the neighbor. There's a young kid involved in all this, just to make things worse.

They've been late on their rent for the past two months and are close to being evicted. They also claim that they cannot get on medical insurance. They also have to wait to see their doctor for this condition until May.

853,"These Last 3 weeks have been the roughest weeks on me. My gf  is having a emotional affair with another man and i cant do anything to help fix this. 

   
   In the beginning of our relationship we talked about our future and kids, she didn't want any and i said i did, She lived in a different state so i decided to sacrifice my family and friends to move in with her 7 months in to the relationship, I had told her and assured her during the 6 years that i was committed and all in for being with her. I didn't think i would change my mind about kids but i did for her. In July we found out she was pregnant, This crushed us both pretty hard but i still was there for her and assured her what ever decision was made i stand by it 120%. Week after she had a abortion and then few days later she flew to Ohio for training in August. I had taken off the day of for planned parenthood before the procedure, during the procedure and the full week till she left for training. I was with her every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had talked about The situation and I asked her about how she was feeling but I guess I didn’t ask enough while she was away. She was by herself and only had her video game with her (final fantasy XIV) she didn’t have any one to converse with and no one from her workplace came either so she was training alone and dealing with this on her own. But one of her raid mates was there, he was her third person to vent to. She went to GA 1/30/2020 for a rave, She took Molly for the first time (she never done drugs and was always straight edge) and had fun with out me. She met him for the first time but they didn’t do anything.(i believe in her)  Now her feelings are split between him and I and she doesn’t know what to do We talked 2/2/2020 where we all were freaking out. I was honest with her and she told me he doesn’t want her to have feelings for him and to fix our relationship. (He=other guy)   


That week we talked and she said she wants nothing to do with him, no sex, no relationship just is confused why is she feeling this way. i told her we should do counseling to help keep our minds at peace and she agreed. That week she went to her mothers in Florida but had a layover in GA where the guy lived. her flight got delayed and she re books it to the next morning and opts to stay with him that night. I'm still hopeful and optimistic but after talking to friends they felt it was a red flag and i need to look at the bigger picture. I stay optimistic all week i took a trip to visit friends and my mother in NYC  to clear my head. Didn't converse with her and gave her space while she was away.    


Towards the end of the week before i was supposed to head home i had a few friends gaslight me to a point where i didn't believe in this anymore. I didn't have any answers and i was just left here wondering if shes trying to make a effort to recoup or not. Not once have i ever thought about breaking up with her, until that day.   


I had talked to my mom and her dad and weighed their opinions on me. when she came back we sat down and talked in a unbiased Non-Judgmental forum, she expressed some emotions and Felt she was holding me back because of the abortion situation and her not wanting kids but I did but then said she has a problem and she wanted a break. I had expressed my emotions and told her she should take a break from that guy and take a break from the video game until you have a few counseling sessions. (I've never been the type to tell her who she can or cant see/talk to. She's always had freedom with me.) Told her if she does i would appreciate it but if she doesn't  then i think we should break up. the next day she messages me saying she cant give these things up. Now I've been dealing with this for the past 3 weeks, Emotionally and physically exhausted where i cant work, Eat and sleep. This week has been having the most impact on me. Shes avoiding the problem by not talking to me and its driving me nuts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a therapist appointment Monday 2/17/2020 and hers is Thursday 2/20/20. I'm hoping to figure this out, i love her and care for her but i don't know if after all this i want to stay with her. I'm trying to look out for whats best for me and my best interests, I've been reading a lot more (just read 5 love languages and i wish i read this while we were together), Going to the gym 2-3 times a week to get my mind off things. What should i do? Should i stop hoping things will end up ok? Is it selfish of me to keep believing these things?

 **TLDR**: How can I say this, I appreciate my life my friends and everything in between. She is someone who does keep me going. But I don’t believe she is in to it anymore she found a guy who she appreciates more and I believe she has given up on our relationship by going to his place and betraying my trust. She doesn’t see what she’s doing wrong and how can you? You’re trying to build a relationship with someone else besides your boyfriend. Even if she never had sex she should understand she’s emotionally crushing on someone and she’s having a emotional affair with him. Even if they don’t believe it she knows the consequences of her actions. So we broke up and i dont know if i want to try and make a effort or not.",16Feb2020,1

The kids are about 6 years old  and 1 year old. 
I don’t really interact much with them , and only seldom see them, but I hear them ALL THE TIME. 
There are constant screams and crying coming from the apartment, loud enough to travel to me 2 doors down from them. 
For instance every single morning at around 6 am I hear the older kid crying very loudly and both parents screaming at him, many mornings the kid goes out into the hallway to cry there and the parents come scream at him until he agrees to go back inside. 
I have no reason to believe there’s anything physical going on, I haven’t heard threats or anything like that. 
I’m just worried about the kids because the screams are very loud and aggressive and seem to go beyond normal parents yelling.

At this point I'm jumping from being practically a virgin to being extremely welcome at his first orgy, ever.

The people involved in this social circle find me ""cute"" specifically, but never ""hot"", yet get crushes on me and want to sleep with me, invite me to group sex, etc. I always notice too late, but then people explain to me that someone has found me attractivr and I didnt notice.

I now get women to put their arm over my shoulder, playfully pull me by the collar, tickle me and massage me while giggling ""he's SO CUTE"" , even though up to a few months ago I was a hopeless man with no idea on how to approach women. Why did this change happen?

I never kisses a girl and all of a sudden I'm welcome at an orgy, and when I ask my friend, who's responsible to a lot of these meetups whether or not I should go ""all in"" with my ""cuteness"", he says that it's ""way more complicated"" than just my cuteness.

868,"Hi! I am a medical assistant for a large hospital and I started about 3 weeks ago. I have years of medical assistant experience and took this job after working in a administrative position for a bit to work with patients again. Without giving too much details, I have quickly found out that this office is not for me and I am considering looking elsewhere. My main concern is that it is an oncology office and things are so disorganized and I feel like patient care is not a top priority (results delayed, things getting missed) which really bothers me. I know someone who used to work there who stated that they are having a problem with turnover in the position I have because of similar issues and if she knew I was applying she would have discouraged me. Since I have been unhappy, I looked for other jobs within the company and came across an administrative job with a hiring manager that I am familiar with because I was offered a job there in the past but declined due to a different opportunity. My fiance also works at this organization and was talking to her about it who essentially said I would be a great fit and she would be comfortable even foregoing the interview since she knows me. Here comes the issue....

HR states that there is a ""6 month requirement within a new role before you can internally bid. That being said, in rare instances, leaders may determine through discussion with a new associate that they support a change sooner and then contact HR to waive that requirement. As indicated, this is pretty rare.""

So, I would need to speak to my leader about how I feel in your role to see if there is support for making a change sooner.

My question is... how do I even go about this? (To be noted... I have no relationship with her yet because she has not been in the office since my first day as she travels to different sites)

Do I risk having a conversation with her about this and she says no she doesn't support this and then what? Is there a way I can tactfully go about the conversation that would encourage her more to approve the switch? Any feedback would be awesome. Thank you so much!",16Feb2020,1

TL;DR: My friend doesn’t understand that their parent has been financially, mentally, and possibly physically abusing them. The parent has now moved halfway across the country with my friend. How can I help rescue her?

 My best friend is in an abusive home situation but doesn’t realize it. They are over 20 years old and their parent requires them to put their paychecks into a shared account, or is threatened that they will be kicked out. There has been talk of physical abuse but I personally have no proof. There is proof of harassment on my friend’s phone, unless their parent has deleted it. Countless screenshots from texts, my friend texting me and I never deleted any texts, etc. The parent required my friend to have 2+ jobs, but would take all their money and refuse to help them purchase a car. Now, the parent has moved halfway across the country with my best friend. Their family that lives in the area they moved to have cut off all contact due to the manipulation that the parent caused. My friend is now isolated 40+ minutes from the nearest grocery store, in the middle of nowhere, with no job yet or car. We had a Group FaceTime with the friend and a mutual friend of ours. (To prevent confusion, we will call this friend sally). Sally and I called our friend  to express concerns for their well-being after being isolated by the parent. We quickly realized that the parent was hiding in the room and listening to the conversation, which jeopardized a real conversation with our friend. Sally and I have reached out to our friends sibling and their other parent who still lives near us. The sibling didn’t know the extent of abuse and is now worried for their well-being. We are currently trying to inform the parent of the abuse, but they have a busy schedule and meeting up is hard. The biggest issue is that our friend doesn’t realize the manipulation that is happening, and makes claims that they are “just trying to keep the peace” with their parent. What can we do to bring our friend back?? They need a wake-up call to the abuse, because they believe that their parent is “just stressed out and everything will get better soon” after hearing that excuse for three years.",16Feb2020,1

It's not that I dont want to drive because I want to so bad, I just get so anxious and within 10 minutes I want to stop. Theres just so many things to do at once and keep track of and if I mess up, it could have severe consequences.

Does anybody have any tips about how to get over it? I need to learn but I just dont know how I can let myself do that.",16Feb2020,1

879,"2 months ago me and a player got into an argument. It wasn't a very long or big argument but it ended with the player saying that he would sabotage more games that we play together.

Since then, almost every time we're both online he will use a feature in the game to see where I am so that he can follow me around and join in battles that my friends and I are in. As soon as a battle starts and I am in the battle he will immediately start feeding the enemy which makes us lose a lot more often. There is no way to stop him from using the feature to see where I am as mutes/blocks don't affect it. There is no way to play the part of the game I'm playing without him being able to join in the battle with me on my team and its the only part of the game I play.

For around the first month after the argument I didn't even say 1 word to him in an attempt to not feed the troll though my friends/other players would ask him questions which he would never answer except that he would say that I'm making him do it and that he's ""keeping a promise"". After that we would bicker every few weeks but I tried to do this as little as possible and it was mostly him just making comments about me/towards me.

It has caused many of my friends/other players/his ex friends to dislike him so lots have reported him ingame but moderators have done nothing so far. We also sent an email to the moderators explaining the situation better with some signatures and said we also had evidence if they wanted but they just replied with a stock message saying to report issues we have with players ingame.

Some of my friends who have mutual friends with with him have tried asking his close friends to talk to him about it or maybe convince him to stop but I dont know if they actually did this because I never got an update on it but nothing changed.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this situation as I am basically all out of ideas. One idea is that I could make a new account but I don't really want to do this as I have a lot of things on my current account I wouldn't want to lose and also if he found out that it was my account he'd just start doing it again.

I wouldn't like to quit the game even though it might not seem worth it to deal with this just to have to play. First because it would just mean that he could do this again to someone until they quit (he has done this to someone before but only did it for around a week or 2 before I guess he got bored and a lot less people knew about it or got angry). Second because I would leave behind a lot of friends and my group.",16Feb2020,1
880,"So the long story turned short on this one is that I'm 21, have had suicidal thoughts for the past 8, and felt out of place, anxious, full of anger and guilt and overall gloomy since maybe 4 or 5. I had two suicide attempts about a year and a half ago, and have never been prescribed an antidepressant. After living with suicidal thoughts and bad feelings my entire life I finally decided to try an antidepressant my friend had previously used. They gave it to me and I've been using it for about a week and a half, and it's really worked! I've had a few mild side effects but have not felt suicidal or very anxious once in the past 10 or 1q days. Well, tomorrow I have an appointment with a counselor who can refer the facilities doctor to write me a prescription. Ideally I'd like to be prescribed what my friend gave me, but obviously I'm not a medical professional. 

What I'm really asking here is this: How do I talk about taking an SSRI unprescribed and how do I let a counselor know it really works and I personally feel I need to be on one? I'm so scared she won't give me a prescription and I'll be on my own with this again. This is the first time in my life I've felt okay and I don't wanna lose that.

883,"so basically ever since i was a kid, people called me gay / a lesbian because of how comfortable i was with other girls. personally i just think the way i act around my female friends is quite normal for friends and etc (i kiss them on the cheek, slap their butts, etc). 

i never think this is sexual and it’s a joke around all my friends (i always ask my friends if they mind if i do touchy things like kisses / slaps, i’m not the type of person to just do those things without consent). we all do this.

in the seventh grade, i dated a girl. and honestly the whole time i was confused and only thought of her as a dude. 

i like guys, only ever want to marry a guy / date a guy. 

but recently on tik tok (16 now), i’ve been having girl crushes. and i noticed the girls i have crushes on are always muscular looking. 

then recently i’ve been having dreams and thoughts about a girlfriend. 

honestly i can be bisexual or bicurious. 

and i know all of these don’t all = to be being a lesbian or bisexual. 

but i’m confused now. i’m still going through a lot in my mindset. maybe i am just a normal straight girl
with girl crushes, or maybe i’m bisexual? i don’t know. i’m confused. 

overall, i’m known as a huge supporter of the LGBT community. i always call out homophobia and transphobia in my school, always correct my immigrant parents about information about the LGBT, wanted to go to pride with a gay friend (couldn’t because he cancelled last minute and he was my ride), etc.

another thing about me is that i’m comfortable with the fact that i probably would like to date a girl.

Due to my state being a travel state, meaning you need a car to get anywhere, I am stuck at home 90% of the time unless I want to walk an hour through traffic just to get to walmart. There's not really such a thing as public transportation in my town. So the only way I have been able to meet people, or make any friends at all is by saying fuck it and meeting people off the internet. I don't really connect with any coworkers who are my age. I don't know what it is, but I've always had an easier time making friends with adults rather than teenagers, even when I was really young. Had a tough time trying to fit in in middle school and I didn't really fit at all.  Even then, the older folks I work with often either really respect me, or think I'm weird as shit. It's either one or the other. I'm so happy I'm getting older so it doesn't feel as weird interacting with people 20 years older than I am. 

But I'd been talking to this guy I was interested in online, and he had told me he was single. We went on a total of 2 dates, and honestly I thought it went pretty okay but I wasn't sure at that point if he had just wanted sex from me or if he was down for more. It was more of a hookup kinda dynamic, but I liked him a bit and really tried to be honest about myself and who I am. I didn't care if it was just sex he wanted either, it felt nice to just chill with someone and I was down. He seemed pretty genuine too for the most part, but a few things kinda made me suspicious he wasn't being 100% honest. Though I thought it was because he didn't know me that well, and was being cautious about what he told someone he had just met. It didn't bother me either way. 

Well, yesterday his gf started texting me. Yeah, his GF. But she wasn't mad. She told me she just wanted to let me know what was going on, and that if I wanted to do anything else with him... she'd have to able to either watch or join us. And like. What. The. Fuck. Is. My. Life. 

Apparently including a third person is normal for them, but he'd never gone behind her back like that before. And now I guess I'm probably never going to hear back from him again.

Maybe I'm just a bad person, but this has got me wanting to see him again. I feel a bit flattered he thought I was worth doing that, but at the same time I'm so, so disappointed because he didn't seem the type. And part of me feels like I just got set up.

887,"sorry if this is waffle, just off the top of my head.

simply put, for some reason lately ive proper struggled to feel strongly about anything. Im usually a rlly emotional bloke, find i fall for people quick and hard, always get butterflies and am always rlly bad for nostalgia, especially when it comes to music.

but as of recently, ive just not had any of that at all. weirdest part is ive just recently pulled this girl ive fancied for the longest time (day before my parents got divorced actually) , and we’ve got together a couple times and stuff, but for whatever reason the way i felt about her last year is gone and in its place i just feel a bit distant and ambivalent about it all.

same goes for like school and that, im just not fucked about any of it, like ill get my work done for deadlines and everything, but i rlly dont care about revision or grades or whatever. also am struggling to feel anything about music and stuff, when im usually rlly emotionally charged when i comes to certain tunes, like i dont get nostalgic about the tunes thatd make me cry a few months ago

probably related but this all started near enough around when my parents got divorced about 3 weeks ago, and it was proper rough, like police involved, never seeing one of them again, family struggling to get by, but im not even fucked about any of that, like the idea of not seeing one of my parents again just doesnt fuss me.

feel like im just sort of existing right now and kinda want to get back in touch with the way i used to feel recently. Dont want to lead this girl on because im emotionally unavailable, and i just want to enjoy my tunes like i used to, everything just feels a bit subdued at the moment and i dont rlly know how to get out of it.

891,"Ok so, me and this girl have been friends for over a year now and only a couple weeks ago she told me she had feelings for me. I had feelings for her to for a while before that and told her how I felt cause she found out and asked me about it. But she got a boyfriend a lil bit after that and they after around 2 months or so they broke up the day before New Year’s Eve.

But yeah she told me she had feelings for me and I told her I still had feelings for her, but she didn’t want to get into a relationship again cause of how she was feeling at the time and what had happened and she said that she just didn’t want to get straight back into a relationship. I understood what she meant so I just gave her her time and space and obviously, it’s worked out now.

But the problem is, I really just wanna spend more time with her cause this is my first real relationship that wasn’t in primary school and meant nothing. Like I feel a genuine connection to her and she means a lot to me so I don’t wanna ruin it by asking too many questions and making her feel uncomfortable or something. It’s a half term rn at both of our schools so we have a bit of free time but she’s only free for Tuesday and either Thursday or Friday, I forgot but still, We don’t have much time to meet. We have been meeting every Friday before this with someone from my school (she and I both go to same sex schools).

But so umm, yeah I just wanna spend more time with her cause it makes me feel really happy and comfortable when I’m with her. Like last Friday, it was me, her, the guy from my school and a girl from her school. We all went around her house and I was the last one to leave. I had gotten her a valentines present that she really liked. After that we both laid on her bed and watched like 30 mins of a movie on her laptop. It was so nice cause her head was just above my shoulder and she was just resting her head on it. It made me feel really like, idk just kinda like I meant something and I really fuckin liked it. She told me the day after that she told me it felt nice as well. I really just want more of that sort of thing cause of how it makes me feel but idk how to talk to her about it.

I don’t wanna invite myself around her house cause that just feels wrong and she can’t really come around mine cause she’s allergic to cats and I have 2. Also my dads working from home all week anyway and none of my family, or friends for that matter, know about our relationship or even the feelings we each have for each other. Well idk if her friends know how she and I feel about each other or our relationship cause she’s a lot more open with her friends than I am with mine or anyone really. 

I can’t really ask her anyway cause it’s like, it’s not that I feel I can’t, but I kinda, she’s really awkward when it comes to feelings or genuine sort of questions, like the way I found out she wanted to ask me out was on a discord server where she was changing my nickname and asking the question. When I asked her how she felt and if she felt like she was ready to be in a relationship, she kinda just avoided it and did some dumb shit for a lil bit before actually answering. It was funny don’t get me wrong but she is kinda, avoidance of those sort of serious kinda questions sometimes. I’m not really any better cause I’m shit at reading feelings and social situations sometimes and since this relationship thing is a foreign concept to me, I just don’t know what to do.

I really just need help on how to approach this and ask her questions. Any help is appreciated, thanks",16Feb2020,1

Hello everyone

I just wanted to share my story to see if anyone here has had a similar experience to mine or to see if y’all have any advice to help turn things around.

So, ever since I graduated high school, I knew I wanted to set myself up to be financially secure. I did everything I could to help me reach this goal—I went to a community college my first two years of college, studied something with great job prospects (Accounting and Finance double major and then did a masters In accounting), lived at home during college, and got almost perfect grades to help me get some scholarships. In addition, I worked almost 30 hours a week during college through numerous internships. I made a lot of sacrifices and my whole life the last six years have been about school and work. I worked incredibly hard and accomplished almost anything I set my mind to.

I am a licensed CPA and make 73/k a year before taxes. I finished my masters in accounting in September 2019. My finances are:

     Index funds/ IRA Contributions: 85k
     Traditional 401k Value: 15.5k
     Cash: 9k
     Total Net Worth: 109k

Also purchased a 2016 Honda Civic with 10k miles with cash. No debt or student loans at all.

I am incredibly proud of the wealth I have built. However, I have let $$$ control my life for the last six years and I need to change that. I have basically neglected a lot of my friendships and relationships the last six years cause I have been doing nothing but working or studying and working out when I have time. I basically have no friends anymore which makes me very sad. The last couple months have been very hard for me now that I am done with school— I just don’t know what to do with my free time. I feel like I forgot how to have fun. I have become a boring person in a sense. I want to change and I know I have been struggling with anxiety/depression as well. 

I don’t hate my job, but I am definitely not passionate about it. Idk I just get bored sometimes working in an office. I mainly picked being a CPA for stability/ pay,  not because I am super passionate about it. 

I still live at home and want to move out soon. Hopefully that helps me make new friends and meet a nice girl lol. I also want to start therapy. Feel like that will help me.

I just wanted to share my story to see if anyone had ever gone through anything similar. I am doing very well on a surface level, but feel numb inside a lot of the time. Remember $$$ isn’t everything guys.",16Feb2020,1

900,"I cant believe I have to censore myself on f*****g reddit, wt* man? This is gonna be a long one. So there is this girl at my job that I kinda like. We work in different areas of the warehouse, and our brakes are usually seperate, so its very difficult to find time to talk to her. Our areas are right next to eachother, so we can see eachother coming and going and sometimes while working from across the room, but way too far to talk to eachother. Sometimes I really feel like she's looking at me like she might be interested. Every couple of weeks the assembly line runs out of stuff to do, and I get sent to her area to stand and label stuff all day (very boring). But when im over there I always end up on the other side of the lines/shelves so we still cant talk till brake. During brake there are always 2 guys hanging out with her, one seems like a bit of a tough guy and the other, seems like a wannabe pretty boy socialite, but still not a push over. Im no push over myself and I'm fairly attractive, but I'm a bit socially inept/antisocial (I have been working on it). I heard she recently got a boyfreind but Im guessing hes not from the warehouse, and idk if they are still a thing. So I have a lot of obstacles and very limited opportunitys to talk. 

When I first started about a month ago, the line was down for 2 days and I was in her area and talked to her a little bit with some other people. I learned a little bit about her. Shes 24, same age as me. Shes been here for 9 months. And shes bit weird and maybe too open about her personal life...things I also can be guilty of sometimes. She was talking about how she has to take care of her parents, because they are both really ill and cant take care of themselves. Which is sad, but also something I sort of relate to. A couple years ago my mom relapsed on meth, and long story short, I had to give up my plans to start college and all of the money I saved to take care of her kids for about 2 years. I also had to kick her out, keep her out till i got a place with some financial help from my mentally unstable dad who has a distant and complicated relationship with my family, and wait until she went through rehab and worked her way back toward stable income and a large enough house to move the kids back in with her. Im staying with them now and ill be moving into an apartment at the end of the month, since everything is relatively stable now. So anyway, I casually mentioned that I had to take care of family for a while too. We only talked a little bit other than that, and it seemed like she didnt want to talk to me much campared to everyone else, so I quit trying to talk to her for the rest of the day.

 Since then a couple guys have slowy figured out that I have a some interest in her even though I never directly admitted to it, and have told me I should try to talk to her. It which makes me wonder if they have said anything to her about me. My response to them is always that Im not looking for any freinds or women right now because Im not in a good place to handle all that yet. Which is true, I'm working my way out of a deep depression I fell into while dealing with my fucked up family, and Im trying to take one step at a time. I even rejected a girl I kinda liked at my last job because of it. I occasionally have really brief encounters with her, like I would have with any random person in the warehouse that I dont know, but no real conversations up until this friday. 

So on monday somebody told me she was crying and left work early because her mom was ""sick"". For the rest of the week she seemed normal. On friday (valentines day) I was working in her area, meaning we had the same brake, but again we were too far to communicate. I didnt try to catch up to her to talk on the way to brake, because a: Im usaually tired and irritated at work and feel stressed around so many people, so I dont go out of my way to talk to anyone, but Im freindly and can talk if they aproach me. And b: any time I try to approach even remotely attractive women at work and start a casual conversation, they act all weird and b****y, so I quit trying that. During break I kept to myself and watched something on my phone like usual, and of course those guys were around her. On the way out she was right behind me and awkwardly tried to start a conversation with me about some bordeline racist joke she saw on facebook, and I turned around intending to talk to her. Then one of those c***blocking motherf*****s called her over and she had to go see what he wanted, even though she seemed a bit annoyed. So after standing there for a second, I kept walking. Of course he walked with her all the way to her area, even though he works on the otherside of the warehouse.

At the end of the day, I finally ended up walking alone with her to clock out and leave, which is about a 2 minute walk, except she walks really fast because she wants to get home to her mom. So before I could ask her what she was trying to tell me earlier today, she starts telling me about it again, and then the conversation shifted to her being a mess on moday and leaving early. She told me her mom had some kind of muscle atrophy from a blood infection or something and it got worse recently, and she said she has to get stronger so that she can lift her into bed and stuff. At the moment all I could think to say was that Im sorry and that I hope somehow things get better for her, and then awkwardly said ""well have a nice weekend...I guess"" before she got in the car. 

I have been thinking about it all weekend and Im starting to wonder if I should offer some kind of help. I dont know if there is anything I could do to help, but Im willing to be there if she needs it. Im just not sure how to ask her or if it would be innapropriet. I figure I might just ask her if anybody is helping her, and if not id be willing to help if she needs it. I know she doesnt know me but maybe if I explain to her how I had to take care of family and that in some ways I understand her stress, it would make sense for me to want to help. I just feel like people should have someone looking out for them in these kinds of situations.

 I just dont know if it would be weird for me offer, but I dont see why those p*****s hanging out with her havent offered some help, unless she doesnt need it. I also dont know if ill find an opportunity to talk to her about it because there are typically people around her. And if she does go for it, Im worried she might try to pull me into a relationship, because I dont think I can handle that right now, but I also dont want to leave her alone in this. I'm just very confused on what I should do. I do like her but I dont want to end up in a relationship, but I dont want to make her feel bad if I go to help her and she catches feelings, which I feel like is likely to happen. Should I try to get to know her more before I offer? It seems like if she does need help, then the offer wont be so genuine if I wait forever to offer it, and I just dont want to leave someone stuck like that for long, because I get all protective for people when I see them struggling, especially if its agirl I like. Or maybe I should just leave it alone and keep keeping to myself, but then feel like a total ba*****d for not helping someone who might need it. Any suggestions?",16Feb2020,1

902,"(I'm making this under a throwaway account in case anyone were to snoop if I'm on my main.)

My younger sister and I live with our mom.  I can't exactly leave, due to situations beyond my control, nor do I have any other family I can reach out to.  A lot of what she does irks me, but it's only recently I've realized how filthy and vulgar this woman is.  The thing is, I don't know if she's always been a slob or if I've only just began to see it this way.

Despite being nearly 60 years old, she still chews with her mouth open and gulps down beverages like she's never had anything to drink in her life.  She knows the sounds irritate me, but she continues to do it.  She either calls me into the living room to tell me something and will smack on food while doing it or will call me on the phone while she's working either chewing on mints, snapping gum, or just chomping on some kind of snack.  I have asked her not to eat while talking to me or please close her mouth, but she will not do either.

She will also call me into the living room to talk or tell me something that is usually no big emergency but she acts like it is, and will sit there with at least one leg thrown over the arm of her recliner.  While talking, she's either digging in her nose or scratching her crotch.

She will throw trash on the floor or pile it up on a table before she can be bothered to walk to a trash can, either in the kitchen or bathroom, to throw something away.  There are empty drink bottles, food wrappers, junk mail, magazines, all scattered around the living room floor.  She also lets dishes pile up in the sink and will not wash for days, sometimes past a week.  I know she works, but the only things I do not do around the house are the dishes or clean up the living room, especially the living room.  It is not my mess, I do not make it.  I will rinse my dishes when I am done with them and put them away, but she will grab a bowl, eat chips out of it, and grab another bowl for something else instead of simply wiping out the first bowl.

I stood in the kitchen with her one night a few weeks ago while she was cooking dinner.  She took the last stick of butter out of the box, looked at me, and then dropped the empty box on the floor.  Not only was the trash can six feet away from her, but I was standing right by it.  She could have handed it to me to throw out.

The absolute worse as of late, though, is she cannot be bothered to get up and walk out of her room and to the bathroom.  She will pee in a trash can in her room, let it sit, and then later lug it out and flush it.  Her room reeks of piss but she either doesn't realize or doesn't care.  One of our latest subjects of contention is please get my sister out of my room. She is keeping me up and I need privacy and space.  She will tell me ""Just go to my room if you want some privacy and solitude.""  I have come so close to blurting out that no one wants to go in your room because it smells like a piss soaked fish market, but I stop myself.  It seems rude and disrespectful, yet I don't know how to tell her otherwise.

I also don't know if just talking to her will work.  There have been many moments in the past few years where I have broken down, hysterical sobbing sometimes, begging her to help me, I can't do this by myself, I can't take care of the house by myself, I'm tired of having to act like the parent, and she'll just tell me, ""You're not the parent.  Things will change.""  But they either never do or get worse.  I thought of posting this under a rant subreddit, because it feels like a rant, but I am hoping for some kind of advice.",16Feb2020,1
