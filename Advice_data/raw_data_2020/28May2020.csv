0,So I have myself(14M) my 2 older sisters(16F/18F) my 3 older brothers(24M/26M/30M) from my dads previous marriage. I have always struggled with emotions and has had a short fuse I would get depressed and overall unstable as long as I can remember. Friday of last week I was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I am officially the mess up of the family. My dad runs a company that my grandfather started that is a huge company in north America. My brothers are also work there with my oldest brother next in line to be CFO. My oldest sister is going to Stanford University next year. My other sister has a digital art free lance career. When I explained to them I felt this way my mom and my sisters especially started treating me different. Ever since friday shit hasn't been the same. My sisters are a lot nicer not saying they were mean before but they would tease me here and there but that's not a thing anymore. My mom has been letting me sleep in more and scheduled the cleaning people to come later on Saturday(cleaning people come 3 times a week and normally early in the morning) because I was up late Friday with everything that happened. I explained to them I dont want my diagnosis to change how they see me but they deny that being a thing. My dad has put a lot less stress on me for school work. Like my dad had a strict rule where I cant use my gaming pc till I do a couple hours of school work on my school laptop(my sisters and I are homeschooled) but he has been relaxed with that aswell. They dont seem to understand I can see right through what they are doing and it's only making me feel worse about my diagnose. What can I do to make them realize this?,28May2020,1

3,"Years ago I downloaded an app that wasn’t on the App Store onto my iPhone. My phone is not jail broken or anything I just downloaded it using the certificate method. This was about 4 years ago. I did it when I was a dumb teenager who didn’t know any better. Now as an adult I’m worried that there’s possibly still malware/spyware on my phone somehow. I have no evidence that anything’s wrong I’m just anxiety prone and can’t stop worrying about it. The question is, should I be worried? I checked and the app isn’t on my phone and hasn’t been for years.",28May2020,1

5,"So, yesterday on accident I swallowed half of a toothpick. I chewed it up a little bit before I swallowed it, I called my mother and she took me directly to the ER where we waited 5 hours. The doctor scanned some xrays, Tried to get a followup from the hospital in Nashville (I live in Tennessee) he couldn't get a followup and said that since it's small and wooden that he believes it will soften in the stomach acid. Well, I get home and I start having a burning feeling and some cramps. So I called the paramedics, and they were from a different hosbital and told me not to worry and that discomfort and pain will occur. And that usually, The toothpick would get stuck in the esophagus if it was full. I'm having some stomach pain and I'm really worried about it. Am I just paranoid?",28May2020,1

7,"I am 24 and ever since I was in 5th grade I have bitten my nails. I have had some periods of time where my nails have been long but eventually I bite them. I have tried no bite nail polish, press on nails, and restricting nail biting.   


I know nail biting can cause health issues as learned by M\*A\*S\*H and the internet. I really want to stop using this as a way to cope with  stress.

8,"My mom has been treating me like a victim. I don’t want to give out too much information but the bottom line is she perceives me to be the victim. My little sister belittles me and we used to get into arguments a lot. We don’t anymore as much. Yes, I have talked to my mom about this not too long ago, instead of just talking about it turned into a lecture about me needing to stand up for myself and then we began yelling. She started going on about how I shouldn’t be intimidated by my sister and I needed to stand up for myself for once. I started screaming about how I’ve been doing that for a long time and what I have been doing in those situations was of my own accord. She says that it seems like I don’t stand up and I gave her examples about how I have been doing just that. She used to tell me to ignore it but she perceives that as being too intimidated to do anything. I yelled at her that the only reason she sees me as a victim is because she perceives me as one.",28May2020,1
9,"So I (18F) just graduated high school this month, I’ve worked at a golf course as a cart person ( I clean the golf carts, put them away, collect all the golf balls from the range, clean golf balls stuff like that) for about 2 years. I live in southern Arizona and my job is mostly outside so it gets very hot, especially during the summer  (today it is 105ish). I’ve thought about leaving a few times over the years. I’m very pale and I’m not very great at the manual labor aspects but the people I work with are nice and I could be somewhat flexible with my schedule so I’ve stayed for a while. 
I plan on going to a community college for the first two years and transferring to a university to save money, I’m staying at my house for the community college years and I have a decent amount in both my savings and checkings. I thought this summer would be a good time to quit because i would get a little time to relax before I start school full time and I’m planning on working in the medical field so there will definitely be clinicals and things to deal with, besides I worked really hard in high school and am graduating high school with a few college credits already and I’m also a CNA. 
I don’t plan on taking a gap year and I don’t plan on going on any big expensive trips during the summer. Now when I mentioned this to my mom she started sounding very sad and said she didn’t understand, she said that I would be making a mistake and she is very sad for me. 
I thought this was a good idea and that I had earned a little break before doing more school and working the rest of my life. But what she said made me very anxious, would taking off this summer be a bad idea? I’m really unsure now and my mom made me feel like I would be making a huge huge mistake. 

Extra information: i also recently finished taking accutane a couple months ago (it’s like a really intense, harsh medication for acne and I still have side effects from it) this means my skin is much much more sensitive than it was before and I’m a very pale, don’t tan in the sun kinda person. Working in the spring has already caused a million sun spots to pop up on me and I use a lot of sunscreen. Plus, I do have some families I babysit for occasionally and I make 40+ dollars from that when I do it so I would still occasionally get money.",28May2020,1
10,"I've known both of them for several years and we are good friends, when I met both of them they had explained to me about her issues, she's bipolar, depressive, and suicidal but recently it's gotten a bit out of hand.

For one she refuses treatment, whether it's therapy or medication, prefers to self harm in any way possible (the latest way is large amounts of alcohol) and my friend enables these things because ""I have to give in to what she wants"".

The details of her traumatic past are vague because even my friend hasn't a clue because she ""can't trust anyone"".

In fact the last time I went over I tried talking to her about it, hoping to see if maybe I could understand a bit more to help her and she started screaming ""No! You're one of them! You want to lock me up forever!"" and stormed off to her bedroom (they sleep separately) and I could hear her chugging something while sobbing loudly, as my friend tried to console her. 

According to him the reason why he gives in and doesn't help her seek assistance is because he promised her that he would never make her do something she didn't want to do, even if it means her own destruction. 

Is there even anything I or anyone can do? Is what he is doing legal? Should I even bother helping? I'd hate to lose them.",28May2020,1
11,"I used to have such a good routine that my body would naturally follow. I was always asleep by 11pm and awake by 6am even without an alarm.

13,"I(20m) talk a lot about my future plans, and my parents always tell me to strive for things that are more realistic. In a year, I want to move cross country and eventually start my own real estate business/business in general. I’m financially stable and have enough saved up to move and support myself for the first 6 months worst case scenario, but I still live with my parents currently. Every time I speak about moving or start to make arrangements for my future plans, my parents just say “oh you’re not going to move across the country. You’ll be right back.” I always say “what makes you think that?” They usually go quiet or just say “you’re happy here.” They think that I should stay within 100 miles of my hometown and find a job somewhere where I can work my way up to manager.

16,"TL;DR at bottom. This is going to be long.


I have been married to my wife for just over 3 years now. Because of covid, MIL has moved in with us right before lockdown so she wouldn't be alone. I pretty much had no say in this since my wife is her only child and the mother her only parent. MIL had the daughter young and hasn't seemed to mentally grow past that age. In the time I've known her she is very sexual. She has always flirted with me but she does that with everyone.

Incident one. (At Christmas she sat on my lap and my wife asked why she didn't sit on the chair. She said ""it's too soft I need a hard one."" I felt shockwaves go through me and all my wife did was laugh).  

Incident 2. ( I dropped my car off at the shop and she was giving me a ride back. As we were going along a motel was coming up and she enthusiastically said ""let's get a room. Wanna?"". I assume she was joking and joked back ""why not just pull over somewhere"" in a light hearted way. She then scowled and said ""no class at all"" and then there was a really tense and quiet vibe until I turned on the radio. Had my wife drive me the next time. I didn't mention the incident.


MIL goes out a lot and more than I can count I have had to pick her up at last call. Sometimes have to pull her off a guy which is never a fun conversation. Other than that she would give you the shirt off her back. Very supportive and an open ear. She has helped my wife and I's relationship with some advice in tough times. She is a very nice woman most of the time.

So now that stay at home lockdown is here we are pretty much together all the time. This has been a big damper in the bedroom due to lack of privacy and  her bedroom is next to ours. I realize this is happening everywhere and it's something I need to adjust to as she is my family now. 

This leads me to what happened yesterday when my wife went to the groceries.

I was in living room watching tv when she came in and started watching and making small talk. She then commented she hasn't heard much action going on from our bedroom (while bouncing on her sofa cushion with her tongue out like she was orgasming). I gave her a funny look and she joked  that she puts a glass against the wall everynight. I stupidly, stupidly, very stupidly said that not much can go on since there isn't much privacy. The look on her face is one no son in law wants to see. She glared and said in a menacing tone ""well if you need help with that you come find me"" and literally STOMPED off. I let her sit in her room until my wife got home and then I went out for a run. After that it was like nothing had happened. We watched a movie all together before bed.

This is getting a bit tense and these conversations shouldn't be happening. I don't know how to tell this to my wife and not have it ruin their relationship. Not to mention our marriage. Another thing is that since there has been a lack of bedroom that menacing command had me turned on like I haven't been in a very long time. 

The advice I need is what to do? It isn't like this goes on all the time but I can feel the sexual tension between us. Today throughout the afternoon I can feel her looking at me.

TL;DR - MIL is making advances that she is over dramatic with so they pass off like jokes. She has moved in during covid and it is escalating.",28May2020,1
17,"Where do I start?! I’ll try my best to keep it short n’ sweet. My husband and I have been married for 22 years. I [ 41f ] was 19 when we got married &amp; he was 28 years old. We have 5 children together. It has been an INCREDIBLY rocky marriage. Not as much with fighting, but more with infidelity. Mostly me being the unfaithful one. He was raised Mormon/LDS &amp; I was  raised Buddhist. Believe it or not, they are more similar than they are different. I wanted to convert as Buddhism didn’t feel ‘right’ to me. During our marriage we weren’t 100% devout in our church, but we weren’t “Jack Mormon’s” either.  About 7/8 years ago, during one of our rough patches, I suggested we venture out more sexually because he was older &amp; more experienced &amp; I was relatively naive. He agreed &amp; thus started our temporary exploration of being swingers. Temporary because we both agreed it would be on the basis that ‘I’d get it out of my system’ &amp; we would then get married in the Temple. That should bring you mostly up to speed &amp; to when the current problem started roughly about 2/3 years ago.
  About 2.5 years ago I went to visit my father in Northern California. While I was there, for some reason, I happened to be looking at our family Life360 app. I saw that he was at a swingers club that we frequented, but he was there without my knowledge or consent. For those of you who don’t know, just because we’re swingers does NOT mean that we are free to f**k whom we wish when we wish. Every couple has their own rules &amp; boundaries. So, not only did he go to the club without talking to me, he also was at a hotel. I forget the duration of time he was at the hotel, all I remember was it was long enough for things to happen. Upon seeing these things on the Life360 app I then logged into his email account &amp; our Craigslist account. That’s when things got worse. I found evidence of him communicating with another guy. Yes, you read that correctly. Another guy. I saved all the evidence &amp; decided to confront him when I got back home to Arizona. 
     I confronted him, and he SWORE up n down that nothing came of it. Backing up a little, during our marriage I’ve come to know that there is one thing, as far as I know, that he has never lied to me on. When he says ‘I swear to God’, he means it. I’ve never caught him lying when I’ve asked him to swear to God.  So after some time I let go of all the feelings &amp; reservations I had due to that situation......... Until the other day.  We we’re running errands together &amp; I had left my phone at home. I was using his phone to look up some stuff we were talking about. As I was opening another tab on his search engine, I see a tab for google mail. Instantly it struck me as odd. He has his mail on his mail app. Why would he log into it via safari??? So on one of our stops he hopped out of the car &amp; I stayed in &amp; did some investigating. Needless to say, I found more of the same. Plus later I found a video of him. I’ve saved it all. I’m going to wait &amp; see if I collect more evidence &amp; see if he confronts me. 
     Essentially I want to confront him &amp; tell him I think we need to have an open relationship. 
     I could really use your thoughts, perspectives &amp; opinions. 

**side note, I have been doing personal therapy for the better part of 11 years &amp; we have done approximately 3-4 years of couples counseling.",28May2020,1
18,"This is going to be a long post.

A couple years back, I was in an abusive relationship and was an asshole to everybody. I understand that how I acted was completely wrong, and now that I am out of that relationship, I am a much better person for it.

The problem is that, now, I still don't feel like I'm allowed to make mistakes. I'm still pinned as the asshole of the family and no matter what I do, it becomes my fault. I understand grudges, but this is more than that. This is them always making themselves become the victims.

For example: My brother called our cousin cancerous. That's bad on its own, until you remember that his mom is also dying of stage four cancer. When I call him out on it, saying that it's wrong, he tells me to chill out and that it's just the way boys talk. My mom doesn't bother to say anything but just pushes us to make up so we can get it over with. No apology to the cousin and no validation for me telling me that standing up for my cousin was the right thing to do.

Today, we were joking around. I say that he looks like our cousin that we both hate as a joke and he splashes water on me (also as a joke) and then gets upset when I tell him that he could've ruined my stuff. Says that I'm overreacting. Maybe so, but couldn't you just apologize anyway? He ended up calling me a jerk for not taking his obviously half-assed apology seriously, and my mom sided with him because, again, she just wants us to make up and get it over with. She told me to apologize to him. Why? For making fun of my cousin. Doesn't even acknowledge that what he did might've been wrong.

Even before this, my mom has been emotionally abusive to me. She would refuse to get me professional help after my abusive relationship took a huge toll on my mental health. My school threatened to call CPS on her, and that's when she finally got me help. Before that, she would call me manipulative for asking her for therapy and for using any resource I could to get the help I needed. She would yell at me to get my shit together instead of getting me the professional help I deserved. I still don't forgive her for that, even if she's gotten better.

I guess I'm not asking for advice anymore. I just want to know, what am I doing wrong? Is it my family and not me? What did I do to deserve this? Is it because I was an asshole in the past? Do I still deserve the life I have just because of how I acted before? I feel so hurt and so lost and nobody can understand why I can't wait to get out of this house. I hate this situation.  Please tell me what I'm doing so wrong.  They're so nice to everybody else.  Why me?",28May2020,1

20,"My boyfriend has a pretty large friend group with 15 or so guys. One of the guys (we’ll call him Tom) repeatedly talks about cheating on his gf... sliding up on other girls stories calling them hot, and messages other girls saying he’d hookup with them and probably more.

My boyfriend and I both agree what he’s doing is wrong but it’s his friend and “bro code”
We don’t want to be involved in any drama so we decided to message her anonymously.

So I made a fake insta account and messaged the girl saying 
“Just letting you know, Tom has the intention of cheating on you and has said he would. Do what you want with this, you deserve to know the truth.”

But they are still together... 
What should I do? Message her again? Leave it alone? 

I know it’s not really my place but as someone who has been cheated on she deserves to know.",28May2020,1
21,"We met on a pen pal app where we exchanged letters for some time. We lost contact because I didn’t write back for a week (I was depressed). I decided to write back to his new user I found, after 6 months. I kept thinking about it and I wanted to at least apologize, explain why I stopped writing with him and say thank you for all the letters.

I didn't think he would respond, but he wrote a nice letter back and said he was happy I found him. We started writing to each-other again for almost a month.

One week ago, he told me he didn’t want to write letters anymore but we could text. I was honestly a little shocked and hesitant but I have now texted him for one week. He quickly started sending me voice records and I also got some pictures of him. I was happy to get those, but I am extremely socially anxious, and I am really uncomfortable about making voice records or sending photos of myself. I felt bad and awkward about the unequal sharing. But he said it was okay.

I promised to talk on the phone. I am not comfortable talking on the phone with anyone, let alone talking in English and while other people are around. I had to wait for a time that I was alone. I had planned it so I was alone yesterday, but the plan failed. After that, he sent a text saying that he really doesn’t want to text anymore. He will talk on the phone but he very strongly doesn’t want to text. I finally sent a picture of myself and promised to talk on the phone when I could. He told me to text him when I was okay with talking. I have not texted him since then.

So, tomorrow I will be alone. But now I’m so confused and a little mad. I am very anxious and he has been very nice and okay about it. But it seems like he is now angry or probably more disappointed at me. I understand that it is annoying for him to be the only one who sends voice records and shares more. But I still get sad. He texted me in a nice way, but it didn't feel nice. I don’t know what we should talk about anymore too, because this is all very weird. And I don´t know if he even wants to talk to me. He doesn’t want to text at all, and I feel like that means he is uninterested. Why would he want to talk to me? I don’t know if I want to talk to him then.

I wrote to him half a year later, because he was really nice, funny and easy to talk to. He was honest and personal. I liked him a lot, and I have told him that too. And it is very awkward because I think I say it unnecessarily much. I should say that I think I have been really obsessive and stressed. I have not slept well at all this week, because I have had crazy realistic dreams. I have dreamed about whole conversations with him. I have had to check and see if it was real or not every night. And I have woken up at 7am everyday without an alarm because my body thinks he has written something. I normally sleep fine. 

So. Should explain to him that I should stop writing with him completely? It will hurt a lot to stop talking with him, but it has already been very painful.

Or, should I talk with him on the phone tomorrow or later, and try to make sense of what his opinions about it are and try to tell him about what I feel? I wish I could have a better and more relaxed relationship with him, but I don’t know how I can do that. I also don’t feel that anxious about talking anymore, because I shared a picture of me. But I am anxious about the actual conversation now. I don’t know if I will get to say what I want.

I hope someone has some advice for me in any way, because I really need it. I don´t know what to do.

Thank you so much.",28May2020,1
22,"To really cut down all the details, and not bore you with all the fluff, I recently heard all of the absolutely insane theories my friend has about me, and something I recently did.  This was a friend that was a 'friend with benefits', but never progressed to an actual relationship.  

Hearing this person's theories was disturbing, somewhat comedic at times, frustrating, and all sorts of emotions.  

I was amazed at how someone can play so many mental gymnastics to try to rationalize someone else's behavior.  There wasn't a single theory that was even remotely correct.  And these theories came to life while this person talked to their friends to try to make sense of it.  Like I said, some of these theories are hilarious.  

So now the tables have turned, and this person did something to me.  And My mind completely goes to a place where I'm thinking it was a manipulative thing to do, planned, and executed.  But in reality, it could really just be a genuine question this person needed to ask me.  Regardless of the intent, it got in my head.  I think this person is a narcissistic and is gaslighting me.  I didn't know there was a word for what I've felt like I have experienced for quite some time, until somewhat recently, and when I started hearing it get used a lot, then looked it up, I was in denial of that term, probably deep down because I knew it was what I was experiencing.  And now I'm the one coming up with theories, and what not.  It's really not possible to contact this person for clarification at this time.

If I were to call any of my friends right now, and share my theory, they would all absolutely 100% agree with me immediately, and begin to reinforce my ideas, giving me confirmation bias, and it would make them dislike this person that much more.  I am hoping us not spending so much time together, and no longer being friends with benefits, will kind of fix the issues we've had with each other.  Maybe I'm being naive.   

I'm just kinda sharing how a lot of us are probably dead wrong when we try to rationalize someone else's behavior.  And the friends to whom we vent, are more than likely just taking our side and allowing us to vent.  Occasionally a friend might call us out on our own bullshit, and that's a true friend, but when the friends don't know all the details, they just have to go with what you are telling them, and try to rationalize right along with you.",28May2020,1

29,"A few of my friends asked if I was going to be at my apartment over the summer. 

My apartment is near my university and my friends are forced to move out of their on campus dorm before they have access to their new apartment. So they wanted to know if I would be in town to store some of their stuff at my place. 

I’m at an internship right now commuting from my parents’ place. The commute is longer from my parents’ place but not too bad, my parents wanted me to get used to driving (especially highways) and are worried I would get into a car crash. My mom proposed I commute with them to/from work for the first 1-2 weeks (to feel more comfortable with driving) before I go back to my apartment. It is now the second week and I feel confident in driving.

When my friends asked if they could store stuff at my place, I thought I would be in my university town pretty soon and for most of the summer, so i checked with my roommates (who were totally fine with it) and said sure! 

My friends would move out in June and move to their apartment in July, and recently they let me know the dates/times they were gonna be bringing stuff over to our apartment (which are coming up soon).

Right now it’s feeling harder to get away from my parents’ place, because my mom doesn’t seem to want me to go back. I am however feeling much more comfortable driving on highways and other roads. I know I can do it safely. 

Also I found a route to work from my university apartment that doesn’t include highways at all. My parents and I talked about taking this route earlier before I started work. 

I feel awful because I think I should have told my friends I wouldn’t be able to be at the apartment a ton over the summer, at least not as much as I originally planned. But when they asked me I thought I’d be at my apartment for most of the summer... it’s too late now, and I can’t just pull out at the last minute. 

I also feel bad because I originally thought “I can do it! No problem at all” and didn’t take into account much of my parents’ time and worries. My mom I think doesn’t want me to go back to my apartment because she won’t be able to monitor my drive to/from work as easily, wont know if I’m eating well, if I’m staying safe at the apartment, if I’m having parking issues, etc. (all of these things I know I can do fine but my mom doesn’t seem to think so)

I know I can do it, and that any problems that come up I can figure things out, but I think it’s gonna take a bit more time for my mom to trust me. 

But I already promised my friends, and I need to be back during those times to let them in and help them store things. 

I’m worried that things won’t work out and my friends will either hate me for not being able to make it or my parents being stressed out about getting me to my apartment at specific dates/taking a new route to work... or both. 

One of my roommates offered to go up and let my friends in if I couldn’t make it, I checked with her again about it and she says she “thinks she can make it.” I’m worried about the “think” part— that she might not be able to go. And if she can’t and I can’t, I’m screwed, and so are my friends. 

I’m so worried, I know I made this mess, but I can’t really undo anything at this point. Any advice on moving forward with this?",28May2020,1

I was a scared anxious 15 year old and I googled why I felt that way and it said heart attack.

31,"Honestly, I can try to make this short. 
My dad left the picture when I was a toddler. Addicted to drugs and alcohol. In &amp; out of jail. Got clean when I was about 13, saw him every now and then.. but it was whatever. I’m 21F. My dad is all about himself. Always has been. Always will be. In fact, when I FaceTimed him to tell him about my engagement, I got the dullest response that he was so happy for me and then he changed the subject to tell me of his new house he’s building and how I need to come see it. Or come see him or have dinner with him.  God forbid he even meet me halfway. Okay blah blah blah, I said I’d make it short. I love him, I have a fine relationship now (even though he is how he is and I get annoyed), but he’s really contributed nothing to my life growing up... at all. 

Stepdad is a hero to say the least. My stepdad has been in my life since I was 8. Although it was rough at first, (first of all he was tryin to take my mom away wth) as I got older, I came to understand how much he loved me and cared for me and only wants what’s best for me. He’s been an incredible father. I could really go on forever about how great of an influence he has been in my life &amp; how much he has done for me and how he has raised me to be a smart, mature woman! I feel that he deserves to give me away on my wedding day. 

What do I do? 

Should I have my mom walk me down the aisle? 
Or should I pick a dad? 

I’m almost positive that my biological father is going to throw a fit and be so upset with me if I choose my stepdad. He’s so narcissistic and I feel like he will guilt the crap out of me. 
My stepdad and I have talked about this and he knows I want him to give me away but understands the drama that my biological father will bring. 
But I still want to make the right decision. 

Help me please. I feel so torn. 
Also, feel free to ask anything if I didn’t include enough info. I’m very scattered. 
Thank you so much in advance",28May2020,1
33,"I (23f) got out of an extremely toxic relationship with someone (24m)  who is a covert narcissist. After the relationship ended he wanted to stay friends but I basically called him out for how badly he treated me and said if you want me to consider that I need a genuine apology. Obviously never got one. I realize now (shoutout to my therapist) that he’s a narcissist and I know I’ll never get an apology. 

But I realized in the previous messages i sent him, I was really nice- even while calling him out.  I was so gentle. And it pisses me off. This guy was so manipulative, controlling, selfish- you name it.

I’ve been able to process everything he said to me and realize just how awful and gross he really is. And also realized he has a weird fetish for young looking girls. Luckily I’m not the only person who sees who he is-  and I want to send one final message telling him exactly what I think- no trying to be nice, or considerate- none of that- just brutally honest. I know he’s not going to respond and my friend obviously thinks it’s a bad idea, but I let him push me around for so long it’s like for once I want to stand up for myself and truly call him out for how he treated me. It’s more for myself because I know he’ll probably not even read it and if he does it’ll go in one ear and out the other.

Anyway we chat and turns out we both had a thing for each other.

We move over to socials.

Talking is great, good level of interest but also flirting and replying to each other stories in flirty ways.

She did a really forward thing last week and like a post of mine on insta a couple months ago and put a flirty comment down.

However I’ve been left on delivered for 2 days going on 3, usually text everyday but usually every 7-8hrs which is calm sometimes shorter sometimes longer.

However yesterday she turned location off randomly and only put it back on a few hours ago but says she was at a park, idc just weird she never turns it off.

Basically I know this girl in person, we have had good chats and last message wasn’t anything different, I wanna ask her if she’s all good as Ik these times are tough for everyone, but I don’t wanna come off clingy.

43,"My ex and I ended a five year relationship about four months ago. She has been seeing someone else for possibly a month idk, I’m not invasive in her life. I told her that I wanted to meet anyone she was dating before they are around our child. Which seems reasonable to me and she’s agreed. 
  However, I didn’t expect her to already be asking me to meet a guy. I’m not sure if it’s too much for me to be negative of this. Am I setting up too unrealistic of a standard by saying I don’t want him meeting anyone yet, and how long should I even wait to make that call? 
  I know she is also his parent and has the right to make her own judgements, but I’ve known her to be too trusting of people far too quickly.   
  She is living with her parents right now and I know that it is probably adding pressure on her to bring our kid when she goes out with her boyfriend because she doesn’t just want to leave him with them all the time.

44,"I’m not trying to sound like some kind on incel or misogynist in this at all, but I do feel like just on a level, person to person, this was bothersome.

I’ve been talking with this girl for a bit and I think I made an error of not making my intentions abundantly clear from the start. We’ve known each other but never been particularly close. There have been times we’ve said “we need to hangout soon!” Etc, but I didn’t want to fall into the thing of hanging out a lot only to be let down if she didn’t reciprocate those feelings later on. So I simply asked “hey would you be interested in doing a dinner date sometime soon?”, and I haven’t heard from her since.

I just think this is kind of rude and flippant to do. I wouldn’t have made a big deal in any way if she said she wasn’t interested like that, but I’d rather be dignified with that answer than left with no answer at all as if I scared her away or crossed some line.

45,"So I'm 27 years old, have a four year old, and currently work in construction as an apprentice plumber. I live with my parents. I have debt I'm trying to pay off. A couple of years ago, I took a break from construction to pursue programming (did a 6 month boot camp), and after 1.5 years, realized I hated coding/am not good at it. I've since been in and out of community college, and out of the 8 classes I have signed up for, only completed 2.

I don't enjoy plumbing at all, and am looking for something else, but in the meantime I still give my current job maximum effort (always on time, staying positive, willingness to learn, studying plumbing code etc). I'm signed up again to take English for the third time this fall. My son starts kindergarten this year too.

I have my hobbies and interests that I'd like to pursue, but they all take either time or money. I've volunteered for a political campaign for the first time in my life last year, tried martial arts (was awesome but expensive), and have made lifting/running a daily occurrence. I have not had a romantic partner since December 2017. Having a kid is a big no-no for chicks my age so I don't try anymore. Shits lonely yo.

I know nothing happens over night, but I'm just ready to live my own life. It's like there is this version of myself that I could have been or should have been, but I missed it a long time ago. I want to make a change to better myself and become the best father I can be. I just don't know where to start. 

  Right now my main focus is get rid of my debt (should be gone in a year if I stay the course I'm on). Then I can save up to move out. I just don't know if I should be focusing on quality of life, or standard of living. My son wont stop growing so I can get my shit together, and I feel so guilty that I cant give him the childhood he deserves.

So that's my wall of text. 

tl:dr

Life is confusing. I'll be thirty in a couple years, I have a child that I want the best for, and I don't know shit about myself or where I'm going. I'm open to any and all suggestions.",28May2020,1
46,"Its a complicated situation. Theyve been together since high school and theyre 22 right now. Their entire relationship she has been emotionally abusive to him. Calling him insults everyday, isolating him from friends (she doesnt have any so he shouldn’t), getting angry at whatever he does, putting down his interests, all the works. They live with us so my sister (20) and i (16) see this every single day. It’s heartbreaking. She sees herself as blameless and perfect and him as an idiot. 

A few months ago her mother and aunt came to our house and basically yelled at her for being immature and treating my boyfriend bad. She didnt really get the message. Then, a few weeks ago, he worked late (she doesn’t have a job, only a small business on fb selling jewelry but has had very very few clients, but “its not her fault” even tho it is) she got mad and locked him out of her room. 

2 days ago it got worse. It was memorial day and i guess they were gonna go out and do something. However my dad, uncle and cousin started working on my house, fixing it up, and he decided to help (my dad pays well). The entire day she got mad. So he tried to make it up to her by making funnel cakes and setting up a tent in the backyard to watch movies. But later that night she started yelling at him and pushing him out of their house out back (my sister says she threw things) before slamming the door in his face. He went into the main house crying and stayed crying for a few hours after. My mom finally came to her senses and told my sister if she does it again shes making her go with her mom. 

I wish it could be a simple breakup, but they have a year old daughter together. Theyre together for the baby and because they depend on each other. But i cant stand seeing him be treated like this every day. Like he’s worthless. His happiness has gone down and im worried for him mental health (he has depression and anxiety). I know no one else is gonna tell them to break up, and i dont even know if i should, its not my place. But if the roles were reversed? If my brother did that to her, he’d be in jail.

47,"I am fairly active on Instagram. My Instagram is private and mostly just for friends and family. I really try to keep everything clean because I am in college and am looking for jobs and will be for a while, and I know that employers look at things like social media. 
Recently, a person that I do not know tagged me in a photo. It was a photo of a girl obviously nude from the waist down wearing a long shirt in a sexualized position (nothing was like SHOWN shown, it was just obvious that she was not wearing anything under her shirt. The caption was “Do you want to see my private hot photos and videos? Link here.” 
I DMed the person and said the following:
“Hi - You tagged me in a photo that I find kind of inappropriate. I am looking for a job and I do not want possible employers to see me tagged in this photo. I would really appreciate it if you took that post down. I don’t wanna be an asshole, I just really don’t want that in my tagged pictures. Thanks!”

48,"What is the etiquette? How should I explain my situation? Are sex workers usually okay with just cuddling sometimes? Have you met any that were good with socially awkward clients?

My background: I'm an extremely lonely 25 year old virgin. I basically shut myself off from the world at 17 after I made a fool of myself at school. And now I've been isolated so long I've become socially retarded and can't seem to form bonds with other people even online friends. I have no real life friends, and as one would expect I've been in a constant state of loneliness and misery. I feel pathetic. It's a miracle I haven't killed myself yet, I think about it everyday and probably still will do it by the time I'm 30, but first one of the things I would like to do is have sex so that at least I do not die a virgin. I don't think it would ""fix"" me or my loneliness, depression or avoidant behavior. But I don't see how it could hurt either. Let me know if you've gotten anything out of it.

But the ""bucket list"" reason is not the main reason, I am also starving for human contact. The desperation for skin to skin contact - a hug or cuddle, is so strong it makes me forget about all the possible consequences of potentially fueling someones drug habit, contracting STDs, the sheer awkwardness of touching a complete stranger, etc. I would like to find someone who is ""clean"" and can meet up regularly for awkward cuddling and/or sex.

I've looked into cuddling services in my area, but I live in a small town and they seem to be sparse/nonexistent, so prostitution is my best bet for now. I know it will be very awkward because I am very awkward and probably on the spectrum, and also because I will be taking off my clothes in front of another person which I've never done before. But I don't care if it's awkward, I'm willing to power through because I think it might make me feel better, at least short term.

Keep in mind, I've asked this same question on here several times over the last year and a half, I always get the same responses telling me I shouldn't do it, **so to clarify:**

I will probably not ever find a date with a girl for the following reasons:

I have nothing going for me that I could sell myself on.

I am afraid to initiate anything with anyone.

I have extreme social anxiety, I can't look strangers in the eye.

Even if I convinced someone online to meet me, I cannot meet up with someone for a date because I am extremely awkward and extremely boring, uninteresting and unlikable, and since I have nothing going for me or anything positive to say, it would not go well and I would feel bad for the other person.

I don't even want a relationship. It would be torture for both of us because I only know how to live life selfishly. I would be a terrible partner. I also am extremely scared to commit to someone which is what most girls want.

I can't/don't want to see a therapist. For one, my problems are an inherent part of my personality now. I also have too much social anxiety and shame to tell them how pathetic I am as a person.

I can't/don't want to ""work on myself"" that ship has sailed. I'm 25 and have zero skills, talents or anything to offer the world, or any person whatsoever. I've been depressed for years, I don't have passion, **I don't like anything.** I am not ""cool"". I am all the negative connotations of a nerd with none of the positive connotations (smart, well read, with many cool hobbies etc).

Many of you will try to convince I'm not as bad as I seem, but everything I've said is true. I am irreversibly fucked in the head and people do not like men who look and act like little boys. Especially if they're mentally ill and stupid. It's too late to form bonds with people, and build a social circle, that is meant to happen in the adolescent stage of life and I catastrophically fucked that up at 17 years old. Shouldn't I at least have the right to have the basic life experiences everyone else has? Even if it's just a fantasy and not the real thing. **I have to pay for something like this**, I do not possess the attributes and abilities to get someone to do this with me without paying.

You can try to encourage me to try to get over this stuff but it's never worked in the past so you probably shouldn't.

**TL;DR** This is a desperate and selfish act because in the short term I really need human contact. I don't deserve human contact as I am a selfish outcast and weirdo, so I have to pay for it, which I'm fine with.  How do I do it, what is the etiquette?

Why is it every time I ask for advice on this people tell me I will regret it? I'm not even trying to be dramatic by bringing this up, but suicide is basically inevitable for me, why wouldn't I at least try this first? What do I have to lose?

two main questions

1. Should I move out

Less homophobia/discrimination (I'm gay)

Healthcare

Better quality of life

Colder climate (I cant stand hot/humid\_

Cheaper cost of living

**Cons:**

Away from family (my parents are pretty old 55ish. Worried that lets say in my 30s the might need my help)

Cost of moving (but I'm pretty sure among savings from parents for college+poss scholarship would help)

Struggle/Confusion/Wait times for entry.

Maybe no reason too? My family is reasonably wealthy (able to afford college), I live in the suburbs. Very little discrimination

I'm looking into doing art for videogames. (I have a digital tablet. I have a lot of experience with photoshop, a bit in 3d modelling) .

**What are career options in Canada compared to America. Is the job market harder, pay less, less jobs for a non-native?**

# (How should I move)

51,"To start off, we’ve been dating for almost two years as of my writing this. The issue of guys hitting on her and making moves has come up before, but recently it seems like everyday that a guy she is in close contact with says something to her or someone else about her figure or wanting to get with her, and it’s driving me up the wall.

I come from a background where guys get their asses kicked for doing stuff like that, but she doesn’t, and I think she truly does not understand how guys are sometimes. Where she’s from, guys taking girls is just drama, but I hate even the idea of it.

She’s very attractive, more than she realizes, and most of her friends just don’t know about me really. She keeps her dating life and friends separate. Is it wrong for me to want to go handle every guy that makes a move or a comment that she tells me about myself? And if it is, what can I do to stop it? Is it possible that my hostile reactions to these people bother her?",28May2020,1
52,"The relationship between my friend and his girl is very fucky. My best friend is an extremely easily manipulated person and is too nice to people. A year back (they have been with each other for a bit less than two years), three of his good friend including me talked to him concerned that he barely had the time to see us and chill with us anymore, fearing his girl had him by the balls or some shit. Consequently, he told us it was his fault, his girlfriend had nothing to do with it, and asked us to apologize to her for assuming so, which we did. His girl is a very special case (6 apparent exes back in boarding school, all of whom apparently cheated on her.., used to be a heavy drinker back in Mexico, bipolar in her emotions, needy, possessive) like all of the shit you don't want your girlfriend to be. Once I even texted him about something which was not even bad in any way, but he tells me to delete it and fake a normal conversation because she apparently goes through his phone messages all of the time (and vice-versa). 

Whenever I'm with them, I constantly notice how she is able to control him and do things for her, it's almost like she has him on a leash. The fucked up part is that because we all went to a small school, her friend group are all super close. Two of her best friends are guys, and one of them who is especially one horny mf always hugs her, touches her hair, and other cringy shit. Like they all joke around and it's just super flirty and weird, all the while my friend stands there and watches, doing nothing. 

She basically continuously has orgy hugs with her guy friends. If my friend would even hug another girl, she would probably throw a tantrum or kill him. For example, in 8th grade, my friend had kind of a thing with another girl who stayed in our school until graduation, and when she asked him on text a few months ago for advice on the university he goes to he left her on read. The thing is we always joke about his 8th grade prepubescent relationship and he always says it was a joke of a relationship, however, he still leaves her on read for a such a normal question regarding her education. While his girl is allowed to engage in constant hugging, my friend isn't even allowed to reply to texts from females.

Last night they were with their normal group and my friend told me to reach (i hadn't seen him in months due to the pandemic) When I arrived, she was drunk along with others and later asked me if she could touch my hair, while my friend is standing right next to me. I look at him for 5 seconds, as he awkwardly stands there and says nothing, so I say alright. She proceeds to touch it for a good 8 seconds and kind of moans which was weird, then turns to my friend and touches his hair and sighs (straight hair). Like it wasn't even in a jokingly way, she seemed extremely disappointed in my friend, as if he's able to control how his hair grows. The entire time she was not only getting touchy with my friend, but another guy friend of hers. It was just really uncomfortable.

Although my friend is happy, their relationship is extremely toxic and they just depend on each other emotionally all of the time (my friend gets no validation from his parents). I just feel so fucking bad for my friend because he's literally blinded by love. The last time I confronted him about his relationship, shit just got way too complicated and passive aggressive. I hoped they would break up but they are still going 'strong'. 

Side story: My friend and I are a grade above her class, and in April 2019, her class went on a graduation trip to Cuba (which included my brother). Basically at one point during the trip my brother told me she was in a room alone with her horny friend (who literally touches everybody) and they were cuddling in bed the entire time. I don't think my friend ever found out about this but the fact that she thinks its okay to do that is quite weird. The horny friend even tried to do something sexual towards my brothers girlfriend on the same class trip, which explains his true obvious intentions. The fucked up part is that even if he found out, she would brush it off as being a normal friend type thing and put the blame on him.

Sorry for making this so long but I really only touched upon the surface of this fiasco. Any type of question or comment is appreciated.",28May2020,1

55,"I have a cousin that I come into contact with often and everytime I'm around him I always feel so scared and on my toes just hoping I dont say anything or do something that will get him irate and lash out at me by hitting me or something. He's very unstable and always had been. He does drugs like meth and shit and is the most obnoxiously inappropriate person when hes drunk. He always talks about the fights he's been in and he got stabbed one time because hes always starting trouble. Hes the farthest end of the worst side of my family. I hate being in a car with him cuz he drives insane and if I were to say anything he'd probably beat my ass. You just cant say no to him. Of course, I'm always trying to be a pleaser just to stay on his good side so I never have to be on the other end of his anger. But the problem is that he thinks of me as one of his friends and always calls me to hangout. 3 days ago I said no because I was working on my art (I make music but just said art because he draws too and I thought he'd understand) but then he went off like ""maaaan foo you gonna pick that over family? I should jump you for that""  I would like to never have to see him again but right now I'm living with my grandma because I'm 21 and in a rough place financially but he however has lived off of my gma all of his life (raised by her). So he comes over all the time cause he lives down the street but he also calls and expects me to be the delivery man whenever he needs money from her or wants to borrow her car (which is why I always find myself in the car with him). Again I cant say no and if I take too long he cusses me out. My biggest problem right now is his most recent purchase. He and his brother recently bought boxing gloves and head gear and they've been having fun with it (based off the bloody noses they've been posting on the gram) and now he keeps calling me to come over and fight with them. He's always like ""we all need to start boxing eachother cause I dont want any bitches in my family."" I keep saying I have work and shit but I know it's going to come up where I'm in the same room with him and he has the gloves. I'm super anxious right now like I cant get off of my mind the scenarios of what will happen when I say ""no I dont feel like boxing right now"" (sparring is fun but i dont wanna go all out like a gang initiation). I know hes gonna take it to heart and call me a bitch and shit and may even just start throwing down on me to force me to but the gloves on and defend myself. I've been so anxious about this that I've even thought about self defense and whether or not it would be permissible to have a gun on me incase he ever goes crazy on me like he has to a few people. What should I do to make him not think I'm cool with him anymore and get invited less to hangout with him? Hes 8 years older than me and easily overpowers me so I get scared when I have to confront him. Hes so unpredictable and I just dont want to have to deal with him anymore. I cant move back in to my moms but I have no where else to go. What do I do?",28May2020,1

58,"He is a wheelchair user. He needs to move with his mom due to a recent accident. He wants to move with very few possessions. This is what he mentioned :

"" I want to find a ride with one bedroom of belongings, tv, knick nacks,tools and clothes, NO furniture. Literally a pickup truck load. I am alone most of the time and my mom's home is my only option. Problem is, I don't know anyone who could help, I can't hitchhike in a wheelchair, and it's 1600 miles ish.""

What are the options here? Preferably something on the less expensive side. I did find sites like rentatruckdriver but I do not have enough information to get a quote on their behalf and I don't want to give any hope without it being possible. So basically a man in wheelchair wants to move from Colorado to California and needs a ride. I don't have a car and I live in Seattle so I won't be able to help in any way unfortunately. I don't know anyone else here either.

Also I found them through a fundraiser so I do not think they are able to afford large expenses of moving companies. So it would be great if some less expensive options can be given to them.

If anyone has experience with any non profit org or something that helps people in such a situation, it would be great as well. He has no caretaker right no caretaker right now.",28May2020,1
59,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. He has been close with his friends for 10+ years. I’ve always gotten along with his friends and they’ve always treated me with respect. The last 6 months though I’ve noticed them being really hostile. And they’ve made me cry a few times (i am crybaby). They just make snappy snarky comments towards me. I don’t know, I feel like they don’t understand my humor. I might be too sarcastic for them. But since I’ve known them for so long, I can be my authentic sarcastic goofy self. They also like to make fun of the fact that I’m Mexican, I find it offensive. Today I sent one of them a joke via snapchat and they told me to learn how to punctuate and I was really hurt.

60,"So I’m worried about a new job I will be starting Monday. I will be a recreation aide, so not working with those tested positive in the home, but still risk of exposure. My boyfriend whom I live with is concerned because he’s also working currently and isn’t sure if he would be considered “exposed” to the virus once I start working. 

The home was assessed by the ministry of health in my country and there were no concerns regarding use of PPE, or resident care. I’ve been told to keep a change of clothes with me for when I go home, and that I’ll be wearing the full yellow cover with N95 mask and gloves, etc. They also test staff regularly. I feel like it will be safe and I’m only working one on one with those tested negative. 

I really want this to work, I need a job. I’m just hearing stories of nurses and PSWs staying in their cars or in hotels to not spread it to their loved ones and it taking a huge toll on them. The position is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time and there is so much need for it right now. 

I don’t know if I’m blowing this out of proportion or if I should be looking into another place to stay. I would of course follow the PPE guidelines and change clothes, wash my hands and shower when I get home. Would that be enough to prevent it? What do you guys think?

65,"So I have a girlfriend. And she has a best friend (F). Who also happens to be my best friend. 

We'll call my girlfriend GF and our mutual best friend Z.

So I recently made a twitter account and I followed Z. She's a nice girl. Doesn't flirt with random guys. You get the jist. But I saw she was constantly replying and flirting to this guy's tweets. Every. Single. One. And he was doing the same.

So i casually tell GF that this guy is flirting and trying to get with Z. No biggie.

Also, Z does not like herself being associated with anyone. I mean she wouldn't like hearing someone say that she was flirting with someone. And I didn't say that. I said that someone was trying to flirt with her. 2 completely different stories. 

Now I get a text randomly from Z that "" I shouldn't go around telling people that someone is trying to get with someone just because they replied to their tweets""
""Don't give derogatory remarks about me to my close friends"" 

Also, worth mentioning is that even though GF and Z are best friends, Z does not know that I'm dating GF. Or even talk to her. 

Now I asked GF if she said anything to Z and she said she didn't.

I tried asking Z but she wouldn't respond to me.

I think, GF fucked up and told Z that I was saying things about her (even though I didn't) I don't doubt GF intentionally got the wrong meaning from me but I think she told Z.

I dont know what to do. Z hates me because she thinks I'm going around talking shit about her to anyone. And GF well, she's just sad because I'm upset that Z hates me.

And I still don't know who would talk to Z about me. I suspect GF. Who else could it be?

Idk whats going on. I came her for advice because you all might see something I'm not. Feel free to ask anything, I'll happily reply.",28May2020,1

I'm an engineer, I work from home so once a day I try to workout in my room. My neighbor living downstairs has walked up to my apartment (a couple of times) to complaint about us making 'jumping' noises. She even emailed the landlord about us.

I am suffering from PTSD as well, but I do not wish to delve into that here. 

Ok so onto my actual issue, some friends of mine decided to go out on a drive because of all of the quarantine issues and that. When they asked me to go with them, I happily accepted the offer and went along. In the process I got to hang out with an old accomplice, which just happens to be the girl. We started to hang out more and more and I saw a steady trend of her liking me as well.  We started to talk on FaceTime throughout the day more and ended up with a call that lasted around 12 hours in total. She semi-opened up about some attachment issues and the such, but at the time I didn't really read into that too much. Fast forward to last night and she basically called me out on liking her, to which I confirmed. It was all good at that point, but 15 minutes later she starts breaking down and saying that she does not know what she wants and does not want to hurt or lose me in the end. She told me then that she liked me too, today has been a depressing day for both of us. Fortunately, she has her friends to ask advice from and I have the wonderful people of Reddit. I do not know how to talk to her, and how to relieve the awkwardness of this situation.

A perfect example of what I'm asking about is just tonight, actually. My little brother and sister both got out of bed to go to my dad about something so that can stay up. Now tonight was a bit different because my brother revealed that he was having trouble sleeping. This made me feel terrible for getting mad, but I digress. I got infuriated when my little brother got out of his bed (Yes, we sleep in the same room, which sucks exponentially for me because I'm a 14 year old boy) and rage shot through me like gunfire.

79,"My boyfriend and I aren't sure what to do about an upcoming gathering. BF sold his cousin his almost-new indoor plant setup worth about $800 new, for $400. His cousin still owes him the full $400. This sale was from early February before the pandemic took flight, and there have been no attempts to communicate when the money will be paid. We all got laid off, then subsequently rehired. We're all hurting for money to the same degree.


My boyfriend refuses to hound his cousin for money, or even ask, so prompting cousin is out of the question (believe me, I tried asking him to just ask). The way he sees it, if cousin never pays him back, BF will cut his losses. He still feels as though he'slost more than the $400. First of all, he's done this cousin many unpaid favors. Also with the quality of the setup, we could have sold it for at least $600.


Yes it is technically my bfs setup, but we share our resources in almost every way, and he appreciates my input anyway. Personally I think the situation kind of irks me because I'm not used to the whole ""family can borrow money and expect favors (in the form of hard labour) whenever they want"" mentality. Also, I really wanted us to get a dishwasher with the money we would have made from the sale, and BF agreed that's where it would go to. I work and go to school full time so I'd really appreciate the dishwasher. 


A couple months later cousin's dad passed away. Cousin made an announcement that he'd like the family to do a potluck and contribute to fireworks. Cousin says he'll put $1000 down and everyone can pitch in for more fireworks and extras. 


So now we're not sure if, or how much we should contribute to the fireworks party. Personally I feel like I am obliged to, but I think it's lame that Cousin just never stepped up to pay my BF back. Not even offering a payment plan. Not to mention, we know Cousin is a partier. Likes to go out and treat himself. Sorry, but his lifestyle is something I've taken into account. 


I'm grappling over contributing a small dollar amount, or just making my famous dips like I always do. But maybe I should put feelings aside and do both? After all, I understand not everyone is lucky to have a life insurance policy so aren't guaranteed a nice memorial service. And I understand that the sale and the memorial service are two separate issues.


As a side note, not sure if it's relevant, but according to my BF, his now-deceased uncle was a bit of a dud of a father, and his cousin often had to come to his house to escape abuse and get fed. Cousin and BF are very close because Cousin spent so much time growing up around him. Now understandably, my BF and his father (the patriarch of the family) have a type of reserved feelings for the deceased uncle. The uncle got ill later in his life and made amends with most of the family, but the feelings run pretty deep for my BF. 


SO HERE WE ARE, my boyfriend doesn't know what to do, and I've come to you all  for a moral compass (not my family yet haha) Should we pay the money forward? Make dips and forget about contributing? What do you think?",28May2020,1

81,"Hi people of Reddit. I rarely post anything on here, but I'll get straight to the point. I'm (25M), bachelor degree in kinesiology, no student loans, no car loans, no consumer debt. I've been spending my early 20s and now trying to get into a PA (Physician Assistant) program around the country. I am currently in the process of it. As of right now, I work in a hospital in the ER, and I'm starting to have doubts if I still wanna purse a career in healthcare/medicine. 

I feel as if I am slaving my life away because I'm constantly working and putting off other aspects of life off (owning a home, having a family, etc). I'm at the point where I feel as if I should just ditch a PA career, throw away all of the hard work I had spent years to get to where I am at, to just focus on achieving financial freedom.

82,"I've (25f) been with my partner (27m) for 7 years now. We've had a lot of ups and downs and both deal with our fair share of pasr trauma and mental illness, but we love each other and support each other. 

I've always been bad with my depression.  I'm pretty high functioning and I work a lot, go to school,  handle all the finances,  etc. But I'm never content. I'll have good days,  sometimes weeks, but I have a lot of bad days. I tend to find the current most pressing stresser and I fixate on it and beat myself up until its fixed and in the meantime if it's not something quickly solved I cry and sit in bed for days and I'm just a miserable person.  

Quarantine has been really bad for this.  (I'm not against quarantine measures by anymeans) but not being able to work or go to school has taken a lot of my usefulness from me and made it so hard for me to have the good days. I take so much to heart,  so I've been really torn apart by world events and not being able to do a thing about any of it is killing me. 

Instead of focusing on one bad thing lately, its just been a constant cycle. My partner is trying to be supportive but I've literally been inconsolable for months. Its always something, either fighting with a friend,  losing a family member,  money stress,  landlord scuffs, body image,  you name it.  I always have a reason to obsess over something that's bothering me and be miserable. And I'm so ashamed.  

I feel like such a burden to my partner. It must be so hard to be happy when you're constantly next to someone who just can't be pleased. 

He assures me I'm not a burden, that I've helped him through tough times too, that these past few months are hitting me hard but I'll recover, etc. But i can't help but feel like I'm ruining his life.

How do I feel like less of a burden to him? I'm trying to contact a therapist to work on the route of the problem.. but how do I face him in the meantime? What if I never get better,  and he has to decide between watching me destroy myself and his life or leaving me? 

How do you put these what ifs, this kind of guilt away?",28May2020,1
83,"TL:DR I think it's time to quit my job, I have the resignation e-mail written, but I'm hesitant to send it.  


Long story, Since at least 2016 I've been teaching at the same dance studio, Over that time, nothings really changed for me, I've always been stuck teaching the kids classes, and although its fun, I feel like the just keep me there because they don't believe in me, although I have personally bested or matched every other teacher in competition or knowledge of our styles and culture. I'm capable of teaching all ages and advanced skills but they still just have me teaching kids even when I've mentioned repeatedly wanting to teach more advanced classes. On top of it I don't think they value me as a person or at most as more than an acquaintance/ distant friend. When it comes to competitions everyone else teams up and battles, performs, or travels together, but in the time I've been there, they have never once asked to work with me, not even inviting me to help with the curriculum I teach. I don't know why I'm actually scared to press send on the e-mail I have written out other than the fact I don't know what kind of change this will bring in my life, but as much as I love dance, and teaching as a whole, I feel uninspired as well as disregarded as a person while I work there and I feel like it's made me avoid dance as a whole. I mean, if no one wants to actually work with let alone be around me, and this is my closest group of peers in the dance community, why even be a part of it.  


Maybe I just want someone to acknowledge me before I send it just so I don't feel so alone making this choice, but I do think it's the right one, my mind feels cloudy as a whole, but I think this could at least relieve some stress.   


A sincere Thank You to anyone who actually read this mess of thoughts.",28May2020,1

I'm much older (over legal age in the U.S.) than my other sibling and have taken care of them for as long as I can remember. In the last 4 years it has escelated with her going out and staying nights at her boyfriends place, and expecting me to stay at the house with my sibling. My nana is there to watch him, and I'm made to feel bad if I want to go out the same night she does. She guilt trips me into giving her most of all my money, and when I first opened my bank account she was on it. She took 200 dollars (all I had) out of my savings account and took my bank card and never told me. This happened and months went by and she didnt tell me until I insisted on having my card back. Then she acted as if I was wrong for being hurt. She insists I give her money when I have it, and seems to be forcing me into going to college when I dont have money to pay for it or any scholarships to cover it. She makes me feel bad whenever I buy something for myself that I don't necessarily need, but she will go and by 4 bathing suits for herself to go to the beach. She makes me feel like a terrible person when I talk about moving out, and says I'll never make it and I'm not responsible enough. She tells me I'm not a real adult, and I never will be until I'm responsible enough to own a house. However, she insists that I will live with her forever and if I ever mention leaving she begins to cry and make me feel guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

The work can get pretty intensive up there with carrying bags upwards of 100 lbs. and having the warehouse reach temperatures of 105-110 degrees. I normally work 24-32 hours per week during summer, and 20 hours during school. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you may be thinking, this is not the best job for a teenager to have, but my family hasn't let me quit. I tried multiple times, and each time I've gotten grounded or punished in some manner. This time though, they don't have any leverage over me. All of my items are paid for myself, and I am reaching the age where I should be able to find a different job on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this past year, I've been passionate about more things. I've been studying philosophy, writing, exercising, taking hikes in nature, etc. This can be very time-consuming, and my current hours doesn't enable me to engage in these things as much as I want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking for any advice that you guys can give me regarding to how to go about quitting my job/reducing my hours without burning any bridges with my family, considering I have three more years living with them. I've tried to reduce my hours in the past, but I have been unsuccessful. At this point, I just want to quit my job and further work on myself, my passions, and my relationships.",28May2020,1

93,"Hey all.  

I’m a male 27 year old medical student that just doesn’t have the energy to care about anything anymore.  I had been feeling burnt out from school and looking for an escape for some time.  I started letting my grades slip because I didn’t want to bother to put in the effort I had for so long.

Then my relationship fell apart and I went into a dark place for a couple of months.  Now I’m back past the self-loathing/harm side of it but I still can’t bring myself to care about anything.

I know I need therapy.  Please don’t use that as advice, I am going to seek it out.

As far as ways to cope I’ve tried exercising regularly (arguably too much at this point).  I’ve tried diving into my studies.  I’ve tried recouping with binging shows.  I’ve tried learning new things not related to medicine.

I do it because I hate feeling like none of it matters, but truly nothing shakes the feeling.  I don’t smile like I used to, nor do I find much humor or joy in things.

I should mention this isn’t related to COVID as far as I know because I felt this way before, though I imagine COVID hasn’t helped.

95,So I'm a guy and my bestfriend is a girl. We're both freshman in highschool and recently she told me she sends nudes to people. This wouldn't be a problem normally but I'm especially protective over her and she has never seemed like someone to do that (she literally almost threw up because she heard people talking about sex) I've been friends with her for 4 years and I just don't want her getting hurt or used at all. I tried bringing this up to her and she said it made her really uncomfortable (which I understand completely) but i just feel like she doesn't trust me anymore. She's shared far worse with me and...I don't know honestly.....things are really awkward between us now and I just want her to be safe....any advice at all?,28May2020,1
96,"Apologies in advanced for any poor grammar its late at night and Im tired but cannot sleep.

So in December 2018 I met a girl (18) and was with her till December 2019 (Im 20M). She broke my heart. We lived far apart so every weekend I would do a round trip of 200 miles to see her, and even when i got there i would drive her where every she wanted and I fell head heels for her. First love I was actually 19 when i met her. But in December 2019, she told my closest family member to me (my grandmother) that “I really hope he is the one, he’s the light of my life. I could never love someone the same”.

This obviously made me very happy when i found out the day after, however, a week later she left me...

I was in bits because the whole reason she left me was because of another guy that she was “just friends” with. Unfortunately for her karma kicked her in the dick really quickly and she got herpes. But, that..that never gave me any satisfaction because i still felt as if she was mine. On top if this, she was friends with my best friend at the time Greig (not his real name obviously). Grieg and I got in great, we would party together and play video games together and have a great laugh. So through our friendship I was happy he was friends with my gf, it was great knowing they got along. However, my naivety got the better of me :( 4 days after we broke up, she had slept with her friend and then swapped nudes with my best friend and they arranged to meet to have sex. And basically she done the same thing with my other friend John. So After I knew all this I asked her “why?”. Her simple response was “because greig has a big fucking dick”. And that shattered me, the first girl I’ve ever fallen in love with has left me for a bigger dick. 

So for months (December 2019 - April 2020) I was question myself, broken hearted and distraught. Thinking that Id done something wrong, was it my fault? Could I have been better in bed? But she never complained when we would do it, because she would never shut up about how good it was and would want to do it all the time and every-time I complied, we had a very happy and healthy sex life. So i was so confused, I didn’t know why she didn’t love me anymore and I wanted to know why she done what she done.

Then came the 13th of May. She unblocked me on everything, which i noticed by the fact when i typed her name in a social media search bar it would come up with her username in the suggestions. So I saw that and thought “fuck it, Ill see what she wants” 

So I messaged her and we talked a few things out and I got some closure. However, I still felt she was mine. That same click was still there, and for all that I should hate her because she broke my heart in two. I cant, nothing inside me cant, I would never take her back but I still have love her and I dont want to :( 

Because it got harder from that conversation onwards.  

We agreed to be friends and if either of us found someone new we would remove each other out of respect for said new partner. She also told me that i never did anything wrong, I was the best thing that happened to her and that she instantly regretted what she did when she came to terms with it after her “self-destruction period” she claims she will never ever forgive herself for it. And that she misses me deeply. 

Which kinda broke my heart even more to be honest :/.

But moving on. Being a sad lonely boi, I gave in to nsfwtwitter, and what do I stumble across? My ex gf that Im still not over. Shes posting nudes on twitter and pornhub. 

I am not judging sex workers, or people that make a living this way. 

Whats hard about it, is that looking and seeing those videos and photos shes posted of herself. Was once all mine. And was committed to just me, we had a relationship so close and so focused on each other, we were both loyal through thick and thin. Its hard to see what was once my precious world, is now just going to be torn apart by thousands of men seeing it all. God forbid the day she makes a porn video, I will be in bits if i ever find out about it. 

And now I just feel like I am drowning in sorrow, I can sleep for hours and hours but I am still exhausted through the day even if I’ve done nothing, I’ve given up on my fitness routine. I am 6ft 5, 200lbs with 10% body fat, but since all this I am probably much heavier and double my body fat. 

I guess I just want advice on how to pick myself, because I dont know how and I am scared for it to get worse :( 

I wanna be happy, and love someone new. Because at the end if the day I deserve it, I give the one I am with my everything when I am with them, 110% all the time nothing less and everything more. But I cant feel anything, a part of me wants to go into “self-destruct mode” and the other part just tells me to give up and sob about the place. Im just so lost and hurt and want some advice, even if it s a small phrase anything, please. I have no one irl i can turn to :( 

Sorry for the sad post and if someone does happen to read it all and give me some advice I thank you so much for your time, it means a lot :) 

I hope everyone is staying safe in these tough times.",28May2020,1

I’ve gone to catholic schools my whole life and there’s this great high school that my current school is a filter to and I’m almost guaranteed to get into it based off of my academic career. The added bonus is that a majority of my friends and people that I know are going to/already going there. But I’m tired of religion I just don’t click with it and because I don’t want to get confirmed (a major step in catholic faith) it will make the tuition more expensive because I’m not catholic. It’s also far from my house just like my current school. Which means I don’t have a social life outside of school and I don’t want that again. Now, School Y is a public school which is almost as good as School X. But because of how large it is there’s gonna be a lot of people which means a lot of diversity which I’m not really used to because well you know private catholic schools don’t tend to be too diverse. I also won’t know anyone there I’ll have no friend groups to fall back on. I do have a twin but I don’t even know if we’re gonna go to the same school. Which might be bad cause we’re inseparable.

107,"\-I tried to keep this as short as possible with all deltails-

So there is a girl that I met in my college class and I felt like I'd catch her looking at me a lot during class, I was pretty sure she was interested in me. After class was cancelled (due to COVID), she added me on Facebook. I messaged her a couple of days after she added me and since then we've basically been messaging back and forth constantly.

It's been a couple of months now of messaging basically all day every day. Lately, it seems like her messages are less and less frequent and she doesn't have much to say in them. There are times when I try to be a bit distant in case she's getting annoyed by too much messaging, there are other times when I try to ask her various questions about things that are going on in her life. Either way it seems like she's responding with minimal effort and there is now a couple of hours between each message (that was never the case before). 

Also I asked her a couple of times when we first started talking if she'd like to do something together once things started to open back up (we live about 2 hours away from each other but go to the same college). She always seemed interested in doing something in person together. I asked her the other day, since things are opening back up, if she'd like to go out together for lunch. She didn't respond back for about 12 hours and when she did she said ""sure"". She's always tried to show a lot more emotion through her messages and does a good job. She's working on her second English degree so I feel like if she's cutting her messages short then she's doing it intentionally. 

Lastly, I'd be fine with even being friends with her. We have a lot in common and both have similar personality types. I just feel like she's giving me mixed signals or sometimes no signal at all. At this point I'm debating between 1. continuing as I have been with no expectations 2. pulling away and letting her have her space 3 trying to escalate the situation somehow.

Thanks for reading through this and any advice is greatly appreciated!",28May2020,1
108,"My family is all sorts of messed up and my mother in particular is a special kind of crazy.

In January, I found an apartment in the town I went to high school in and decided to apply for it because I have roots in the community. Of course, my boyfriend moved in with me, too! It’s a spacious, 3-bedroom apartment and I am very proud of it and myself because even normal successes are unheard of within my family.

On February 16th, my brother, who also lives in this town with my mother and little sister, texted me at 12:00 AM to tell me that my mother purposefully  locked him out. Of course, I picked him up and told him he could stay over... and after a few days of my mother not budging, I told my brother on February 21st—his birthday—that he could live with me and occupy one of the spare bedrooms as long as he pitched in and abided by my simple requests. My boyfriend was fine with it and I was happy that he wouldn’t be homeless. It was messy to the extent of needing a police detail to accompany him while he took his stuff from our mother’s house. We dealt with it and he’s currently settled it.

No one in my family seems to have senses of decency, cleanliness, fairness, hard-work—nothing. No one really takes care of anything and no one really works! My mother has been influencing my brother for years now and he behaves a lot like her and I am unsure of how to inspire him to do better!

Since moving in months ago, he has only cleaned dishes maybe... 5 times? He doesn’t really pick up after himself and he is VERY careless, like my mother. I will cook dinner and when he’s home late, he’ll heat it up in the oven, remove it, put it on a plate, pour a glass of juice... and when he’s done eating he’ll leave the plate on the table with the silverware and glass... he’ll even leave the glass pan on the stove to get crusty... and he will not finish the tasks of putting the dishes in the sink and cleaning them. He also leaves his dirty napkins around after eating quite often. Another thing that he does that I really dislike is leave the toilet seat up with urine on the rim. My boyfriend is extraordinarily clean and a germaphobe! My boyfriend is cleaner than me but I am also a pretty clean person... leaving the toilet seat up bothers me but it isn’t the end of the world... the pee is what really bothers me. He won’t clean it. My boyfriend has never left the toilet seat up... not even when we were living with his mother! And he definitely doesn’t urinate on the seat. My brother has also left feces and skid marks on the toilet seat and I am unsure how that even happens... :0 Also, because of this, I feel like my brother is just generally unclean and my boyfriend doesn’t use the hand towel by the sink in the bathroom because he thinks my brother uses is without really washing his hands. LOL. My brother also doesn’t like being confronted even if it is in the nicest possible way. He is very much like our mother—he becomes very verbally aggressive and pushy when anyone tells him to do better—and it’s a lot to deal with. My brother also never helps with general chores. My boyfriend and I do a big cleaning of the house every couple of weeks. For example... we clean as we go... we wipe down the toilet, granite and sink with sanitary wipes and stuff regularly but do a deep clean every other weekend with bleach and tile cleaner. My brother NEVER offers to help and he never does it of his own accord. My brother also refuses to take out the trash... My boyfriend and I both take out the trash whenever we see it full. It is neither of our specific chore... as nothing else is besides cooking (I solely cook, I cook the best, LOL) and my brother just doesn’t do it. My brother also leaves trash in different rooms. He will leave dirty dishes in the kitchen... drinks in the dining room... take-out containers in the living room... he doesn’t seem to care about anything. It’s like he has no pride in the home. He also gets water all over the floor sometimes when he showers. It isn’t all the time but it’s a couple times each week... it’s like he doesn’t begin to dry off in the shower. It seems like he steps out without a towel and goes wild... because when he showers he will get water everywhere but he will also somehow soak the toilet paper and the rack by the toilet. It’s very weird... we have a bath mat and proper curtains. It never happens when my boyfriend or I showed... it is quite perplexing. My brother also likes having a guest over once in a while which is totally fine. But basically, I’ll come home from work and he’ll have been home all day and the apartment will be messy... dishes won’t be done... the pans he had just used will be sitting on the oven... a dish will be on the table, the trash will be full... he’ll be playing video games... and then he’ll ask me, “can my friend come over?” I appreciate him asking but I also told him that if the place was clean, he wouldn’t need to ask! I just don’t want people over when it’s messy which is reasonable, I think.

My brother also leaves my Venmo requests unfulfilled. We use Venmo to exchange bill money. He pays the bills on time, always. He pays less than 1/3 of the rent because it’s my place... you know? He does however pay 1/3 of the electricity and heat! And it’s always on time. However, I buy groceries for the house and I cook and he is supposed to pay 1/3 of the grocery and toiletry bills (outside of stuff I buy for myself like tampons, LOL) and whenever u send him a Venmo request for groceries he doesn’t pay it until weeks later or so... and it’s weird because... that’s not what we agreed to.

My boyfriend and I have talks with him quite a bit... more so just my boyfriend... and he acts like he finally gets what we’re talking about and says he’ll help and pay the requests on time... but he never actually does the right thing.

I know he may need therapy due to our childhood and his experiences... but I feel like responsibility can’t simply be dumped the way he dumps it. It’s very hard and stressful to clean up after my OLDER BROTHER. I’m 22. He’s 24.

How can I inspire him? What are some creative ways to get him to work? I almost feel like I need to charge extra money because my time is valuable and I use a lot of it to clean up after him. Haha... I go to class, hold a job, run a business and homeschool my friend’s children 3 days each week because of Coronavirus.

109,"23M These past few years have been nothing but hell to me, some back story on my life, I went to college dropped out 3rd year in to pursue a career of ""Trading stocks"" any whatever else is trade-able, had a rough start, lost 80-90% of my capital 2 times and during these past 2 years I thought of the brilliant idea to help my family with their funds, so I took on the absurd responsibility at the age of 20 to manage my families money, and I do not mean my family as a collective whole, but each individual account from each family member, a brother, a sister, a dad, (my mom and dad share accounts and funds) 

I went through painstaking endeavors such as generating enough capital to retire two years after I started, to losing 80-90% of the capital I had, this was not the first nor second time but the 3rd time, and this time it really stung because I burned the capital due to a psychological issues I was having at the time that were unrelated to me not seeing what was going to happen to the market, I self destructed and screwed my self hardcore. Not only my own account but every SINGLE account I managed, I was stupid and bought a really nice car that I was making payments to and at some point I was in debt over $100,000 from having enough to retire, not only to a car company but to my family. Besides this point, during all of this my dad is diagnosed with cancer and my mother health is falling ill due to bone loss (osteoporosis), I am heavily addicted to caffeine just to function and I don't think anyone knows what anxiety is like I do, I take pain pills as well every day just to cope with my anxiety and have for months now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly believed my family only gave a shit about me because I made them money if you want to know the back story as to why I became self destructive, (the sad reality is that the situations that allowed me to make that capital will not come back for years if not decades) and I have busted my ass 12-14 hour work days around the clock for months almost 2 years after I lost just about everything to get back to where I am now..

&amp;#x200B;

And where I am at now, is that I recovered all of the losses with my family and now I am also in stable condition financially, but not near to what I use to be at which is besides the point. I can handle that mentally.

My issue is how do I change my perception? Why do I feel so miserable, nothing makes me happy, I get on Reddit I am salty, I turn on the news, Corona Virus deaths and police brutality, I put my head on the pillow and find my self scrolling through some mindless non sense which is just subconsciously putting more negativity in my head.

Every day I wake up and I feel miserable, feel like I am under unbelievable amounts of stress and nothing and I mean nothing in the world makes me happy, I can't remember the last time I was happy,

I've lost my ability to feel other than to cry at times and I cry alone

I can't cope with reality without taking pain killers or more caffeine (which for sure increases my anxiety) but part of my profession involves trading a 24/7 market, so you already know.

I don't want to give up my career, I am more ambitious than all my peers, but at times I can't fathom how this is a life anyone wants to live no matter what the reward is.

My girlfriend wants to start a family and I can't even hold my actual family together as their is arguments and fights often, and they have habits that I have tried to change to help them but to no avail.

All this illness to top it off along with global tensions seems to be ripping a hole in the psyche of every person dropping their aura down 20-30%.

How can I be happy again?

How can I cope with reality and my families health issues?

How can I continue my profession while having good stress management?

How do I start a family when I can't even fathom adding another responsibility and having a child now with another financial strain? I genuinely feel like some days I am going to have a heart attack.

My life is monotonous routine of small dopamine bursts from the food and drugs I take along with deep pits of sorrow that I experience every day feeling like I am crippling under the stress of immense responsibilities. 

TLDR

I have had unspeakable amounts of stress for years

Nothing makes me happy or joyful and think I am borderline depressed if not depressed (along with my addictions)

I cant figure out how to continue through life throwing even more carnage at me in different ways

Although unemployed, my mom was really dependent on him for a lot of things. My dad had paid for the bills and managed our rental property in a different state for my whole life. He also drove my mom to work everyday since my mom is afraid to drive after a small car accident (she has her license). He took care of my little brother and got him to school and his extracurriculars. 

Now that he’s gone, I have to figure out what bills to pay and how to pay them. I have to manage our finances and our rental property. I also have to figure out how my mom is going to get to work everyday and find childcare services for my brother. I have no idea to start. I would pass these duties on to my mom, but she is even less knowledgeable on these things than I am. She is also going through a lot being a healthcare worker during these times. As an 18 year old, I have learned nothing about finances in school. I also don’t have a clue as to how I am going to manage all of this when I am away at college (hopefully) in the fall.

I realized that I felt like my best friend was more of a sister than a gf and that I liked my current gf more. I went it about the hard way and had to tell my best friend that. So now her parents hate my gf. My best friend loves her and adores her, but her parents do not. My gf hasn't done anything but good to both me and my friend. It sucks because I can't go to my friends parties (my gf allows me, i just don't because it makes me uncomfortable to be in a house full of ppl that don't like her for no reason). We're all allowed to hangout and what not and the last party my friend had, her parents allowed my gf over but she decided not to go because of anxiety and awkwardness which is understandable. Ive talked to my friend about it and she's tried talking to her parents about it but they won't open their minds to actually talking to my gf. I just sent my friend a long message about how if this isn't resolved then we probably will not be as close because her family is causing me to be pushed away from all of them. I dont know what to do at this point. My gf is willing to take us all out to eat and to talk about it, but im not even sure if any of that will help. What should I do??

Now, I’m back to binge drinking beer. I’m sitting in my room with at least 40 beer cans that have been collecting since Saturday. I mix the beer with the weed and eventually pass out. That’s been my life for a couple weeks now. 

I get really upset and go all out. My goal is to feel nothing and pass out. Most days that’s my goal. I usually freak out if I can’t get high or drunk because being sober is terrifying to me.

Okay I know this seems black and white but please hear me out. 

This girl, I’ll call her A, has been one of my best friends for almost a decade. Our freshman year of high school, she was dating a boy, B, a year or two older than us. They ended up going to a birthday party together. Now A told me, and has been open about it and talked about it frequently since then, that he assaulted her in his car. She stayed with him after that and they ended up dating for a couple years (I don’t remember at what point in their relationship this happened). It took her at least some months to tell me about it.  

I want to be very clear: I have never questioned, or felt the need to question her story. 

However, some time ago we were talking about the first guy we’d slept with. I knew that B was her first and she never shied away from talking about him. What she did say caught me completely off guard: “I wanted to be the one to take B’s virginity. I wanted to be able to tell people ‘yeah, I took it.’” I didn’t respond, and didn’t really know how, so I played it off and changed the subject. We haven’t talked about B since then but I have heard her talking about him to other people.

122,"Hello, so I will introduce my topic by telling how my father has stopped working lately and thus have been living at home with my mother and I, (my mother had stopped working a few years ago and is also always at home so they're usually together). As for me, not during quarantine though, I'm usually at school so they're together at home all day long.
The thing is that my dad is quite introverted, he has trouble in social situations and often feels left out in discussions, even though that, him not seeing anyone since he stopped working has made him a little sad. He told us how he would like to meet new people. My parents don't really have friends like, at all outside of family so I thought it wasn't a problem since they always were like that.
And also my father didn't especially love his coworkers but performing social interactions every day even without appreciating them 100% of the time filled his social needs.
But yeah my dad is feeling bummed out and he thinks meeting new people, making new friends would be great for him but I dont know how, he his paraplegic in a wheelchair so sport is not even considerable, he gets drunk after half a beer so hanging out at the bar isn't really either (and I wouldn't especially like my father which is not in the middle of his youth to start drinking frequently). I would like to find a solution for him but I don't see any, it seems quite complicated to me for a 60 year old adult to create new social links with people around his age.

126,"I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I mean, I just feel more comfortable talking about it here.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 years old still living at my mom's house. I pay rent and my bills, yet my sister makes comments that I still live at home.  I recall saying I hope I'm not 25 and still living at home, so I don't blame her. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Recently I've been dreading going to work. I currently work at Walmart. I actually returned this year but did 2 years from 2016 - 2018.  At one point, I worked 6 months overnights doing 12-hour shifts 70% of the time,  due to the co-manager's request (I was working days, but he set up a team of 5, to help out the overnight crew). Even though managers like how I work and I get pride from that, I just hope I can find a job that I don't dread going to. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I quit in 2018, I transferred to construction and went to school at night for IT and general ed classes ( I eventually stopped taking classes). My friend got me in but it wasn't a good fit for me after all, but it was a good experience. The only reason, I returned to Walmart is because it feels like it's the only thing I'm capable of. I'm not sure where else to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, every single day I think about joining the Air Force as I feel like it'll help me became a better version of myself. The sad thing is I was almost in. 7 months ago, I took the ASVAB, scored a 92 AFQT and after a few months my recruiter called me up saying I got a job I picked. I had to be at the hotel that night since it was a last minute job, to ship out the following morning. I recall packing and setting up auto payments, but an hour before I had to arrive, I panicked.  I wasn't sure if it was a sign or just my nerves. I  told my recruiter, I didn't think I could make it. 

2 weeks later, he checked up, asking if I was okay and if I wanted to try again.  I didn't expect that because I'm pretty sure I got him in trouble and thought he wouldn't want to ever work with me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me feels like quitting Walmart and hope an Air Force recruiter will work with me. I mean I thought about joining the military since I was a kid. And it's always in the back of my mind. I just have this resistance for some reason and I'm not sure why.  

I am a homebody, shy, reserved person so maybe I'm simply comfortable staying at home. My father wasn't ever really in my life  so maybe not having a role model or brothers was a part of it. A big part was me being addicted to video games and not taking school seriously. I'm not addicted anymore but I do take full responsibility for where I'm at, at this point of my life.  I also, feel like I lack confidence and I'm not good enough.

 Maybe I just need to take a leap of faith so I don't let it stop me from achieving great things. It could be a good choice to join, as it'll change the trajectory of my life. I might just be overthinking it and letting the nerves get to me. 

In my free time, I help people with their math so they can pass the ASVAB. Being a motivator and supporter makes me feel glad.  It feels good seeing people enlist with their branch of choice. I hope I can too, someday. 

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",28May2020,1

I run a popular fan page on instagram for this famous singer and my friend and I also have an Etsy page where I create things to sell to other fans. We linked it to our Instagram fan page. There is this one account in particular who has ordered from me in the past, I’ve never talked or interacted with her, but she paid and I sent her the items she ordered and that was that. 

I was made aware by several other fan accounts that She is posting on her story about how I sent her a free custom made hat (I stopped making and selling those in January) with her last order. She posted a picture of all the things she bought from me including this hat. The hat was not included in the order at all. She bought that from somebody else. We do not sell those hats anymore, period. Nor would we ever give them away for free. She never tagged my account. She’s never tagged or thanked my account period for any of her orders, actually. Which is quite rude. People are wondering why they’ve never been sent any free items, etc and are saying we favor her, which is not true at all. We have never spoke with her. 

Now she’s also going around saying she’s messaged us asking about a particular item for the last two weeks and all we do is leave her on read and never respond. We have not received any DM from her on instagram or any message on Etsy. She is trying to ruin our business for whatever reason. My friend actually regrets sending her anything at all. We should’ve just cancelled the orders.

129,"So, I (21F) was just terminated from my Amazon job due to Job Abandonment, which I am appealing because I have never done consecutive No Call No Shows ever. So, before this anyway I had unemployment on my mind and I’ve seen many, especially Amazon workers, claim to have gotten approved for unemployment due to COVID-19 (my warehouse has at least 10 cases so far). So here’s where I’m baffled... my mom was a social worker for 20+ years so she knows her shit when it comes to filling out government assistance type forms BUT she’s been retired for 3 years + has not looked into how things are right now since the corona so she’s not exactly sure what is what during this pandemic. But as I mentioned earlier, I’ve heard of many success stories in being approved. So anyway, I just got off the phone with her and she can come off/be intimidating &amp; a tad bit controlling when it comes to dealing with situations. So I had it in my mind already that I’d apply for the unemployment and hope for the best. This was pre- her being in my business/knowing what I have going on. So now she’s sort of trying to take matter into her own hands in trying to get me food stamps and medi-cal and just whatever she can that will be able to support me but the thing is, like I’m sure any other supporting parent would, now that she knows my situation she wants to handle it all for me in helping me fill out all these different assistance applications and at the same time saying I have a habit of quitting a job when I don’t have a back up plan while at the same time acknowledging, for my age group, it’s common. (I’m confused on if she’s attacking my character or just tough-love) anyways... basically without just saying too much: I had my vision/plan on how I was going to make my next moves and she has her way and I feel if I do the unemployment on my own, once she finds out, I’m assuming she may feel disrespected that I went behind her back on something she’s handled or helped other people with various times. But my reasoning is, with this pandemic, things are different right now + I’ve been researching the requirements and I’m sure she hasn’t. So how I plan to fill it out, I’m sure she’d do it differently. Also, she was getting on me on how we need to sit down and figure out what I’m going to do with myself and etc. but what’s really bothering me is, I was just over her house yesterday and was describing my 6 month journey: how I started it yesterday (05/26) and how I’ve put goals and daily reminders in my calendar on the different career &amp; hobby interests I’ll start researching and finally DOING and getting myself out there (my interests are: acting, comedy, poetry, screenwriting / college plan: either accounting or communications) and it’s like for it be only 24 hours later and she’s telling me how we need to figure out what I’m going to do, it’s seriously irritating me more &amp; more now that I’m thinking about it. (This isn’t the first time I’ve had this sort of conflict with her, our relationship isn’t the best. She believes I’m secretive and I believe she’s not that accepting nor a great listener and that’s one of my biggest trust issues: wasting my time/not being listened to). Anyways.. like the title said, I’m an over-thinker, I don’t have many people to talk to but even those that I do, my trust issues block me from opening up. What should I do? A) Do my best to just get my Amazon job back B) Follow my mom’s lead C) Do my own paperwork and figure out my nexts steps whether the unemployment comes through or not?",28May2020,1

My brother suffers from severe anxiety/depression. He's one year removed from college and I just finished my freshman year. Due to covid, we've both been living at my parents house. He is in an extremely dark place, and tends to take it out on me/my mother. 

I'm aware that the reason he does this is because he's at an incredibly low point in his life. I as well as my parents often worry about him. He's been going to therapy for forever now and he's on meds, but it seems to be of little avail. 

The result is an incredibly toxic person. He is constantly attacking my parents for letting me have anything nice (for example, my parents are okay with me drinking at this age. He however, will scream that I shouldn't be allowed to etc.). I don't want to get into all the details, but ultimately I have had a really hard time dealing with him over the past few months. He's constantly dragging me down in every way possible, yet I know his mental illness is the reason and that being mean back or reciprocating won't help.

How do I deal with this? I have a really hard time with it because he actively tries to make my life worse every single day. I don't know what to do because he really is horrible to me often times but at the same time I worry about him at some point committing suicide.

I'm a 15 years old male and everytime my emotions are overflowing my lower body and sometimes whole body feels so weak and delicate.

Example: I was so happy and excited when I conversed with my old friend then suddenly my lower body got so shaky and felt like my bpdy was heavy.

Seconsly, I got angry at a person and tried my best to control my emotions and trying to do so, I just cried to prevent a bigger problem. later on while crying my whole body suddenly felt shaky like what happened to the first scenario.

I just needed to ask if there are any advices I can get to prevent this or how I can try to control my emotions or something like that.

I distanced myself and only saw him once a year or so at group gatherings, as he's part of a mutual friend group. Which is the reason I didn't just cut contact completely. 

He's getting married in a few weeks and I think k it's a terrible idea with everything going on. Most of my friends don't seem to feel the same, except one who is going anyways out of peer pressure.

153,"Some background: My brother has been learning French for the past 4 years (in a school setting) and was never really interested in learning it outside of school. When I was also forced to learn French at his age (we're 5 years apart) I would always say how much I hated it since I was also forced to learn it. 

Fast forward to now, for a little bit over a month I've been passing the time by learning French because, why not? And me and him aren't exactly the closest but we don't hate each other either. He is also getting scared about high school and how much harder the work will be. 

 I want to say hey I know French lets make a bigger bond and get you confident in at least one area of highschool and whatnot. But at the same time, I don't want him to keep bringing up the fact how I hated French, and with us being stuck in the same house because of COVID I don't want to hear any other creative backtalk if he hates me that day.

I want to hang out with my friends but because they haven’t really been distancing/following the rules I want to maintain the social distancing when we do see each other, but I’m scared they will judge me or think I’m crazy for suggesting that. 

I also can’t stop thinking about the social life aspect of college like parties, events, bars/clubs. I think once I’m away from my parents I wouldn’t mind small gatherings or seeing close friends at college but large parties or going to crowded bars just seems like too much to me. 

In both situations I’m just fearing the judgment of my peers and friends for me not wanting to break the guideline rules.

161,"My friend is now trying to be a “better” friend, but after this I don’t trust her. She and the guy that I liked created this really petty drama triangle with me. It made me see the both of them in a completely different way. When the two of them were still living with each other, I would wake up most mornings at my house having a panic attack with my mind thinking about the two of them getting with each other. My friend has been open to talk about this many times but it’s pointless. The two of them didn’t do anything, but the guy that I liked started to develop feelings for her which was a fucking slap in the face.

I’ve tried to let things go with her but every time she brings up the guy that I like, I just get triggered and remember the pain that I felt from the decision that she made. I don’t trust her and in fact I never will, the funny thing is that I’ve never even met her boyfriend and she’s never once asked me if I wanted to hangout with them.

162,"My MIL thinks she has EMF sensitivity, ie, that radiation from WiFi and cell phones are giving her headaches.

My understanding of the condition is that it’s never been proven in a laboratory setting but that it’s at least a real psychosomatic phenomenon, so she is actually “feeling” these things. The recommended treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy.

The problem is... how to get her to accept this and try seeing a therapist. She’s deep into it, has hired a “consultant”to help her buy all this gear to shield against EMF radiation, and is trying to get us to do the same in our house since she visits for weeks at a time to see her grandkids. She also believes that 5g is going to bombard us all with dangerous radiation and basically believes the Bill Gates vaccine conspiracy, so having a reasonable conversation is difficult.

Usually, we kind of just shrug off the eccentricities, but this is having a real effect on her well-being and the quality of life of her husband, who has to spend the money on all this stuff and accommodate the WiFi-less lifestyle, and I know it’s going to affect us when she comes to visit because she won’t be able to handle being in the house with our WiFi. She bought a meter that detects the signal, so she’ll know when it’s on.

163,"The title pretty much says it.

You've probably been in a relationship that was coming to an end, and that end might have been delayed because of pity that one had for the other. If you haven't been in this situation yourself, you have probably seen the same thing happen with others.

I think I'm in that now, except with friendships. I'm in at least two of them now.

I'd be happy to catch up with most old friends from time to time, even if we're not close and don't have so much in common anymore, if that was it.

What makes ""pity friendships"" different is that the one Skype call I make once every other week, or the one time I hang out once every few months, gets really annoying. I made these friendships back in high school, when I was a different person.

A lot of what happens when we do talk is that I hear updates from acquaintances in high school or some kind of fitness pseudoscience. I could not care less about that stuff. It's annoying to listen to.

I have tried subtly changing the subject, but it always comes back to this. It's so annoying. I'm 22, I've been out of high school for 4 years, and I'm still hearing the exact same topics.

There's no bad blood and the talk is relatively innocent. The updates are not gossip - they're just standard ""this is how Ryan is doing."" The pseudoscience isn't particularly harmful either - it's mostly stuff like ""try this new stretch to target your love handles.""

What makes them *pity* friends is that I don't think they have many other people to go to. I'm not super popular, but I have developed I think a strong friend group in college. I have at least 3 people I'm *really* close with, and 7 or 8 people I'm moderately close with whom I could talk to if one person wasn't available.

164,"Good Evening,

So I had been in a rocky relationship for the past two years, to say the least both parties having their own faults, mine of the more rigorous consequence, hers more mentally controlling. Both sides at fault and she ended up leaving me. 

I currently use Reddit for it's more advantageous side of exploration, with that being said talking about something serious is a bit new for me. With that out of the way, I need some advice. (Aside from the obvious of making two different accounts, but that's no fun.)

Here is my dilemma. I dated this girl in highschool for two weeks... Nothing serious right? She's a phenomenal girl, but you know highschool, me personally I was a sports guy and she was a band gal. We didn't necessarily click, but there was something that I was missing at the time and I broke up with her. I believe I thought she was cheating on me. 

Anyways. So fast forward easily 5 years. And which btw, she looks exactly the same except matured and definitely still the same girl outside of being married and having children.. Which I have two boys one not blood and the other out of wedlock. So we both have a history now and more baggage... If we were to maybe do anything other than be friends. That's just it. She doesn't want to be more than friends right now and I respect that. I don't want to influence her, but at the same time I don't want to deny her any sort of experience she could have. I can't give to many details with the intention of protecting her identity. However, I just want to figure out what the best thing to do is now, or if I'm already doing it by laying down the grounds of ""Hey, we are friends, and if anything changes let me know, otherwise we stay that way.""

I care about this girl and don't know how to show it other than be there for her, and give her a letter sealed with the words ""In Case you feel alone.""

So I don't know. Any Advice?",28May2020,1
166,"Been together for 2 1/2 years. I want to be able to buy a house before 30, currently saving as much as I can. He makes more than I do so I don't pay a high rent at all. But, I always try to pay half of everything we buy like groceries, I pay the internet, and any bills for the apartment that come out high I will pay half. I try to cook, I clean, I've washed his clothes and put them away. I try to do extra things to make things easier for him. I am in school and work full time so it's difficult, I get stressed out but I really appreciate his help so I don't have to live with my parents and we can be together. We had a couple of conversation about money in the past and someday getting a house, but now that his expenses are lower since I am here to financially help support the household, he wants to buy a brand new car. We do not live in the greatest area and would like to move out eventually (there are police here every weak, fights, and homeless people ). But, in my mind, we were both supposed to save as much as we can to buy a house, start a full life together. Maybe I want too much, and want to be able to have a better life. I don't want to live with debt, I want a good low mortgage. And once I can get my LVN and RN license pay off that house and move to a better one while renting the other house (LVN school was free, hoping RN school will be too with the help of the program that is paying my LVN). Invest in properties. But during this time  I want to save as much as I possibly can. I am not doing it just for me, but for him to also have a good comfortable life where he can indulge. But, right now is not the time to buy a 30,000 dollar brand new car, there are plenty of cheaper used cars with low milage that work perfectly and later on, we can get him the car he wants. I feel like he completely ignored the other conversations, so complacent with doing nothing with his life. It terrifies me that he may have no ambition, no want to better his life (a new car isn't improving your life). It makes me feel like I am alone and if I want a home, to live in a better place, I am responsible for making that happen and he would just ride along. That is not what I want. I don't know what the next step to make is.

169,"I’m 18. 

My dad makes physical threats to me all the time, threatens to cut me off financially, etc... He thinks I “disrespect” him and use him for his money. Whenever he thinks I’m talking back, he can’t control his anger. Last night, I was hit badly with a remote on the side of my head. He is extremely apologetic about it right now, but I don’t want to accept this.

I just feel so hollow right now. I have nothing to do. Emotionally, I am alone. None of my friends can do anything. I’m not even sure if my current partner can. I’m sure they care and all but I have a strong suspicion that it’s not something they really want or need to deal with right now. 

He has kicked me in the stomach before, broken my phone, thrown things at me, and kicked holes in the wall due to these anger outbursts. He has always been extremely apologetic afterwards and promised never to do it again. These are NOT common incidents: maybe once, twice, three times a year? Usually we just argue and he curses me out. He curses me out a lot.

My mom always tells me to stop talking back, because somehow me doing that causes things to escalate. I do have a tendency to not back down, but I strongly believe that I shouldn’t keep being blamed for this. My mom got so frustrated last night - she was like “why can’t you just not talk back? Why do you have to keep goading him?” is that not just his own problem? Why can’t you control yourself? I’ve never been physically violent with anyone.

I had enough of his shit after getting hit last night and told him to fuck off. He apologized and said he didn’t mean to hit me, and that he meant to aim somewhere else. You shouldn’t fucking be throwing remotes at me in the first place, right? My head hurts. I’m really mad. Someone please tell me what to do because I don’t even know what to do anymore. I feel so hollow. I don’t even hate him - he’s just disgusting, everything is disgusting and I want it all to go away.",28May2020,1
170,"I currently live in an apartment with a couple of other girls. I recently had a new male neighbor move in next door. The building which he moved into happens to be extremely close to mine, maybe 10-15 feet. Our only bedroom windows are lined up perfectly next to each other, so you have strait view into the adjacent bedroom. During the day this isn’t much of an issue as the rooms are mostly shaded and hard to see in. However, at night, with the lights on, the rooms are perfectly visible. Because of this I usually close my blinds at night, or whenever I’m changing as he could easily see in. 

The problem is one night I caught him completely naked. I was relaxing in bed, with my blinds open. From where I sit in bed I cannot see into his room and he cannot see me. It was getting dark (~8pm) so I decided to close the blinds. When I got up I saw him laying out on his bed, on his stomach, completely nude. What makes it worse is that he has placed his bed to be exactly in front of the window (while mine is in the back opposite corner of the room and harder to see). Which seemed so creepy, almost like he wanted to be on display for me to see. I was shocked and closed the blinds immediately. Which would have been pretty obvious to him as they make some noise. I thought he might have just forgot to close the blinds?? But once I peeked out again to see if he had noticed and shut his, he hadn’t at all. He still continues to leave his blinds open at all times. 

It has only been about three days since he’s moved in. I feel weird confronting him myself. I thought about contacting the landlord to see  if they could do anything but I’m not sure if I should since it’s only happened once so far. But I also don’t want to see his pasty white butt again either.",28May2020,1
171,"CONTEXT: To preface this our family is Indian and we're 1st gen kids living in America. The people in our family who still come to family events are either toxic or enable the toxicity saying that its part of every family. Most if not all the uncles and aunts participate or facilitate some sort of gossip/drama between all the adults. A lot of them are also very condescending and each person wants the others to live and they would like, not caring about what the other person feels or wants for their own life. The only way they deal with conflict is by ignoring it and pretending like it never happened in front of each other but then holding grudges and talking behind people's backs. 

My cousin(18) and I(22) were somewhat very close because we'd see all the drama going on in our family and were happy we had each other and weren't disrespectful like they were. So my cousin and I got into a fight with through facebook messages over her justifying her vilifying other family members for insulting her parents but then not condemning her parents for doing the same things and worse to other family members INCLUDING ME. She's been doing this for years so I can't say she's acting brand new, and yes I'm admitting I've been the one putting up with it so I can't be too furious but I thought she'd grow up and change(especially when she's admitted that her parents have damaged her mental health more than anyone else she's ever met, yes she's 18 lmao)

Her whole side of the argument is that these insults from our other aunt made her mom upset and that she was justified in throwing a tantrum(she tried to jump out of our moving car while screaming and crying at my uncle who was driving while we were on our way to our cousin's rehearsal dinner). 

I explained to her(my cousin) that her parents have insulted and upset me and other people in the family to the point of tears and heartache but they tell us that, we're too sensitive, so why is it when it happens to her parents its the end of the world and the people insulting her parents are ""petty, disrespectful, and fake"" as she says. I didn't say it in those exact words, mine had more emotion in it, I didn't curse but I was very vulnerable.

Question Context: I sent her a loooooong paragraph explaining my emotions(all very calm, just very vulnerable) and she checked the messages 2 hours later and hasn't responded since(its been about 12 days). At first I thought she was busy with school so I didn't think much of it, but then a couple days later I got notifications(because she's on my close friends list) that she changed her profile photo and cover photo for the first time since she made a facebook(she never posts). And she updated them to YEARS old photos, so its not even  like she put up a recent photo. She clearly isn't busy and knows she has to see me in person soon(after quarantine is over). 

QUESTIONS: 

1. She has admitted that her parents have degraded her mental health(they're known to be the most dramatic in our whole family) but why doesn't she that they're also hurting others? And that wrong is wrong no matter who does it. (For example, as brown people we get invited to tonsss of randos weddings and go to all of them, but my uncle didn't go to my other cousin's wedding(who he grew up with since he lived with them for 6+years when he moved to America) because he married a white woman. 
2. She knows I'm confrontational, so why did she leave me on read/seen when she knows I poured my heart out, and that she has to see me in person soon. 
3. Isn't leaving someone on seen in a fight a sign of blatant disrespect?

173,"I mentioned in an earlier post about my direct family and how I was the forgotten one, the hardest button to button, the one that didn’t click. The solution given was, don’t click, just exist entirely parallel to them and I think that’s great advice. But, that’s just one side of my family, there is another. 

My Grandpa on my dad's side was farmer’s son turned lawyer who made a pretty penny by investing in Oil during the Canadian oil boom of the ’60s to the 2000s. All of my dad’s siblings, except him, took a chance and right out of university they banded together and started a commercial real-estate firm which skyrocketed them into being millionaires. All of them live in swanky modernist multi-million-dollar homes and their children went to private schools and have huge savings accounts to bail them out whenever they need it. My dad, on the other hand, was the one person in his family who was more than happy to pursue a career in radio in rural Manitoba in a small, crime-riddled town. My family, therefore, were the ones who grew up on boxed mac’n’cheese,  coupons and hand-me-downs. There, the context provided. 

For over a decade I went with my dad to his family’s Christmases (despite being a Jew) 1000km away, and every year we insisted they do not give us anything and they ignored us and spent LAVISHLY on us, like $200.00 on each of us. This is just how it’s always gone. It wasn’t just the gifts I was in it for, I genuinely liked them, and aside from a few complicated teenage years they seemed to like me. I was just a fixture at those gatherings. We had this tradition where we’d go to my grandparents' condo 7:30 am and throughout the day stop in for coffee, or brunch, or lunch at the house of every family in our family. Then, in the dead of night, we’d go to my aunt and uncle’s lavish house for Christmas dinner. They did turkey, stuffing, the works; The kids would play card-games downstairs. Then at 10 pm everyone in the family would gather in the living room and play some novelty board game as a group of twenty. It was really fun and I always had a great time. From the time I was 16 onward I brought gifts for everyone too, I mean what’s a $135 wine order between family? It made me feel better about receiving gifts if I was giving some. Even if we didn’t drive the 1000km there, we’d get a gigantic package in the mail with gifts for everyone. Now, I eventually moved closer to them.  Back when I was a millwright, we lived close enough that on boring Sundays my dad’s girlfriend and my aunt call each other and put together a spur of the moment wine &amp; cheese party just for something to do. 

Half a decade ago, I moved away, I felt like I could do more than be a millwright and wanted to start over. So, I moved close to my mom’s side and started my life over with $20 in my pocket, sleeping on someone’s couch, eventually going back to university for civil engineering. In all that time, I never came down for Christmas. It wasn’t feasible. So, last year, I was down for Memorial and they insisted on hosting me for dinner. My uncle, a sweet bearish man, like 6’7, 320 lbs just embraced me in this huge hug that lasted a minute and said, “ four years, we can’t let this much time pass again.” Later that night, I decided I wanted to have a dad’s side Christmas that year, why not? I contacted my aunt and she was excited that I was coming back. We made arrangements and synced schedules and that was that. Then, I got a birthday card from her asking to send gift ideas because she didn’t want to give me a cheque on Christmas. I thought about it, like really thought on it. I honestly didn’t want to do it. You know, I wasn’t in it for commercialism, I just wanted to see my grandparents, aunts, uncles and partake in the old familiar events. After a long time of thinking it over, I sent a list, because I didn’t want to sour our relationship, and OH BOY was that the bad choice. 

Three nights later, I checked my phone at work to a massive text from my aunt basically saying “This is ridiculous, you kids are thirty-five, why are we obligated to get you gifts?” and I said “You asked me” and then I quoted her card, she then said, “Oh yeah, well this year’s fine, I just meant going forward we don’t give you anything, you don’t give us anything.”Fine, that sounds great, less guilt, right? Well, two weeks later she blew up at me again, this time while buying wine for everyone and demanded I never bring gifts to her place, period. After finding out you can actually return wine I was fine and just continued on. On the drive down I was racked with nervousness, felt like I really screwed the pooch and kept messaged the local Chabad and local synagogues to see if I can just drop my dad off at the party, attend a candle-lighting, and pick him up later. All and all, I attended their party, it was fine. She was more patronizing to my dad and me than I remember. She’d passive-aggressively say, “Wines at the bar, you two aren’t seniors, you can serve yourselves” when our glasses were still half full or before anyone said dinner was ready saying, “Stand up, the line starts there, I’m only building plates for the seniors.” They did get me a gift, that cost around $2-$300.00, My grandpa is so proud of me turning my life around and that was nice, I got along with my cousins although their world and mine are oceans apart, and  I really connected with my second uncle who I never got a chance to speak with, but he was absolutely fascinated with Civil Engineering.  

I know, this whole chain of events doesn’t sound like a major f\*\*kup, or like anything to dwell on. Tell that to my subconscious. A day hasn’t gone by since I received that text, where my brain doesn’t bring it to the front of my mind, and I don’t feel guilty and call myself an a\*\*hole, shiver and regret getting involved at all. I think about it so often it’s insane, I just want to crawl under a tree every time I think about it. How do I handle this going forward? Part of me just wants to fall off the map with them again, but then I think about that bear hug and what my uncle said to me. Plus, honestly, I still love those Christmases, sue me. What should I do? How should I approach the relationship with this side of the family going forward?",28May2020,1
174,"I have wanted to do so during summertime for a while now. Now with Covid-19 I am unsure if it is the right thing to do, neither of my parents have been laid off their jobs and we don't need it financially, but I would like to start saving up money for college and things of the such. With so many people's jobs being taken away should I or should I not still apply, I have heard that people have been getting paid more during unemployment then when they happened to be employed, am I overthinking the entire situation or should I not apply at all. Also yes Wal-Mart apparently does hire 15 year olds.",28May2020,1
175,"I just decided to create an account after just viewing everything for a couple months so I could post this but yeah,

Ok so some backstory here, So my family owns 12 chickens now but we used to have a 18, why is it lower you might ask? Well, we live super far from a city, basically in the woods, and we have tons of different animals within shouting distance, beavers, squirrels, deer, fox, but only three animals are really on our watch list, Possums, Raccoons, and Hawks. Now for the last one, we just put a wire net roof over the chicken run so they aren't really a problem, but in out last house, possums ate like 3/4 of the chickens we used to have, but there aren't really any possums where we live now so the only real problem is raccoons.

So up comes the first night we are to put the chickens outside for the first time, no problem, we keep them trapped in the coop while we finish up the run. first week no problems at all, nothing, nada. about two weeks after we finish the coop, we wake up one morning and notice that there is some blood around the corner of the coop entrance in the run, welp, we count the chickens and sure enough, two are missing. So we do what any sane person would do and we seal up all of the gaps in the walls with wire mesh or boards. Then comes the second night, we wake up in the morning and all we see are some scratches on the walls, count the chickens, all 16 there. We thought that would be the end. Oh were we wrong.

The next night, around 9 PM, one of our neighbors comes to our door saying she is hearing weird noises coming from our backyard, so we go out and check. We count, and there are 14 chickens. We look around, and to our dismay, we notice that some of the blocking boards have been torn right off their nails and theres a gap into the coop. Now there's nothing we can really hope to do at this point, but our neighbor says she will lend us a trap that she used when some animals were getting at her garden. Now, since the first time only one chicken was taken, we thought we were safe for that night, so we call it a night and go to bed. Well, it turns out that must have been a very hungry raccoon that night and we find out 2 more chickens are missing, barely any trace at all, no blood, just a couple feathers. lowering our total to just a dozen

Well, at that point all we could do was go get the trap and set it, so we put it next to the gap in the coop and put some raw chicken in it to bait the raccoon and we go to bed, hoping we would catch something. Well, when we wake up, sure enough, theres a 50 something pound looking raccoon sitting in the trap, hissing and sitting still in the trap. Well, we can't just take it back into the woods and let it go, so we have to kill it, and unluckily the job fell to me. So I get the .22 and come back out thinking, ""How the heck am I gunna move this thing?"" So me, being the idiot I am, I grab the top of the   trap with one hand, lift it keeping it away from my body, basically 1 sided t posing  and start walking into the woods. Once I get about a couple dozen paces, my arm is already killing me, so me, being the idiot I am, keep walking. I get to where I need to go, toss the trap over the fence, hop over myself, and take it back a bit farther, I do what I need to do, and bury the thing.

That night, no chickens gone, no sound from the woods, guess it was alone. That brings me to now, where my arm is on fire, my shoulder is stiff, and trying to move any muscles above my elbow leads to a dull aching pain, which is why I am here right now asking one simple question. How the heck do I get my arm to stop hurting? I've tried Ibuprofen but it only helped a bit, any advice on how to numb the pain?",28May2020,1

177,"I am a freshman student at a very large public university in California. When I started the year, I was loosely committed to becoming a physician assistant and so I majored in something health related. I now recognize that I never had a passion for medicine and only decided that that was a field I wanted to go into because of pressure from my parents to become a doctor. 

I have been extremely unmotivated for the entire year. Besides joining a sport I participated in very little on campus activity and I don't feel that I made many friends. I was one of those kids in high school that didn't need to study at all to excel in my classes, and I feel like I can't cope with the pace and rigor of college classes. I nearly failed a class my first quarter, then actually failed a class the second quarter. Now it's almost summer and I genuinely feel like I haven't learned anything during my entire first year.

I've been toying with the idea of dropping out and working for a while to figure my life out and decide what I want to do. I'm certain that my parents would disapprove and try to convince me otherwise but they wouldn't cut me off or anything like that. They would let me move back in but ideally I would want to have my own place (I recognize that this may not be possible). I've been thinking about going to trade school as well even though being a woman in a male-dominated field would have its own set of difficulties. 

Alternatively, I could stay in college and figure out what I want to do along the way. 

What I'm most afraid of is going into massive debt for a degree that I don't want and won't use. When my grandpa passed away he left me money for my college education and that is pretty much all gone from school fees this year save for a few thousand that I still have. I know that not having to take out student loans so far is a privilege that most people don't get and I'm extremely grateful for it. My parents tell me not to worry about debt, that it's just a fact of life and if I get a high-paying job it won't matter anyways. I feel a lot of pressure from them and my extended family to get a degree, as many of my family members are highly educated. I'm really, really afraid of disappointing them and making them feel as though their efforts have been wasted on me. I feel directionless and unmotivated. Any advice on what I should do would be greatly appreciated.",28May2020,1

She has started the application process, but has been asking me for help none stop on her resume and letter of intent. She is happy about it one day and hates it the next. I have been trying my best  to be supportive including: help writing, moral support and watching the kids all weekend while she works. I have even picked up more chore work to try and take more stress off her plate (I now do all cooking, laundry, dish cleaning, floor cleaning, and garbage).

180,So yeah the title pretty much says it all. My batting coach from around 4 years ago just died today and I don’t know how I feel about it. Don’t get me wrong I’m sad he died but I’m not sad enough to cry about it but at the same time my throat feels kind of tight like I’m holding back tears. I can’t explain it. It’s kind of like when your neighbor form one house over passes away you know? You never really knew them but hearing them pass away makes you feel weird and sad and it’s just kind of jarring? I don’t know guys. I guess I just kinda needed a place to vent for a minute. But I just want to know what I feel and why I’m feeling it. It’s night the 5 stages of grief I know that for sure.

181," i also posted this in r/raisedbynarcississts but i haven't gotten any replies. this is the same post tho

My step dad is really narcissistic. we have a really long history but im not going to get into too much of it for this post.

so just a little while ago my step dad asked me if i had drank any of his coke in a tone that kinda said ""idgaf about what you have to say"" so he asked me if i had drank any of his coke and i said no because i really didn't. he obviously didn't believe me and asked my mom and she said no too. my mom called me down to bring the laundry up the stairs and while we were down there she asked me if i drank his coke and once again i said no. she didn't believe me either. she didn't really even let me explain myself. i told her that if i could in any way prove that i didn't drink his coke that i would prove it but how could i do that?

she just took my phone without saying anything. im literally being punished over something i didn't even do.

this really pisses me off because my real dad and old step mom used to do this kind of shit all the time but on a way bigger scale. as in they thought i was murdering animals, breaking things that added up to thousands of dollars and many precious family air looms and abusing my brother when i hadn't. that lasted for years and i cant tell you how many incidents there were them. oh and not to mention i was 7 or 8 when they started accusing me of these types of things. they would just randomly yell at me for hours and hours on end, multiple times a day sometimes. even though i didn't do any of the stuff they were saying i did i just said i did because that was the only thing they would believe.

when i told the school that i had suicidal thoughts about 2 years ago, my parents were more concerned with how much money it was going to cost them and how it made them look. oh and that they had to deal with DHS. (dhs also does the same things as cps where i am). i said all of that to help defy the kind of people my parents are.

its been almost a year since ive seen my real dad and he's broken up with my step mom since then too. i will admit that my dad is getting better but idk if im ready to visit him or not. even if he is 100% turned around now i will never forget everything him and my step mom put me through.

thats why this pisses me off soo much. dont fucking acuse me of something i didn't do. i dont like to take shit from anybody and that doesn't exclude my parents. i wish i had started doing this way earlier and standing up for myself. but all standing up for myself does nowadays is get me grounded. im so done with these people.

i will probably add or edit this later but i want to know what can i do?",28May2020,1
183,"I went to a very small high school (everyone knows everyone kinda situation). There was a guy in my class who I liked a lot, we were friends and talked really frequently in person and over text but we were from different friend groups so we didn’t often ever hangout. Like I said, I liked him but I wasn’t sure if he felt the same way. Whenever we talked in person he would be flirty as well as over text, but I would consider him way out of my league. 

One day he just stopped texting me and we kind of lost touch. But this summer when we moved away to university/collage (we went to different schools which were far apart) he reached out and started talking to me again. Except it wasn’t acting like he did before and he seemed like he was only interested in being very sexual. 

He wanted me to send nudes and talk dirty to him. He wasn’t really interested in anything else. I was single and slightly lonely so I decided “why not.” After that night he messaged me at least once a week but only for sexting, he never asked me how my day went, how school was going, if I liked my classes... he just wanted to get off. 

The sexting was fun at first, but I just wanted more from him (if that makes sense??) He started saying things like “we need to hookup” and “omg we need to fuck”. I agreed because the sexting just wasn’t cutting it anymore. But when I tried to talk to him about actually meeting up, he completely avoided the conversation. I said “when will you be home next, we should meet up” and he replied “I don’t know, maybe”

This just continuously keeps going on and on and I’m getting annoyed. I just want someone’s opinion other than my friends because they all dislike him (even when we were in high school). Should I keep trying? Should I stop trying? I know he is a nice guy but he’s just being a dick. I just wish he would have a conversation with me like a civilized person.

I feel no love for her at all.

She’s not even a bad sister. Most people would be lucky to have her, she always is waiting on everyone, if I ask for a drink she gets it, she always does what I ask. And I know this sounds bad. I use her and I know I do. 

And I’m not a psychopath or anything, I love and feel sympathy for everyone but her. Every time she smiles I get so mad. When she opens her mouth to speak, I can’t handle it. I just hate her and being around her.

We’re kind of long distance (about 3 hours away) so we usually text and/or call at least once each day, with occasional ups and downs and maybe a missed day here and there. Normal. Except for recently.

Normally I would be really worried but they’re not alone and have posted many seemingly very happy photos with their girlfriend (23F) on social media. I know looks can be deceiving but honestly they seem to be doing okay. I checked in a few days ago and they said they were doing alright, all things considered.

But a very childish and immature part of me feels kind of hurt, which is why I didn’t bother reaching out today. In the past, I’ve never gone a single whole day without replying to them without it being taken personally, and I’m just confused as to why they’re allowed to do this but I’m not. The only times we’ve even said words to each other in the last week, beyond a couple memes was when they were asking for help with unemployment stuff. And a few weeks ago it felt like they would only reach out in a crisis or when they needed relationship advice. I don’t like feeling like a utility. Honestly I think this has triggered some residual insecurities within me, which is why I’m more upset about it than I probably should be.

My question is whether I should even bother continuing to reach out, or just give them their space? I worry they’re gonna think I’m pissed if I give them too much space and they might just not talk to me again.

Had one good friend over the course of 3 years. Little else. Other coworkers who came in hit it off immediately. Texting one another, hangouts ect. As we often had new coworkers I tried again and again to make friends with little to no luck. Once I was told that I am fairly bland and that is the reason. I always thought I was more of a introvert and quiet person. So something had to change. 

 I moved and got a new job, and a new career so I am learning and it has been a uphill battle. I am not a fast learner and I think that frustrated a few folks. My new coworkers are a tight cliche. They welcomed me and were very friendly but somewhere along the way I have rubbed them the wrong way. I am not sure how. I have tried to be positive, ask questions (maybe the problem?) be upbeat (not pollyanna or anything.) No luck. another new coworker gelled instantly.

209,"I’m 18 years old and I’m going away to college in August. Ever since I had a smartphone, I’ve had very strict parental controls (ie it shut off my phone after a certain time, they could read my texts and view my history remotely, block certain search terms, etc). A few years ago, they lightened up a bit, but I still have pages blocked on Safari, even when I search for things that should not be age restricted. For example, I saw a video with some statues and wanted to find out where they were in the world, but Safari blocked my search for “red and orange asian statues on hill”. So not only does it make me uncomfortable that they can see what I’m doing on my phone, I’m worried that if I need to Google something while I’m at college and it blocks the page, I won’t be able to find it. I pay for my own phone and my mom pays for my data (my parents are divorced, Dad is the one controlling the settings), so I see no reason for him to continue to have the power to be virtually looking over my shoulder at everything I do. But every time I bring up him taking off the settings, he gets mad. How do I get him to lighten up and at least give my the password to my own device?",28May2020,1
210,"Yesterday my parents got into an argument,mom then admitted what ive been suspecting for as long as i could remember and what i feared that she wanted to kill herself.  Im worried she would either kill herself, or kill us then herself.. i woke up in the middle of the night last night and had a panic attack freaking out thinking my mom could come in at any second and end my life... i just kept petting my cat and he helped me calm down and i just drifted to sleep. Skip to today everything seems fine shes in a better mood. I keep thinking about the entire situation.  If she (in her words)  doesnt want to live anymore and is unhappy, am i not a good enough reason to keep living? I know we arent close anymore but the fact that even i, your child, isnt a good reason to stick around, does it mean im not good enough. Did i fail you? I try and try to be close with you but somedays i feel like my little ""hi's"" and ""how are you""s bounce right off.. its the only way i know how to start a conversation... i cant help im on the spectrum mom. I try to listen to you when you talk but i dont mean to get distracted.  Im sorry. 

When i think about it more i realize why i may be closer with dad as he spent time with me so much as a kid. He would bring me to the park or movies when i was little, he would play with legos with me and he would also be the one to tuck me in at night and read dr.seuss. From what i can remember mom youd sometimes be there and do those things but i dont have much memory of it. I want to be closer to you and when i try talking to you i feel like my words are reflected.  When i talk about therapy for the family and originally me before all of this you said it never works or its not real science.  Im not in a good mental state and i know you arent either.  But the fact that you threaten to leave us and get a divorce 6 times within the span of a year fucks up my mental health and i dont know if you care. I know you have your problems but i dont want mine to be made worse. 

Ex: When we went to epcot for a good time you and dad argued on the way. I then vented about it to my boyfriend via text. Later at dinner you saw me texting him as we waited for you and i tried to hide my screen but you insisted to check my messages and i tried to stop you. Then you get upset when you see something that wasnt meant for you. Apparently i ruined the trip and its MY fault youre in a bad mood now. You didnt listen. 

These things highlight in my mind when i try sleeping at night and i hate it as i love you and try to be closer to you but my perspective is all muddy and distorted im just very confused on what to think anymore. Im sorry if you ever see this.",28May2020,1
211,"Im a 23F and grew up with very thick, straight, and long hair. After puberity/becoming vegetarian the texture of my hair completely changed. It is now more of a brittle texture and has some curls in it. I have also been experiencing hair loss over the years and have been feeling very insecure about how it looks now. This was the only feature that I would ever get complements on.. Now it doesn’t have the fraction of volume it once did. To add on to this my hair is incredibly difficult to take care of. I don’t brush it because it gets frizzy and when I leave it alone long enough it starts to form a huge mess of dreads and just matted hair in some areas that is a pain to brush out. I have been trying to think of ways that I can manage my hair the way it is now just because I lose so much of it and the difficulty taking proper care of it. I am a very low maintenance person and don’t like having a long hair care routine. If I lived alone on this planet and would not offend anyone, the easiest solution that I would implement would be to braid my hair. But I understand that I probably will never be able to do this without offending anyone and something I would never want to do. Just to put it out there in case anyone asks I am Mexican American (first gen) and although I have dark black hair, dark eyes, my skin is light.

219,"Before you read any further: i know i sound dramatic. Please just give me the benefit of the doubt and try to keep in mind that i am not a very strong person.

I have been at home for a month and a half now. Before that i was finishing my freshman year of college, while in a serious long term relationship, with two jobs, with a healthy social life. I was very happy. In high school i was very depressed and i worked really hard to save up money and get an apartment to go to college (my family doesnt really have money).

Since moving home, my relationship has ended, and i have lost my support system which i loved so dearly, and i have also lost all my money and both my jobs. I now live at home with a job that gives me around 15 hours a week, i barely see anyone, and i am so physically and mentally broken from this breakup and from my entire life falling apart that i can’t do anything. I don’t eat, i barely sleep, i just watch tv or i’m on tiktok or reddit or tumblr. I used to play video games a lot and i cant even do that. I used to be really into music and art and i cant even do that.

Point is, i have already gotten close to killing myself twice. The only thing holding me on is hope of the future and my best friend just told me that there is apparently supposed to be an even worse spike of corona in the fall. I am so afraid that i will kill myself because of not being able to go out and do anything. I need to meet new people or i am afraid i will literally die.

Please, i am so desperate, has anyone else been suicidal/is right now and is coping or knows what to do right now?? I am so desperate. I am so so desperate. Please.

220,"I am trying to be vague so that no one in the post may be identified. My girlfriend was recently raped by a relative that had raped her multiple times when she was younger. She never said anything to authorities and only told her very closest friends after it happened. It happened again very recently, and I know it will happen again. I made a promise that I would never tell anyone that she told me. She has said in the past that if she told anyone, she would want to do that herself. I want to break that promise and tell her caretaker, so that it will never happen again, and that bastard will be locked up for what he did. Should I not say anything and be there for her when this happens (not going to do this unless REALLLY good reason, but it is good to hear other’s input)? Should I immediately tell her caretaker and let them decide what to do? If I do this, she WILL break up with me and hate me. I am okay with that if it stops this trauma from happening. This is going to sound absolutely terrible. Should I not say anything and be there for her until it happens again? And when it does immediately contact the authorities? bc there will be DNA evidence.

221,"My bf and I have been dating for almost 3 years. He's 24 and I'm 23. He's an amazing, kind, and sensitive man. I'm in love with him and I know he's the one. But this isn't about relationship trouble really, I'm having trouble understanding a perspective and I want to see it but it's hard...

He just moved to his first apartment and I've been helping him unpack. I've always known he was a collector. He collects Knives and Pop Figures. I understand that because I think his knife collection is pretty cool and he and I like a lot of the same pop culture stuff they make Pop Figures for. But as I'm unpacking with him, I'm noticing a lot of really old and weird keepsakes.

He still has a lot of toys from childhood, even a teddy bear he got as a baby, and keepsakes from an aunt that passed away. I also understand attachment after a loss. My Grandmother passed away and I kept all the holiday and birthday cards she gave me while she was sick. But, I have trouble understanding keeping the childhood toys. I would understand if they were Legos, or a hot wheels car collection, or even action figures. But it's more like small trains, and blocks, old stuffed animals, and other stuff like that. 

I would understand if they were displayed and shown off as an art piece, but even before he moved he admitted they stayed in boxes in his closet. I even asked if we could donate them, but if I even insinuate getting rid of it he gets really upset. 

He's admitted to me he has a family history of hording. His grandma's house had to be torn down because it got so bad. Even his mom has a little hording issue (she has multiple collections, no real way to store them, and she has storage bins in every closet to hold them).

It's very hard for me to understand the attachment. I was raised as a Christian and was taught that we shouldn't get attached to belongings and we should always give our things away. I got rid of a lot of my toys when I was in middle school, and when I graduated high school I got rid of almost half my stuff (old clothes, stuff I didn't use, knick knacks I was tired of, etc).

Now, comparing him to his mom and his grandma, he's not a horder. It's 1 very small closet. And it's not enough to scare me off or break up with him, but it is a red flag and I think something it needs to be addressed, whether is gets utilized as decor or I learn to understand his prospective. 

So I'm mainly looking for advice on what to do. Should I try to see it from his perspective? Should I transform it into something with him? Should I try to convince him to let it go? I love him to death and I just don't want to make him upset if it means that much to him but I don't want to be on an episode of Horders either.",28May2020,1
222,"Basically what the title says, it has been dream to study abroad in Spain since sophomore year of high school. I spent months working on a journal on why I wanted to study there with colleges, majors, cities, jobs etc but they shot it down and said I wasn’t old enough to make that decision for myself. They told me being nineteen was not an adult and I needed their help with life changing decisions. 

Since I’m a girl, there will be always double standards for me and I would not be able to do the things I want to do. I understand that they’re just trying to protect me but I want to live my own life and follow my dreams. There will always be dangers wherever I go, wether it’s in the states or another country.

 I threw my resume online and applied to jobs here and there got a few interviews but I wasn't feeling anything from them, then a construction/sprinkler irrigation job i had not applied for contacted me (call him frank)  frank said he saw my resume online and would like to know If was interested, I said sure why not I have no experience in this field of work but i can make a decent living doing it If i stick through it so i replied i was interested.
 I contacted the interviewer ( let's call him Bob) and asked to set up a interview date, day goes by no response I wait untill 3pm and decide maybe I'll phone him he picks up and says he must have missed my text so we set up a date and I have an interview. 
The interview lasts for about 15 min ( he was on a smoke break I think?) I say I'd like the job and that I'm interested in the position, he says okayy he'll have to contact Head office and fiddle with some details and figure out a suitable pay rate for me since I have no experience in this field ( he offered 18 with 12% holiday pay stacked on top of that)
3 days go by and I don't hear anything, so I start to doubt if I got the job, I decide maybe I'll contact Frank? he replies the next morning and says they've been swamped with interviews/resume and he'll contact Bob to see how things are going. another 3 days go by no email from Frank and no texts from Bob so I text Bob and say I was just wondering how the application process is going and if you have heard any word yet from head office he replies ""The office is still working things out, I will be calling the office this afternoon to discuss and should have some answers for you tomorrow"" so I'm like great! I can finally figure things out now I wait patiently all morning for a text nothing... 
Another 5 days go by no response from either frank or Bob I contacted Frank 1 more time and say I'm just wondering if the position is still available as I haven't been contacted or told if it was or not, frank doesn't reply 2 more days passed and I'm over this job now and think screw it I'll just try for another job. I text Bob one more time and say that I'm sorry for bugging you but I haven't heard anything and just wanted to know if there was any update before I accepted any other job offers. no response I just say f this call him leave a voice message 2 min go by and I get a text saying sorry busy call in a bit.... I'm like okay.. day turns to night and no call, next morning hits I wake up to a text from Bob, saying I have the job and that he's sorry it's been really busy give me any pay rate and if I accept he'll send me a list of tools ill need I say yes I'm interested he gives me a list and says he would like me to start tomorrow, I'm like damn that's not a lot of time so I asked if Thursday is okay he replies 5 hours later... sure that works so here I am night of Wednesday starting my new job tomorrow should I be worried or just assume they've been really busy your thoughts?

My (24f) sister (9f) is very destructive. My mother spoils her insanely with toys and treats and it’s like she can do no wrong because she’s “special”. (There’s nothing wrong with her other than behavior, she has been screened for adhd and autism but the doctors said she had nothing) 
I live with roommates and my mother recently lost her job to COVID and is living as a live in aid to an elderly couple and left me to take care of my sister during quarantine. I don’t spend much time with my mom because she was abusive to me and I think the guilt made her the opposite for my sister. I was kicked out at 16 when she got remarried so I on let saw my sister a few times a year after I turned twenty because she got a divorce and asked me to babysit sometimes.

Due to virus I’ve had her for two weeks and so far she has damaged all three sinks in this house, she ripped off the ceiling fan in the guest bedroom, broke the glass light fixture on the ceiling fan as well, stole money from my roommates wallet, stole magnets off the fridge and many knock knacks around the house, abuses two old dogs, covering them in peanut butter and locked them in the bathroom, and she calls my mom daily and says she hates it here.

The first week I gave her my old Nintendo did and wii and she broke both. I refused to give her my switch because I have the expensive edition one and she cried for three days and went on a hunger strike. 

We had to bribe her with McDonald’s because she wouldn’t eat dinner my roommates and I cook but cried and tried calling cops that we were starving her. 

I have some experience with child care ages 3-13 in school programs doing art and after school clubs, and I know how to handle a classroom full of rowdy tweens in summer camps but for some reason I cannot handle one little girl and I feel like I’m stuck in some freak horror comedy or the babadook or something I’ve been crying for days and I don’t know how to handle her. I know she’s my half sister but I dont want to be responsible for her.

My classes are suffering I’ve already failed my test and my roommates are. Telling me they can’t have her here because she disrupts everyone at night when she trashed the closets.

227,"So this is gonna be a bit of a rant and venting of my thoughts but go ahead and chime in your thoughts if you want. This is a throwaway account anyway so it won't last forever.

So I've kind of questioned my sexuality since I was a teenager. I was never great looking but not ugly I don't think. Never had much luck with girls. In fact I didn't loose my virginity until my early 20's and the girl i was with became my wife eventually. Her and I were together for nearly 5 years, and married for 2. Long story but we divorced earlier this year cause our relationship was very strained due to my poor communication skills and her mental health conditions  always clashing. It was good for my mental and physical health as I am far less stressed now. Our sex life was great until the relationship started breaking down in the last year. 

When things started going south I started looking at more porn and since finalizing the divorce a lot more. Something I've always struggled with is that once in a while I'll look at gay porn and it seems to be a nice change from standard guy/girl or girl/girl porn. But I could never see myself with a guy. I always wanted to marry a woman and start a family and have kids and still very much do. But since my divorce and being stuck at home during this covid crap I've gotten very lonely. I've been on all sorts of dating sites but I just seem to not have much luck with women. This is most likely due to me sucking at communicating. 

Well the thoughts been bouncing around my head for quite some time and today I finally decided to give it a try. What if I'm gay? Or at least bi, which seemed more likely as I still find women more attractive more often than men. So I downloaded Grinder and made an account. Holy cow, I was getting taps (there version of a like) and messages like crazy. Kinda felt good that someone was interested in me, even if to just hook up. Came across one guy who seemed nice and we hit it off messaging each other. Told him I had never been with a guy before and he was cool about it. As the day went on we started talking about meeting up. I invited him over to my place eventually. He didn't want to fuck on a first date or kiss so we just kinda jerked each other off for a while and sucked each other a bit. Felt kinda strange to be honest but I kept going. Took me a long time to finally cum. But once we both came and cleaned up we sat and talked for about 5 minutes.  

Then he left and all I could think was ""that was not what I thought it would be. I'm not sure I liked it"". As soon as he left I took a shower and threw the bed sheets in the washer. I feel disgusting and wrong. I deleted my Grinder account and the app. Like wtf did I just do? I feel like this experience has solidified in my mind that no, I'm not gay. Bi? Maybe a little but I really don't see myself getting with a guy ever again. I'm struggling to make sense of this whole situation I've put myself in. I'm totally confused. I think I really need a vagina on my dick, on my face and just all over me to feel normal again as sad and pathetic that may sound. 

So if you've read this far, thanks. I'm sure some of you are laughing your asses off reading this. Feel free to give your thoughts. 

tl;dr - I messed around with a gay guy cause I wanted to explore my sexuality and really didn't like it. Now I'm just confused.",28May2020,1
228,"So I´m a 17 yo that likes math, science, history, anime, videogames and gardening, during this quarantine Ive been looking at documentaries on Curiosity Stream, videos on YT and Nebula, playing some of the maaaaany videogames I have and watching as many anime as I can, also Ive been helping on chores, you know, things such as doing the dishes, mopping the floor and doing my homework.

So... first things first, my family is quite disfunctional, my brother doesnt have any kind of love towards my mother, my father and my mother are divorced, I hate my sister for many things and I only live w/ my father and my sister, my brother lives w/ my grandma.

My brother is 6 years older than me and since I was born in a suburb full of people older than me (most of the the age of my brother, none of my age), Ive matured in par with my brother and I am very mature in some ways for someone my age (someone my age on my country at least), so since Ive grown up maturing at the same time w/ my brother, Ive always found it difficult to make good friends w/ people my age.

Around the time I was in 5th grade, due to financial problems we were having at that time I had to change schools (from that point on, I just stopped talking to any of my older classmates from my past school), so I come here to this new school and Im basically one of the best intelligence-wise (and I hate it, this will be important later).

I grow up in tis new school where virtually everyone has known each other for at least 2 years now, and Im the new guy, many things happen and Im now on 11th grade and I havent had any great friendships, I dont get bullied however, since I am good at math, science, chemistry and one other practical class (Lógica Simbólica, Idk how english-speaking countries call it), all of my classmates respect me and seek guidace when they dont understand any topic on any class and Im basically an off-school teacher for many of my classmates. Thats it for school.

Now, at home, my brother has already moved from my parents´ to my grandma´s and back at my parent´s and then back to my grandma´s (this last time on a good note w/ my parents so no problem there), now,  my brother has had issues w/ my parents since he was like 10, until his 20s, Ive been there the whole time watching how everything unfolds and as so, Ive seen how his life has been evolving, Ive been watching his entire life, hes had great school moments, good friends moments, interesting stuff happening when he started to go to the University and Basically his life has been a way for me to get a look at how an interesting life can be, I have not had any single experience that can be interesting for me so for the last months Ive been feeling like Im only an spectator in life, I have no friends I think Ill still be in touch with when I enter to the university next year, I have no friends to hang out with, heck, I dont even play the same games my small group of temporary friends play so I dont have any interaction with anyone aside from ""Hey, Im having trouble with this math/science/chemistry/LogSim problem, can u help me?"" or the zoom reunions I have with my circle of TF (TF = Temporary Friends) to work on group proyects,

I feel like Im only an spectator, I look at documentaries and love them, I look at science YT channels, and through them I look at humanity´s story and successes, mayor civilizations´rise and fall and I basically love all of that, but I feel like Im only tha, an spectator that looks at history stuff  to learn about the story of mankind, look at scince stuff to be amazed by this incredible universe we live in and how humanity has been discovering how it works and inventing stuff to adapt to it, I look at anime to look at something that at least ""resembles reality"" and to look at how complex relationships can be... all while I sit here on my chair looking at all that stuff through a Computer´s monitor, like an old wizard looking through a crystal ball and I hate it, I want to have a life, I want to have friends to talk to about my musical preferences (Nobody I know listens to Metal), I want to talk about the ames I like (Nobody I know plays the same games as I do, except my brother, but I dont get to see him often), I want to talk about the mesoamerican civilizations (nobody I know my age even cares about that kind of stuff).

Everywhere I see, I look at how the meaning of life is the relationships people have and how they interact with the world, I cant d any of that, (The only person I can talk to that at least likes science and history is my dad, but I dont want to interrupt him often, hes has to work yknow), I feel like my life has no meaning, I havent even considered suicide tho, and I think that´s the last of the last things Id consider.

Although I found joy doing all the stuff listed above, these last quarantine months have been specially hard, I cant even get out of my house and the feeling of ""elder wizard looking at a crystal ball"" has intensified greatly, to the point where I dont want to do anything, I dont want to play, I dont want to see documentaries, I dont want to read the books I hacve about the precolumbine Americas and I feel just void sometimes.

Idk if anyone will get here but if you do, wow you are patient, also, Idk how anyone can help me at this point, I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist but any kind of help will be welcome. thanks in advance to the (most certainly) only soul that will get through all of that.",28May2020,1
229,"Maryland, USA

This morning I received a strange “spam” email that passed my spam filters followed by an email from Microsoft with a confirmation email of an order placed on my account. I saw the email come in and was suspicious so instead of clicking the link in the email I logged into my Microsoft account and looked at my orders. Sure enough an order had been place for $2700 (laptop and surface pen) just like the email said. I did not make this order and was very surprised! The address it was supposed to be shipped to was about 10 minutes from my house but it had my name on it! While I was looking up the order my phone was buzzing like crazy. Tons of “spam” emails coming in. 1-3 a minute (for about 40 minutes). All bypassing my spam filter on gmail. When I looked closely, these emails were not spam at all! They were legitimate companies. An email about signing up for Monster, Etsy, Hedge-Funds, and Russian, Chinese and other languages I did not pick up on. This explains why they got through my spam filter. When I logged back into my Microsoft account to see who paid for this massive order, I see a card with my name on it, but another address (an office building) this time about a 7 minute drive from my house. The only other bit of information said the card was a visa that ended in four numbers that were shown to me but did not match up with any of my credit or debit cards. Having now realized what was happening I deleted the email address associated with the Microsoft account (because it was an old one I did not use anymore, but it used to have all of its emails forwarded to my main inbox). This is when the emails stopped. 90 minutes later I called up Microsoft to try and cancel the order. I was bounced around several departments over half an hour and then the call ended. I think the lady said someone was going to call me back but I wasn’t sure. They weren’t helpful at all. I filed an identity theft report with the FTC and then called the police. I let the police know all the details including the two addresses I saw. At around 6pm I pulled a credit report and saw no new inquiries or accounts across all three bureaus. Around this time I see that the package has been shipped (fml) and I record the tracking number. I have since put fraud alerts and credit freezes on all three bureaus and now requested that the package be returned on Microsoft’s website but that requires it being delivered and then shipped back. I have since made a UPS my choice account with the address where the package was being shipped so I could track its location much better and maybe even have it delivered to a ups store so the thieves don’t get it. 

Plan of action: 

1.) call up ups tomorrow and see where I get with them and see what they can do. I’m just worried that I don’t have much standing because as of right now, It wasn’t my credit card used and It isn’t being shipped to me. It just happens to be through my account and have my name on everything. 

2.) Run another credit report. 

Questions:

1.) How bad of an idea was it to make the ups my choice account for an address that is not mine?

2.) what else can I do to check if there was a bank account made under my name?

3.) Can I get in legal trouble if I sit at the house, wait for it to be delivered, then take a video of whoever picks up the package? I will call the police when it will soon be delivered but they said they can’t have someone sitting there all day. 

4.) what else can I do? Tips are surely useful.

5.) if the police fall through and it is delivered and I pick up the package and mail it back to Microsoft, how much doo-doo will I potentially be in? Is this a bad idea?

Notes:

1.) time is of the essence here. This all happened on May 27th and it is now 12:00am May 28th. The package is supposed to be delivered on May 29th.

2.) I am frantically trying to get the police to pick up the package so it can be returned. In case it ends up being a bank account or credit card in my name, I want that $2700 refunded! 

3.) I drove by the house where it was supposed to be delivered and there were no cars in the driveway and I saw someone in the living room (10:00pm) 

4.) this seems to be deliberate and not an accident or glitch on Microsoft’s part based on the spam emails. 

5.) I don’t have very much money so this $2700 will hit me hard. That is why I am adamant",28May2020,1
230,"After graduating it felt like my school kicked me into a dark and deep well with nothing but a piece of paper, leaving me to scratch at the surface hoping someone would pass and throw a rope down for me. My school did not in all my 4 years prepare me for my next step. My parents never went to college - they never had to experience this and because of that they have no advice to give me other than “find a job, it’s not that difficult”. 
For 4 years I have studied my ass off and walked away with a bachelors degree in biology. I originally wanted to be a dentist but since have changed my mind. I don’t want to spend the money or time on going back to school when I am not 100% sure on what path I want to take. I have no idea what I can do with my degree and no one has helped with the options I need to weigh. 
I’ve applied to countless jobs and have not had luck. I feel discouraged and the worst part is that most places will not even give me 2 minutes of time unless I have A, B and C experience. How am I going to get experience if no one is willing to hire and let me learn? 
I’ve been working at a swim school for 6 years (and am now a manager). That job helped me through Highschool and college. I worked full time while enrolled in 16-20 credits per semester. Although I love my job, I feel like I’ve outgrown it and it is time for me to start my career and do something related to what I’ve gone to school for.

231,"This “friend” I’ve had for my entire life has within the past couple years completely changed what our relationship used to be. A couple years ago they completely shut me out of their life. wouldn’t return any calls/texts/snaps/dms, yet constantly showed that they were seeing it. We’re both 21M, I went off to college which helped me to forget about them until he saw how nice the college town I was at was, then finally decided to reach out so he could come up for a weekend and hang out and go to some parties. I thought he genuinely wanted to hang with me, and at first it seemed like that, however, after that weekend he shut me out once again. He then proceeded to only contact me when he felt like it I guess. Once in while he’ll just ask to hang out randomly and come up to my place, but it seems not to hang with me but to have his own fun in the town I attend college at. It seems like whenever a mutual friend asks to hang out in a group chat (when I’m back in my hometown like now) he says yes but he’ll bail or not respond to texts when we’re about to go out and just not go. He’s been a life long friend, I don’t want to forget about him, but I also don’t want him to take advantage of me by only ever contacting me when it’s convenient for him/so he can have a good time. 

So any tips on how to move on from him/stop thinking about it?

235,"My (23F) best friend (22F) and I have been friends since we were in eighth grade, have known each other since third, I love her dearly, and she is more than family to me. The biggest issue we have in our friendship is that I am the only friend she vents her problems to, and it puts a strain on me. It is not that I don't want to be there for her, I just cannot always deal with her issues and my own, as well as my other friends in a consistent manner. It makes me bitter with her when it becomes too overwhelming, and it has been the reason why we have gone a few days, or weeks, without talking to her. I want to be there for her, but it is an unhealthy amount imo how much she relies on me, and when I have mentioned this in the past, she acknowledges it and apologizes it, but slowly drifts back into doing it. The biggest problem is that this happens mostly with dating issues she goes through, I will listen to her rant and vent about men, and then give her solid, logical advice, which she does not listens to and then she comes back around and tells me how I was right all along. She does this with everything, and I, personally, cannot tolerate giving advice to people who ignore it and continue the problem that frustrates them. I listen to her vent, but then when she asks for my opinion, she acknowledges that it's the logical choice, and then does the complete opposite.

Today, he gave me a call a literally only said ""thank you for all, goodbye"" and hang up. I called him back, and he didnt answer, so i panicked and called his mother who explained to me that he was ok. Later he explained to me (apparently, nothing hapenned, he just ""felt like thanking me for no reason"") 
The thing is that this is not the first time something like this happens, actually, its been 3 years now since he invented this kind filosofy for his life in wich suicide is just ok and other things related to death. Now, everytime i try to adress this in a ""safe"" way (for example, talking about getting help) he just calls me an idiot because of this and says that i should not get involved in his private life and that im blinded because of my ""distorded and paranoick ways of seeing things"". 
I honestly dont know if his family knows about this, but i've been thinking about telling it to his parents because i dont know if there is anything else i can do for him. The only thing i know is that his dad is kind of an asshole and even if he knew he would just do nothing about it but i still feel like i should do it.

239,"i’ve been dating this guy for a week now. we’ve hung out almost every day the last week and it’s been nice and all having someone who wants to spend time with me, but he does these little things that irritate me.

like today, we were laying down in my bed and i was very tired but apparently he wanted to do sexy stuff and i kinda let him but i also felt like i couldn’t say no which really freaked me out. i ended up asking him to stop and he did and we just kept cuddling. but he kept doing these things like kissing my face, moving around a lot, messing with my toes, breathing really heavily in my ear, unintentionally pulling my hair, sucking on my nipples, pressing his dick in my ass. and all the other days, i would’ve totally been into that, but today i was super fucking annoyed and irritated. i just wanted to lay down with him and cuddle and fall asleep.

241,"I f(18) was raised by my two loving parents who are upper middle class, white, conservative, and catholic who adopted me when I was just a baby. I (also white and Native American) have always been grateful for the life I’ve been given, knowing that my birth parents live in their car. Now that I’m almost 19 I’ve been thinking a lot about my future and what I want for myself as an adult, and I definitely want bio kids, but I also would love to be able to adopt a child too. I want to give a child that needs a home a home, no matter what race or gender or anything.

Being from the home I am from and being a young mostly white looking girl, I have always been comfortable with cops. Never scared of them, never afraid for my life, never worried about anything and in fact, I always trusted cops and believed in the system. 

Today I watched George Floyd, a suspect of a non violent crime, be murdered by 4 police officers in Minneapolis. The officer put his knee on his neck and I watched that officer slowly and painfully kill that poor, poor man who was begging for his life. I am disgusted and horrified. I’ve known that there was a problem with the system, I’ve known that there are racist police officers who target people of color or at least don’t cut them any slack or even listen to their side. I’ve always know there was a problem with the system. I’ve prayed for victims. But after seeing what those horrible idiots did to that man, I can’t trust cops anymore. 

How can I possibly raise a child - of any race - knowing there are evil, horrible, awful people who will do this. 

I am so afraid for myself, my friends, my family, my future children. I’m not sure who thought it was a good idea to put their knee on his neck but they should be thrown in jail. For life. 

That. Was. Cold. Blooded. Murder. 

Any moron with half a brain KNOWS the neck is a very fragile and dangerous part of the body. Everyone knows you never aim for the neck unless wishing DEATH upon someone. Why on earth would this cop do this, if not with the intention of killing him.

This man was not even resisting. He was just struggling on the floor, slowing dying, begging for help. 

I have cried for hours upon hours and I have prayed for hours for this man and for his friends and family. 

I have begged God for an explanation. I can’t understand how people could do this to one another. It breaks my heart and destroys my faith in humanity and in the American justice system. 

To the friends family and loved ones of George Floyd, I am so sorry for your loss, and I pray that those horrible men are thrown in jail. And I pray for the sake of all Americans that this never happens again, and that America gets it together and protects its people from racial injustice and police brutality. 

I need to know genuinely how to move past this, I need to know how am I supposed to be a parent one day when my child could be in danger from the very thing that is supposed to protect them, I need to know how to not fear police. 

How can I have faith in the system when this happens?",28May2020,1
243,"Long time lurker here finally making the plunge and posting.  I've got a lot to unpack and really appreciate any help/advice you may have as I  am feeling quite overwhelmed and lost...  


My mom (58F) has many medical issues and even more issues in general.  Her biggest medical  challenge right now is that cervical spine at C3 and C4 joints are compressed and pressing on her spinal cord, she has a lot of pain and other issues related to this.  She has been referred for surgery, but it's yet to be scheduled.  She's also facing advanced osteoporosis, arthritis, and general weakness/fragility (she has to use a  walker and struggles to complete every day tasks).  Sometimes it seems  she just has bad luck... only a few days ago she had unexpected  emergency surgery to remove her appendix.  And then there's the reality  that my mom has been enemy #1 of her health.  She's been an alcoholic my  (28F) entire life and it has been especially bad the past 7 years (DUI,  missed Christmas after Christmas, passed out when I visit, etc...).   She smokes cigarettes heavily.  She's been underweight and undernourished for many  years now (5'5"" and always under 100 lbs).  She doesn't consistently see  her doctors or follow-up.  She's depressive, emotionally manipulative, and has an addictive, drug  seeking personality.  She has gone to the emergency room 6+ times in the  past 12 months and checked herself out against doctors orders every  time.  It all makes her medical care very difficult.  
 

But my mom  is legitimately struggling to care for herself at home with all her  medical challenges.  She can't drive, use stairs, shower safely, prepare  food.  She lives with her long term boyfriend/my step dad, but their  relationship has always been 50/50% love and verbal abuse (been like  that for 20 years long before she was disabled).  And at this point my  step dad is done with dealing with her shit and he's made it abundantly  clear in her care and attitude towards her.  He barely helps her, so my  my mom goes weeks between showers and never leaves the house.  Her life  revolves around a recliner chair where she starts and ends her days and  spends all her time in between.  She can get around in the house with  her walker, but if she's been drinking her disability goes from bad to  all consuming, so much so that she wets herself.  


I don't have a  good relationship with my mom.  Her long term alcoholism and emotional  abuse haven't exactly made for rosy feelings towards her.  Moving across  the country away from home was the best thing I ever did for my mental  health, it also means I am mostly dealing with matters related to my mom  over the phone.  At this point I just feel pity and obligation towards  my mom, but these weigh on me heavily because my mom is basically on her  own.  I am her only child and the only relative that lives near my mom  is my elderly grandfather.  I know she won't help herself and no one  else will (she's driven everyone off) and that these are self-inflicted,  but I struggle knowing this means she lives in abject suffering and  worsening health.  I absolutely am not in a position to support my mom  or take her in and no one else would be willing.  I try my best to  provide medical guidance and talk to her doctors, but getting the  straight story and keeping my mom on track is often impossible.  Even  just these efforts mean hours and hours of time lost on the phone for me  and stress and sadness and frustration.  


What I really think my mom needs is an  assisted living situation or nursing home. She legitimately needs help  caring for herself, she's not safe at home.  I think in this positive,  facilitated environment she might actually be able to regain some  strength and mental wellness.  My mom is on Medicaid but far from  Medicare age. She applied for disability many years ago and was  rejected, she never reapplied (like I said, her follow up is very poor)  and at this point she's easily 7+ years since she last worked. For  assets she partially owns the house she lives in with her boyfriend and  that's about it, no savings or retirement or anything like that.  House  is a wreck (leaking roof, reeks of cigarettes).  If anyone has some  guidance on how I might facilitate medical care for my mom given these  challenges, I could really use the advice.  


TLDR: My mom has significant, disabling health issues as well as an addictive/difficult personality,  she's at the point she needs assisted living but because of her age  (58) I am unsure what options there are.  She is on medicaid but not disability.",28May2020,1
244,"Both my girlfriend and I are in our late teens. 

My feelings for her haven’t been very strong lately because our relationship dynamic changes every time she gets anxious about anything.

245,"For context, here's a few facts about me:

* Teen, still living with my parents
* I have a three-year-old sister
* I've been vegan since I was ten years old
* Everyone else in my family couldn't care less about living things that aren't humans
* I don't kill. Ever. That includes ants, flies, spiders, and mosquitoes. I do *not* kill and my parents know this. 
* I have a nature-based religion. Everyone else in my family is unflinchingly atheistic.  

Since our parents don't care what they do to animals if they don't like said animals, I've been putting in a lot of effort to de-train my sister from doing things like chasing turkeys, yelling at squirrels, killing carpenter ants, etc. This makes them incredibly mad, and I really would appreciate some insight as to why. My theory is that they feel I'm challenging their beliefs in some way, or maybe forcing my beliefs unto them. 

The specific instance that prompted me to write this post happened today. My dad swatted a mosquito on my arm. Usually, I either let them drink my blood (I bet they're hungry) or I blow them away. Needless to say, I screamed as soon as that happened. My own father killed a living being, and their life was lost *on my arm.* I mean, how surreal is that? But my attempts to explain why that shouldn't happen were met with anger and frustration, and they moved the conversation to a place where my sister couldn't hear my protests.

I guess what I'm asking is, from a parental standpoint, what are some possible reasons to discourage this behavior and shield it from my sister, and how can I change their minds? (Or, alternatively, *should* I change their minds)

247,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I am not sure where else to go. I'm sorry about the long post too. I (f/49) live on my own in a flat that is part of a bigger house, in which my landlords live. I get along really well with them, they are like family now. We aren't in each pockets, I'm kinda in one ""wing"" and have my own area, etc. but am free to use all the grounds. The place is semi-rural, out of town on a property so they employ a local man to come and help with the gardening, maintenance, etc. I don't have that much to do with him as I work full time and aren't usually here when he is but we've chatted in the past, I'm always friendly and say hi when I see him, give his dog treats etc. 

Today I came home from work early and he was here, I could see he was doing some gardening with my landlord. His dog came over for a treat so he also wandered over and we chatted for a couple of minutes then he went on his way.  Later, when he was leaving, he came and knocked on my door, which isn't usual - he's only done it once before just to ask if he could fill up my dog's bowl outside with water for his dog. No probs. Today though he says that he wanted to apologise for the comment he made earlier. I said I wasn't sure what he meant and he said ""when we were talking before, I made a comment under my breath and now I feel bad about it"". I was a bit taken aback as I didn't hear the original comment and because I was shocked, as I said, I've always been friendly. I just said ""oh, okay, well I didn't hear it but I appreciate you coming to apologise"". He just apologised again then went on his way. 

That was about an hour ago and I can't stop thinking about it or shake this horrible feeling. I don't know what the comment was. I know that my last comment to him in the conversation though innocent, was something that he could have added something inappropriate to, but I don't know. I'd also started to get ready to go for a run and had a sports bra on but just an old T-shirt so I was probably showing a bit more cleavage than I would normally (I hadn't changed into the top I usually run in, which is not as revealing), so I don't know if it was about that. I just don't know. Now I don't know what to do - do I ask him next time what he said? Do I say something to my landlords? I'm acutely aware of the dangers that women face in weird situations but then thing, he apologised....I actually felt bad for him. But now I'm also kinda scared, which I hate because I'm not someone who is like this, but I feel that I shouldn't ignore this gut feeling too. Because the place is isolated, I am often wary at night because my part of the property is a distance from the landlords and there are lots of trees etc.  I also leave my door open when I'm at work because my landlords are still usually here and we are down several private roads and a long driveway - no one accidentally comes here.

I recently came across a post on r/LifeProTips which brought to mind this issue that I've been having for YEARS. By YEARS, I mean noticing that it started wayyyy before I actually hit puberty and it's been bugging me (and everyone else around me) for such a long time.

If any of you want to know for context, I'm 21F. I've been trying all sorts of ways to get rid of this problem, which includes:
- deodorant
- anti-bacterial wet wipes
- tea tree oil
- home remedies such as drinking lemonade and boiled water with parsley soaked in it???

I can smell myself like 99.9% of the time, even when I shower/step out of the shower and had scrubbed myself vigorously with all kinds of soap available to me in the bathroom. I sweat really easily (even in an air-conditioned room) and my top will usually have multiple sweat patches within an hour. It doesn't help that I live in a tropical country.

As a result of this, I feel self-conscious everytime I go out and also try to refrain from walking/sitting close to another person, preferring to keep my distance at all times. I can't really explain when some of my friends question me about why I don't like getting/giving hugs to them whenever we see each other. I really want to get rid of this problem once and for all, and I've already visited a doctor who told me to watch my diet and exercise more (which I don't think works because I've tried and it isn't getting better). The second reason is due to heredity, in which I might have gotten it from my dad who has a similar problem but milder than mine. Reddit, is there any possible permanent solution to this?",28May2020,1

252,"So, I don’t speak to my dad often because he cheated on my mother and is now remarried. Frankly, I don’t like the guy and have never had a relationship with him. The one thing he always promised me and my siblings was that he would pay for our college. Three weeks ago, we received letters from our dad. Instead of him giving us a phone call, he simply sent us letters like we were a business transaction to let us know he couldn’t pay for our college. Basically his wife told him to stop paying for it. So yeah this was the first any of us had heard of it. I had no time to prepare for this. Since then he has not said a word to any of us about it. Now I am only have couple of months before returning my senior year to college. We looked into FASFA but it still isn’t enough to cover. I am so depressed and sad because I will have to leave all of my friends and I won’t get to graduate with them because my mom keeps telling me I need to look at cheaper options. I’m just worried I’ll have no social life and my life will basically be over before it’s really even begun. What do I do?

259,"I’ve been living in an apartment for 3 years. I was one of the first to move in when they were first built. Since then, neighbors who have stayed long term have come and gone. I’m a big advocate for it’s okay to never communicate or come into contact with a neighbor unless we pass by eachother in the morning or evening to just say hello. It’s the usual because everyone here has jobs so it’s RARE to run into a neighbor. (There are only 6 apartments). 
These new neighbors have been here for about 9 months and I hate to say it but they’re awful. #3 and #6 live across from eachother and hang around outside for hours, drinking, playing music. Ever since they moved in they would mostly do it on weekends and I would just let it slide. Let em have a good time it’s the weekend ya know. I wouldn’t mind at all if it was during the day, BUT AT 11 pm ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Tonight I finally had enough and I called my local police. They never came. Am I surprised? Nope. They’ve been doing it more and more, weekdays and weekends. I sound like a goddamn Karen lol but in this case I don’t care if I am being a Karen. Not just me, but other people have work in the morning too. How can they be so inconsiderate of others? Middle aged men have nothing better to do than to stand around stroking each others ego, drinking shitty beer and listening to rancheros at 11pm on a Wednesday night. 
I’ve asked them to keep it down a couple times before,
I’ve told the landlord a couple times (I don’t want to be a burden to him though so I stopped),
Tonight was the first time I called the cops.
If nothing comes of it and they keep doing this I don’t know what else to do. (Also I’m not a confrontational person cause I have pretty bad anxiety :/ I was shaking even when I was calling the cops) 
Any advice? 
Be petty?
Move?
Go Karen 10,000%?

260,"I’ll try to keep this to the point. Also on mobile. 
My ex broke up with me around 2.5 years ago. It was serious enough that we had lived together for about 2 years before the break up, so when I moved out there was some of his stuff mixed up with mine. He did most of the packing himself as he wanted me in the house as little as possible while moving my stuff out, so I wasn’t able to go through everything as much as I would have liked. Fast forward to this past weekend. I was cleaning out a jewelry box and found a set of his dog tags. For anyone that doesn’t know these have his name and more importantly his full SSN on them. 

I wanted to mail them back to him because *identity theft is not a joke, Jim*, and they are his property. Also, I wouldn’t have felt right just throwing them away for someone to find. I tried reaching out to a few mutual friends, but after the break up they lost contact with him. I haven’t had any contact for over 2 years. So here’s where I need the advice. Do I keep trying to make contact and get a mailing address, say screw it, I tried, and throw them away, or attempt to destroy them myself? Am I way over thinking this?",28May2020,1

262,"Back in my teenage days, drinking was my go-to way to have fun. I never got hangovers no matter how drunk I got, being drunk was fun and I felt invincible. But now that I’m an adult, things have changed. I hate drinking now. My family who I’m very close with (one cousin in particular) just turned 21 and constantly wants me to drink with her. She doesn’t understand why I don’t like it and I don’t know how to explain this to people because they get the idea that I’m shaming them for drinking, which I’m not. I don’t care if others drink at all, do what you want man. But for me it makes me feel like complete shit now. And my cousin gets pissed at me everytime and thinks I’m an asshole. But now when I drink, I immediately feel horribly dizzy, nauseous, I get a migraine, I feel like I get tunnel vision and if I’m drunk I immediately regret it and panic because I want to be sober immediately. I can’t enjoy myself with it anymore. I’m not sure what changed. I’m a young adult, I turn 21 soon. And I dread it because I know everyone will want to take me out to drink to celebrate and I will be expected to drink because I’m 21. I don’t know how I’ll avoid that. I’m bad at telling people no. I’m bad at standing up for myself and end up giving in and I hate that about myself. I guess I’m looking for advice on ways to avoid drinking when I’m expected to.

263,"So here’s the story.

Recently about 4 months ago I found out the girl I was with for 10 years cheated on me and did a plethora of awful things to me, even after I figured it out. I was so depressed. Needless to say I still kind of am.

I quit my job for a while, I had no motivation. I was consumed. I tried to hangout with friends, tried to suppress it with activities, yet nothing helped.

I’m in somewhat of a better place now, I still don’t feel like me and everything just feels different. I don’t have many friends as my girlfriend was pretty much my life. My fault, yes I know. It hurt. Believe me.

I got my old job offered back, but truth be told, I can’t stand it. I kind of always didn’t go after my dream because I was doing what was best for us in the relationship, and neglecting myself. I live with my mom again, I’m 22 by the way. I don’t really have any bills to pay besides my car and insurance. I feel like a bum for living at my moms, and it eats at me.

I’m tempted to just say fuck it, quit this job I hate and start living life how I want to. I’ve always had someone looking over my shoulder influencing my decision and have never fully engaged myself in my own happiness. I’m sick of it. The job I want requires me to do a little bit more studying, and that would take some time for me to do. I feel like this is the only time in my life where I can utilize not having to worry about much except for getting where I want in life.

Should I just go for my dreams? Quit my job and go to school? I’ve never been alone before and everything is so weird. I just want to be happy. And I feel like this is the way to go. Any advice at all is helpful. Thank you so much.",28May2020,1

265,"**I am likely to be homeless soon. All I’ll have is my car, my laptop, my phone, some chargers, a credit card &amp; bank account with under $200, some clothes and a couple snacks if I can snatch them before being forced out. I am 19 &amp; male.**

There’s a lot of backstory to everything which would make this all make sense, but I’m just gonna explain the surface hoping I can get the advice I need.

The gist of it -

My parents are likely to physically kick me out soon. Been trying to prevent this from happening but the ice is becoming far too thin.

I also have a very hateful stalker that I have been dealing with for the past couple years. Has always been a problem - and at some point became more of a stalker than a bully, and continued to disturbingly become more obsessed from there. That story is even more confusing to explain.

Been trying to prevent myself getting kicked out during quarantine, but my stalker is speeding up that process.

Where do homeless people go? I am unable to go to any of my friends’ places, despite most of them being 20-21 and some with their own apartments, because they are all on good terms with my parents. Nobody is aware of the way my parents truly are.

Staying at one of their places would also put them and their families/roommates at risk, because of my stalker.

I have chosen the homeless route. On New Year’s Eve my friend from high school with Asperger’s was targeted and blackmailed by my stalker, and that friend took her own life. My stalker humiliated my friend to her parents (who I now suspect were similar to mine) and that is what I suppose pushed her past the edge, given other problems in her life.

I do not wish to have any more friends tangled in my mess. Parents &amp; my stalker both agree that people who are “different” (basically anything ranging from mental illness to being LGBT+ to literally just being kinda unique) are inhuman.

My parents have mercy for me because I’m their son but they gave up taking care of me when I was 9, and neglected me. And then became abusive. Gave me a chance but they stand me at all so tried to hate me into someone they could love. Didn’t work (turns out I have ADHD. Was diagnosed at 14 but my parents withheld any form of treatment and didn’t even tell me I had it until I was 18)

My stalker doesn’t have that blood connection with me and hates me with a strong passion.

Fully aware this might not make sense - thought I should point that out. The actions of my parents &amp; my stalker are not rational at all. No point in going insane trying to understand insane people.

My safety is in the hands of two people who do not care for me much at all, and my safety is being threatened by an absolutely sadistic and sociopathic person who has been responsible for two suicides in her life - one of them being my friend - and holds those unnecessary deaths as achievements. 

Everything I hold valuable is being torn apart. Social life, romantic life, college life, home life - it’s all being taken.

I am proud to say I have made a positive impact of the lives of many people. Proud to say that my unique personality &amp; creativity which had me neglected and abused is what has made so many people fall in love with who I am today.

Losing everything... to a stalker. Parents encouraging this downfall. Story of my life feels like a movie. Like a poorly written thriller where the antagonists have ridiculously unrealistic motives. But it’s not a film. Or a book. Or a video game. It’s my life. Guess I’m just super unlucky to come across a person as twisted as my parents. What are the bloody odds?

267,"I'm really pissed off about this situation right now. I had to experience it, then i spent 30 minutes writing an r/amitheasshole post cause I feel angry about it, but I'm not sure if i did the right thing, only for it to be removed for being too long. I'm coming here with the post from there to 1) see if I'm the asshole, and 2) get advice for what to do. That's why the post asks ""AITA"" a couple of times.

I know that question seems kinda like a quick answer. You don't learn anything from getting the answers given to you but this is a whole ordeal that i have to go into. This might be long, I'll try my best to simplify it but I have a story to tell. Without further to do, let's dive into why I am or am not the asshole.

Me and my good friend Jake (fake name) have been friends for about 4 years. We've had our ups and downs but ultimately we get along and have a great time together. He usually struggles with his work. I try to help him the best I can but now with quarantine and online learning, it's like stabbing a knife into our friendship. As I said he wasn't the best with homework. He got assignments done, but they were late. But now with online work, it's easier than ever to share your answers with eachother.

I want to be a good friend so when he asked for help I was there. But then he started to ask for my answers. I tried to help in other ways but not wanting to ruin the friendship, i sent him my work. Whenever I said that I just want to help him, he gets mad. Sometimes to the point of just leaving the work for the next day, then going to sleep and then not doing the work the next day. It all kinda climaxed for me when 1) he sent me a paragraph from a website so i could read it all and give him the answers, and 2) when he asked for the answers for a chart we had to fill up about ourselves. I knew that he wasn't really reading the instructions, he went to the work, got confused, then came to me to ask for answers. I refused. I told him in these exact words ""I'm sorry but I shouldn't give you the answers. It does the compete opposite of helping you cause you won't have the information if you need it when the next assignment comes along"" and he didn't care. He said things like ""i don't care, i need the answers, I'm behind on work. Give me the answers"" but i kept saying no.

He finally accepted it and I tried my absolute hardest to help him catch up, and help him do the work. I told him what to do, how to do it, repeated the instructions when they were right there on the page he was working on. This all came to a crashing stop today. Just about an hour ago. He messaged me at 10, saying ""we didn't talk about homework today"" so i start asking what he's working on and what you have to do. He sends me a screenshot of the work and I'm like ""bet, this was an easy assignment. No problem."" I. Was. Dead. Fucking. Wrong. He quickly gets confused about why there are boxes with arrows so i try to explain. ""The arrows link a topic to an empty box, then link that empty box to another topic. The box is meant for you to answer how topic 1 effects topic 2."" He kept saying ""what?"" ""I don't get it."" ""Huh?"" So, i kept explaining, in finding different ways to try to describe it as simple as possible. He gets really upset and says ""i literally don't know how to breathe I'm mentally wrong."" This is where I might be the asshole. I ask him what he wants me to do, he says ""just give me the answers so i can sleep."" I say ""I'm not giving you the answers, it doesn't help you"" he gets mad. He starts asking about what will help him, and says ""what will help me? you endlessly telling me that it wont help me?""

 I get a little pissed off cause I'm trying my hardest to help him understand so he can get better grades and do the work so he can learn. I tell him ""if you keep asking for the answers, i have to keep repeating that it isn't gonna help. If you don't believe in yourself, you won't be able to do it."" I might've gone wrong there. I was just trying to get him to believe in himself but he got mad. ""God. That's kind. I can't rely on anyone but you. And you ask why I can't rely on you."" He said. He says he has 40 minutes and I still offer my help. He talks about hair falling out, i say ""my hair falls out too"" and that makes him more angry. I say ""what do you want me to say?"" ""the answers you fucking numbnut"" ""it won't help you."" He then spams ""give me the answers"" and i say no. He then talks about a drama I've been having. He says ""when you talked about it, i kept getting annoyed. Did I ever say it to you?"" But i never said anything about this being annoying. At all. Not once. Zero. Zip. Nada. 

I try to get him to focus on stuff that makes him happy so he could calm down. He gets more mad. He then says ""fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you."" I say ""me?"" He says ""you really wanna see me die don't you?"" (He was saying if i don't give him the answers it contributes to his stress that will kill him.) I say ""i don't want that"" he says ""then give me the answers"" i say ""it won't help you"" he says ""dude, you're messed up man. Good night and fuck you.""

I think he's wrong here and if i am wrong, it's really unintentional. I'm trying to help him and giving him the answers doesn't help in the way he thinks it does. So tell me reddit, AITA? What should I do?",28May2020,1

272,"ok so please hear me out because what you’re about to hear is very very wrong on my part. however, i’m just very worried about the consequences right now. basically, a few nights ago i met this guy on this app where teens can meet other teens, and i think on his profile it said he was 17 as well with several pictures of himself. upon accepting his friend request, he asked if i was interested in sending him a few nudes for money. i don’t know what i was thinking at the time but it was a good amount of money so i was just like why not. so i got his snapchat, and just to prove he’d follow through he sent me the first half of the money upfront. he said he’d pay the rest after i sent so i sent whatever he asked for in the chat (after making sure he wouldn’t save them) and when he was finally satisfied i asked him to send the rest. but he asked if he could have my instagram first. i told him no because it was personal, and he started becoming very hostile and rude. i kept telling him no, and then out of nowhere he started screenshotting the whole conversation and saving everything i sent to camera roll. i started panicking and telling him to stop but he kept saying he wouldn’t until i gave him my instagram. then he continued to try to blackmail me by saying he’d delete them only if i sent more. he said if i didn’t, he’d post on instagram, facebook, twitter, and youtube?? i tried my very best to convince him this wasn’t a good idea but he ended up eventually blocking me. he doesn’t know my last name or where i live, but if he googled my snap username he’d be able to link it to my instagram account. also, he spoke very poor english so i’m guessing he lived on a different continent. he also was making up strange things like that he could find my location through cashapp, so that made me think it was just a scare tactic and he wouldn’t actually post my stuff anywhere. however, i’m still very nervous and can’t stop thinking about it. this definitely taught me a lesson and im never going to send to anyone ever again. i just really need some outside advice. :(",28May2020,1
275,"I am (21F) and I live with my mom and three younger siblings. My sister 17F and my brother 10M have been constantly bickering for about four years now, they used to always play and have fun before that. They were really close until my sister got more into her teen years. About last year it became worse. They will fight almost every day and my brother always yells he hates her and wishes she lived with my dad or her boyfriend (side note: my brother is very jealous of him and they've been dating almost a year). But that's not all, my brother always throws tantrums if I tell him no to something or if I take his game when curfew comes. He even punched the wall a few days ago when my mom said he couldn't get on his game. 

Today my brother and sister went swimming and my brother was splashing water in her face and saying he was going to drown her. This isn't the only time he's said something like this, he's treated to stab her a few times and wished she'd move out. 

My mom (39F) is starting to piss me off. Sure, she'll punish him, get on him for yelling at my sister, but she doesn't punish him enough in my opinion. She'll take his game for a day or two and she gives in to letting him get on his game right after he had a attitude or yells when asked to get on his game. When it comes to threats, she is just dismissive. She'll just say ""he'll grow out of it"" or ""he's a little kid"". I don't think my brother will actually harm my sister, he's really sensitive and pretty much a crybaby. But it's still concerning. I've suggested therapy several times, but I feel like she doesn't take me seriously. 

I'm very concerned about this now because I'm moving in about two months, five hours away and I don't want it to get any worse. They're going to have to take care of my 11M special needs brother and our puppy more when I leave and I want them to get along. My dad and his siblings are barley close and I don't want my brother and sister to be like that. 

Any advice on what I can do?

276,"I’ll try to make this short, my (25F) mom (58F) struggled with substance abuse from a young age until she had me at 32, then relapsed again in her early 50s, and is now clean. She also had a god awful childhood full of abuse. Now, she has quite a few behavioral issues mostly boiling down to immaturity and insecurity. She’s been physically abusive to me when I was a child, but slowed down once I got too big to push around, and resorted to being mostly verbally nasty, but would still become enraged and hit me sometimes. I’ve only ever hit her back once, she’s disabled and I could really hurt her if I fought back, so I dealt with it. She hasn’t gotten physical with me in about three years now (mostly because I’ve been moved out for three years) She’s not like this all the time, but she’s pretty easy to trigger. All in all I think my mom is deep down a good person, but has a LOT of unresolved issues. She still denies hitting me as a child even though my aunt walked in on her strangling me when I was 8. The physical abuse would happen probably once a month on average, but she’s verbally nasty almost daily. 

Now that I’ve been moved out, I have been able to set clear boundaries and my mother pushes them all the time. For example, keeping the front door shut is my number one rule to keep my cats safely inside and I explicitly state this to every new guest and my mom knows this very well as I talk about it a lot. She was at my place helping me bake pies for thanksgiving and it got HOT with the oven running all day, and I was rolling out some crust and I turn around to find her standing at my front door holding it wide open. 

I told her “dude you know the rules, keep that door shut” 

she replied “I’m cooling off the house!” 

“No! Shut. The. Door.” 

She continued to argue with me until I had to go physically take the door out of her hand and shut it myself. She then raised her fist at me and I demanded that she leave. This was a HUGE deal for me, and she knows how important that rule is to me, she just doesn’t think my rules apply to her. 

Bottom line: she does whatever she wants, acts like a scolded child when she faces consequences, and still doesn’t learn. I’ve never had a great relationship with her, but now that her health is in decline and she’s becoming more disabled, I want to just sort of deal with her crap (excluding allowing her to hit me or disrespect my property/rules) because my gut tells me that if I put my foot down now, I’m going to regret it once she’s gone. Also, I’m an only child and all she has, she’s hugely insecure about her appearance and intelligence (which are age appropriate for her, she’s not ugly or stupid) so she refuses to attempt a social life. We frequently have arguments because she wants to make assumptions about my life and when I politely correct her, she takes it personally as if I’m calling her stupid, crazy, or whatever, accuses me of starting a fight, calls me names, and hangs up on me. This happens OFTEN in nearly the same pattern every time. She asks why I can’t just say “okay, mom” and I tell her it’s because I don’t want her to have misconceptions about me, I want her to know the truth. 

For instance last night, we argued about the air conditioning in my car which is broken. 

“When are you going to get it fixed??”

“Oh I have a coupon for a discounted A/C service so I’ll be doing it soon”

“So you just don’t care that you’re going to die in your hot car???” 

“...like I said, I have a coupon and I’m going to-“

“See?! All you ever do is argue with me! Just say ‘okay mom’ and I’ll drop it!”

Later we will talk about our frights and she will break down about how bad of a mom she feels and she just wants the best for me, which seems true because we only fight about things that “will make my life better”. I think she’s just misguided and full of emotional problems. 

You get it. Now my problem is like I said, I really feel strongly that if I put my foot down and not tolerate it, she will just be miserable until she dies, and I’m going to feel guilty about it forever. My gut tells me to just “say okay mom” so she can live the last few years of her life feeling happy, and I will be at peace with it. I can tolerate it, I’ve been dealing with it forever, but since I know it’s not healthy I’ve been trying to break the cycle, and it’s just made things worse. She has agreed to therapy, it’s just delayed until the end of this pandemic. I do want to clarify, she’s not terminally ill, but she’s pretty disabled, obese, long history of drug abuse, basically no will to live, and she says things like “I know I won’t make it through my 60s”. If she had the will to live I wouldn’t take this as seriously, but she’s attempted suicide in the past and I know she would give up and die given the chance. 

People who have had similar issues, I need insight. 

Also, I have NO issues creating and maintaining boundaries with anyone else, this is mostly about how I’m going to feel about our relationship and her happiness once she’s gone. I don’t want to have regrets.",28May2020,1
277,"I know this is kind of stupid but I don't really know where else to look. I lived in a dorm previously but due to current events I moved to live with some family members about two weeks ago. They adopted a puppy back in March. I brought my dog (~10yo) when I moved. Back on campus, my dog was very active and happy and she engaged with me and ate her food regularly. Since we've been here and I've started interacting with the puppy, my dog has changed. Sometimes she snaps at the puppy, sometimes she doesnt. I cant get her to play with me or with other members of my family. She spends all her time laying on the couch or bed and rarely gets up until I physically move her. If the puppy approaches me, sometimes my dog will come close to me and sometimes she will get up and go across the room.

I'm pretty sure this is her being jealous? I've tried to distance myself from the puppy but she's very excited and energetic, and also pretty attached to me. My dog is moping around and hesitating to eat her food and I can barely get her to go outside and potty. I'm hoping this is just her reacting to me giving attention to another dog, but if anybody with animal experience has other opinions, or any advice to make her act normal again, I would love to hear!

I don’t know how to talk to him about it because I have fear he will hit me or threaten me again. I haven’t talked to him or my mom at all about it because I’m just scared to.

anyways, the situation that happened this time.......

i grew up listening to his music from like grade 7 to now (he’s in a band). i sort of warped my personality to be like his when i was younger but i guess i sort of moved on from that a bit.. so a few months ago he had a kid with his wife and i felt really depressed and left out, like i’d been replaced.

another topic for my therapy is that i have so much trauma i need to address. and i’m afraid to keep telling my story because i’m afraid someone will report it (even though i’m an adult and it has already been reported once). but i need to address this and talk about it. i also don’t have the energy to keep telling my story over and over to different therapists.

I asked my mother to do something about it, but she always says something along the lines of “She’s only in middle school, it’s not a big deal anyway.” (I’m a couple years older than her). But that makes me feel pretty annoyed. Am i overreacting? it makes me feel very uncomfortable, since because I don’t have tiktok i can’t see who sees it. I’m fine with her doing what she wants on her own, but when she films me without my consent, that’s where I have a problem. Anyway, what should i try to reason with her, or just to get her to stop?

I did get my G.E.D, and now by March of 2021 I will have my B.S In human resources management. I also plan to have around 8k-10k in savings by this time, and want to start over fresh in a new city before I turn 30 while I still have no kids or mortgage to worry about. My friend who will have about 30k on savings also wants to come, and share an apt. He shares my values and need to get out, but wants to go somewhere where buying a house eventually won't be impossible. He is getting his degree in Tech management. We've both spent our entire lives in East Tx, and some in North Tx, and our values don't fit in here. We both hate the weather, and detest the culture. I'm looking for advice on somewhere I could move that's affordable for 2 people with the savings I have, and splitting costs monthly. As well as somewhere that fits me personality wise, has no humid or hot weather, and generally the people are more liberal/arts minded. Austin, San Fran, L.A, New York, and Seattle are out of the question budget wise, and it needs to be somewhere where the savings plus a low end job could make it feasible to survive and get on our feet.

289,"I’ve been friends with a shy guy for a few years now, and I have a bit of a crush on him, but that’s not too important.  He does things sometimes that I don’t understand, and I’m wondering if its just a personality quirk, or if I make him nervous/ he likes me.  For example, when we see each other, he has a few questions that he repeatedly asks me.  One question in particular bothers me, just because I just don’t like being asked, but there’s no way he would know that, because it’s a personal thing.  He asks me this question a lot, and I always answer the same way, I never elaborate or continue on the same topic, and this isn’t something that really changes at all.  He does this a lot, just asking me things he’s asked me before.  Does he just not know what to say?  Is he nervous around me, or just awkward?  I’ve known him for years, so I don’t really understand why he would be uncomfortable around me.  We get along just fine, and joke around with each other

So, from an outsider’s perspective, is this just his personality, or do I make him nervous/ does he possibly like-like me?

292,"This sounds like a very cliche problem, but the fact is that it has been consuming me since forever or as long as I can remember.

I cannot explain my entire life, but it has been relatively happy. 

However, no matter what happens there is something in me that does not allow me to be myself. That is because I do not like my personality, I don't like the emotional and caring aspects of my personality. I can't hold back my emotions, neither can I control what I feel and I feel it intensely. 

I am overwhelmed by my emotions at times. 

I don't blame my parents but I have never known how to confront my emotions, or at least project them the way they are. I feel ashamed to cry - more so, I'd feel like death if I did so in front of my family. Friends are sometimes okay, but I don't really like the concept of someone knowing everything about me. That prospect in its entirety sucks. 

I have trust issues when people compliment me, especially on the way I look. I don't like what I see in the mirror, but that's also cureable because I have experienced boosts of positive emotions when I have worked on my body, I have the confidence I can regain that.

Although my personal behaviour something I never wish I'd give to my worst enemy. It is consuming and I have set up a stupid standard of impossible tasks for myself.

I try to act tough and aloof all the times, when in fact I feel what others feel instantly. I can sense shift in emotions almost instantly. I can also feel the intentions behind what people do and that makes me cynical. And it just sucks. I hate projecting myself as emotional - and I find its weak to do so. Nobody rewards people like me for caring is what I feel. If you ask people, they have often taunted me as non-emotional or disinterested, I feel proud of that for some time. But, deep down I also feel that people should just know that I care for them intensely.

Toughen up is a phrase which makes me sad, because it only further shows how people do not value somebody feeling things. I don't want to be a burden to anyone, but I want to love people. I love people and feel there is something good everywhere, but my personality is taxing on me.

That has also led to dwindling self-confidence as a woman. I have the quality of nurture, but I also find shameful to admit many a times. And, though I actually admire strong, confident women I also feel sunk that I cannot be like them because I seriously don't know the way to that place. I often give gender differences  an excuse to my lame personality, and when my partner and I broke up my first intention was that I loved a man more than he loved me obscuring the fact that he did in fact love me intensely enough. I never regret a single relation in my life, but I want to love myself. I want to know I can add value to the world around me. But, society always gives me reminders I don't belong or I can't be a strong, happy person who can help others. 
I want to be an officer, and sometimes I think I have the capabilities to be one but then being too caring also makes me think if I can do it. I want to become better, but I don't value my values enough.

Although this rant is lengthy, it cannot just explain in entirety how I feel. And, I definitely don't like being like this. I believe I have already made the first step of transformation, but I have been stuck here with no understanding on how to move forward.

I suffered from a breakup a few months ago, I have become much better and have even more time to introspect my flaws and my essential shortcomings. But, I cannon help but imagine how I would have been a better farer had I not been underconfident and forever doubtful of my capabilities.

So my main questions are -
1. What do you think about this?
2. How do I find a way to enjoy my personality and my conflicting thoughts?
3. Any advice at all which you find relevant for me.",28May2020,1

This means no job, no contact with friends, no going to restaurants or stores, etc. I will just stay inside and help my parents with household chores and practice guitar a lot.

It's just come out of sudden and I'm not sure what to do.

So from my plan, I'm going to buy house for my parents to live so they don't need to rent, the reason I want to buy them house so that they dont need to rent anymore and it's good for investment in future, so my dad would pay the most for monthly payment and I plan to contribute 300$-400$, depend monthly payment.

I thought my gf would buy her own place and I'll leave with her, the plan I will contribute to pay for utilities. But today I think she changes her mind that from her parent side won't look good. So she thought probably best I join mortgage with her since we're going to marry.
I'm okay with it, but I dont think the bank will give the second mortgage if I have already own a mortgage.

So, because of covid, my mother and father haven't been working (up until recently). This delayed me and my mom's progress on getting away from my dad (who is emotionally and verbally abusive to both of us). 

I've had some issues in the past with coping mechanisms becoming toxic, for instance, I used to use coping characters (google it), but that turned into breakdowns (which is a long story within itself), to deal with one of these breakdowns, I took up roleplay, which was fun at first, and I made a bunch of friends, but the drama and a few other things now stress me out.

The reason I mention this is because another one of these dramas happened in the roleplay, and it's been severely negatively affecting me, to the point where I get so anxious about it I have a difficult time sleeping. I've been working hard to try and fix it, but it's difficult, and I'm thinking of leaving the server this drama is associated with.

But since I use roleplay as an escape from my situation (and I met most of my friends through there), I feel as if I can't take a break, and it's been bothering me.

Anyways, to summarize this, I have a couple questions.

How do I deal with the abuse from my father getting worse?

Should I take a break from roleplay? 

And how do I deal with the coping mechanisms becoming toxic? Or how to stop them from becoming toxic?

304,"(26m) A few months ago I found out my girlfriend’s (26f) reddit username. I decided to follow her and I occasionally look at what she posts. Just recently I saw a post in the advice reddit and saw that it was deleted. I read through the comments and that was enough to give me an idea of what she was asking advice for. She was talking about me and what she should do about our relationship. She said that she’s losing attraction to me, she thinks that I’m immature because I reminisce about my days in high school with my friends, and doesn’t think my dreams are realistic. I’m a recent college grad with a bachelors in Film Production. I’ve been currently writing a screenplay with the hopes of submitting into a few festivals. My dream is to become either a film or a tv director, or just to be able to work in that industry. She does/ and doesn’t support that. She wants to see me succeed, but doesn’t believe that I can. So she pretty much wants me to give up on it now. She also doesn’t like the fact that I don’t have a job. I just graduated two weeks ago. It’s been really hard trying to find work during this pandemic. I also don’t qualify for unemployment since I’m just a college grad. She thinks I’m being lazy which isn’t the case. She owns her own grooming business and works part time in retail. Both of which aren’t open due to the pandemic, but will be open soon. 
This situation is very new to me. We’ve been together for almost 3 years now. I’ve been in a long term relationship before, and have been blindsided by a situation sort of like this.

Because I’m a part of the regular staff, I often turn to seniors for advice or direction if I’m unsure of anything, but because communication between seniors is so poor, there usually ends up being a disagreement and leaves other staff unsure of what to say/do. Unfortunately the management is not much better so there’s little chance of this being resolved. I hate the fact that sometimes I’m literally just following orders and when they’re wrong, it’s me who ends up looking inept and not the person who gave me the order.

How can I learn to just get on with it and accept I’m only human?",28May2020,1
307,"I’m a 13 year old and I jsut really want a job LOL. We aren’t very rich so if I want to get things I feel like I should earn them with my own money, but I need a job to do that. I don’t think I’d be good at a lot of jobs considering I’m only really able to hold responsibility and do things well if I hyper focus on it. If I don’t like it, it’s impossible for me to do a good job (probably an adhd thing) and I’m not good at repetitive things, memorizing, hard work (my body has issues :’D) but I’m super into the arts and animals! writing, photography, drawing, and dogs, cats, hamsters, all sorts. I wouldn’t say I’m very talented at either animal care or art so I’m at a big struggle with finding a suitable job (and also one that works for 13 year olds). Does anyone have advice? :(",28May2020,1
308,"Could use some advice from people currently in college.

I have to decide where I’m going to go next fall in 2-3 days, and coronavirus has really thrown me for a loop.  I have a full ride to an out of state public college or I can stay in state and have most of my education paid for($25k total over 4 years, and there’s enough in my college fund to pay for it, but I’d like to save for grad school) while being apart of the top leadership group (meet every week, speakers, can leverage to other opportunities).  

Before corona, the choice was easy.  I’ve never had trouble making friends or building connections, so I wasn’t too worried about going out of state.  I decided to wait until the end to make a final decision but I’ve been set on going out of state for a couple of months.  Full ride (literally would bank probably $1000+ per semester off the scholarship) and I honestly wouldn’t mind experiencing something completely different.  Also this university is more highly ranked(not that it matters too much).  

Now I’m not so sure.  I see the benefits to staying in state now with virus.  I’d hate to do online school and be attending out of state for no reason.  I also hate the idea of trying to build those connections and friendships while quasi-social distancing and restrictions may be in place for my freshman year.  

Even if things are limited, I’m already in a top leadership program and know some people at my in state university of which I’m good friends with.  I could leverage this group and connections for other things which I want to like competitive internships.  My end goal is an Ivy League grad school.  I had to take the merit money as my parents make too much but would’ve financed too little of my education if I’d gone to a top university.  So these connections are important to be able to get involved

Bonus detail: I think my in state college is more likely to have less restrictions although it will probably be similar both places.

In all, I’d love to the out of state college but I’m terrified of a limited freshman year ruining the experience, meanwhile the in state college will provide me the connections and groups that may otherwise be hard to build.  Any advice?  I feel way more comfortable staying in state but I also feel like I’m selling myself short of experiencing a new place for free.  I’m at a loss and could use any words of wisdom.",28May2020,1

I don't like things being all complicated, and i thought I had everything under control. And then The principal of my school offered me a scholarship and wanted me to stay. She said we just have to pay anything that we can pay, and that 8th grade will be completely free. I don't know what to do, because 2 of my friends are going to the other public school with me. They are excited for me to come, and we already planned everything out and I have new clothes and everything. But I'm trying to think of my education. Will going to a public middle school change my future? I really am excited to go to this other school, but it seems like everyone, my mom, my teachers, they all want me to stay and I don't know why. I just don't know if i can let them down like this. It's a big change, and now everything's complicated.

316,"I have this “friend” who constantly shares her honest opinions. Her opinions are always negative and competitive. They make me feel insecure and like I’m not as good as her. 

For example, (this is a real life example), once I was receiving lots of compliments as feedback for a painting I had made. She told me that she didn’t like what I had painted and that she’s seen better.

She justifies her comments by saying that they’re her honest opinions, and that she values being honest, and she says she can’t help if I feel insecure and that she’s going to continue being unapologetically herself and not going to stop speaking her mind just because I’m “too sensitive”. When she puts it that way, she makes me feel and look like I’m the bad guy that wants to force her to stop being herself.

I think I’m being manipulated. Logically, she makes sense. If I tell her that her honest opinions are making people feel insecure, and not everyone wants to hear them 24/7 if they’re negative, and that it seems as if she uses this “honesty” as an excuse to offend and bring others down and make them feel insecure, she’ll just flip it right back around on me and say that she doesn’t want to hear my opinion on how she shouldn’t be sharing her opinions because it’s making her feel insecure about being herself. She always uses my own logic against me in a way that just makes my gut tell me that I’m being manipulated.

I thought I knew clearly what was right and wrong, but whenever I talk to her I always come out with my morals flipped around and it just feels... wrong somehow.

320,"Hello Reddit. 

So, hubs has been job hunting and typically one of the largest factors when deciding on an employer is health insurance and benefits. He is type-1 diabetic, and it is the only way we can afford insulin, pump supplies, and regular specialist visits. 

He also needs regular eye care, and some dental work done in the near future we have been putting off.

Currently, we are making due with coupon codes, member rewards, and traveling out of state to obtain affordable insulin. 

He recently was offered a position that pays well, has room for growth, and even offers commission along with salary. The thing is, as for benefits the company does not offer a health insurance plan but rather a $250 reimbursement monthly once he finds a insurance company he is going to use. 

Now, I have not reached out to any insurance companies as of yet, but from past experience, I personally have chronic kidney disease, and when I was booted from my parents insurance plan and had to find my own, paying out of pocket was ridiculous for me because of my medication and care plans. Like, upwards of $800 monthly. 

He has decided to pursue this position, and so as a sign of support I need to find a health insurance plan that will meet his needs, and any and all advice would be much appreciated! 

I personally do not want to be swindled into a crappy plan, or be bombarded with spam calls. I am willing to talk to whomever I need to about it though, but I am sure there are also lots of scams.",28May2020,1
321,"This is isn't near as pressing as a lot of the other posts on here so I apologize if this isn't a big deal to anyone. Nonetheless, for the past few months I have kind of just felt like something in my life is missing. I'm extremely young, so this could just be how growing up feels, I suppose. It's just that during this whole virus mess, I have been shoved into an isolated life when I'm very extroverted, and this has allowed me so much time to think that I no longer wish to have a brain. I will not lie and say that I'm not privileged in the way that I live, so I sometimes feel as if I'm not allowed to have problems. Yet I still just feel this overwhelming sense of emptiness. I don't quite enjoy anything that I used to anymore. Games, hanging with the few friends I can who have also been isolating, eating, even music just doesn't hold the same weight that it used to. I'll watch comedy videos or listen to podcasts almost all waking hours just to have some kind of input throughout the day so that I don't feel so intellectually dead now that school has stopped. I maintain the regular routine of working out and eating kind of alright and talking with friends but it all just seems to mean nothing anymore.

 This was a similar to how I felt a couple of years ago, but when I met my best friend things transformed and the world was brighter for the year we remained in school together. He offered a brand new perspective and vice versa and we became each other's perfect beacons for advice and enjoyable conversation and activities. Now he's graduated and has his own place and feels so much more grown-up than me. Now that I feel like he doesn't need me, reaching out to him feels more awkward and that emptiness has returned because I can't get that outside perspective anymore. He used to phrase things in just the way I needed to step back and look at the bigger picture. But now I just feel like I'm pressing against this void and I don't know what I need to fill it. Even when I hang out with that best friend, and things are just like normal for a while, I still feel that emptiness. So I know it isn't his ""loss"" that's affecting me. My laughs are just hollow and my activities are so bland when I used to crave adventure so badly my body would tingle and I'd sneak out just to take a walk in the dark along the streets since if I were caught with anyone my parents would have my hide. I used to be so very happy and full of life but now I feel as if I'm feeding off the attention of others through mundane posts about art or fashion in the hopes that this feeling is just an illness to be cured and enough human contact can quell it.

Can someone with a similar experience maybe just let me know how you dealt with this feeling? And how you got your old self back? I'm 15 and I don't have any mental illnesses or disorders as far as I know, unless you count a 99.9% sure self-diagnosis of ADHD. 

TLDR; I feel extremely alien and empty and I just want someone to help me feel like myself again because I'm too scared to talk to my friends.",28May2020,1
322,"So let's start off with basics. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression with psychotic features and one other diagnosis I can't think of. I used to take two medications for my mental health one is an antipsychotic called Olanzapine and the other is an antidepressant called Citalopram. In April of this year I had ran out of my antipsychotic and needed it to be refilled. This was not a big problem because I could just go to the pharmacy and get it refilled. But the pharmacist told me there was no refill for the prescription. I didn't think it was a big deal and I could get it refilled by my medication evaluator who I would be getting a call from in a few days (They were doing telahealth because of quarantine). The day comes where I get the call. I had a great mindset about this call figuring it was going to be a few simple questions and I would have my medicine that was working completely fine refilled. My mindset was thrown in a lion's pit and completely ripped to shreds. This phone call lasted about ten minutes. They asked me a total of three questions. I can only remember one and it was ""How are you feeling?"". It doesn't seem like a big red waving flag but it was. I can never answer this question, mostly because I can't define my emotions that well unless they are overwhelmingly strong and to a lot of people that sounds outright stupid but it's true. I stuttered around this question not even sure how to answer it so I gave the best I could and said ""I feel 'off', I guess"". Understandably they tried with the basic ""Happy, Sad, angry?"" And all I could respond with was ""I don't know"" after a few attempts of trying to make them understand they shrugged it off with a ""Yeah, okay"" and moved on. After that they somehow magically knew that the medication I was currently on wasn't good for me. I was so confused. These medications had been working for three whole years and I was doing so much better on both of them! Of course I confronted them about why they wanted to change both of my medications and they gave me the worst two arguments that made absolutely no sense. The first argument was about weight gain. Now I'll admit I'm not the fittest guy in the world but I'm not humungous (No offense). On this medication I had actually been losing weight especially with exercising everyday so that made no sense to me in anyway. The second argument they had was that the medication was highly addictive and they didn't want me to become addicted but I've never ever in my entire life had any problem with being addicted to anything I've never even taken more than two ibuprofen in a day. Later on in the story that will make no sense and you'll see why. I sat there for a few minutes compromising with them to let me stay on the Citalopram and to just change the Olanzapine. The Olanzapine was changed to another antipsychotic called Resparodone which if I remember correctly only has a 5% less chance of causing weight gain making it a 10% chance. I hated changing my medication. I just hate change in general especially when it comes to medication but I gave it a try. While I'm on this medication it does little to nothing for me. Hallucinations are about the same except shifted from auditory to visual. My mood went haywire and I would become so aggressive to the point I would punch walls over the littlest things. Which honestly bothered me the most because I am usually a very calm and non-impulsive person. And my relationships started to fall apart because of the elevated moods. My grades went from A's and B's to C's D's and F's. The last and most horrific side effect was the constant nightmares I had every night. So when they called a few weeks to check in how my medication was working I told them everything figuring they'd put a stop to this and take me off the medication. That isn't even close to what happened. They upped my dosage to .50 instead of .25 milligrams on the resparodone and wanted to put me on a sleeping pill to help with nightmares. I said that was fine and allowed it to happen, I didn't feel like fighting anymore. It just so happen to be they were leaving the mental health establishment and were going to a different one so this would be our last session. I couldn't help but smile about it. I pick up my medicine from the pharmacy a few days later and I was reading up about the sleeping medicine which I just can't remember the name of. Well, remember how I said they had a problem with me getting highly addicted to things? THIS PILL was a HIGHLY ADDICTIVE narcotic! I didn't even want to touch it. So I decided not even to open the bottle. I tried the higher dosage of the resparodone and of course it made everything worse so I eased my self off the pill by cutting it in half then fourths then just stopping all together. I still haven't gotten any calls from anyone about the new medication evaluator or anything and I've tried making calls but nothing is happening. At this point I don't have any clue what to do. The nightmares are just awful and I'm afraid the next step to it is sleep paralysis or worse. I've sorta just given up so I don't over stress about it and induce a huge panic attack.

So a few weeks ago I was driving around (in my car) with a friend (18f) and I was being followed by a car. It didn’t stand out in any way and we didn’t get the plates but it was clearly following us. It took every turn I did, even down side roads. I pulled into an apartment complex and turned off my car. The car pulled off to the road behind me (I could still see it) and turn off as well. We freaked out obviously. I grabbed the mace I keep in my car and we sat for a second trying to get a game plan. We decided to turn around and head into a more populated area of town. When we did this, we headed towards where the car was parked and the car seemed to panic and took off very quickly. We speed all the way back to her house after making sure it wasn’t following us again. When we got home we told her brother and tried to calm down. I was more freaked then she was because it was MY car. Nothing else like that has happened since and I calmed down a bit. 
About an hour ago (it’s like 2 am where I live, so around 1 am) I heard what I thought was a stick breaking outside my window. My lights were on and my curtains were open, I wasn’t changing or anything, just brushing my hair. (I have a funky sleep schedule). It sounded closer than a stick would usually be, and louder. I began to think it might’ve been a camera. I dont know, something about it didn’t sit well with me. I closed the curtains and turned off the lights. For context I live pretty far outside town, it’s mostly woods. Everybody knows everybody but the closest neighbor is probably half a mile at least. It’s very possible it could’ve been an animal, we have lots of coyotes, deer, turkey, all sorts of things. Even now that I’m typing it out, it seems dumb. I think I may have overreacted. To be fair I am watching criminal minds at the moment so I’m a bit on edge anyways. For more context I’ve never really had any boyfriends or people who I’ve dated so that’s not really a possibility. I guess the advice I’m looking for is what should I do next? Should I be worried? Does this sound like anything out of the ordinary? 

I’m still going to post this, even though it seems silly now. I’d like your opinions if anyone reads this lol.

It was when we were leaving that one cholo tried talking to my male cousin’s (29M) little sister (18f) since she was staring and smiling at the cholo (and some background info my cousin trains in muy Thai and can obviously handle himself) so he lets the cholo know that the girl is his sister and the cholos apologize since there’s a bunch of them my cousin is obviously in a very fight or flight situation and I don’t blame him. We ignore them and drive off but as we drove off and we’re nearing our house since we were cut off and it was those same cholo kids who all jumped out and tried to jump my cousin and he gets out and is ready to fight four of these kids but they pull out knives and a crowbar so shit went south real quick and my idiot female cousins and sister all get out of their car and start recording for proof which was pretty stupid if you ask me but I whatever I felt a rush of adrenaline and grabbed my fishing rod with a giant hook ready to defend myself and younger cousin(11m) in the car. And right when they seem like their gonna run at my cousin I notice a old friend that grew up with me come out of the car and I shout his name and it takes him a while to recognize me but when he does he starts apologizing and trying to settle the other idiots who wanted to jump my cousin , it works but before we leave they shout about how their gonna drive by our house and shoot us up and then they say that they wanted to attack my cousin because he “dogged” them before we left.

330,"Obligatory throwaway account and sorry in advance for mobile format. I’m a college student and, of course, I’ve been home since March. Since then, my family has deteriorated. My sister, I’ll call her Kate, a rising high school junior, has been dating “Dick,” a rising high school senior, for nearly a year. It’s been on an off with typical high school spats that cause breakups, but since around January, he’s been abusive. He threatens any guy who tries to be a platonic friend, he tells her lies about her current friends to keep her away from them, and constantly makes himself the victim when she tries to leave him. He has cheated on her numerous times with numerous people. I’m not privy to details, but I think he has sexually assaulted her as well. Last night, he broke up with her, claiming she cheated on him before they had even met. This isn’t the first time he’s made this excuse; he does this any time Kate begins to succeed or be happy without him.

But tonight, after he had “broken up” with her, he threatened me(I have no evidence that could be used against him). I just had a serious surgery and could not defend myself.

331,"I'm going to cut to the chase. I'm fucked. Currently, I'm 15 and a freshman. Every time I got nudes on my phone I would put them on my school computer to save them (because parents check my phone). Now, my friend told me that everything on there gets backed up to the school's cloud. Basically, if I turn this computer in at the end of my 12th-grade year, and they see the cloud or however that works they're gonna see underage girls nudes on there. I'm scared shitless I don't know what to do.",28May2020,1
332,"This is my first reddit post, and was typed in a google doc on my phone so excuse any spelling or spacing errors please.


So let's start off with basics. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression with psychotic features and one other diagnosis I can't think of. I used to take two medications for my mental health one is an antipsychotic called Olanzapine and the other is an antidepressant called Citalopram.

 In April of this year I had ran out of my antipsychotic and needed it to be refilled. This was not a big problem because I could just go to the pharmacy and get it refilled. But the pharmacist told me there was no refill for the prescription. I didn't think it was a big deal and I could get it refilled by my medication evaluator who I would be getting a call from in a few days (They were doing telahealth because of quarantine). 

The day comes where I get the call. I had a great mindset about this call figuring it was going to be a few simple questions and I would have my medicine that was working completely fine refilled. My mindset was thrown in a lion's pit and completely ripped to shreds. This phone call lasted about ten minutes.

 They asked me a total of three questions. I can only remember one and it was ""How are you feeling?"". It doesn't seem like a big red waving flag but it was. I can never answer this question, mostly because I can't define my emotions that well unless they are overwhelmingly strong and to a lot of people that sounds outright stupid but it's true. 

I stuttered around this question not even sure how to answer it so I gave the best I could and said ""I feel 'off', I guess"". Understandably they tried with the basic ""Happy, Sad, angry?"" And all I could respond with was ""I don't know"" after a few attempts of trying to make them understand they shrugged it off with a ""Yeah, okay"" and moved on. After that they somehow magically knew that the medication I was currently on wasn't good for me. 

I was so confused. These medications had been working for three whole years and I was doing so much better on both of them! Of course I confronted them about why they wanted to change both of my medications and they gave me the worst two arguments that made absolutely no sense. 

The first argument was about weight gain. Now I'll admit I'm not the fittest guy in the world but I'm not humungous (No offense). On this medication I had actually been losing weight especially with exercising everyday so that made no sense to me in anyway. The second argument they had was that the medication was highly addictive and they didn't want me to become addicted but I've never ever in my entire life had any problem with being addicted to anything I've never even taken more than two ibuprofen in a day. Later on in the story that will make no sense and you'll see why. 

I sat there for a few minutes compromising with them to let me stay on the Citalopram and to just change the Olanzapine. The Olanzapine was changed to another antipsychotic called Resparodone which if I remember correctly only has a 5% less chance of causing weight gain making it a 10% chance. I hated changing my medication. I just hate change in general especially when it comes to medication but I gave it a try. While I'm on this medication it does little to nothing for me.

 Hallucinations are about the same except shifted from auditory to visual. My mood went haywire and I would become so aggressive to the point I would punch walls over the littlest things. Which honestly bothered me the most because I am usually a very calm and non-impulsive person. And my relationships started to fall apart because of the elevated moods. My grades went from A's and B's to C's D's and F's. The last and most horrific side effect was the constant nightmares I had every night. 

So when they called a few weeks to check in how my medication was working I told them everything figuring they'd put a stop to this and take me off the medication. That isn't even close to what happened. They upped my dosage to .50 instead of .25 milligrams on the resparodone and wanted to put me on a sleeping pill to help with nightmares.

 I said that was fine and allowed it to happen, I didn't feel like fighting anymore. It just so happen to be they were leaving the mental health establishment and were going to a different one so this would be our last session. I couldn't help but smile about it.

 I pick up my medicine from the pharmacy a few days later and I was reading up about the sleeping medicine which I just can't remember the name of. Well, remember how I said they had a problem with me getting highly addicted to things? THIS PILL was a HIGHLY ADDICTIVE narcotic! I didn't even want to touch it. So I decided not even to open the bottle. 

I tried the higher dosage of the resparodone and of course it made everything worse so I eased my self off the pill by cutting it in half then fourths then just stopping all together. I still haven't gotten any calls from anyone about the new medication evaluator or anything and I've tried making calls but nothing is happening.

 At this point I don't have any clue what to do. The nightmares are just awful and I'm afraid the next step to it is sleep paralysis or worse. I've sorta just given up so I don't over stress about it and induce a huge panic attack. 

So, any advice?",28May2020,1

We’ve become extremely close over the time we dated, and I literally told her everything.  I have tons of extreme food allergies, so much that the majority of food is not an option for me and she gave up all of those for me.  

I know I’ll get better, and I know that a day is still a day whether or not we’re together but I still do want some advice on honestly anything.

We ended on really good terms, still going to be really good friends when I’m ready.  It was almost mutual because we agreed that it was too early for us to be in this serious or something and relying this much.  We agreed we needed to fully learn how to be independent first she just figured it’d be best to break up and I didn’t.

I feel so much shame and disgust at myself for it. I don't think I'm doing it for attention, I pick spots that never show and I'm very safe about it (sanitizing the area and not going too deep - I really don't want scars to remember this time of life). 

I'm aware that it's destructive and a bad thing, and I want to stop. But I would feel so selfish putting that ridiculous burden on anyone by telling them. It seems like sharing it with a trusted person might help keep me accountable, maybe a little more grounded. But I absolutely cannot have them spread that information, and I don't want them to worry.

I was a pretty jealous person, but there was always one person that bothered me the most and following our break up and until recently my ex dated this person. In cliche terms “went after the girl he told me not to worry about”
He has since said that he regrets it, got nothing out of it and had a deeper connection with me. Among this he’s told me that it was a distraction, and mentioned that he knew it would hurt me although specifying that was never the intent going into it. Without going into detail, he was hurting too. I didn’t handle my jealousy or anger well and had taken it out on him and when I was overwhelmed with unfortunate happenings knew I wasn’t treating him properly. I acknowledged that fully and accept responsibility for that but I can’t help but let my mind spiral about his time with this other girl.
I loved him the whole time. I “dated” but never fully committed to someone or even slept with someone else because I was still extremely heartbroken. Not that this should make a difference either, but he’s the only person I’ve ever slept with. He had a few partners before me, and now this. 
I wanted this to have never ended and would have rekindled at any given moment over the past 10 months.

I don't want to give too much detail because idk if she is on reddit and is a huge distinguish. Anyways, she was great compared to the previous people I've dated and had so little im common.
The date wasn't normal, our state is still in lock down, so middle of the night we decided I'd pick her up and just drive around. It was easy because I honestly do that on my own xD . Well she was very talkative it felt like she couldn't notice how nervous I was, maybe she could, i don't know. I was super tired and had a slight buzz from a couple beers two hours ago. Well we started talking about life, friends, and the biggest part that i failed to discuss with her, our childhood growing up. She was so open about her childhood trauma and it was one in a million... it was so similar too mine. It really freaked me out! Well, when she asked about mine, I kinda froze and fell off so I quickly grasped for some false identity. I don't even know why?! Why lie?! I have made truths with my past, I've reached out to the people that did wrong with me as a kid and built new relationships with them(pretty recent), but now when I needed to be honest, I faked my childhood, not really, just altered minor details and withheld some of the horrors I endured. I think she could tell I lied or the fact I wasn't ready to tell her, but it felt so forced. I feel so bad. The conversation changed and we stayed talking for a couple hours as if nothing happened. The night ended great! I dropped her off, gave her a hug when she asked me to stay. I did for a while but I was so tired I eventually had to leave. She even asked to let her know I made it home safe.

A few days later we haven't talked. I just want to tell her sorry so bad and be honest, but before something could begin I broke the biggest rule and im not even sure why? Or even where to go from here..


I guess I'm asking for advice how to handle this internally. I know I'll have the chance to tell her the truth, but i need to figure out for myself first.. I'm not even sure why i lied. I hate that I might have ruined something good but I'm willing to lose something great to become better at the same time but don't want to hurt anyone. I am so conflicted.

So I have never posted anything on reddit like this before so I’m sorry if it’s bad, just please help.



So I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about nearly 7 months and we’re very much in love and everything was going great. But a few months ago back in March his dad ended up not wanting us to date. He wouldn’t let me see him for 40+ days and my he’d get in even more trouble if his dad caught him texting me. So during that hard time we both were very sad, angry, depressed, etc but we were still in love and happy with each other. The moments we’d have to secretly text were fine, I’d be very sad at times but we’d get through it. 


Skip ahead to April:

So basically later in during that whole ordeal his dad said we can see each in a month from then. Since it all went down on March 15th I was supposed to be able to talk and see him without him getting in trouble on April 15th. April rolls around and I get to text him without fear of punishment for him but I wasn’t able to see him still. I was still upset and somewhat coming out of my depression but he seemed completely fine since he was able to play games with his friends and talk to them now on his pc since he was ungrounded. The entire month of April I didn’t see him.

Skip to May:

So after 48 days I was finally able to see him in secret. I went on a walk with him for like two hours and it was great. I cried when he left and my mom picked me up. The next day his dad asked if he had seen me and he didn’t want to lie so he said yes. His dad apparently didn’t care so that was great. 

Throughout this month we’ve seen each other about like 7 times maybe and I thought everything was fine. But then I slowly felt like he didn’t want me. The feeling grew worse and worse so I started talking to him about it and eventually he told me he really really wants to want me but can’t feel it for some reason. He tells me he knows for sure he still loves me but has also said he’s confused with everything right now. One thing is for certain, I love him more then anything but I’m hurting because I feel like he doesn’t.

357,"I subleased a two bedroom house from the master tenant (and roommate) a few months ago. I took one of the two bedrooms and decided to split the rent with her for a lease that I could renew every 3 months. It was a shit ton of money (~$1700) but the house and neighborhood were great so I gave in.

A week later her boyfriend started coming to hang out at the house. By the end of the month, he started spending nights in the house. And then Covid struck, so my roommate said her boyfriend’s roommate was sick with a fever and so he’d be sticking around with us for safety till Covid settles. And long story short, its been over 3-4 months and the guy hasn’t left our house since!

He’s set up his work station in our living room and they fall asleep watching movies on the couch every night so I haven’t sat in my living room for months. I’m not allowed to go to the kitchen to fix a late night meal coz the living room and kitchen are connected and it disturbs their sleep. I pay for the internet connection that doesn’t even reach my room and that he utilizes all day. He doesn’t pay for rent or expenses, and I’m essentially paying a shit ton of money just for a bedroom and bathroom access.

I also have a degree that I’m almost finished in physics that he told me to finish that and trash modelling.

Now he comes from a Muslim background (not strict obviously because he’s sleeping with me) but I’m saying this because he probably has it engrained in him somewhere that women shouldn’t be exposed like modelling does.

I've worked hard on my body and my looks to be able to get signed, it’ll probably get jobs like catalogue modelling and commercial. My point is that it’s not a waste of time I’m doing this for some cash and because I think it would be fun.

He pretty much told me to scrap it and go for education WHICH I know is the smart idea. I will be finishing that but I’m confused as to why he’s being so cold about me modelling?

no congratulations at all or encouragement for me getting signed? And I know it’s in his nature to be happy for someone like this so I don’t get the coldness.

So men could yourself in his shoes and think, how would you feel if your friends with benefits went into modelling/was a model? I mean if that’s all it is no feelings than why would he be jealous right?

366,"When I was in my late teens during I got to know this really kind girl. During the time I was a boxing prospect, and she came in to learn how to essentially defend herself. During this age I treated women with disrespect, show them no attention, and perfom inappropriate acts almost everyday. So intentionally I saw her as a sexy broad waiting to have a fun time with someone. In the following weeks me and her got to know each other very well. Even though there was a little bit of an age difference between, I genuinely felt I had feelings for this girl. I didn't view her as an object as I did to other girls. One day when I was done sparring at the gym I had no ride. No of my folk was in town and my trainer couldn't give me a ride. I asked the girl and she said she would take me home if we could stop by her house to pick something up. Whenever we were driving home we were able to enjoy ourselves and she introduced me to Smino. When we got to her place, she went inside and took a long time. So, I went inside to check if everything was alright. She called to me to her room where she was standing there naked. I didn't know how to react because this was the first time this ever happened. She told me not to be nervous and guided my hands across her body. We then stumbled onto her bed and made love. After that I felt great. She drove me home and told me she would see me next Monday. I couldn't stop thinking about her, and I was gonna ask her out. But whenever I was training in my gym that next Monday she didn't show. I tried to get a hold of her for the next couple of weeks but I recieved no response. One day she hit me up and told me to met her at this one local restaurant. When I arrived I asked why she hadn't got back to me in the longest time. She then went on to explain that she has been feeling very sick and hadn't had her period in a few months. I started to add everything up, and she told me she was pregnant. I was scared for my future but when I started to think about the baby I felt a sense of relaxation go through. I knew what I had to do, and i was going to take responsibility. But she told she wasn't ready to have a kid, and told me she was gonna get an abortion. She told me that I was going to have to pay for it. I told her that I could be a dad but she declined. So I had know way to respond but by telling her I could get the money. My family wasn't financially stable during this time so I could ask my pops for money. I couldn't have them worrying about me when they had to worry about three more kids and living in the projects. So I had to find an alternative. Luckily my close cousin said that he could make me some money quick and he didn't ask why I needed it. So i took his offer, two days later he gave me a duffle and got me a route to work on. I know it wasn't the best option but it was the only one I had. During this time I barely went to school, so my grades started dropping and I eventually got kicked off the team. I didn't, all I had on my mind wasn't getting this money for my girl. I was able to get the payment in a good amount of time and she was able to get the procedure done. When she came back to my place she told me that she had to get out of this place and she was going to move up to Michigan with a sister of hers. I didn't say anything, I couldn't say anything. After that she left. I was alone, all I had was boxing and my family. I tried to get with this one chick from Spain but when she came onto I pushed her away because I was too scared. She left to. However, 5 months ago I met this one broad my brother's girlfriend was a friend of. I started to talking to her on the phone and before I knew it she made me starting getting Instagram and Snapchat for the first time. We started off slow, we enjoyed each others company and I was able to get to know her better. Three months in I got a ride from my cousin to meet her in Michigan. I stayed for two nights and spent both of the days with her. I opened up to her about my past, and she just listened. And it was the most kindest thing anyone could have done for me at that point. She didn't judge, she didn't laugh, she cared for me. She hugged. She told .er pops left her at a young age and all the guys she had been with previously treated her like some pocket. I asked her why she didn't like telling anyone, and she said everyone she has told before told her to be quiet and forget about. I was enraged by this and just held her. After our serious talk we just hanged out and watched some of her shows. I feel I was able to open my self up around her. I let her know how I felt about her that night and she felt the same way. I left the next day and we talked on facetime everyday. But the more we talked, the more it felt like it was forced. She also wasn't able to talk as much since she had an important project coming up. I would tell her after I got back from work if we could talk and she sad of course, but when I texted her she said she was tired. And when I saw that I just thought how could she be tired if I've been working all day and still have the urge to put in all my effort to have a conversation. It continued like this for a while and when we did talk we spoke about our issues. We didn't enjoy ourselves and she would tire herself out more. She began to lie to me that she wasn't tired so she could stay on the phone. However when she stayed that my heart broke, I couldn't have her lying to me just to me feel like I did nothing wrong. I hated her always thinking about the welfare of other people when she was breaking inside. I felt selfish, I felt that I put too much effort into her that I could be happy when I was with her, that I would always try intrude myself into her life because I didn't want to mess up. I didn't want her to be like the rest because I loved her too much. We decided that we should just be friends for now, neither of us wanted an online relationship. She told me that if I find anyone else, she would be okay because she just cared about my well being. But I couldn't feel the same. I always wanted her, and I hated it when she said I was so hot and that I could get any girl. But i just didn't want any girl, I wanted the girl that was there for me when no one else was. She was perfect and I died inside when she didn't think the same way. But after a 2 weeks of thinking I just want her to be happy, too many people guys have broken her heart. I dont want her to lower standards just for any guy, I want them to give her the amount of love that I do or maybe even more. She means the world to me, and she meets anyone else before I can save up enough money to see her and be with her. Than so be it, because if she's happy so am I. I just want to know if I should keep on fighting for her until I'm able to see her again, or if we should just be friends?",28May2020,1

368,"Relationship Misunderstanding...

My ex broke up with me because they believed I had sex with someone else. I will admit that I emotionally sought people to listen to me, and set boundaries that were wrong, but I would never have crossed that physical line. I was mentally and emotionally deteriorating, and looking for someone to talk to, but I NEVER was looking for someone to actually love, the way that I did with my ex. 


I was in the beginning stages of my BPD’s symptoms kicking in, and didn’t know it until a few months ago. Does that excuse my emotional cheating? No. I was terrible for doing that, I should of been able to talk to him. It’s all I  TRULY wanted but now after arguing, and terrible miscommunication, I don’t know what to do. 

I know I need to focus on getting healthy again, but the thought that I lost someone because of a real lacking of communication destroys me inside.

369,"Last year before this pandemic was a thing, I had a loss in my family. 
It was devastating but I think I took it pretty well, but recently I've noticed that this loss did actually change me. I'm noticing myself thinking about death and my own inevitable demise more often than I'd like to admit. I don't think I'm depressed, suicidal, anxious or anything like that I feel pretty normal but I feel like by having someone very close to me die, it made me realize something I always to tried to sweep under the rug... it made me realize that people do die.
For some reason I'm trying to deny all of this, everytime that someone or even my own family mentions the loss, I try to change the subject immediately or say I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know how to approach it, I don't how to act, so I just pretend that it didn't happen. It seems as if I'm burying away the memories, Saying they never existed and this makes me feel horribly guilty.",28May2020,1

372,"I feel afraid of the fact that I have so much debt and regretful of attending college. I am thankful that my grades from Highschool have allowed me to be able to graduate a year early but I still have so much debt and more to come. 


Mind you, my school is extremely expensive. We’re talking like four years probably costs $200k. In the two years that I’ve attended my school, I have $20k and a little bit in debt. I’ve only had to take out a small loan because I haven’t had the credit history to take out larger loans, so my mom was kind enough to take the $20k debt in her name, making her total amount of loans $40k (mine plus her own $20k from her schooling). 


I’ve read the financial breakdown for my senior year and we’re expecting to pay a collective $39k this year (payments of $13k throughout the year). The first payment is due in August, which is tight for my family. My mom is worried that she won’t be able to take out another loan. I’m afraid because it would be a huge loss for me to not finish my degree. My degree isn’t that valuable in the first place (Fine arts degree) but it’s better to have it than not have it and still have to pay off the loans without it.


I borderline regret attending my school. I do enjoy it, it’s super fun, and I do feel more prepared for my dream job than I would’ve been without attending but my family is by no means rich and we honestly are struggling to afford it. There’s also so much uncertainty with my own job after graduating. I have no idea what I’m even going to be doing after I graduate or if I’ll even be able to secure a job after graduating. I have a part time entry job currently but I can’t pay $20k+ of loans with a minimum wage job. 


I don’t know what the future will hold for me but I’m afraid of having to spend the rest of my life paying off loans and being in debt like my mom still is. I feel tremendously guilty that she’s had to get loans in her name for me. Especially since I have fears that my future income will be minimal if not inconsistent.

378,"Hi y’all! 

My best friend of 12 years has asked me to be his best man. And for a while we were planning parts of the wedding together. Making plans for the party. All that fun stuff. Then rona hit and it kinda put a stop to all the planning. We were supposed to go to Vegas In June. I called and told him that after talking to my husband we did not feel comfortable with me going. So we postponed/canceled it. 

We had a big team meeting about the wedding date. As we understood it. The wedding was going to be postponed since August 29th is coming up fast. 

I’m in one of the cities that has been hit really hard. Hubs and I have been working from home for two and a half months. Ordering food online and not going to stores at all. So we are taking this pretty seriously. 

Shit hit the fan two days ago. The bride has made up her mind that they will go forward as planned on August 29th. I think this is a bad idea. The wedding is going to be around 200 people. 30% of those folks are old people. 

I spoke to a few members of the wedding party and we all feel mostly that this is a ridiculous decision. A lot of us are going to have to take a flight to get to Virginia. I’m scared to even walk in a store let alone get on a plane. 

Am I a dick for writing him an email letting him know that I will not be attending if the date is not postponed? I did it as loving as I could have. But I really feel as if he is asking me to choose between my health and going to his wedding. Not to mention all the others he would be putting at risk. 

I do want to add. I’ve been very vocal in voicing my concerns around the rona and the wedding. Clearly it fell on deaf ears. I mean I canceled the party because of these fears. 

 I get they want to get married but it feel like they are being really selfish at the moment. Why not just wait a year? I don’t really get their thought process.",28May2020,1

Now before I get into this please understand my situation and where I stand.

I have always been a black lives matter advocate and have never wish any person of colour harm. I have never said the n word and never plan too. It’s shitty and fucked up that he says it but I can’t do anything about it.

So for some context on my dad he has shared custody with my mom meaning (legally) I have to go there every other weekend. He’s an emotionally abusive piece of shit but again nothing I can do, I also go to my dads for my bothers (half bothers not related to my mom) 


So now for my bf. We have been together for about 6 months now, he has wanted to meet my dad for the longest time but I always tell him no cause of how racist he is. My dad will say stuff my “I hope you don’t marry that n word”. So yeah, pretty bad. We did go and see him and under his breath my dad said the n word when we where having dinner (where I’m from they have released some restrictions). 

He obviously didn’t say anything but when we went to go home to my moms he freaked out at me asking why I didn’t stand up for him. I tried to explain but he just didn’t listen and hasn’t talked to me since, it has been like 1 day now and I don’t know what to do. How can I explain why I didn’t. And yea I know it was a shitty thing to do. But my dad says stuff like “go back to washing dishes” or “I hope you don’t end up with a lesbo” (I’m bi).

For some context I recently turned 16 and I cant exactly get my license yet because the DMV is closed but I figured I might as well try now to get a car for my first vehicle. My dad, who was given a $30,000 sports car as his first and my mom who was given a $24,000 car as her first (going off MSRP for these) refuse to even entertain the notion of buying me a car. When saying it back to myself it sounds selfish and I feel like a pos but then I remember the cars they got. I feel so childish writing this. I talked to my father about it and I asked him ""how hard was it for you to get your dad to get you that car at your age?"" He then replied ""not very hard"". I have personally been wanting a retired police interceptor to get into learning how to work on cars because they are cheap and cool but he is so adamantly against it. He has a fondness for 90's sports cars and whenever I mention them he seems to like them and is open to buying them and openly admitted he planned on dropping 36k on one from a collector in vegas!(we live in oregon) and just handing me down our ""family car"" which is his beat up old highlander. My neighbor on the other hand was given a $24,000 muscle car as his first and I just struggle to see why I cant have a $3,000 retired p71.

395,"So, I'll give you some backstory. I have the shittiest memory, likely due to my ADHD. I'm also gay, and nobody knows. Recently during quarantine, I've found all sorts of fun new sources of entertainment -- Netflix, Amazon Prime movies, all that. I'm staying with my aunt and uncle, but you could say it's gotten pretty lonely and boring. On a whim to address my boredom, I guess I subscribed to someone's OnlyFans account. I decided to make a new email address to open this account, because I didn't want it to be connected to my work account. As I'm a very private person and closeted, I opened this email account on an incognito window and didn't put any recovery phone number or email address. I know this was stupid, I just don't really trust technology. In the past I've had people find social media accounts I wanted to keep to myself just because they were connected to my phone number. Yeah, I could've gone on PornHub or something basic like that, just so much of the stuff on there is a little gross. Plus anyone in charge of the wifi can see ""pornhub"" and start asking questions, I'm certain my family's never heard of OnlyFans and as it isn't necessarily or blatantly sexual, and wouldn't bother looking into it. 

So then this is when I run into the issue. I quickly got bored of my subscription and wanted to go end it so I wouldn't be charged one month from now when it renews. Then I entered my email and password when logging in. Failed. I tried different combinations. All failed. I tried looking for the email I created for this, tested different passwords. Nothing worked. Suddenly I was in a panic. My card information is on there, my subscription wasn't cancelled, and I have no way to go in there and change either. I emailed their support (using a separate email) because that's what their FAQ instructs people to do if they forget their email for their account. I told them that I'd give any information needed -- time the account was created, my name, phone, etc. I know my passwords, all I needed was the email that corresponded to those passwords. No response for days. I followed up. Still no response. 

I'm considering contacting my bank pretending I lost my debit card on the street and need to cancel all transactions until I get a new debit card number. I don't really have the guts to tell them the truth. I know if I get a new card, the subscription will try to bill an expired card number and it won't touch my real account, so I won't potentially be wasting money on a subscription I can't even access or terminate. But that is such a long, tedious process, and given that my family is strict and watches my every move, they'll know I replaced my card and will wonder how the hell I lose my card when I never leave the house.

I don't know. Dumb situation, please don't judge me. I need advice.",28May2020,1

397,"Back story

A friend of mine, we’ll call her F. F had a douche of an ex and family back in her hometown of Bumsvile ASU. She was 16 at the time, and decided to move as far away as she could, money allowing. Didn’t tell her parents, friends, anyone from her old life. She ended up moving half way across yonder to be here in Hicktown USA. Where I live, I was 26 at the time. 

Now it’s 5 years later, we’re both having very happy lives and live together, somewhat romantically involved. 

*wink wink nudge nudge*

I helped her cope with a lot of anxiety, stress, and PTSD from her past life. She has come along way in finding her happiness again, granted she still has some nightmares from time to time. 

To this day, I don’t think that anyone from her old life knows where she is, or who she is since she is going buy her nickname. We’re going to the courthouse to get it changed next week. 

I am the ONLY person in her life now that knows her full story. The story she tells, is that she came in on a bus, and just fell in love with Hicktown.

Advice part. 

Last night, around 9pm, I got a call from a PI. Saying that F’s family needed to get in contact with her, that her father was dying and would like to talk to her about donating a kidney to save his life. He was an alcoholic and was to far down on the donation list to even be considered. 

I have worked hard and long over the past 10 years to get her back from that mindset that they had her in. I really don’t want her going back there again, but I fell lime it should be her choice. What should I do?",28May2020,1
398,"He and I lived at a rental house, he moved out, moved back in unexpectedly and said:

&gt; Ugh technically I can just take my old room back.

According to what? And he did in a really crappy way. I thought he was just spouting nonsense. He moved all my stuff out of the room, bought me a bed I didn’t ask for, and pretended everything was okay. I can’t believe he so off-handedly said that the day he got back only to provoke and beg me and such. He texted me everyday asking if he could buy me a bed or whatever and I told him I didn’t need anything. 

Still, he’s a narcissist and that’s sad. Some brother. Today he was staring at me as he walked by and I asked him WTF he was doing and he said he was ‘testing my mental toughness’ or whatever, and it’s a game. I told him I’m not playing any bullshit games and I didn’t care. -_-

What should I say to him in the future that’s mature and sets my expectations/boundaries?",28May2020,1
399,"I love my family and spending time with them, but I feel like I can only spend time with one of them at a time. I feel like if I try to spend time with two of my siblings I always get ignored cause I'm the youngest, or if I try to spend time with a sibling and a parent I get  ignored cause they have their own adult things to talk about (I'm the only child who isn't an adult yet). Whenever we spend time as a whole family I get anxious and always say something dumb. If I don't say something dumb I notice I can only talk to one person at a time. Like if we're all out to eat I'll mainly just talk to the two people next two me instead of the whole table. Same with car rides, sitting on the couch, ect. How can I stop being anxious around them. I love them, so I don't understand why I can only spend time with one at a time.

TL;DR:
I can only spend time with one family member at a time because I either get ignored or get anxious if there's two of them.",28May2020,1
400,"My girlfriend has been dealing with a lot of depression the past few years, but the past couple of months have been getting a lot worse. We've only known each other since last July, so I wasn't there for all of it, but I have heard the details of most of it. We're both 17 and live in the US, so there isn't much she can do on her own right now. I'm coming to Reddit because I'm hoping that someone who has dealt with similar stuff will see it and know of a way to suppress her bad feelings, and/or get rid of them. If anyone knows of a possible solution, please comment it. She didn't feel comfortable posting herself, so I told her to write how she feels to me and I'd post it. 
This is what she said: 

""My head always has this heavy feeling of darkness making me feel weighed down, makes me feel completely off and different and hard to perceive things, my face has this tingling sensation that just stings like it’s eating away my happiness, my fore arms have this sensation of tingling similar to my face making me feel constricted in my darkness longing for anything to stop it whether it’s sh, etc., I always have slight movement in my hands and legs always just shaking just purposeless physical activity, makes me feel unstable and kinda of off balance 

Everything I was once interested in just faded away like I’m in a blanket of nothingness, makes my appetite low just like no food looks good, I have this feeling of worthlessness and guilt that’s degrading like I don’t deserve to talk to people, it seems impossible for me too think and concentrate, making decisions it’s 1000 times harder like I struggle ordering food at restaurants, I can’t seem to remember things, I’m always agitated, i can be thinking or talking to someone and my brain just disconnects like I’m in space and don’t hear them, I have this weird fascination with death, like I want to stop feeling so many things and just want it all to stop. I feel like a typo.

But I’ve been in two inpatient mental hospitals and one outpatient. I’ve been provided with lists of coping skills and methods and i still feel stuck in a loop. I have a psychiatrist and a therapist but it all feels hopeless like everyday I get this feeling when I’m just sobbing my eyes out muttering help under my breathe just saying I can’t take it anymore that I can’t handle it and everything going on in my head just needs to stop, yet I don’t know how. I go on hotlines almost every night with hope just to get that hope weakened because what they say is what I’ve already heard.""

She said she doesn't want to go back to any mental hospital again because it was a horrible experience. She said they'd just inject her with drugs whenever she was feeling like this and was watched 24/7, even while she showered. She's tried every form of therapy she knows of and hasn't gotten any good results. We live 2 hours away from each other, so the things I can do are limited. I'm really worried about her because of her constant suffering and I don't know what to do. All the help she gets from professionals is them pretty much just saying the same stuff she's already heard and she feels really hopeless. Shes falling apart and I feel powerless in helping her. 

Does anyone know of anything that could work? 

Thank you for reading this, and I'd really appreciate any help you might be able to give us.",28May2020,1

I know using a butt plug first would help and he’s talked about getting me one but just hasn’t yet. He has never done anal with a girl before so he really doesn’t know it works I guess I don’t know either but I think he is just comparing me to porn and it really hurts my feelings and when I express this to him he just wants to get away and doesn’t care or try make me feel better Is this normal guy behavior or is he being mean?",28May2020,1

409,"First time poster. So, a little background. I (22F) have a diagnosed anxiety disorder. I also have an uncle who tested positive for COVID last month and was in the ICU for 3 weeks. Thankfully, he’s ok now... but saw how dangerous this is. I also have a little brother (16M) who’s considered at risk because of asthma and vocal cord problems.  

Recently, my grandma passed away. It’s been really hard for our family. My mom, the youngest of 8, hasn’t been able to see all her siblings to help grieve because of the pandemic. 

Soon, we’ll have a Catholic mass in honor of her. The heartache— I don’t actually feel safe with this risk. For context, I haven’t even been to the grocery store and have been pretty strict with staying at home, more strict than most.  Now, I just read an article by Dr. Fauci explicitly calling receiving Catholic communion risky. (https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/05/27/dr-anthony-fauci-catholic-churches-masks-communion-covid-coronavirus). There will be communion at this mass. And I don’t know what to do. My parents would be devastated, hurt, and probably mad (I don’t blame them) if I didn’t go, as my brother is going. They told everyone I am going and I also thought I would be ok with going (before reading the article). I do want to honor my grandma by having this mass to help grieve. My parents are not as worried as I am and were happy to hear that church was reopening. Our family friend is even playing the music for mass. 

Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA for skipping, or even proposing that I skip, the funeral? There will be a live stream online, but that’s mainly for my family out of state. I feel like this situation is going to give me a panic attack, but that only frustrates all parties involved (me too). It’s also hard to discuss with my grieving family about this, I really believe even having this concern would be perceived as self absorbed. Is this a genuine concern or just my anxiety again? How do I choose between my physical (potential exposure) and emotional well being (would damage relationship with family but in an ideal world I would want to attend of course).

Edit: the capacity of the funeral would be limited and most people would wear masks, it’s mainly the receiving communion part that worries me. I would hope that everyone would stick to social distancing (is no hugging at a funeral even realistic?)",28May2020,1

416,"Hey all! I recently went to a specialty hair salon **for the** ***first*** **time in my entire life** after ruining my virgin, very dark hair with box dye and deciding it was best to leave it to the professionals. My hair barely touches my shoulders, but I went full blonde with a few inches of roots showing (essentially somewhat of a bayalage). Almost 6 hours in the chair and it totaled to $280. Sadly, because it was my first time I didn't know what to expect, I only gave a $25 tip because I didn't have more / the exact amount of the 20% tip. I was so shook and confused and didn't know if they overcharged me and I felt overwhelmed and embarrassed and I kinda cried in my car not knowing if I tipped enough or what even happened. But anyway... after some time I realized it was a fairly well-done job and feel like I might want to keep this hair color for at least the rest of this year. 

**FIRSTLY,** should I go back to that salon? I feel a bit embarrassed that I tipped low, but that price range caught me a bit off guard. I didn't know what to expect. Before this experience, I have always been frugal and never splurged on me (early-mid 20s, new to real life out of college, here). I'm worried that I'll be remembered and I don't want to be known as the bad-tipper, I really didn't mean to. 

Second, is it okay to ask a stylist for estimates? I don't want to be rude. After this first time, I found a new respect for cosmetologists and want to communicate in a respectful manner,- like you would with any other person in a professional field. The thing is, they knew it was my first time there and I didn't know what to do / say other than an idea for my hair color and they kind of took control and I went with it,- naively. They washed my hair, gave it a blowout, and styled / curled it, even offered to cut it (which I declined).. which I think made the cost go up. They didn't explain what all they did that made it amount to $280, but I was too zoned out that I paid and left.  I mainly just wanted my color done... which I have now learned the hard way, that I need to speak up. But how can I sound.. not cheap or demanding? I dunno, lol. I had e-mailed them before asking about prices but they never got back to me.. and when they finally did, a week after shooting the e-mail, they didn't answer the question but rather just told me to book an appointment. 

Help! I am new to the beauty world, but I kinda like it and just wanna be well-informed next time. Thanks, guys! :-)",28May2020,1

I’m a Christian, I have made the decision to save myself for marriage, but I find that I’m a very sexual person. My ex was the love of my life, I wanted a life with her and only her. We had that planned and then one day she just said she stopped loving me, cut contact, and never gave me closure. I’m still incredibly hung up on her. However, I’ve made some friends on the internet that have been helpful. A couple of them are guys. (I’m a bi female) they have expressed attraction to me. I tell them it wouldn’t be fair to them since I’m still hung up on my ex. They say dating someone else will help me get over it but I just don’t think it’d be right of me when the whole time I’d be wishing they were my ex. However I’m a very open person. I don’t mind talking about sex, I find it kinda interesting to share interests. Two of the people I’m talking to know I like to be dominate and will sometimes say things to egg that on like “what are you going to do if I don’t?” I am in no way attracted to these men, their personalities are nice and they’re fine looking but there are things I don’t mind in a friendship that I know I would mind in a relationship, and I’m not physically attracted to them even though they’re fine looking they just aren’t my type. However, when they use those kind of phrases I kinda like to tease them, idk why I’m so embarrassed. I really enjoy teasing them but it’s not even sexual because I’m not getting sexual gratification out of it, I’m not turned on, I’m not thinking about them in that way so why do I enjoy riling them up. Some of you might say “well have a casual thing, be flirty, there doesn’t have to be sex, just have an internet fling” but I wouldn’t want that because again I’m not attracted to them so it would be kinda sucky for them if they were to be like “how do I make you feel? You like that?” Kind of thing because I’d be feeling nothing. I’m so petrified they’ll catch feelings, but then go against my better judgement and use teasing phrases and such. I think I’m just an attention whore, I miss my ex so badly that I’m being awful. I feel so guilty. I want to know why I like this attention so much. I feel like an awful human because I’m flirting but not attracted to them. Does this mean I’m lacking empathy?

I am a type of a person who plans ahead of life but due to sone personal conflicts, I got lost and I really dont want to do right now..

here is the possible scenarios Ive been playing in my head, before, I really thought that after this, I will find a decent work, pass the boards then try to make my own company with my SO who also knows a thing or two about the business, this is where I met him and everythings fine until that ""conflict"" happened...

Its been really months of deprrssion and meds dont work, I am just a human tyring to get by evryday with nothing to look forward to, until I saw sonething that made ne remeber what I really liked as a child..

Science, Im just an average human but I quite excel in this stuff since gradeschool ang been through a lot of quiz bees, i really dreamt that someday I will be working in a lab coat and not a hardhat and safety boots..

it kinda ignited hope in me and ither things to look forward to but afraid that I cant do anything to pursue it...

My ex and I talk every week. We text daily and talk on the phone every week. 

We always talk on the phone for three or more hours. He recently told me that he is so happy he has me to talk to because it doesn’t seem like anyone understands his job and it’s hard to relate. I told him that of course it’ll be hard to relate but that happens for everyone and that owning a company can be difficult because you’re at the top and usually there aren’t as many colleagues at his level. 

Anyways he said it was nice to talk and said goodbye. He said bye funny and I told him he sounded like my favorite tv character. He laughed and paused and said “for real. I really miss talking to you and really enjoy talking to you and can’t wait to speak again...” I told him I am too and That we weren’t friendly for a few years and I regret that but he truly is my oldest friend.

He is a really great guy and treats her so well and they are very happy together. But at the end of the day, it still hurts that I can’t be that person she calls baby or reminds her of how funny, beautiful, and artistic she is every day. Obviously since she’s dating him she set boundaries with me that I absolutely respect. I dunno this is getting very rambly, long story short this has been on my mind for quite some time, and I don’t really have anyone else I feel comfortable enough talking about this with...

432,"Over the two years I have dated him I have grown to despise that woman. She reminds me a lot of the stepmother from Cinderella, making him do chores around the house and take care of their countless dogs and cats while she only cuddles and plays with them. She even goes as far as to make him bring her things and make her coffee. I'm not exaggerating when I say that she treats him like a slave. Her justification is that he lives under her roof and doesn't pay rent so he has to 'pay' through work. He's still in high school and at the moment he's in quarantine, of course, but even back when he was still going to school she would often make him stay home to do chores with no way for me or his friends to contact him. Since I turned 18 before him I have tried calling CPS twice but all they ever did was show up to their house, ask some questions and leave. In fact, this would get her angry and punish him (thanks CPS, reaaally nice job there) and one of her favourite punishments, aside from hitting him, is taking away anything he can entertain himself with. Phone, video games, art supplies. She has yelled at him and abused him in front of other people, usually his friends, as well as in public so I have no idea how CPS can be so ignorant. She doesn't know that her son is gay and has a boyfriend (me that is, obviously) but if she found out she would definitely forbid him from seeing me. All of this psychological abuse has taken a toll on his mental health and has resulted in him suffering from bipolar, trichotillomania and suicidal depression. Despite all this he cares immensely about her feelings and tries desperately and unsuccessfully to be on good terms with her. I know that this is common for victims of abuse but it's extremely hard to watch. Today he broke his mom's tablet after stealing it to talk to me and his friends. He freaked out and had a severe panic attack/ depressive bipolar episode. I tried my best to calm him (we were talking over discord) and tell him that if anything it serves her right. He then started talking about how all he does is hurt his mother and make her hate him. That it would be best if he killed himself. This got me very emotional and in the heat of the moment I told him that I can no longer watch this. I told him that he can not care both about my feelings and what I want for him while still caring about his mother and what she wants for him. As long as he wants to please her, we will not be able to follow through with our plans of moving together when I go to college. That he has to start making plans of escaping her. He told me that he chooses me and will try to somehow move in with his grandma for a while until we can move together, after which he calmed down. I feel terrible though. No matter how abusive his mother is, making someone choose between their parent and yourself feels so, so wrong and egotistical. Besides he was not himself in that moment which makes it even more toxic. I apologised to him for saying those things and he says that it was okay and justified but I want to know what people who aren't involved in this think about how I behaved here and what I should do.",28May2020,1

437,"TL;DR: my fiancé got charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct. I feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back, but I'm being urged to reconsider by his family. If I leave, what do I need to do?

---

Late last night, at around 10:30pm I was awakened by extremely loud music and shouting. I thought it was one of the neighbors so I tried my best to ignore it. After about 5 or so minutes passed, I got up to look through the blinds because it was still happening. Along with the shouting I heard other people yelling. That's when I saw the familiar headlights of my fiancé's car. My car alarm also went off but was stopped (he has spare keys for my car). I don't know if he did that by accident or not for my attention.

I went downstairs and listened for his voice again to make sure if it was him or not. He yelled again, saying at the top of his lungs that he's home. After much hesitation, I finally opened the door and walked outside.

I saw him playing his music at max volume while sitting on the top of his car. When I walked up to him and the car, I noticed how completely awful his parking was. He was diagonal and I'm very surprised he didn't hit my car. I asked him what the hell he was doing. Every time I asked a question, he would just repeat it and not give an answer. I asked what all he drank and if he took anything. I had never seen him act this way in the 6 years we'd been together.

After not getting answers, I walked inside and proceeded to call his mother multiple times as well as his step-dad. He came inside and told me I had nothing to worry about. Then he went back outside and started yelling again. A police officer arrived and asked him a few questions. While doing so, my fiancé kept telling me to go inside and that he'd handle everything. I hesitantly did while still trying to get ahold of his mother or step-dad. I was doing this because he had been over at their house since early evening.

I finally got ahold of his mother and asked her numerous questions; what did he drink (he's supposed to stay away from liquor), how much, if he was on any pills, what pills they were, etc. While talking to her, fiancé was going in and out of the house, taunting the police with insults. The last time in doing so, I followed him outside because I had noticed another officer.

After more insults, police finally arrested him. While they were cuffing him, fiancé was telling me to go inside and that he'd handle everything. When I refused, he told me something along the lines of, ""Listen to me when I'm telling you to do something, goddammit."" I, along with one of the officers, told him not to speak to me that way.

They walked him to the police car and afterwards an officer came back to speak with me. While he was talking to me my fiancé's step-dad showed up. At this point it was around 11:30pm. The officer explained what had happened and that fiancé was staying in jail until he blows all zeros in a breathalyzer. I had called his mother and step-dad to pick fiancé up before he got himself arrested, but it had been too late.

I talked with step-dad and found out that fiancé and his mother had gotten drunk off of wine and smoked a lot of pot. I feel like there has to be more than that added in because he's had a lot of wine before, along with pain pills, and still didn't act like this.

My fiancé is an alcoholic and he admits it. Before he went over to his mom's house, all throughout the night before and into the late morning he had been drinking. He had downed maybe close to 20 beers (there are 2 partially full boxes of packs of 15).

I've been sick on and off with nausea and vomiting, so I've been staying in bed. Had I known he was going out, I would have tried to stop him.

Step-dad told me that he tried to get fiancé to stay at their place because he was clearly drunk, but fiancé and his mother protested, saying he was fine to leave.

Step-dad told me to sleep on it when I said I wanted to end the relationship. When fiancé drinks, he's just so... mean. He was actually sober for a couple years until he went back to his hometown back in September. I don't know what happened while he was in his hometown, but something changed inside of him and it's gotten worse over the months.

I told step-dad this. That fiancé had changed a lot and I'm sure the pandemic didn't help at all. However, other things changed. He's been on FLMA/Short-term for a long time now for depression and now for pandemic reasons. In this time he's been at work for maybe a total of 3 weeks since last year.

Even though he's been at home, he doesn't help with anything around the house. I clean the kitchen, dishes, litterboxes, feed the cats, clean the bathroom, cook, pay bills, take out the trash, etc. He sits or lays on the couch all day playing a game on his phone. He's actually obsessed with it, having maxed out my credit card on it (I don't use the credit card and I should also mention that he's the one making payments on it).

I want to end everything, but step-dad is telling me to sleep on it. That the both of us just need to talk about it all. But I have tried talking, but it's a cycle. After I mention concerns, things get better for a few days then goes back to how it was. What I say gets dismissed.

Still, apart of me wants to try and talk things out again, hoping that this is a wake up call for him. But I have strong doubts. Later I want to go get a new apartment, take one of the 3 cats with me, and just try to distance myself.

Despite wanting this, I also recognize that this is also going to be expensive. I'm also under his insurance so I'd have to get that on my own. I also have to consider what breaking our current lease will do. I feel stuck on all sides.

I should also mention I have no family here with me. They're all on the other side of the country and I also don't have any friends outside of work (I'm very introverted, so that's my doing not fiancé's).

444,"This is something I think I feel uncomfortable with talking about but after getting barely any sleep just now, I think I need to talk to someone about it to get some advice. Over the past few years I've had pretty bad anxiety about a lot of things but I've also had a pretty harsh fear that occasionally springs up on me. I won't be able to sleep, I'll start checking around the place for it and I'll be terrified that something's going to happen. The problem is I know it's completely irrational. I found I was able to really help my anxiety with Brazilian jiu jitsu, but with the lockdown that's not really possible. The fear is coming back and I'm having trouble sleeping because of paranoia of this thing attacking me. A while back my therapist offered to look at it with me which helped it for quite a while when we looked at it together. I'm embarrassed talking about this but I feel like it's worth explaining what the fear is. Bare with me because it's both irrational, ridiculous and to people who won't get it, hilarious. But I literally can't sleep because of this thing so at least it'll be some fun. 

Ok, have you seen a movie called ""Sleepaway Camp""? Yeah, I told you this would be funny. For those of you who have seen it, you'll know exactly what it is I'm talking about. For those of you who haven't, either watch the movie, it's honestly a good movie and really great fun, or watch the last scene to get an idea of what I'm talking about. I won't spoil things but at the end, there's a very elaborate plot twist that makes the killer get revealed with this enormously creepy smile on their face and about 10 other things that make it terrifying. I know it's silly but I'm checking behind couches making sure that this person with this face and all the other stuff aren't there, I'm afraid they'll appear in the dark and all this shit that I'm terrified of. 

So I was thinking of doing what helped me a while ago with looking at the face, however, with my girlfriend, who's really familiar with both my anxiety and fear of this scene. I wanted to know if it's a good idea to watch the whole thing start to finish, making things not quite as bad as I'll be familiar with it more, less afraid of not knowing and I'll have viewed it with someone and in a place that both make me comfortable. Apologies for not being very concise, but I suppose explaining it helps as well. 

Should I watch this with her to get this thing through with and not be afraid of it or are there other things I can do to fix the problem? Thank you all.",28May2020,1

446,"Hi reddit. First time posting. As the title says, I need advice about a strange smell. I live with my best friend and it's just the 2 of us. Late last night I started smelling a burnt rubber smell in my room. First thing I did was text my roomie if she was smoking pot. She didn't answer so I checked her room and it smelt fine. I later realized her room didn't pick up any smell because she has her window open and fan on. (We'll get there) 

So I googled what the smell potentially meant and most posts said a furnace or dryer was acting up. So I checked every appliance and didn't smell the same scent. And  most things were either off, or had their own unique scent that wasn't anywhere near what I was smelling. (A/C was off all night).

So I thought it was coming from outside and closed all the windows. However, that's when it got worse. I walked around and smelled everything. I then realized it was the air that smelt bad. Closing the windows made it worse because it was clearly coming from inside the apartment building. 

I called some friends and they said it was likely the neighbors. I decided to Google ""drugs that smell like burnt rubber"" (sounds funny, but I had my suspicions). Google told me that crack cocaine is likely the culprit. 

Now thats where I need advice. I left the apartment to my boyfriends house before the 2nd Google search because the smell was making me gag. And now I don't know what to do. My roommate was asleep the whole time and she couldn't smell it with the window and fan anyway. But the scent followed my clothes and blankets. Regardless whether the scent is drugs from my neighbors, or an electrical emergency, I don't know if I should call the police. My roomie is an avid pothead, and the apartment smells like weed all the time. And she has soooo much drug paraphernalia in her room. We also may or may not have some road signs that we don't wanna get in trouble for. 

So what do I do? Do I call the cops and have them investigate the neighbors? Do I call the maintenance guy to look at our appliances? Because that would take weeks to get him in. Our supers are not reliable and tend to neglect residents. (They didn't charge us rent for 2 months until we pestered them to get it fixed so we could pay it). 

Sorry for long post. But I'm at a loss. I can't live in this apartment with that smell going on. And I don't know the best thing to do here. 



Also, sorry if I sound like a Karen asking what the ""strange skunk smell from my sons room is"". This is a first time experience for me.",28May2020,1
448,"My 16 year old cousin is dating a 29 year old adventist (everyone sees this as a massive red flag) who lives in a village pretty 
 far from our city (30 miles away). They met at a redlight with their choppers (motorbikes) and got to know each other after some time and after a few months they ""fell in love"". From what I know about his backstory, he moved to Spain with his family after their home burned down in our current country and when he returned he opened a small bussiness but nobody quite knows how he got money for it or what the bussiness implies. It is really shady. My uncle and aunt are not ok with their daughter's relationship and even threatened to sell her chopper yesterday if she didn't break up with him, causing her to go hysterical and start crying.

My uncle is a policeman and asked his buddies at the precinct to see if he has any criminal records (unbeknownst to my cousin). My cousin doesn't see any red flags and noone can talk sense into her. We are afraid that her reputation might also be tarnished as we live in a small town and new go around fast. I am also afraid she might run away with him or be disowned. What should my family do?

So.. A couple days ago I came to wake my sister up for something, and she was asleep, just wearing no shirt or bra with shorts. She’s done this since we were kids. But I realized she was on discord FaceTime? Her iPad was faced the other way, so I couldn’t get a good look where the camera was faced. I tried moving my foot (her mattress is on the floor) and I was looking for any sign of movement and I didn’t see any.. I asked her why in the world she was on FaceTime. She told me she “forgot”. I just let it go, but was worried because she had instances of sending nudes back when we were apart for a couple years. (Custody issues).
Anyways, we recently took in another cat- and we can’t let him out into the rest of the house until he calms down and gets used to our house. It was 4am and he was scratching at the door and meowing really loudly again. So I knocked on my sisters door and asked her to give him attention, or I will come get him. She sounded really panicked and told me she was really busy, and I got the hint and walked away

 I know she has a vibrator and wasn’t surprised was I heard it turn back on again.. But I heard a male voice I had recognized. (He has an Australian accent). It was muffled but I could tell it was him. My sister has been talking to him constantly lately. She was saying muffled things too.. I’m not sure if that was talking or “talking”. I went back into the game room (it’s right by her bedroom and I’s) and I heard her talking to him, much clearer again. If I was imagining her talking to him while doing ... that. I would take that into possibility. But I heard the.. thing stop and she started talking again. I didn’t stop and hear what she was saying because I didn’t want to hear it. But I found it really strange that I would hear her talking to him immediately right after- and not hear any dialing tone or something (she doesn’t have headphones). 
She told me her and her boyfriend are on break.. but he recently came over and I caught them in the act doing something, (not that I mind. I’m happy she’s with someone!) But I’ve never been on “break” in a relationship, so I don’t think you would be doing stuff like that if you’re on a break. (Correct me if I’m wrong). 
I’m not sure what to do.. I don’t have concrete proof, I can’t ask my friends for advice because that would be violating my sisters privacy. I’m not sure what the child pornography laws are where I live.. and I can’t exactly google that. I don’t wanna be a snitch and lose my sisters trust (we’re supposed to be going on a trip to our grandmas by ourselves this summer- I still want her trust but if I told on her it would make the trip miserable as well). I know my sister is gullible and I don’t want her doing something that could put her in danger. (From previous experiences with her). I’m all for her exploring her sexuality and stuff..but doing it on camera in front of adults is illegal and not to mention creepy on the adults side. (He’s 18.)  I’m probably going to be deleting this account soon- I don’t want anyone to find it. What should I do?

Tl;dr I think my sister is masturbating on camera with older guys. I don’t know 100%, maybe 90%.",28May2020,1
450,"Hi, this is probably the wrong advice but I just want to get something off my chest. I've been around people who are better at me at almost everything. Tiffany (not real name) is smarter and prettier than me, and is better at my own passions (English, DIT, art) than me. Tony (another fake name) is again smarter than me, and is better than my passions of drama and science. A couple other people are maths geniuses or great athletes, or are absolute pro at Minecraft pvp, redsfons, etc.

You see, because everyone is better than me at my own passions and other stuff, too, I grasp onto the one passion that I'm truly best at: Minecraft building. As childish as it may sound, because I'm good at it, and because people praise me for being such a great builder (my friends), I love it so much. It makes me feel like I have actual worth.

But, Brian (fake name) says he better than me because he had a higher build battle rank (in which, in solo build battle people tend to vote good for bad builds and bad for good builds to gain points for themselves, though actually ruin the system because of how many people do it), and he built bad builds. This isn't just me being salty; he admitted it at the time.

Now, Tony (who gets A’s at everything) is trying to build a pirate ship after I failed at my attempt. I'm afraid that he going to do better, and that everyone will further praise him for all his talents and I won't be praised for a single thing no more. All my friends are praised, and I feel worthless without something to be praised by. Minecraft building is just a part of me.

I understand this sounds really childish, but minecraft building is something I've held strongly onto to help my self-esteem for a long time. Anyone has any advice- about building, or passions, self-esteem- anything? It would be greatly appreciated.",28May2020,1
451,"Hi r/advice. In a few weeks I have to move to Australia by myself, and the law requires that you have to stay in the hotel room for 14 days without leaving. Because of a few mental health complications, I'm terrified of this. I can foresee extreme mental breakdowns that will happen after the first day. As it is right now, I have to leave the house every hour or so, otherwise I get anxious. I don't know how I can do it for 14 days. Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with this?",28May2020,1
452,So I recently stumbled upon my first real girlfriend's Instagram page and idk what to do. Like we dated back in 2014 for 4yrs but broke up because of long distance which never works but somehow I still find myself thinking about her like shes always in the back of my mind. However in 2018 she messaged saying she was in town for a while and ask if I wanted to hangout of course I said yes. After a few days I told her I still have feelings for her and she said she does too so we tried again but once more it didn't work cause of the distance and since then we haven't talked. I want to message  her but from what I can tell she has a whole new life and I dont want to be a bother.,28May2020,1
453,"(Sorry for formatting I’m on the app)

I think I just had an anxiety attack

My girlfriend was on FaceTime with me when it happened and talked me through it. After I calmed down, she asked if I wanted to talk about it. I said I need to cool off more so I don’t start back up so we watched some tv on FaceTime then I was like okay I’m ready if that’s cool and she was like alrighty then let’s figure it out. 

I then proceed to vent my deepest fears and anxieties that I have never told anyone before now to her and after about 5 or 6 minutes, she falls completely asleep.

Is it okay for me to feel at least a little hurt by that?",28May2020,1
454,"Hello, I can't believe I'm turning to Reddit for this, but I'm really overthinking trying to figure out the right thing to do here. I have a friend and I will call her Lisa for this post. There is a guy who I will call Chad in this post who developed feelings for Lisa like 2 weeks ago. Lisa called me yesterday to get my opinion on something very important to her, and it ended up being that she was starting to consider dating Chad.

Here is the issue. I have absolutely no respect for Chad right now and he has extremely disappointed me as a friend. Not to mention I also have feelings for Lisa, but I choose to not date her right now for certain reasons. Let's just say that I think she should not focus on getting attached to 1 person right now for her own mental health... So I put my feelings aside simply because I don't think its right atm. She also had feelings for me, but I didn't take the opportunity for quite a bit for what I believe to be good reasons.

In the past, Chad and I liked the same girl who I will call Lay Lay. I liked her first and spent more time with her even. Eventually, he developed feelings for Lay Lay and started to openly flirt with her without any regards for the feelings he knew I had. He even went as far as to ask the girl out behind my back and told her not to tell me (She told me immediately). I confronted him about this, and he just simply admitted that he was not being his best self. Now to the current stuff... Once again we both liked Lisa (New girl) and he asked her out behind my back, and she ended up telling me immediately. He did not tell me himself and he knew that I would not be pleased about his attempt. I'm disappointed in Chad because it seems like he is willing to step over me who is supposed to be his ""friend"" to get what he wants. I feel disgusted with him because he is just not a very good friend... If he would show a little courtesy since he knows I had feelings in both cases... I probably would not be so disgusted. But he went for the kill twice. I never asked out the girls that we happened to both have feelings because it felt kinda messy since he was involved...  and I didn't want to be a party to the situation.

Lisa rejected Chad the first time he tried to ask her out, but now she is starting to consider dating him. I guess she wants my approval and she wanted to know if I would still be her friend if she started dating Chad. She is aware of how disgusted I am with him, so she was worried about my response. Unfortunately... I told her that I would have a hard time stomaching it and I would not be able to be around her as much. Maybe not even be friends anymore because she knows full well just how much my experience with Chad hurt me the first time. I told her that I don't think Chad is that great of a guy because of how he handled the situation twice now. And his big ego is immediately noticed by most people that hang out with him... Chad is not the most humble person, and I really just don't have a good opinion on him at all. He even lied one time about a story of his past to make himself look good, but eventually one of the people involved in the story revealed the truth... And he simply admitted he lied. So I told her that I would be disappointed in her if she started dating Chad and that I would distance myself. This seemed to really hurt her and she told me she won't do it. But I see Chad as a dishonest and unloyal person. I do not like deception... I do not like big egos... And I do not like how he is able to do things that he knows full well will hurt a friend but goes for it anyway because of his own greed and desires.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanna know what you guys think. Is my response toward her justified? Am I overreacting or am I being unfair in any way? I want to do the right thing. Every bone in my body is telling me to be blunt with her about how I feel about this... which is that I'm not going to stick around to accept her and chad dating. But I don't want to cause anyone pain or make them feel bad. Am I being immature maybe? Just be honest with me cause I'm honestly stuck. If I am wrong here... I will try my best to reflect and I will perhaps change my mind for the sake of doing the right thing. I just don't think Chad is good :/ Like geez if someone that I respected were to start dating her... I would not mind so much. But I have 0 respect for Chad because of his actions, lies, and his failure to do right by his ""friend"" Sorry, this post is such a mess.",28May2020,1
455,"sorry for any run on sentences, english isn’t my first language 

on friday i have a date with my boyfriend who i haven’t seen since roughly 67-69 days. quarantine where i live started on march and i’ve been at home the whole time, only leaving twice for a medical appointment for an eye exam and to get my stuff from my locker (both i was wearing a mask, gloves, etc) at home i’ve been following procedure, as well as my parents who leave often for medical reasons and academic reasons. we all clean everything we’ve used outside very thoroughly, to the point where my mom has ruined receipts bcz she cleaned them with too much alcohol lol. 

my boyfriend has also followed the rules, but has left only to other family gatherings. his parents are divorced so he stayed most of the time with his mom and her bf (both of which have only left to his mom’s bf parent’s house) and has recently gone to his dad’s house. 

here’s where i need advice. we’re going somewhere with a lot of space and fresh air, but idk if i should hug or kiss him and all that jazz. i’m worried about the covid situation, but i still missed him a lot and want physical affection. we’ll both be wearing masks and i’ll be bringing a lot of hand sanitizer and alcohol in case of anything. what do you guys think?",28May2020,1

457,"So my girls friend took my virginity last night. It was amazing, and I love her because not only did she do that, but she’s also an awesome person and my best friend.

Fast forward, night two, we plan on sex again. But this time, at her house, with weed. It was so risky but I wanted to spend more time with her and smash again. So did sex on her bed after she snuck me in. And she’s teaching me how sex is. And after we feel great and cuddle for a couple hours.

Then we decide to smoke. We smoke outside on her roof and go back inside into her room when we starting feeling high.

But the bad thing was that we were too high to be quiet. Her mom knocks on the door, but there is nowhere to hide. I hide behind a divider like an idiot with nowhere to hide. The mom finds me fucking naked. She leaves saying “oh my GOD!”

I put my clothes back on and gather my things. The last thing gf said to me was “I don’t think we’re gonna talk for a while. Her step father comes up, and I’m fucki if terrified. I’m still high so I’m extremely scared of him. He tells me to get the hell outta his house.

I said “yes sir” and he followed me through his house to make sure I got the FUCK out. After he lets me outside, I fucking RUN. I’m in the ghetto, running for my life, even though her step dad isn’t chasing me. 

One thing I forgot, as I was leaving, the mom asked me “have you been smoking weed?” (They asked her that before they even found me). And me, being a dumbass narc and a shitty bf, says “yes.” The mom thanks me for my honesty and the dad escorts me out while he probably uses ever fiber of his being to not fucking murder me.

Anyway, after I run to my car, I almost cry. But I kept it together so I could get home. I could have gotten arrested for DUI if a cop had seen me. I drive aimlessly until I see that no cars are behind me, then I make the GPS take me home.

Now I’m home, but terrified. What are they going to do with my gf? I love her. Typing this while still high, but I’m not trying to brag about it like those (who else high af rn) Instagram bots.

But will the stepdad try to find out who I am and call the Police? (I’m 19 and she’s 17 in the USA). Maybe he’ll try to get the cops to put a warrant on my arrest for breaking and entering (she broke me in). What if she lies and says I raped her? (I don’t think she’ll do that, but if she does, that would mean she doesn’t care about me). The stepdad didn’t seem angry, but I felt like he would try to kill me?

How can I sleep rn knowing that the girl I love is in super deep trouble, AND that maybe her parents are out to get me now? I am extremely worried

Also my family is EXTREMELY religious. I’m not religious anymore because I spent a lot of time away from my family in my room. My gf is so stupid for screaming during sex. She told me to be quiet and then fucking fake orgasms her parents awake. As I was saying, my family is religious, and they think I’m religious too. If I get in trouble for this, they’ll know I’m not a Christian anymore. My parents wouldn’t love me as much if they knew I weren’t christian. I Reeallly hope the parents don’t get involved with my parents in ANNY WAY. Unless it’s at our wedding.

I went through a traumatic experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. No matter how high I was, I will Never forget the fear I felt when her parents discovered me and escorted me out. I want them to be cool with it. But at the same time. I’m still glad I got to spend this time with my gf. I can perfectly picture her lying in my arms looking at memes with me. I just wish she hadn’t screamed. I regret going to her house now. I should have known something would go terribly wrong once we started smoking weed. It’s like all the worst parts of a porno. You get caught. That’s it. Now get the fuck outta me house before I fucking murder you.

Reddit please help me. What do I do about the parents? I’m really scared of them. Also I don’t want my christian family to know I smoked. OR HAD SEX. My dad might be proud I lost my virginity, but that pride probably wouldn’t las long

Before I go to sleep, I NEED to know what I can do about these overbearing fears?

And I know your advice will be to “DONT GO OVER SOME GURL’S HOUSE WHEN IT’S P DEMIC SEASON” BUT I THINK I LEARNED THAT LESSON BY NOW!",28May2020,1

459,"I'm a M21 living in Singapore. I had an argument with my parents regarding my decision to defer college and was wondering what I should do

I finished my National Service in Feb, and was supposed to head to college in the US in March. However, the ongoing pandemic caused problems in doing so. The decision was made to defer from March to June to see how the situation would play out.

In April, the school announced that students would be able to start their courses in their home countries online. However, I would have to account for the time difference between the US and Singapore to attend my classes. As the classes I would be taking is not confirmed yet, I am looking at the possibility of having classes from 11pm to 7-8am, which I was told by a friend's friend (who is doing the same thing I would be doing in Singapore regarding college) is the latest time her school would have classes.

To me, this is a problem as during my National Service, I had night shifts where i would be working from 8pm to 8am the next day. I know how tiring it is to stay awake and focused throughout the night, even if I took a nap in the afternoon. Thus, I am fearful that this would impact my studies. Furthermore, not knowing if I would have breaks between my classes so that I could take a nap and recharge before my next lesson makes me hesitant.

The next option would be to travel to the US and start there, but I am not sure if I should travel to the US in June. Furthermore, it would be Summer, and I do not think that there will be many people on campus. I would like a fruitful college experience, being able to study internationally, and would like to make friends and attend classes like a regular student. My college announced plans to hold classes in person in the Fall with preventive measures in place, but is dependent on the situation.

Thus, I decided to defer again to September, and hopefully start college in the US. However, my parents do not agree as they want me to start ASAP. I have expressed my views to them numerous times, but they dismissed it saying ""So many people can do it"", and that I was making them worried as ""I would be taking longer to become financially-independent"". The fact that most of my relatives and siblings have finished college, and I have yet to start worries them (Note: I was the only one to undergo 2 yrs of National Service, and I am the youngest amongst my relatives). In addition,I was held back a year in school, making my parents anxious to for me to ""catch-up"" to my peers.

Due to my decision, my parents want nothing to do with me. I understood that by doing so, I would be disrespecting my parents wishes and causing them stress in the reasons stated above. However, I feel like this is my college experience, and I would like to choose how it would be like, which is where I feel I may be selfish

Therefore, I would really like some advice on how to handle this situation. If i should stick to my decision, give in to my parents wishes, or if there was any other way around it. TYVM for your help :)",28May2020,1

471,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

So, I’m a junior in high school and decided that since I did not feel confident with the material, I was going to cheat on my Chemistry final exam. I worked with two other people and shared answers, turned it in, and forgot about.

I received an email yesterday from my teacher saying that there were troubling similarities with other students on the test. Saying that 8-9 questions had similar wrong work and answers (keep in mind I completed about 15 questions in total. I’ve been asked to submit a personal statement and from there, I will either be charged or not charged. If charged, I’ll go to a hearing and found guilty or not guilty.

As you can see, the evidence is pretty damning. I figured that since we were at home that cheating wouldn’t be taken seriously and that I could just refute any accusation. I see now that I was wrong. 

I know what I did was wrong, there is no question about it. I’ve communicated with the other kids I cheated with and I initially agreed that we should just refute the accusation and say it’s a coincidence. The reason being the test was open note and open book and we could just say that we shared notes with each other before the exam. 

I’m having reservations now. This is has never happened to me and although one of the kids I’ve cheated with has already submitted her statement, I’m feeling like I should just come clean. I’m afraid of losing my opportunities and looking back on the exam, I had absolutely no reason to cheat, but I did it anyway, and I’m a dumbass for it. I’ve prepped a personal statement that advocates for my innocence, but I feel like it’s just a waste of time. What’re the chances that those similarities were all just a coincidence?

I’m just kind of lost. I know what the right thing to do is, but it seems like the punishment will be the same either way and that just simply doesn’t feel like an option to me. I want to get you all’s perspective and hopefully I can move from there.",28May2020,1

For about 3 days during isolation, my mind was back abd forth about our relationship. I had NO idea what I wanted and I could not make any sense of it. We met up and while talking he was saying how he wanted to work through it and I was saying how something (could not work out what) did not feel right anymore. We continued, ended up with him saying we could not go on a break either it was done or we stay together. It coukd not stay as it was so I said it seems we had to break up. Neither of us at the time really wanted to.
I did some soul searching and realised the problems I was having with us were internal and about myself. I realised I lost an amazing thing so tried to get him back but he said he needed time and space.
It had been 6 days and I sent him a messgae saying i was thinking of him and hoping he was okay, that when he was ready i was here to hear the answer. This made him panic and he called me that evening saying he could not lead me on anymore because he had no answer so he was just going to call it quits for good. I obviously spoke to him and said don't make an answer you are not certain about, that is how we got into this mess. We spoke a bit about us, I spoke about how our next time would be different if he gave us the chance but he is stuck in this negative rut of thinking about all the bad and none if the good.
My thing is, we were and are both SO confused. Neither of us know what to do and we are both just back and forth about it constantly. I wonder if we both forced ourselves to come up with answers to end the cycke rather than actually thinking it through at all. How do we stop this? What should we do?
I am hoping for a chance because how do you know things won't change unless you give it a go, especially when someone really wants to make the effort to.

478,"First off, Im from India, where most people are still prickly about the idea of dating. But for the teenagers since it's basically the ""forbidden fruit"" everyone wants a piece.

So when i was 15 and still in the stupid phase of teen years, i changed schools. The school (let's call it B) i transferred to was a bit more posh and 70% of the students were into casual dating. In an effort to fit in and be ""cool"", I lied to my peers that i had one ex from my previous school, thinking that it would impossible for them find the truth anyway. It was during this time that figured out that i was Bisexual (another prickly topic), and i was unsure on how to tell my friends. 

Ive know my friends from school A since we were kids and we share almost everything with each other, but i didn't think they would take me seriously when i came out to them or would simply brush it off.
This is were i complicated things.
To prove that I was Bi, i told my friends i was dating a girl in school B and gave them a name and photo (idiotic move ik). I wasn't particularly close with this girl, she was simply a part of my group of friends.
Now, my 16 year old self firmly believed there was nothing wrong with this and i would be able to get away with this lie.

The kicker is that now, after having moved on to college, this girl and i have become quite close, found that we were similar in nature and text everyday now.
She is straight and i am not romantically attracted to her at all. I was still not worried about my lie being caught.

Now, im in college in a different state, and recently found out that classmate likes me and wanted to ask me out. It was then it hit me, no one here knows about the lies, but after a year of growth, i realized i didn't want to lie anymore. I rejected them, mostly because i realised i wasn't ready for a relationship but if i dated my classmate, i would have to tell them i had no prior experiences with dating and the truth about above stuff. This would worry me for any future partner as well because i want to be honest with them

484,"I need help and I'm not sure what to do. I found out about 2 months ago that my girlfriend had allegedly been sexually assaulted by a local celebrity, CJ Pearson. (Featured on Fox News, many right wing media outlets, etc.) I am posting this asking for help in understanding what a next step should be with her permission.

I attended high school with CJ and during that time I heard many different rumors about sexual misconduct, but I shrugged it off mostly because I had never personally talked to any of his victims, and I figured there wasn't much that could be done about it anyhow because it was all hearsay.

Recently, a little over 2 months ago, my girlfriend informed me of her own personal encounter with this guy. Being a victim of false accusations from women myself, I have been pretty hesitant to really act on it. Not only that, but I figured it must be a sensitive topic of discussion for my gf so I didn't pursue anything further until about a month ago. When we did speak about it, she provided me with details of what happened which I wrote down and a picture confirming multiple details of her story including the place it happened. It has been bothering me so much lately and I need to know what to do. Any help? (For context this happened in 2018.) 

(Tldr: My girlfriend was allegedly sexually assaulted by a local politician/social media figure and we have no clue what to do)

485,"Throw-away account. I'm three years out of college and have no idea what to do with my life, and constantly feel stressed but sweep it under the rug. I'm really good at acting like I have everything together, and to a certain extent I'm doing alright but I feel anxiety constantly that I'm just not there yet, wherever there is. 

I've got a good paying job that I hate, and am stressed about the professional world. I do sales. I did alright at my last job but I don't know if I can do it anymore. I feel like if I don't do sales I'm a failure. My father does sales and he's really successful and I want to build something great like he did (as in a family with security), but sometimes I feel I'd be happier if I had a job that paid half as much with half as much responsibility, where I was on my feet all day instead of a computer, but then I'd barely have enough money to save anything. 

I had a successful band in college and think I'm a good songwriter and if I get the right people together that there's a shot at a rough career. I'm pursuing that when I'm not working and kind of want to just do that and go balls to the wall and wreck myself and if it works out I'll be happy but if it doesn't I'll be trashed. I have enough set aside to quit my job and pursue this for at least 6 months. 

I saw a doctor about ADD because I need SOMETHING (adderall's great) to work or feel motivated to work (professionally - music is easy to focus on). I don't have adderall yet so I've been doing cocaine to work. I think I have dependency issues and always need to have SOMETHING (caffeine, marijuana, alcohol, cocaine... really whatever's in front of me, though I don't smoke MJ when I work). 

I've been on/off with my girlfriend for three years and I really love her, but I also constantly question if she's the one and think too much about other girls. It's a serious problem. But now we live together with all her pets I've also grown to love and it feels like too much but not living together means breaking up. But living together itself feels like I'm trapped on this road to marriage.

486,"A bit of context 
I started dating someone whilst I was applying to join the army but we fell in love and she didn't want me to go so I agreed to stay( I wasnt super in love with the army but I'd done poorly on my alevels so it was pretty much a last resort and I really didn't want to go to uni at the time). I worked as a chef to save some money so i could move in with her whilst she was at uni and I could support myself whilst I looked for an apprenticeship,  so I moved in with her at the beginning of her school year. When the money I'd saved ran out, I took up another chef job that I hated to maintain myself.

Eventualy I got sick of the job and decided I would go to uni, I chose the same one she was at(1st mistake) and signed a lease to live with her and 3 other 'friends' I was staying with at time(2nd mistake). 

Then quarantine happened and my mum broke her hip whilst she was out running so I came home to help out around the house. We agreed I wouldn't come back till after her exams so she could focus and I would come back the day of her last one.

After a few weeks she said she wanted some time after her exams to relax and I agreed so I said I'd be back a little later. After a while we  started calling less and less till she called and said that she wanted to rediscover herself and that she wanted to be more of an individual so after a few days not knowing what was gonna happen, she called and we broke up.

The roommates I'd had at the house, people I considered my best friends and even my family ditched me. 2 of them never texted me to see how I was not even on my birthday that was 4 days after the break up. One actually tried which I appreciated but hes recently stopped messaging me as well. I had to put down my dog a few days later because he had  blood cancer and again nothing from 2 of my old house mates.

When me and my girlfriend broke up i no longer wanted to move in with them so I got a lease reliquishment form and signed and sent it within a week. All they had to do was sign and send it to the agency for them to start to look for another tenant  or find one themselves but every time I messaged them they said another person from the house was gonna take it the next day or as one of them did repeatedly left my increasly frustrated messages on seen and this went on for almost 3 weeks. Eventually I had get my dad to drive me to the house(2.5 hours away each way) to pick up my stuff from my ex and hand in the letter. 

I have old friends that have luckily been there for me and kept me sane but I'm so angry not only with my ex as whenever i went on holiday or had to visit home i had to reassure her everything was gonna be okay when i got back but with my old house mates who turned their back on me the second we were over and didn't help by making the whole lease  problem that much more stressful. Also the housemate who was ignoring me was also someone my girlfriend had told me she had feeling for during the relationship but said the they weren't the same for the feeling she had for me and now apparently their getting extremely close and he was a massive insecurity for me in the relationship. I know I wasnt perfect in the relationship, that I could of done things better and I could of helped her grow more but I cant help feeling discarded and alone. There were problems but I thought we'd be able to sort them espicaly with me starting uni and  having more time free and feeling like I had a purpose again.

Any help about getting out of the lease and how to get over this would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry to  dump this on reddit but whenever I talk to my friends about it I feel like I'm bothering them and that I've bored them to death talking about it.

Also sorry for such a long post",28May2020,1
487,"A few years ago I was dating a guy and became friends with his group. After me and this guy broke up I had a pretty rough time and became good friends with one of the guys from the group.

We became close friends and he helped me get through the break up, we were completely platonic no kind of feelings just purely friendship. A few months later he confessed he has feelings for me and I politely told him I don't see him in that way and just want to stay good friends - which we did and it was all fine

He then moves on and gets a girlfriend so it's all good, we stay close friends and whatever 
But as time goes on I notice kind of weird behaviour, for example he's always overanalyzing me. Everything I post online he will message me about (even if it's just a boring selfie on Instagram) and it would be instantly after posting too, he also always messages me saying I l look really hot in my new post etc. and always pointing out that my other male friends are ""in love"" with me or trying to get with me, when they obviously aren't (I'm not oblivious to signs if they were)
He'd always be asking me to come round and watch films, and we did because we're good friends and it's nothing weird. But then he suggested we should ""platonically cuddle/spoon"" whilst doing so, which makes me a bit uncomfortable because to me, cuddling while watching a movie is a romantic thing.. I told him how I felt about this and he agreed and apologised for being weird

So I've been single and friends with this guy for about 2 years, and about 2 weeks ago I told him I'd met someone and started seeing him. I expected him to be pleased for me as he's always saying he wants me to meet someone good for me, etc. But he completely freaked out and told me he needed space and has been really off with me since. Whenever I ask him what the problem is he's extremely vague and says he's just ""coping with his feelings"". I only mentioned this new guy once, and immediately he asked me not to bring it up again - which I agreed to just to keep the peace. But it still seems ridiculous to me, it shouldn't be an issue in the first place 

I don't know if it's some form of jealousy/possessiveness that's made him feel this way. Or if he still has feelings for me despite having a long term girlfriend ? 
Another thing I'm questioning is that maybe he was planning to make a move on me if him and his gf break up, as they're having a bit of a rough patch at the moment and I've noticed him making more effort to speak to me and say more suggestive things since this begun. 

Just overall makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable, I feel sorry for his girlfriend that he's acting this way with me being a close female friend even though I've been trying to push it away, does anyone have any suggestions on what to do? I just want to have a normal friendship with him",28May2020,1

491,"One is dead, one is in a nursing home. Both of them had mental illnesses and very abusive behaviour. For some reason my sibling, while acknowledging the gravity and damage of what they did, insists that somehow they authentically loved us: this is not possible for a diagnosed narcissist and since the other has borderline problems and still abuses me I just don't think it's possible not even in theory. 

My sibling downplays the borderline abuse, basically my sibling don't take anything seriously from this parent and says I should just let the parent talk and give them those 5 minutes of phone conversation per week and visit that one time a month or every two months, and don't understand at all how painful it is for me. Perhaps I just want the surviving parent to shape up, ""come into senses"", but it hurts because even if the parent don't realise it they are being abusive and hurtful. They are not, and will never be, a normal parent, old or otherwise.

My sibling also think it's normal that our aunt, who helped us a lot, decide to put my father's remains in a columbarium higher instead of middle height because it would be ""closer to the sky"" in the religious sense. We are not religious at all, but the aunt is. My sibling let her make that choice, and my problem is that now it has ruined my relationship with the physical sky that I loved because it is now associated with my abusive father. I want to undo this psychological link, but my sibling thought it's not an issue at all...

I desperately want my sibling to be my best mate, ally, companion, because that would prove that we are a normal family in spite of what happened growing up. But I cannot cope with my pain being invalidated and her insistence that it's me who is taking everything personally or too forcefully.

501,"**Context:** I was born from a marriage that my grandmother never really accepted; my mom used to be in an arranged marriage with another man before she ran away from home with my father, however, they divorced when I was around 5. My grandmother always resented my mother for not following her demands; she wanted her to be a traditional housewife who would settle down in a house in our home country and my mother was the exact opposite of what she wanted. Due to this, my grandmother and my mom had an ongoing fight that lasted about 6 years until I came into the picture.

My grandmother is a very conservative person who gets very angry when things don't go her way and I  never understood why as a child, she got angry over the slightest things such as the way that I put tomatoes into the salad bowl first instead of the lettuce first and such. I often lashed out back at her for being so mad over nothing, and this would turn into loud arguments where my grandpa and mom had to come between to stop. My grandmother would remember every time I lashed out at her in the past and I would remember her negative attitude vice versa so that the next time we fought there was more fuel.

But as I grew older and my mom started to explain to me more about my grandmothers traumatic experiences living in the post-war era in Japan, and she was genuinely sad that I didn't get along with her own mother. From that, I stopped lashing out at my grandmother and starting agreeing to whatever she demanded. 

It would be easy to say that would be the end of the issue but I always felt that the whole ordeal was unfair to me, because in my eyes I had to be the bigger person as a teenager towards a senior that should know better than me. I had to be patient when she was taking out her anger on me and I always had to apologize so that she wouldn't spread her anger on everybody. 

I couldn't confront her on the unreasonable things that she has done to me, for example; during the time I got a high fever at 1am at 11 years old, she yelled at me and scolded me for getting a high fever in the first place, while my mom and my grandpa tried to look for medicine at the 24/7 drugstores around the area. 

Everything was ""going well"" in this manner until I exploded during dinner today. My grandmother was in a bad mood for some reason and she decided to take it out on my mom by criticizing how she accidentally overcooked flavored steamed rice for the second time this month. She calls my mom an ""actual retard"" for not being able to understand the things she did wrong after making the mistake for the first time. Everything that she did at that moment was so unreasonable and out of nowhere to me, that I exploded for the first time in a few years.

In hindsight, this was probably the worst thing that I could have done, but being emotional I ended up venting almost everything that I had been holding back on her the past few years. I confront her on how immature she is always staying in the past, and I confront her on all the unreasonable things she has said to me. She then told me to get out of the house if I hate being here so much and deflected my arguments by using sarcasm and mocking every word I said, she denied the experiences that I told her and calls me insane for making up those stories. During the argument she bashed my mom again for not settling down in the home country to afford a permanent house to live in, and refused to acknowledge her efforts she made as a single mom. 

I have lost all respect for my grandmother from her hurtful attitude in this confrontation, but at the same time I have caused the toxic cycle of fighting between my grandmother and I to start up again. I honestly feel so demotivated and hopeless to continue trying to keep this relationship at a somewhat neutral state, but my grandmother is getting older and I'm running out of time to make this work out.

I don't want to be unemphatic and have only memories of resentment towards my grandmother for the sake of my mom, and I fear that time is running out, I will be going off to college soon where I won't see my grandparents for a long time, and if anything happens to my grandmother, this is the last memory I would have of her. How do I reconcile or at least let us both move on from the incident before its too late?

TLDR; Grandmother and I have a very toxic relationship in the past, and I got into a huge fight with her again which reignited the cycle of fighting. I need help on how to reconcile so that I would have a decent memory of her before its too late.",28May2020,1

503,"My parents and full brother live in the West Midlands in England and my half bro has been living in Ireland (Republic of, not Northern - so outside the UK) with his step dad in recent months because he left his wife and subsequently split from the woman he left his wife for, so Ireland was a bit of a fresh start for him. This was all pre-lockdown in the UK. Not morally good, but there was a status quo.

Over the weekend, I learned that my half bro has now moved back in with my parents, despite the fact that he was social distancing and living safely in Ireland, making this move completely unnecessary. Apparently he's trying to make it work with the girl he left his wife for, but she lives a two hour drive away! To make matters worse, my dad said ok without consulting my mum or full bro. My parents have a variety of health problems between them that make them higher risk, particularly my dad, who is in his late 70s and a type 2 diabetic.

To get more of an image of the man my father is, I linked him an article about the virus and diabetes, and he dismissed it saying it was too long and that he didn't believe it. When I asked him why he let my half bro move in, he said 'it's my decision'. No reasonable explanation, just a classic 'because I said so'. He's always been like this. I've asked my half bro what's going on and am awaiting his response, but my mum is concerned for herself and my full bro.

He shuts down every suggestion or any reassurance I could give, making me feel useless as I can’t help him while he’s upset.

Last night I was coming home about to open the door to walk in and heard them yelling. Apparently he took money from her account to spend on alcohol and she caught him. He started to really scream and rage at her about how he is sick of everything and everyone and hates everything. 


I made noise and walked in cause I figured if he was going to do something stupid at least she’s not alone and he stormed off to their room. He’s a nice guy I’ve never seen him act like that. 


What should I do? I’m worried he’s going to keep  losing it and hurting some one/thing.

Prepare for some real teenage cringe.
Apologies if this is long - but hey, who doesn’t like some teenage cringe stories 

This was a couple years back, I was in school.

My school has around 5-6 buildings, and I have a form room - which I go to every morning to get registered.

Every school year has the one girl who’s at the top - the one who wins prom queen.

So I start talking to her over snapchat.
There’s the stereotypical conversations people have like “what are you doing” “what are you wearing” “you got a nice ass” etc
But when I talked to her, I talked about life - like what u wanna be when ur older, bucket lists, places you wanna go, things you wanna do. At the time, she wasn’t dating, but everyone knew that her and this school drug dealer gangster or whatever, we’re gonna get together. 

I’d personally say that I don’t think anyone talked to her about the things I did, mainly cos most people in my school are drug dealers, and are part of gangs

“Conveniently” we both arrived at school at the same time (not together) 

There are 3 floors to the building, her form was on the 3rd, mine was on the 2nd. 
Everyday, She would stand by a bathroom outside her form, I would walk past, and exchange looks? Just be aware of the others presence (christ that’s cringe - sorry if that hurt your eyes. What I walked past, and we looked at eachother? Relax I was young, I’m only half as cringe now) 

So I would pretty much do this everyday, sometimes we would talk. Lmao I even asked her what her favourite Disney movie was (take notes boys) 
Then one day, she appears at the bathroom outside my form, and this happened for a while. Stupidly, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t stop to talk, I just walked into my form. 

There were occasions when she was walking a bit ahead of me, she’d turn around and make a shy wave 

Also - she didn’t tell anyone, except for 2 of her friends (I hope/think)
And I only told 1 of my friends. None of the others knew/ still don’t know 

One day her and her friend were chilling in a corridor, I walked past with my friends, we were walking (more running) up some stairs and in the corner of my eye I see her, and hear her say “that’s him!” To her friend, and they both just look at my whilst I’m quickly walking up the stairs. And yeah, I turned around 

Another time when there were loads of people on the field, she was the with her friends, I was there with mine, + loads of other people
(There was supposed to be some girl fight - didn’t happen tho)
I walked off to go play football (soccer) and then 2 minutes later my friend (the one who knows) comes up to me and says that she was coming up to you, and looked like she was about to speak to you, but you walked away

Then summer came, and I never spoke to her again. We still go to the same school. We see eachother sometimes, awkward af, she’s now dating some 6,4 drug dealer. I’m pretty sure here friends didn’t like me / didn’t approve, because I wasn’t a 6 foot drug dealer who gets into fights at school, and smokes weed at 7am

I didn’t know what I wanted out of it, pretty sure it was just a friendship? But I heard loads of stories about her and the type of person she was, so I wanted to talk to her to see if it was all true. 

Currently, I’d say we’re friends. First time I spoke to her since then was on her birthday a few months ago. 

She’s one of those people who has like 500 insta followers, and following only like 60, and she was following me, and still is - pretty sure one of my friends noticed, probably was seeing who I follow etc, and earlier in the year me and her walked past eachother (did nothing ofc) and I noticed that one friend checking to see both our reactions 

Looking back on it, it was very cringe. 
Especially that it was years ago and I remember the details, in my defence - it was pretty much my first time properly talking to a girl - and I had no idea what I was doing 

Idrk why I’m posting this here, but that 1 friend who I had told brought it up, and questioned some of the stuff she was doing, so here. What do you guys think",28May2020,1
510,"

My dad is in his late 60's, he is not healthy, he has compromised immune system and lungs that used to be a smokers, he has immune system problems, And he drives school bus in New York state.

fortunately they shut down the schools in time and he wasn't exposed, I realize exposure for him might not be a death sentence but it seems like it's in me.
He's already talking about going back to work in the fall, his plan was to work one more year to get a slightly better social security.

Where in New York the infection rate is really high compared to other states even in the outlying areas and upstate.

He's an adult and he can do what he wants including this but I think we should try to stop him if we can, Buddy is also very stubborn and very independent, he'll try to be outside shoveling snow with me even though he's not the age that can do that anymore, And might end up hurting himself.

How can the people who love him try to convince him that this might be a bad idea?

Thank you,",28May2020,1
511,For some reason it really pisses me off because I don't like to rely on people but sometimes I do need help or reassurance so it kinda breaks my trust. It hasn't happend quite often (yet) but it recently  happend again and it triggered me. Because these 'promises' were only made when I am/was at my most vulnerable. I can't let this keep happening and I wanna point it out but I don't know how without coming off too strong.,28May2020,1
512,"Guys, I'm trying to stay sane during the lockdown but honestly I feel like I'm losing it. I feel like I don't really enjoy anything anymore. My usual hobbies barely interest me anymore and I can't seem to get into anything new that I try. 

Before the lockdown I had gotten into a good cycle where I was going to the gym and doing yoga regularly, each 3 times a week for 6 days of exercise a week in total. Now because of lockdown, my gym is closed and my yoga class has moved to zoom rather than in-person classes. 

Ive tried doing bodyweight exercises like push ups, sit ups etc now, but it doesn't feel the same and although I'll still do them, I derive no joy or pleasure from doing it the way I did when I went to the gym. It has been harder and harder to motivate myself to work out without my gym, and my frequency has decreased a lot. 

Before quarantine I used to really look forward to my yoga classes, but now I find myself dreading the time when they're about to start. I am not very good at it (I'm very inflexible) and despite my effort for over 3 months now, I don't feel like I'm improving in my flexibility and focus anymore. I really enjoyed it at the start, but now I just feel bad that I still can't do so many of the basic things, and i just dont seem to be improving despite constant effort. My classes leave me feeling frustrated and disappointed in myself rather than fulfilled and accomplished like before. 

Other than that, I usually like to play video games. I have a few on my switch and other systems, and I played them a lot in the past couple of months but I feel like I'm mostly played out. I'll play them a bit during the day but not really enjoying them like I did before. The only one where I feel I could constantly improve and make progress requires a steady wifi connection which I don't have. 

I tried learning the piano from my sister, and even though thats something I really want to do, I didn't feel like I was enjoying it much. Same thing happened with singing, drawing, and learning how to code. I know that these are things where improvement and progress can be slow, but still I get bored because I can't really do anything interesting with any of it. 

Up until recently, I had a lot of things to do, including University applications, and studying for certain exams I had to take for the applications. I didn't really enjoy doing those things, but I HAD to do them, so I just sucked it up and did it, so they kept me kinds busy and distracted. Now I am more or less free and just don't know what to do with my time. 

I have a few friends in the city where I live, but I live in an Asian city in which the lockdown is being very strictly enforced, so I am not allowed to leave the house other than for shopping for groceries. I do live with my family currently, but everyone kinda does their own thing and although I really love them, I don't particularly enjoy spending time with them for reasons not worth going into. 

I'm really sorry for the long post. I am just so mind numbingly bored, and I don't know what to do about it. Sometimes I feel like all the ""highs"" in my life have become ""neutrals"" and the ""neutrals"" feel like lows. I'd love some advice about how to fix this if anyone has anything to say.",28May2020,1
513,"Let me start by saying that I don't hate my life or those around me but...
Here is my backstory you can skip it if you want:
I'm almost 20 male Muslim from middle East and east Asia. I'm super extraverted and can make friends easily but I don't like relationships. I have a good work that pays well and go to a famous college for mechanical engineering.
(I was born in a wealthy family. My life should have been perfect but no good story is without it's twist and mine was loss of my father at the age of 2.
After my father passed away from a heart attack my god father aka my second youngest uncle took on his legacy just to bring to ruin and took my older brother I'll call him ""blood brother"" in but refused to raise me.
So I was raised by my 22 year old mother in her brother's household. She wasn't the most gentle mother every small mistake of mine would result in physical punishment but I don't hold that against her.
Life would go on and so would I, when I turned 5 or 6 my god father would take me in I was unaware of this I was told that I was just going to stay there for a day and I was stoked, they had a PS1 and I was extremely envious of that apparently my oldest uncle pressured him into taking me.
It didn't take long for me to adjust to my life I was happy to meet people who cared for me so much a new family that loved me for no reason but again unlike a cartoon character people aren't 2 dimensional.
I was almost 10 when I learnt that my mother was married again and was pregnant I haven't even seen her in so long it was odd for me I wasn't upset I didn't know how to feel.
My mother gave birth to my sister and we reconnected I would always visit 4 times a month everything seemed good she even had a second child a boy this time but just like before life is never without its challenges.
I was 15 when my mother divorced her husband it was a mess and it changed her, her mental health wasn't good but I would still keep in touch.
My father had 2 children before his wife passed away and my oldest brother was one of them I'll call him ""big bro"" so big bro got married and left the house and the sh*t starts from here he told me about my father's wealth and how godfather wasted it all on women, drugs and so on. I was mad but what could a 17 year-old do.
A year later my blood brother started taking heavy drugs and he snapped he started screaming whilst we were driving but thankfully we were close to home I got us home I had to tie him up before he hurt himself or anyone else. As you can imagine it devastated me I had an important exam in about 5 month and my brother's condition didn't help with the stress.
I graduated from high school with good grades and just wanted to go as far away as possible but godfather forbid me from leaving the city saying I'll turn out like my blood brother and I didn't even argue I just accepted it.)
And now here we are my life is something out of an depressing anime. You can believe or not I just want your opinion.
I live with a strict and controlling godfather who loves to waste his life on women, my mother has bad mental health and had to go through hell so I'm her only hope, my blood brother being treated like a king for his apparent mental issues because of his past with drugs, I'm being pressured daily by my oldest sister to sue my godfather and take him to court.
I'm lost and I don't know what to do. Life feels like shit and future is getting dimmer. I feel like I want all my family to be gone so I don't have to deal with them or for me to disappear to far away land so I can experience life. Am I overreacting? Everyone has downs so I must be. Give an advise as harsh as it may be I'm here to listen.",28May2020,1

Fast forward to right now, after 10 years. We talked and seemed to have a mutual understanding. We constantly inform each other about our lives but recently he keeps on mentioning his sister. He posts pictures of his sister stating that she's the most important person in his life. He post messages meant for his sister that seemed to be cringeworthy.

520,"I really wanted to support a local bike shop so I went with one that had good reviews. I have mutual friends who support their business too.

So May 6 I get on a call with this guy and over video call we get all the details in order. I place the order and give a $800 deposit. He says he’ll have it done in just over a week and that he’ll call me to come fit the bike before he finishes it.

Later in the week, nothing. I check in on the 15th and he sends me a long email explaining how covid has delayed shipping but he got the parts in that day and will begin to work on it in the order of orders that came in.

May 23, I check in again. He sends me a picture showing the frame and fork installed and is hoping to have it done tonight. 

May 27. I want to send me an honest message saying how I feel like he’s fucking with me and if he expects his customers to put down a large deposit I except yo be kept in the loop.

I feel obligated to be nice because I don’t want to piss him off and have him install shit parts in my bike. The price also includes a year of tune ups and I want to keep him on good terms for future correspondence but at this point I just want to cut ties and get a refund.

It’s not so much the delay. If on the initial call he told me it’ll be about a month I’d be fine with that. It’s the fact he keeps giving me unrealistic finish dates.
I need advice. Am I expecting too much? Am I an asshole to keep checking in?

522,"I’ve known this girl since I was 6, when I was in year 5 (4th grade) me and her would just look at eachother from the other side of the classroom, look away when the other person looks at you. I didn’t like her, didn’t she liked me, and this looking thing was only for about a week. I was way more interested in the teacher, if you know what I mean 

Call this girl X

Then I moved to secondary school ( ages 12-18 ) and she had moved to a different school. There were some people who knew her, but the one guy always used to make up lies about me and tell her. 
He would say to me that “ X said you were creepy and stared at her all the time” 
I don’t know whether this was true, but I assume so, because how else would he know? 

This guy chats loooaaads of shit, pretty sure he tells some other people, but tbh idc 

Stuff with this guy was all about 3-4 years ago

Then it was summer, I got out of a plane, into an airport, added the WiFi, and saw a message from her, confessing that when I was in school with her, she had a huge crush of me (and apparently many other girls did, WOO HUGE EGO BOOST) and she said not to worry because she was over it. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, one of my friends is dating a girl, and she’s friend with X,
She tells my friend that “I was begging for a relationship, and was really desperate”, my friend immediately said it was probably somebody else with my name, cos I’m not that sorta guy; and I’m not, if I have to beg for it, I’m better off without it. 

So I’ve just dismissed it - but how long will she just chat shit for, and make stuff up. Is she looking for a reaction out of me? If so, she’ll be waiting her whole life - cos I don’t care. Imma just let her do her thing. 

But the part where it gets bad is the twins

When I was about 4, I went to school, and there were these Persian Arabic twins who lived in dubai. I was friends with them, and actually - they were my first kisses (does it count if I’m that old) 
I remember once when one twin was kissing both of my cheeks (on my face) [but that’s a story for later]  
A few years later, they moved to Dubai 

Last summer, I decided to reconnect with the twins, after finding their Instagram. (Let me just say, puberty hit them harddd) I asked whether they remembered me, and they said of course they did; great for me to hear considering I hadn’t talked to them for over 8 years. 
I continued to talk to them throughout the summer, stuff that’s happened, and plans for the future.

Later that summer, the twins posted a story on Instagram - where they were with X, they went out shopping or something. But what if X said all that bullshit to the twins? 

I know I shouldn’t care what other people think etc, but I’ve known these twins since I was a toddler. Ultimately, I’m going to do nothing, but what do you guys think of this?",28May2020,1

527,"TLDR: Opportunity for my wife and I to save for a house over a short time, but involves moving in with BIL, possible pet issues, longer commute, and generally not knowing how it would go.

My wife and I want to get a house, but money is tight and we've been living at an apartment for 5 years that we said we would he out of in 2.

My BIL is going through a divorce and has a huge house. He invited us to stay with him for a few months so he wouldn't be alone, and so we could save some money. We'd really only share a kitchen, otherwise we'd have half the house to ourselves. We'd set a limit of 6-8 months depending on how long it takes to close on a house.

Some factors at play: I work and live in the same town, so my commute would go from 5 to 45 minutes. My wife would most likely have to quit her job (it's only part time, and not working now anyways) to find a new one.

Some of my concerns are that he has 2 dogs and we have an older cat. The cat has been with dogs before, but I'm worried the stress may cause some problems for him. The dogs have never been around other animals. Also, my in-laws are good people, but can sometimes be overbearing and baby my BIL.

I’ve been bullied a lot throughout my life and had a unloving childhood. Work is just unbearable for me and even staying at home drives me nuts. What’s drives me crazy the most is that I’m so socially inept. People think I’m weird and also think I’m gay. It hurts me a lot. Lately I’ve been noticing that silence is no longer silence for me. It’s alone time with voices of trash talk to myself. I’m not sexually attracted to the same gender but I’ve always envied people who had it better. I’m also probably a 3/10 so better looking people intimidate me because of all the bullying I’ve received. I just want to be accepted. I can’t even talk to dudes without them thinking I’m gay now and I get very paranoid. I always observe my surroundings like I’m being watched. People call me weird for that and I get a lot of triggers from the same people that do. It’s like I can’t act normal around them because I feel threatened like they’re always going to talk shit about me and are out to get me. My self esteem is just done for. My depression is spiraling. I’m very underweight. I’m mentally ill. I even got Zoloft for my depression and I’m on day 3. A lot of times I wonder if me not accepting myself as being gay is the issue. But I’m not sexually attracted to men? I love seeing women naked, watching porn probably screwed me up socially with women too. I’ve been exposed to sex very young from magazines and always fantasized about girls. Being rejected didn’t help as I was too ugly for some. What do I do? What can I do? How do I stop the paranoid thoughts of people thinking I’m weird, gay or just simply being able to talk to people without the fear of not being liked?",28May2020,1

538,"I have noticed for a while now that I keep listening to sad music. I don’t know if it makes me feel worse or better but I think it’s the latter? I’m pretty much sad all the time myself, so listening to sad music helps me deal with it better but it makes me sadder at the same time too. I feel like it’s really unhealthy because I’m unconsciously making myself feel worse. Like I love Lana del rey’s music but I notice that her music makes me sad, even though I love her songs.

541,"So I made a post at r/AITA that probably didn't fit the sub in the first place, and incase it doesn't get approval from the mods I want to post it here because I am in desperate need of answers. 

&gt; Hi, using a throw away here as to hopefully not draw unwanted ire towards any of them, outside or inside the friend group. 

&gt; Recently a very good friend of mine, pretty much my only good brother figure in life, managed to get a foot in the door by being able to chart for a really popular mobile rhythm game. He already was in good graces with the dev team, seeing as how he was good friends with a couple of the charting team members and met one of the main writers and managers in London. 

&gt; This sort of situation isn't an isolated incident either, as before a few friends of mine have been on projects with him before, but he'd started getting REALLY closed off after a big event held in Illinois, if any of you are familiar with the ITG scene it's RIP. After hosting an event there he started working on some personal projects and didn't seem to interact much outside of several circles, including us. I just took it as him being overwhelmed from the sudden huge popularity influx. But the others? They took it as an insult. They also had hopes and dreams and seeing another friend gain so much closeness to the team for the game must have been a huge punch in the gut. 

&gt; I went on an embarrassingly large downfall last night over it. I have a problem of my mood being influenced by my surroundings, and even though I really happy for the guy who got in, I REALLY wanted to let out a huge rant about how it didn't mean either of the other two could make it in either, but I hold that in since I didn't think it was appropriate for the moment. It's like  I wasn't even allowed to be happy for the guy. 

Would this be considered a bad situation? How does one go handling this sort of outcome?",28May2020,1
542,"I (29F) have a cat (3F), I'll call W, who has a heart condition. She was born with an extra membrane. We found this out when she suddently went into heart failure after her vets never heard a murmur. About 2 weeks ago W was given an estimate of 6 months to live before heart failure takes her. She could also die on any given day if a blood clot hits her brain. She's on all medicine thinkable and has regular vet visits.

We also had a dog (13M, Chihuahua) for 11 years who passed one month ago. We decided to get another dog companion (2F) because W and previous dog were really close. Picked new dog the day before yesterday. W is terrified of the new dog. My concern is the stress will cause her to go into heart failure.  The dog is a basset mix and smaller than a regular basset hound. She is cat friendly (SPCA tested her) and just prefers to lay under blankets and take life in.

We have tried Feliway spray, and it helped. The cat no longer cowers in one corner of one room, but is still scared when she sees the dog even at the end of a long hallway. We will return the dog but only as a last resort.

We are also picking up a calming collar &amp; treats today for W. Is there a way we can get the cat to realize the dog is not a threat sooner than later? Any suggestion helps.

Notes:
The SPCA is a kill shelter, but is currently not euthanizing because they are not over capacity(when we went it was basically empty). They said if we return the dog, she will be cared for until she can find a home. 

W is able to relax, just not when she sees the dog. When she is in another room, she is just fine. She also sleeps in our bed at night, the dog sleeps on the couch in the living room.

For those who don't know. Feliway mimicks a feel good cat pheromone and makes the cat feel happy. It comes as a diffuser, drops, and a spray. We spray it as directed on blankets, corners she likes, curtains and the furniture.

W has no problem eating and taking her meds, even when she sees the dog, as long as the dog doesn't come near her.

I live with my boyfriend (33M) who helps me care for them.",28May2020,1
543,"Why, when I get taken advantage of, and pushed repeatedly, that when eventually I lose my temper and stand up for myself,  do I feel so guilty ? 

Why do I feel bad for standing up to certain people in my life, when all they do is take advantage of my nature ?

It's almost like I'm guilt tripped for protecting myself?! 

I'm guilt tripped for not taking their crap anymore.

Why do they take me for granted, my generosity, my support, and then punish me for reacting to their selfish behaviour and verbal put downs ? 

Please to god , someone put me out of my misery and explain why you'd play with some ones mental health, and put them down, when all they've been is decent to you ?? 

Why?

And then why would you get annoyed, when I stand up to your lies and manipulation - make me feel guilty for walking away or standing up to you ??

Am I supposed to just repeatedly let you verbally and mentally abuse me, take advantage of my financial and moral support, and just accept that I get nothing back ? 

Is that how life works ?

Because I'm so lost right now. I feel inside that walking away from these people is the right thing to do. I know it is. Because they're destroying my self esteem.

They tell me how people think I'm fat and ugly. How much I've aged and let myself go. I'm seriously ill yet they literally carry on gas lighting me and making me unhappy. I'm accused by one of not letting him help, yet why the hell would I, when all he does is put me down and lie? 

They make out to the world that they're nice people. They're really not.

I'm so tired of all this

544,"I (40F) work in an office that (according to my employer) is an essential service. The men I work with don't wear masks, don't sanitize and believe the whole COVID-19 situation is fear-mongering nonsense and political. 

I can tolerate them making fun of me for wearing the mask but I am subjected to them bringing in friends and clients who vocally announce all the major cities they've been in in the past week where they were yelled at everywhere they went (for being careless, not distancing, not wearing masks, traveling). The way they talked about the lives lost as if it was nothing, they kept throwing around ""facts"" and ""statistics"" as if the whole thing is a political stunt to make money and collapse the economy. 

I have barely said a word since returning to work. When bombarded with the subject, all I have said is everyone is entitled to their opinion but I genuinely do care about the situation as I have loved ones that are at risk. My employer proceeds to berate me directly for my feelings on it even going so far as I leave and come back next week with my head on straight.

I'm trying to buy a new pair of gym shorts, and I want the pockets to have zippers. Most men's gym shorts have pockets, but zippers to safely store your locker key are harder to find. I found a model on the UK website of a store that I liked, but they don't have my size (M).

I tried to find another store online that has that model, but couldn't find any. At this stage, I could go through the entire webstore of all sports article brands I can think of, and spend hours on finding a new pair of shorts. But that would be rather silly, and I'd much rather spend that time actually getting started on working out again. 

It feels like I'm applying the wrong strategy to this problem. What should I do, reddit? I'd even pay if I could get someone to find a store that has the model I'm after in my size or if they could find a different model for me, but I don't know where I'd ask for such a service either.",28May2020,1

548,"I've been doing graphic design for like 6 years or even more and now I'm 19 and I took seriously for less than 3 years now, and I've been trying to make it into a career, I tried sites like freelancer and I got lucky in a contest and won 180$ and it was great, I got a small drawing tablet to help me more and I thought I could do that again but I tried like more than 20 or 30 times with other contests and all I could get was 10$ in one of them, so I slowly lost interest in doing it because I'd put 7 to more than 10 hours of work just to get rejected or rated like a 1 star and that kinda killed my passion at the time, I slowly stopped entering contests to not designing anything for over 5 months. I went into a rusty state and I couldn't get back on track and design with the passion I had when I did stuff for myself and my friends.



But that was like 2 years ago. But I tried to get back and design again, and then I tried going on fiverr and I got a couple of gigs in the span of like 10 months to a year



And now I'm in a state of being afraid of doing anything because I'm afraid if it will fail and I got myself into a loop hole that goes like this: 


I'm in need of getting an income rn it doesn't matter how small it is but there has to be at least a semi stable income and it has to be through graphic design ---&gt; but to do that I need to start designing stuff ---&gt; but I can't because I'm afraid of not getting the results I hoped for and it will be a huge waste of time ---&gt; but I can't just sit there and do nothing ---&gt; well then if I had money now I'd do this and that ---&gt; then I should start designing ... Then it loops back




Just to note this is not like me thinking that normally and then dropping it .. this is like a wave of depression, anxiety and fear that goes through my mind and I can't help it but to stop thinking about doing what I wanna do and go distract myself with anything else .. and sometimes everything rinds me of my shortcomings and I feel choked and go to sleep to try and feel better




So I've been fighting through that for the past like .. year and it's getting worse because nearly every time I finish a design that I'd work on for a week or two and spend like 30 to 50 hours on doing and then getting absolutely no results makes it harder for me to start doing something again .. I almost go into a panic attack when I try to do something mildly challenging, my brain stops and I get afraid that I'd spend alot of time on it and then in the end get depressed because it was all nearly for nothing sometimes I won't even want to think about it for 3 days or even more than a week  and then slowly pushing myself into doing it but lately it's extremely hard.. you can argue that I'm getting better and honing my skills and that's partially true but when I spend 3 weeks on something that could take me 3 days to finish if I could work when I wanted to work then it's a bit of a problem.


.


Part of that is also my depression and I can't go to a therapist atm because of this pandemic and I don't even know any good therapists so I still need to search but I'll go as soon as I can

I spent over 2 years with no accomplishments, I don't go to college , I rarely go outside, and I just sit there watching youtube or play games almost all day and I hate all of that .. near the start of this year I put a goal of getting enough money to buy a switch and I'm nowhere near that and I'm absolutely stuck and I need help




Maybe it's me pressuring myself to get money and not doing it because I love doing it but I still can't get over that because I do need money or at least any interaction to make me feel like there's at least a meaning in what I'm doing..



I don't wanna sound like I'm begging for money or clout even though I probably did but what I really need at this point is an advice to overcome this crippling fear and anxiety so I can make stuff so I can get money lol

550,"Hello everyone 

I(24M) honestly don’t know how to explain my situation since it’s the first time I am doing this. 
So the thing is, we are from India, our culture is very different and judgemental when it comes to mental health. Any person that visits a therapist/psychiatrist is termed as a ‘Pagal’(local term for Crazy). Hence a lot of people are scared visiting one. 


About my girlfriend(26), we have been together since December 2019. I am in no position to judge/diagnose or even advice her on mental health and that’s why I want her to see a professional. My girlfriends childhood was troubled, her parents are divorced but have still lived together for the sake of the children. She spent every day watching her parents fight and blame her for the fights. When her friends used to play outside, she would visit a lawyers office to decide whom to pick(she never picked any of them, hence they never separated). And her parents are extremely religious, something which is very common in India, but it’s been a contributing factor to her as they were very strict towards her. She has spent her whole childhood being blamed for the irresponsibilities, negligence and in capability. Her parents have not been good parents to her. They were also always in financial trouble even when their income is better than average Indian family income since her dads money management is very poor. I have noticed that she gets paranoid very quickly and blames herself for any trouble she faces or her close ones face, because it’s been told to her since she was a kid. She also has a a condition where she starts to stutter a lot and has extreme breathing troubles when she cries. At times she is also unable to differentiate between dreams and reality, often getting scared in real life because of a bad dream. She is also always under the impression that others will judge her and make fun of her. She has constant fear of being embarrassed and often makes up scenarios in her mind. 

I love her a lot and I want her mental health to improve. I once mentioned it to her that maybe we should see a therapist and she got very paranoid(Am I using the term correctly? Sorry for the poor English) and started the stuttering and breathing issues again. I got very concerned, I haven’t mentioned it to her again since. However, I am concerned about her, I want her to improve and enjoy the small things in life but I am unable to talk to her. She gets scared even by the mere mention of a doctor/professional. 


I cannot speak to anyone else about this in India because no one talks about mental health in India. Therefore, I am asking you for help, please guide me on how i should approach this issue. 

Am I judging her too Much? Do you think my concerns are valid?",28May2020,3

Our country is currently in lockdown, but in general the population believes that breaking the law is okay so long as nobody catches you. As such, nobody is taking lockdown seriously. I do not share this belief. I believe that laws are in place for a reason, and so I try my best to follow it. I'm also at risk for the virus more due to health issues, so I'm particularly keen to follow lockdown laws. My bf doesn't share this opinion.

He believes that I should just come and see him. And although I'm dying to (it's been a while since we saw each other), I just can't bring myself to break the law and put my health at risk. I'm also not happy with him coming here because some of my family members are also in risky groups due to age and health etc. Plus, I don't want him to get arrested!

We have been having this fight over and over and I'm getting super angry. I don't want to break up, but I've also never seen this side of him and it worries me. He's currently not speaking to me because I went to the shops (legal) but won't come to him(illegal).

553,"So I have a best friend who is quite loud and popular and for last halloween she used makeup to create cuts all over face. She also wore black dress and had painted her entire ace white. I did not think much of it but it was just a costume. But now she goes out in short shorts and short sleeves and I noticed that she fakes cuts by using SFX makeup and it actually looks really realistic and gory. She gets weird stares from people when we are out in public but she does not seem to mind. Drawing these marks on her body is like another step to her daily makeup routine at this point.

One day I confronted her about them and she told me that she just does it for ""fashion"". I asked her if she had ever considered doing anything and she said no and that she never has. She does not think of it as a big deal, one of our other friends said that it is disrespectful but she does not understand why. 

She does not wear any type of gothic fashion and wears girly clothes (not that this matters) but she cannot leave the house without any fake cuts. One day she had no time to do her makeup as she had to be somewhere so he just stuck multiple plasters all over her arms.

The difficult colleague is a self-proclaimed perfectionist who dishes out little to no appreciation for the work that others around her are doing and instead focuses on mainly whatever can be ""improved"" or does not look right to her. She has an extremely stubborn personality which means that due to her nit picking perfectionism I spend more time defending why I think a certain way, than I do in any form of collaboration with her. I find my self on the receiving end of emails where I am constantly having to explain my actions and spend like 30 min correcting her why she was wrong. There is no room for creativity or enjoyment in the work with her, unless it is on her terms.

556,"

Hi y’all! 

My best friend of 12 years has asked me to be his best man. And for a while we were planning parts of the wedding together. Making plans for the party. All that fun stuff. Then rona hit and it kinda put a stop to all the planning. We were supposed to go to Vegas In June. I called and told him that after talking to my husband we did not feel comfortable with me going. So we postponed/canceled it. 

We had a big team meeting about the wedding date. As we understood it. The wedding was going to be postponed since August 29th is coming up fast. 

I’m in one of the cities that has been hit really hard. Hubs and I have been working from home for two and a half months. Ordering food online and not going to stores at all. So we are taking this pretty seriously. 

Shit hit the fan two days ago. The bride has made up her mind that they will go forward as planned on August 29th. I think this is a bad idea. The wedding is going to be around 200 people. 30% of those folks are old people. 

I spoke to a few members of the wedding party and we all feel mostly that this is a ridiculous decision. A lot of us are going to have to take a flight to get to Virginia. I’m scared to even walk in a store let alone get on a plane. 

Am I a dick for writing him an email letting him know that I will not be attending if the date is not postponed? I did it as loving as I could have. But I really feel as if he is asking me to choose between my health and going to his wedding. Not to mention all the others he would be putting at risk. 

I do want to add. I’ve been very vocal in voicing my concerns around the rona and the wedding. Clearly it fell on deaf ears. I mean I canceled the party because of these fears. 

 I get they want to get married but it feel like they are being really selfish at the moment. Why not just wait a year? I don’t really get their thought process.",28May2020,1

Recently with the Floyd case I posted on my story how people are so quick to share  the ""justice for Floyd"" posts but do not realise that saying the n word when white, othering and using racial slurs actually causes actions like what's seen in that video to develop. 

My best friend is  mixed race and she broke down while talking to me about how scary it is that one of her close friends believes that America does not have an issue with police brutality and basically said he does not believe in the black lives matter movement. She shared with me how scary it is to have grown up being warned on what to do/not to do when facing cops and other things that show a massive racial discrimination still exists. I 100% realise I will never fully understand how terrifying it must be to be a POC or what struggles they face. But I am aware of a lot of injustices and I try to speak up about it.

560,"Hi, I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I’m taking things out and making it a bit easier to read for anyone who comes across it. I’ll put a TL;DR at the end though :).

I’m 20F and I live in New York with my dad, step-mom, two sisters (17 and 5), and my two grandparents. That’s 7 people. Quarantined in once house together. For the last couple months. 

Now i’ll say this now, my dad and i are the only ones in the house who have absolute freedom with when we can leave and go places. He and i are both essential workers, we’ve been working this entire quarantine thing. 

The last couple days have been rough for me, i have a history of depression that comes and goes pretty often and it leaves my brain in shambles and pretty much like playdoe. I got hit with it this week and I’ve reached my breaking point, i mean I met it awhile ago but it burst the day before yesterday. 

So as we are in quarantine, chores have become a big thing, doing the dishes, taking the garbage out, poop scooping the backyard, etc. My step-mom likes to complain to my titi (means aunt in Spanish) about my sister and I not doing our chores. And I think it’s a load of bullshit because we do the chores, maybe not on a set schedule, but we do them. 

Id like to mention that titi doesn’t have any impact on our lives anymore in this house, and she’s a complete asshole. She’s done a lot and I’d rather not broadcast that much info on the internet but she did some fucked up shit. 

Before all this when I was thinking of getting a new car (I pay for insurance and the car payments which is 300+ and currently, because I’m working, i have no trouble paying on time and I’m full every month) because my old one was on its last legs I was going to go on a trip to California with her and my older cousin. She invited me a couple months before because I was looking at colleges out there I really wanted to go and see how it was, visit campuses, etc. 

Flash-forward to the day I ask my boss off for the weeks for our trip, I call titi to tell her that I got my days off. She proceeds to tell me that maybe I shouldn’t go, because they’re going for my cousins 30th birthday and it wouldn’t be fun for me because they’d be going to bars and clubs, and that because I wasn’t 21 they wouldn’t be able to go in with me there. I felt like i was guilted out of going because they wouldn’t have fun doing things if i wasn’t there. So she keeps telling me that we can do something else, plan a different trip, I can take those days back at work and save for another trip! I started getting short with her on the phone because I was trying not to cry and she asked if I was mad at her and I finally told her, “no I’m disappointed” and said I’d go visit my mom with my time off and hung up. 

Couple days later she offered to help pay for my car instead of going on the California trip. This is relevant because she said she’d help me pay for my car, and I only got a 100$ once and she never brought it up again. 

So anyway, I get a text two days ago from her, she says she has an idea. She lists off all the chores that my sister and I do in the house, giving me a schedule on when to do them and that she’ll help me with my car payments. And ends it with “hopefully we have a deal”. 

I don’t want to seem like an asshole for expecting more, but she said she’d do it in turn for taking the trip away from me. And then she said she’d help me pay if I started doing chores around the house. Chores that are already being done and have been done for years, mind you. The only reason that they aren’t on a schedule anymore is because when I work, I work odd hours. I work at a hotel and I work 12am-8am shifts and my boss fucks up a lot and puts me for different times (like one week she’d do 12-8 then a 4pm-12am then a 12-8 again) and it just messes up my sleep schedule. 


But the way she worded it, and the way she ended the text..it just hasn’t set right with me. I went on a long rant to my friend and it was a lot of “who does she think she is” stuff. I have been infuriated over it for awhile and finally turned to asking more people for advice because i can’t ask my family here. 

I think with my depression and lack of sleep or just lack of being completely there, I snapped. I haven’t responded to her at all, I didn’t acknowledge it for right now because I’m not sure what to say. 

I’ve dealt with a lot in my life with my mental health and struggling to come back from it for the past probably 13 years and I’ve wanted to move out of my house since. I don’t want to stay here anymore but with going to community college and getting my associates degree I couldn’t move out. 

I spoke with my younger sister and my mother about it, my sister wants to move out too, our house is pretty toxic when it comes to how the adults treat us, but she can’t leave until she graduates next year. I however have a degree and my mom is offering to let me stay with her along with my dog. My mom lives in Missouri, so I’d be leaving New York to stay with her and she’d help me find a new job and eventually help me find an apartment out there. My sister would join me when she’s graduated high-school and she’d go to  school close by and work to help me with rent. 

It’s not anywhere near now, (thought i’m going to stay with my mom for awhile to clear my head) but I’m scared if it’s not the right option or if doing this will just fuck me up even more than I already am. But I just can’t stay in this house anymore, neither of us can. 

Does anyone have advice?

Okay so let's take hanging out with friends as an example, it's one of the best knes I've got

Whenever I was invited to go out with my friends I've always looked at it as a mixed bag of feelings. It's generally known that hanging out can be fun and all but I was always sceptical, I always felt like whatever I choose won't really make a difference whatever that means.

I feel like normal people understand the time they've got, they know that instead of doing x they can hang out with people they like for y amount of time, they know that it will be v much fun and it's obvious for them that it's worth it.

I’m writing this from the front seat of my car in a walmart parking lot, hoping to get some advice from y’all. 

Last week, I got an acceptance to the Citadel military college, a real expensive but nice school in South Carolina that’s designed for making officers in the military. I really want to go, but I’m still trying to figure out how to pay for it, and more importantly, how to transfer my stuff from my community college to this new place out of state. They said they’d take everything, even as electives, but I’m hoping it’ll apply to a Bachelor of Arts degree. My plan was to loan out for one year while pursuing an rotc scholarship, which I’m confident that I can get there, due to the prestige and training they put into you there.  

Now, I should preface this by saying that I tried once at the military, as it was my dream for many years... and I didn’t cut it. Discharged. Fell into a state of depression for almost a year, and dad made an agreement with me to get my Associate’s degree, and they’d let me live with them. But I feel this school is giving me a chance at something I once thought I’d never get to do, and people told me I’d never get into. My parents think I can’t even take a shit right and I can’t do it, so they’d rather kick me out then support me and let me go.

We have a daughter together and have been living together for about 2 years. Couple months ago, dropped a life changing bomb on my lifex saying she was no longer in love with me and had felt that way for about a year. I had no idea, thought everything was fine, she was always wanting cuddles/ hugs / kisses before telling me this. She was very affectionate. 

We have had a couple sessions with a couples therapist, but have not had an appt with her for a couple weeks due to scheduling conflicts. She also had told me she started having feelings for an old friends of her, they have a sexual past but never dated. I really dont want to lose her and she feels so trapped. When we found out she was pregnant, we moved in together. She didnt have the best living situation, her mom/stepdad were emotionally abusive to her at times, and she feels pretty trapped. 

I don't really know what to do. Last night i kind of agreed to an open relationship, i was the one who brought it up, and we talked about it a little bit. Brought it up so she wouldnt feel so trapped, she could go explore a little bit etc. We talked about some ground rules, try not to form more of emotional connection with anyone, wear protection etc etc. Now im kind of having second thoughts, very anxious and jealous.

578,"Recently I graduated from a PhD program, the culmination of years of graduate courses and advanced research. But it's also book-ended a chapter of my life, and I'm at the crossroads to decide what I'll be doing next. 

The thing is, I got into graduate degrees partly to assuage my family, especially my mother. Years ago, I was applying to national service positions that might have been very dangerous for me, but they resonated with me very deeply. They were things that I felt answered crucial parts of my identity and what I wanted to do in my life, and I was getting positive reception through the hiring process. But I love my mother very much, so on her request, I dropped my applications and pursued higher study.

My parents recently retired from the business they had maintained since my childhood, and I have been able to enjoy their company as an adult, rather than as a defacto employee. I was the only of my siblings to work in their business for years, with no compensation or pay, but just because I wanted to help my parents. Since they've retired, I've really enjoyed our renewed relationship. 

The crux of the matter is this: I can pursue a career in research, which I am good at and allows me to maintain contact with my family. The benefit of academic-style research is a more relaxed work schedule, and generally gives me more opportunity to be with my family. I don't have a significant other, and don't plan to, so going back to my hometown to visit my family is something that really pleases me. My current job would allow me to be within visiting distance easily, and there's an opportunity to make some career progress.

However, research work isn't something that really calls me. I'm good at it, and I enjoy it, but what really draws me is military service, or service in a civilian federal agency dealing with foreign affairs. It's something that has been a kind of bone-deep calling that really resonates with me, in a very fundamental way. My education and experience align with this path quite well, as I'm fluent in a number of languages, have overseas experience, and am interested in the field. The downside to following this path is it distances me from my family. I wouldn't be able to see them nearly as much, maybe once or twice a year, and I've grown to become fond of visiting more often. Additionally, I'm fairly certain my mother would be opposed to it, and even if I am an adult capable of making my own decision, I still value my parents' opinions.

It's something that I can't resolve. I feel like I have so many blind spots for my situation that for every factor I can think of, there's three factors more that I haven't seen. 

TL;DR: What should I do? Stick with a career path that is somewhat unfulfilling but acceptable, and allows me to be close to my family, or try to embark on the career path that resonates deeply with me, and distances me from my family?",28May2020,0

While I was in level 9-10 pain and it was stressful, my experience was quick, efficient, and friendly. I was home with anti-virals and low-dose oxycodone within an hour.

What I didn't go home with was a doctor's note. I started my first day back at work Tuesday, so I would need an excuse for more than two days of being out, which I naturally thought I'd need because I was in so much pain. My manager also did not want me at work for obvious reasons (we are required to wear masks, exercising social distancing, not open to the public yet, etc.,). I called the hospital, got bounced around for about 15 minutes, got disconnected once, talked to a few people who sounded completely disinterested, then finally got through to a nurse. This is where the problem starts. 

After explaining the reason for my call, the nurse's first response was that it's not contagious and could only cause chickenpox, and said that work was fine, totally dodging my question. I clarified, saying that while that is certainly still a concern, my my main reason for needing it was because I was bed-ridden and basically unable to do something even as simple as put my head on a pillow. The nurse then starts to question my profession, my job title, my age, sometimes insinuating and sometimes outright saying that I'm fine, that I can work, and there's no reason for a doctor's note. He says because the pain could possibly last for up to a month that I should just tough it out and manage. Mind you, I had already talked to my manager and HR department and they said that everything was good to go. I started to get irritated and began to make as strong a case as I could, so the nurse begrudgingly put me on hold for about five minutes. 

His tone at this point is as if he has done me a gigantic favor- he tells me that he wrote an excuse until Monday in a tone that is akin to adult satiating a bratty child and tells me to come pick it up at the front desk. Because I'm in the amount of pain I'm in and the fact that I'm on opiates, I ask if there is any way that he can e-mail or fax the document to either me, my manager, or my HR department. You would think I was asking him to SEND THIS SHIT TO THE MOON. Now, I understand that certain hospitals may have a policy against this, but I always figure I should ask with things like this. He responds by saying that it is impossible, they don't have the capabilities, he doesn't know who he's sending it to- once again, in a tone as if I am the biggest dickhead in the world for even daring to ask. 

I have an immune-compromised family member and also a young nephew, so my family couldn't take me to get the note. I haven't even been in a car with any of them for over three months! I informed him of this, and that I felt intoxicated from the pain meds so I also couldn't get it. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He said one more thing that pissed me off, so finally I just said, ""Alright, you know what? I appreciate your time, I truly do, so just leave the damn note at the desk and I'll get it."" His response? ""Sir, if you did that you'd be driving under the influence."" I DIDN'T EVEN SAY I WAS COMING TO GET IT ALONE! I hung up on him. It was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a medical professional. Because of the stress of the situation, I think it assisted in a flair up of the shingles and I spent the next fifteen hours in some of the worst pain I've ever experienced. Truly a terrible day. 

So, Reddit, what should I do from here? I never complain with service oriented stuff- I've gotten wrong food at restaurants and just eaten the meal because often it's just not worth it. But this, THIS? This seems unethical and just wrong. I would like to file a complaint against this person, but I just don't know. What do you think?",28May2020,1
594,"  Hi! I’m a 17 y/o artist (mainly an oil painter) from VA. I’m on here right now, simply because I really just need to vent. I’ve been keeping a lot of stuff inside, and it’s starting to wear me down. I guess I should tell you the situation I’m in. 
  Well, right now, I live in a basement, with my mom, my sister, her 4 kids, and now my sisters boyfriend. It fucking sucks. It’s so depressing. Everyday I get up, I look around this small room packed with people. All the kids are super young, 4 and under, so bed time for them is at 9. Everything has to shut off at nine, and you have to be incredibly quiet. I can’t listen to music through my headphones too loud because then my sister complains. There’s no privacy.. at all here. My sanctuary used to be the bathroom. It’s the only place I can feel somewhat alone, but now my niece is potty training, so every 10 minutes she has to go to the bathroom and sit on the toilet. 
  My nephews are always touching and going through stuff, and they’ll constantly call my name or throw stuff at me, until I give them attention. And I’m not aloud to complain about any of it, because my sister will unleash hell. 
  My sister and I have a long history of.. not getting along. We all used to live in an apartment together, but I was miserable there, like I am here. At the apartment, my sister made it very clear that it was HER apartment, and not mine, or my mothers. Then she kicked us out, because I finally stood up to her. Usually I just bite my tongue, but I couldn’t that time. She called my mom a bitch, and said that we should burn in hell, all because my mom tried to defend me in an argument my sister and I had. And I just lost it. My mother treats her like gold. She let her drop out of school, she was the one who signed her out, and every boyfriend she’s ever had, my mom let them move in. Even if they’ve only been dating for a few weeks. My mom always defends her, no matter what. Yet, she still kicked us out. 
So when she kicked us out, she gave us a week to find a place and move. We had to stay in a hotel for a little bit, until we found where we’re at now, our basement. 
I didn’t talk to my sister for about a year after all that. Then, she cheated on her ex boyfriend twice, and he kicked her out. So then she came back to us. Now she has a new boyfriend, and they both have a kid together, he stays with us too. 
Every day I have to walk on eggshells, because I don’t want to set my sister off, because I know if I set her off, my mom definitely won’t defend me. She never has when I came to my sister. No matter how wrong my sister is, she always picks her side. I guess it’s because I’m the youngest. 
 So I’m stuck in this basement, 7 other people. I have no privacy, and I can’t have friends over. Not even in my backyard, my sister won’t allow it, because she said we’ll be too loud. Although she screams everyday. And when she goes outside to smoke a black, she’s loud as hell. It’ll be like 3 AM, and she’ll be outside laughing loud and yelling. 
  I can’t ever have anything to myself, my sister or the kids always use my stuff. My makeup, my clothes, my hair stuff, it all goes to her. It really pisses me off, because if I say no, or complain about her always taking my stuff, then I’m being selfish, and I get yelled at. Maybe I am being selfish, but.. I just want to be able to go use my makeup without discovering that everything is empty. She doesn’t even ask. 
  Maybe I’m being a drama queen, but I hate it here. And I feel bad about hating it here, because honestly, my mom is trying her best. This is the best we can do. I don’t want that. My mom is 41 and lives in a basement with 7 other people. And soon it’s going to be 8 other people once my brother gets out of prison in June. 
I feel so ungrateful, because my mom really tries to give me everything. I mean, I have professional paint brushes and oil paints, I had to save up for a while, but I have them. I wasn’t able to say that a few years ago. My mom tries her hardest, and always spoils me when she can, yet I still complain about our living arrangement. Well, I don’t complain to her, but I definitely complain in my head. I just feel like there’s so many families out there who have nothing, and here I am, saying my life sucks. I’m so sorry if I’m coming across as ungrateful. 
I want to do great things. I’m the only one in my family who graduated, and it kind of lit a spark in me. I mean, NO ONE thought I would graduate. Not even my mom. They thought I’d be just like my mom and siblings. I never want to be like them. I have goals and aspirations and I want to follow them. I’m so sorry to my mom, but I don’t want to find myself like her, at 41 living in a tiny basement. 
Sometimes I get mad at myself for complaining, because we’ve been in much worse living conditions. We’ve been homeless 3 times, and had to stay in hotels for months, or stay with friends and sleep on their couches in their living room. We’ve come along way, but i just.. I hate my life. 
I really love to paint and create art. When I paint, I forget about everything else. I don’t want to sound too “hippie” but while I’m painting, I get these intense waves of happiness and peace, it’s like pure euphoria. I also get adrenaline rushes, not from coffee or red bull, just off painting. It’s like it gives me some sort of high. I love it. I don’t know what I would do without art, and I can’t think of a world where I did anything else but art for a career. I remember when I first started oil painting, in 8th grade. I’d clock in 12 hour painting sessions every weekend. I’d paint from 7 pm to 7 am. And on the days I had school, as soon as I would get home, I’d go straight to my desk and paint until 10- midnight. Painting is the only thing that keeps me going. All I want to do is paint for a living; I want nothing else but that. But I feel like I’ll never achieve that dream. My whole entire family are just a bunch of failures. I feel like I’ll be just like them. I know that’s harsh to say about your family, but if I’m being honest, I think it’s true. It’s like my family was just meant to fail. 
I’m starting to become desperate. I need to get out of this basement. I want to be free and and live the life that I want. The closer I get to 18, the more desperate I become. 
I do have a shot at being able to move out. There’s an art competition for a wonderful magazine- Beautiful Bizarre Magazine, and if I win first place, one of the prizes is 10,000 dollars. 
It’s just enough to get me away from here, and move to my dream place. Florida. I’m currently working on the piece for this competition, and I’m really pushing myself, but I can’t help but think that I’ll probably fail, and I’ll be forever stuck in this.. way of life? I don’t know. 
Thank you for reading for this long! And letting me vent. I guess I went a little overboard, sorry!",28May2020,1
596,"Hello dears, this is my first post, I hope I can explain my problem in the right terms.
As stated in the title I need advice in how I can talk to  my best friend about her relationship without offending her.
I do not like to confront people and am not really good in social situations, which results in me saying the wrong things/not being able to read the room etc.
My best friend is currently in a relationship with a guy, who is not really suited for her and shows behaviours that i think are big no-no's.
For example, he did not used a condom after she said she wants protection and he still talks and meet his female friend, who is clearly showing interest in him, even after my friend repeatly stated her sceptisicm of their friendship.
Ask for further information on this if you want.
She already called me many times crying, not doubting her relationship and not sure if she should continue her ""fights"", as she called it.
I already tried to talk with her about this, but she insists on her love for him and his love for her and blocked everything I said.

I just want the best for her as she is a really good person and deserves the best in the world.
But I am concerned she settles for less, because she is scared of what she really deserves.

So, how could I talk to her about this in a way she realises my concerns and don't just brushes it off?
Or should I even say anything?",28May2020,1

The job also pays very well and I could definitely use the money. Do I just ride it out for the summer and basically get paid to play games on my phone all day?

601,Maybe it is a difference in gender communication. I don't know. One of my good friends who is a girl usually clearly ends her FWB by telling them. I wonder why some people decide to disappear or ghost without an explanation. Is this common or expected FWB behavior? Some of my friends think he did nothing wrong. He is not my boyfriend hence he owes me nothing. Others feel like it is wrong to just leave someone hanging without any explanation. I did not interpret our thing/fling as a bootycall maybe he did. Is there a difference between how your FWB treats you versus a bootycall?,28May2020,1
603,"We’ve stayed friends after she rejected me like three months ago Bc I’ve been bored and two weeks ago she said she was upset about three lighthearted jokes I made. I told her that my intention wasn’t to upset her. 1.5 weeks ago I apologized for real and she said it wasn’t a big deal. Last week she sent me a meme about someone wanting to flirt but saying insults. I was kind of done with her and so I told her it’d be best if we part ways until school starts. She said okay, then screenshotted. I felt bad so then I gave her another reason and then she ended up typing a paragraph explaining that she wasn’t still upset about the insults and that she’d respect if I didn’t want to stay friends. I told her we could the next day, but she’s been pretty much dead to me since, barely responding, and has since stopped sending me daily streaks.

Only thing I can think of besides the insults that might have upset her were that last week I took like five SS of the chat accidentally and she said “that’s a lot of screenshots haha”, so maybe she thinks I care too much?

I don’t want to be desperate and apologize again, right? Let it go? Wait a week and apologize? Would like to keep her even as a friend, but I don’t want to force it.",28May2020,1

605,"a bit of context: my father is an alcoholic and my mom has been completely run ragged by their marriage. i was also not an easy kid to raise, but i’ve successfully turned my life around and now i’m someone she’s proud of. the point is, my mom has always been the primary parent and it is clear that she has been so exhausted by stress that she has clocked out as a parent. 

that leaves my younger brother, who i think fits into the forgotten child archetype. he did not cause trouble like i did while growing up, so his name was never mentioned. due to stress in our home and nobody really monitoring him, he found his retreat in video games. 

this has been going on for years. he plays ALL DAY, every. single. day. this is not an exaggeration. he’s only 15 and he’s going to be a sophomore in high school. during those years i was hanging out with friends and experiencing life as a teenager. he does not hang out with friends (even though he has them), he doesn’t even want to leave the house for anything. he chooses video games over everything. 

MemeAnalysis made a video talking about video game addiction on youtube and mentions media-induced autism, which i think my brother may have. i’m not claiming to be an expert, but hear me out. as a result of the persistent isolation and detachment from reality, he has zero social skills. he does not express emotion, only speaking in a flat tone. he keeps interactions short, avoiding them altogether if possible. he barely knows how to do anything and is not independent at all. he is completely unable to engage with the outside world. he doesn’t advocate for himself. he gets poor grades even though he’s smart. the only time i hear him laugh or speak loudly is when he’s on the mic talking to internet friends through a video game. 

as his older sister, it breaks my heart. that boy is my world. all my life i’ve been telling my mom everything i could. stressing the importance of my brother getting outside, having rules set to limit screen time. set chores for him! punish him if he doesn’t do his school work! something to break him into the real world. it’s exhausting seeing him sink lower and lower everyday.

when i try to approach my mom, she gets angry and shuts me up. she is someone who doesn’t like having the truth thrown in her face, and she avoids tough topics like the plague. she is not a good communicator. i’m the ONLY one in my house who tries to get my brother away from the screen, interact with him, and teach him social skills. it sucks because i feel like this falls on me, but i’m a college student with big goals. i have my own things to focus on. and most importantly... 

i am not his mother. his parents should be doing all of these things. thanks for reading. chime in if you want.

610,"Ive talked to doctors in the past about this, but with no results. I've gathered up alot of false information about it in the past, but now I think I got all the info I need. You see, I have this thing where I have uncontrollable thoughts that get triggered by certain words. For this to happen, I have to be in a certain mood. When I'm in this mood, I don't act or think differently, but I am vulnerable to the ""episodes"" as my family calls it. An episode will trigger if I hear the right words, for example ""when the boat leaves the dock, it sails away."" Something simple like that, and usually includes words that when you say them over and over, it quickly loses all meaning and sounds weird. When the episode is triggered, all hell break loose inside my head. I uncontrollably imagine a voice in my head arguing either with me, itself or an identical voice. I don't hear the voices, they just kinda play in my head, kinda like how you can imagine Morgan Freeman's voice in you head but you don't actually hear it. My body feels light and I feel as if I'm in distress or if I'm having an anxiety attack. My family reports that my face goes pale and emotionless, and I Babel nonsense that I don't even remember saying, for example ""can I have the"" while pointing into my grandmother's purse. A very long time ago I tried talking to my counciler about it and she said there was someone who randomly had episodes of being in their house, but it was flooding and the water level kept growing, but I don't know if that's related. If you need some background in my family, we do have a history of extreme anxiety, depression, and from what I know, I'm the only one with diagnosed ADHD and aspergers. Doctors know for a fact that it isn't PTSD and think that it's some type of seizure disorder or stroke. If anyone has something similar or knows what is happening, please share, I've been dealing with this for almost my whole life, and it would help me a ton.",28May2020,1
611,"Hi, I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I’m taking things out and making it a bit easier to read for anyone who comes across it. I’ll put a TL;DR at the end though :).

I’m 20F and I live in New York with my dad, step-mom, two sisters (17 and 5), and my two grandparents. That’s 7 people. Quarantined in once house together. For the last couple months. 

Now i’ll say this now, my dad and i are the only ones in the house who have absolute freedom with when we can leave and go places. He and i are both essential workers, we’ve been working this entire quarantine thing. 

The last couple days have been rough for me, i have a history of depression that comes and goes pretty often and it leaves my brain in shambles and pretty much like playdoe. I got hit with it this week and I’ve reached my breaking point, i mean I met it awhile ago but it burst the day before yesterday. 

So as we are in quarantine, chores have become a big thing, doing the dishes, taking the garbage out, poop scooping the backyard, etc. My step-mom likes to complain to my titi (means aunt in Spanish) about my sister and I not doing our chores. And I think it’s a load of bullshit because we do the chores, maybe not on a set schedule, but we do them. 

Id like to mention that titi doesn’t have any impact on our lives anymore in this house, and she’s a complete asshole. She’s done a lot and I’d rather not broadcast that much info on the internet but she did some fucked up shit. 

Before all this when I was thinking of getting a new car (I pay for insurance and the car payments which is 300+ and currently, because I’m working, i have no trouble paying on time and I’m full every month) because my old one was on its last legs I was going to go on a trip to California with her and my older cousin. She invited me a couple months before because I was looking at colleges out there I really wanted to go and see how it was, visit campuses, etc. 

Flash-forward to the day I ask my boss off for the weeks for our trip, I call titi to tell her that I got my days off. She proceeds to tell me that maybe I shouldn’t go, because they’re going for my cousins 30th birthday and it wouldn’t be fun for me because they’d be going to bars and clubs, and that because I wasn’t 21 they wouldn’t be able to go in with me there. I felt like i was guilted out of going because they wouldn’t have fun doing things if i wasn’t there. So she keeps telling me that we can do something else, plan a different trip, I can take those days back at work and save for another trip! I started getting short with her on the phone because I was trying not to cry and she asked if I was mad at her and I finally told her, “no I’m disappointed” and said I’d go visit my mom with my time off and hung up. 

Couple days later she offered to help pay for my car instead of going on the California trip. This is relevant because she said she’d help me pay for my car, and I only got a 100$ once and she never brought it up again. 

So anyway, I get a text two days ago from her, she says she has an idea. She lists off all the chores that my sister and I do in the house, giving me a schedule on when to do them and that she’ll help me with my car payments. And ends it with “hopefully we have a deal”. 

I don’t want to seem like an asshole for expecting more, but she said she’d do it in turn for taking the trip away from me. And then she said she’d help me pay if I started doing chores around the house. Chores that are already being done and have been done for years, mind you. The only reason that they aren’t on a schedule anymore is because when I work, I work odd hours. I work at a hotel and I work 12am-8am shifts and my boss fucks up a lot and puts me for different times (like one week she’d do 12-8 then a 4pm-12am then a 12-8 again) and it just messes up my sleep schedule. 


But the way she worded it, and the way she ended the text..it just hasn’t set right with me. I went on a long rant to my friend and it was a lot of “who does she think she is” stuff. I have been infuriated over it for awhile and finally turned to asking more people for advice because i can’t ask my family here. 

I think with my depression and lack of sleep or just lack of being completely there, I snapped. I haven’t responded to her at all, I didn’t acknowledge it for right now because I’m not sure what to say. 

I’ve dealt with a lot in my life with my mental health and struggling to come back from it for the past probably 13 years and I’ve wanted to move out of my house since. I don’t want to stay here anymore but with going to community college and getting my associates degree I couldn’t move out. 

I spoke with my younger sister and my mother about it, my sister wants to move out too, our house is pretty toxic when it comes to how the adults treat us, but she can’t leave until she graduates next year. I however have a degree and my mom is offering to let me stay with her along with my dog. My mom lives in Missouri, so I’d be leaving New York to stay with her and she’d help me find a new job and eventually help me find an apartment out there. My sister would join me when she’s graduated high-school and she’d go to  school close by and work to help me with rent. 

It’s not anywhere near now, (thought i’m going to stay with my mom for awhile to clear my head) but I’m scared if it’s not the right option or if doing this will just fuck me up even more than I already am. But I just can’t stay in this house anymore, neither of us can. 

Does anyone have advice?

TL;DR: My house is a shit show and my sister and I can’t take it, I want to move out and start over new...is it a good idea?",28May2020,2
612,"
Basically, I live in a 3 bedroom house and our rent is $1500/mo. When I moved in last year with my roommates, I took the smallest room and they took the two bigger rooms. We split the rent so I paid 400 and they paid 550 each month. Now, one of the girls in the bigger rooms is moving out. The girl in the other big rooms boyfriend is moving in. We plan to turn the third bedroom into a second common space for everyone to use. Also, I feel like I should note this, but we're all extremely close. The roommate left is my best friend and her boyfriend is also one of my close friends, and so is the girl moving out. 


So my roommate has proposed when her boyfriend moves in we split the rent 500 each way so it's even. Her argument is that her and her boyfriend will be sharing a room so they will have a lot less space, I will have access to a new common space, she lost her job from recent events, and her boyfriend pays 530 right now so paying 550 would be an increase for him vs 500 is a bit less.


I understand the common space argument, but we will all have access to the common space, not just me, and I will be paying $100 more for that access while they pay $50 less each. I don't know how to feel about the sharing a room argument -- I get that they will have less space, but that's a problem I've been dealing with for the past year because I chose such a small room. The arguments about her losing her job and her boyfriend's rent being increased by $20 I feel like don't matter at all because your rent is supposed to be determined by room size not your job status. And I am an essential worker, it's not really fair to ""punish"" me by paying more rent just because I still have a job. 

We need to make a decision in the next couple of days because our rent is due on the 1st. She just brought this up to me yesterday, and I kind of feel like she and her boyfriend should have had this discussion with me before we agreed on the move in because now I'm the one who has to make a big decision in a very small window of time. We do all have access to the new common space, so I would be willing to pay more in rent for that, but not $100 more. At the same time, her boyfriend is sharing a room, so I'm not sure if it's fair to him to pay 550. I definitely really wish we had all sat down and had this discussion sooner, but we are where we are. They also threw out the idea that I could move into the 3rd (larger) bedroom and we still split it 500 each way, which I feel is a lot more fair, but I honestly really like my room and it would be a massive hassle to move all my stuff to the other bedroom. 

Anyone have any insight? I just want there to be a fair decision made. Thanks so much!",28May2020,1

I told him that they were mutual. I am really happy but at the same time terrified. In comparison to me, he has a lot more experience (but he’s not a player or anything), having kissed, dated, had sex, and even fallen in love.

With that said, I feel like I’m going to mess something up since I don’t know what I’m doing. I would like to continue our budding relationship but I am so scared. I told him that I have no clue what I’m doing in terms of love and he said it’s okay and that he’ll guide me through it. But I feel like he doesn’t know truly how inexperienced I am and feel like it’s going to be obvious. We really cannot meet up due to the stay at home order right now but he asked if he could take me out and I told him I wanted to keep talking a bit more and go slow. He agreed and has respected my wishes, but what if I am going too slow for him?

Can someone give their input on the situation? I am really confused on what to do and scared but excited at the same time. Thanks.

tl;dr I have zero romantic experience and am currently talking to/crushing on a guy that I met in uni. He has romantic experience and likes me back. I am unsure where to go from here.",28May2020,2
616,"As of now, I am a 21 yr old who lives in the UK. I'm fresh out of University with a degree in Graphic Design, along with a girlfriend of 1.5 yrs. I have been given the opportunity to move to the U.S, Florida to be precise. This transfer would happen within the next year, but most likely in around 6 months time. 

If I decide to take this opportunity, I have to leave my girlfriend and leave my Dad behind in the Uk, to where I would start a new life in Florida where my Mum and Sister are living.

If I decide to turn down this chance, I would continue to live my life in the Uk and I would be none the wiser of what life could've been over in Florida. BUT I fear regret. What if the Uk doesn't turn out how I want and I kick myself for not going when I had the chance to. At least if I go to Florida and dislike it, I can always come back. But it means breaking up and starting fresh. 

As of now, I don't have a job or house and not many things tying me to the Uk, I do however have someone really important to me, that I'm not ready to let go of. Even though  I've been told time and time again that I'll meet many more people in the future to have relationships with. I could probably gain a job in graphic design in either Florida or the Uk, so I don't have many worries there.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. Any advice on things I should be looking at? Pros and Cons, anyone with any experience of this?

I can't say I'm excited to go to Florida, but the same goes for the Uk. Both countries are at a level playing field in my opinion. The difference is, if I stay, I get to be with my girlfriend. But I shouldn't make that decision because of her. I need to do what's best for me, and I don't know what that is.",28May2020,1
617,"Hey just wanted this off my chest as its got under my skin. Since COVID I have been placed on furlough. I got temporaily taken off to help on a project and then put back on. I would be more than happy to get back to work but as it stands I'm on an 80 percent wage paid by the government.

A few nights ago my boss text my personal number asking if I wanted to be involved in some 'training'. It seemed deliberately vague - I was told not to check work emails while on furlough but curious to know if I'd missed anything I went through my emails - nothing. The next day she text me telling me it had been postponed. 

Received another text this morning asking if I could join 'training' tomorrow. I responded asking what was the content of the course, obviously to establish if it would apply to my area of expertise. As far as I'm aware if you are placed on furlough all training should be paid the national living wage or voluntary. She replied asking if I had checked my emails (evading the question) to which I replied yes and that I couldn't find anything with regards to courses. She then just never replied.

&amp;#x200B;

My colleague who is still working just got in touch with me having spoken to my boss, my boss alluded to the fact that they were going to get 'help' from other team members and put it under the guise of 'training'. So basically working but not getting paid. I'm really irritated by this as I'd quite like to work again but the fact they are trying to keep me on furlough while working is disgusting. I don't know how I'll respond when she gets in touch with me again but I'm in a bind...

618,"Yesterday I asked advice about continuing teaching in fall. In the past, I was a part-time instructor for a single class in the summer session. This year, I’ve taught both spring and summer session and was just asked (yesterday) to teach fall.

I haven’t responded yet, was going to today. I noticed that the university has (without my response) gone ahead and listed the class and now has more students than ever enrolled in it. It’s more than my class in spring (which was a lot for me). For the record, the class was not originally offered in the fall. This change is extremely recent.

I’m a bit annoyed, but I also feel pressured into saying yes now. I’m fairly sure they did this on purpose, to wedge me into teaching it.",28May2020,1
619,"Hello all. I hope I am posting in the right place.
Almost once a week, I stop to buy crickets at a pet store/outlet near my house for my leopard gecko. I really enjoy going because they have an indoor pond where I can feed Koi, and I will also walk around the store to look at /talk to the other animals before I leave( I know that probably sounds silly). 

In the reptile room, where I’d usually go to grab the crickets, there is an enclosure for a tortoise. Her name is Roxy and she is about 14 years old, I think.  Her enclosure seems just way too small/low, and she looks absolutely miserable. This may not seem like a big deal, but It breaks my heart to see her try to frequently escape and attempt to get over the small sides that close her in. The sides are just high enough to where she can get her head over it, but slides back down scraping her mouth and hitting her face a little. Sometimes it looks like she is choking herself as well during these frequent attempts. I was reading up on care, and sites suggest the sides of your enclosure are at least 12 inches higher than your tortoise standing on her hind legs. So they don’t try to escape or injure themselves. 
If I had enough space/could afford  her I would buy her in a heartbeat. I have made a comment to the store about her living conditions asking if it was too small and was told she was fine, and apparently they have an “expert” that takes care of all the animals. Right..
I hope I’m not overreacting, please LMK if I am. I know that I am not more knowledgeable than someone who has studied animals/reptiles, but this just seems wrong/cheap for a place that is specifically for animals and their wellbeing. 
I will attach a photo of the enclosure and a short video of how she can stick her head over the enclosure. You can kind of see the marks on her mouth in the video.

It just makes so sad, I haven’t been able to get Roxy off my mind since my last visit. Any advice helps.

I am  a 23 years old girl and my parents split up when I was around 10. Stereotypically enough, my dad moved away to a different town. I am on good terms with him, but we don't really have that much contact, and I'm coming to the realization that we don't really know each other well. 

I never really thought this affected me much, up until I started seeing a therapist for my depression around a year ago. This is possibly a contributing factor to my depression.

Part of me wants to know what happened between them, so that I can accept it and move on . On the other hand I feel like it's kind of none of my business and might not lead to anything good at all.

Well, we had an issue with guys not filling out their time on time, so my Dads Cousin instituted a rule that from that point on if somebody’s time isn’t filled out on time, they don’t get paid for that day, or multiple days, or whatever. Which struck a nerve with me, but alrighty. Well this Monday was Memorial Day in the states, federal holiday, no work. 

Well I ended up developing a case of MRSA, and had to take Tuesday off. Well in this time I wasn’t paying attention, Friday’s time was never approved, and in fact was no longer even in the system, and paychecks are paid on Wednesday. So I go into work Wednesday, to find all this out, and that I was only paid 4/5 days I worked the previous week. So I talked to my dad that night, who said to talk to the girl who does bookkeeping this morning, and so I did. 

She basically said “I can’t do anything about it. The system has been working fine for everybody else, it was probably you.” So now I have bills due on the 1st, and I need this money, I’m pissed because I’m not getting my money I’m owed, and don’t particularly wanna take anybody to court because I want this to be my career one day, and I’m due to all of this, plus the stress of my job, and family expectations I’m starting to sink into depression.

626,"I’m a junior in college and when I met my best friend freshman year, everything was amazing. I’ve never found someone who I clicked with so well it was like we were platonic soulmates. We had a year of amazing friendship bliss, then we both got boyfriends at the same time and started to drift. Both of us studied abroad and stopped talking as much, and even though she was my friend, she would make me upset a lot. For example, one time I accidentally gave it away that her boyfriend had mentioned something about her Christmas gift for me. She got so mad that her boyfriend spoiled the gift (which he didn’t really because I thought it was something it wasnt!) and told me she was going to break up with him. I started crying from guilt and she didn’t at all try to comfort me and stayed mad. This is just one situation where she made me cry and then didn’t even try to comfort me in any way. 

Well anyways, this relationship has been awful for my mental health, but I can’t stop. I just don’t want to lose her. I talked to a therapist who talked about how it’s ok to let a friend go if they’re not good for you and I keep trying but I find myself texting her whenever I need a friend and the cycle seemingly never ends. I am bi and I think that at one point I had romantic feelings for her which doesn’t help because I’ve never had a confusing friendship like this before. 

Well she just got a girlfriend and turned 21 and had a party. I went and had a few drinks before and was just going to go for a little bit. People kept handing me alcohol and I was pretty high. But I wasn’t blacked out by any means just a little too loud and talkative. Well two of her friends came over and said I needed to leave because I was too drunk. They wouldn’t let me say goodbye to her and when I was drunk I said “if she makes me leave we’re no longer friends”. They said that’s fine just please leave. I started crying and i was just so confused because I wasn’t that drunk! My boyfriend picked me up and agreed that I was not too drunk but I suppose I could have not been reading the room well. 

Well I called her a bunch and sent her messages but this morning she read them and stopped sharing her location. That’s it. 

I just feel heartbroken. My body physically hurts. My birthday is tomorrow and I don’t even know if she’s going to acknowledge it. I think our friendship is over and I just feel like absolute garbage. How do I feel better about this?

630,"So I have nueropathy from an accident and occasionally I have a hard time clutching on my BMW. Naturally my mom goes with me to look at new cars, I was planning on going for a Jeep or a Subaru Forester however the same day we go to Hyundai and she buys a freaking Elantra out of the blue - did one text drive and bought it, no thinking or letting me have a say because I would probably have it until I'm 30. Now I didn't want a new car, I love my BMW 530i it's a e39 so a legendary car. Now she drives my Elantra more than I do because she drives a Aspen which needs a lot of work and is rusting out and the clear coat is failing, my BMW has half the issues, just a new rear seal, door seals, tires, and an alternator and I'm good. I have put around 100 miles on it while my mom has out around 1k. I drove my BMW to class nearly every day, except like twice because she had my car. 

Not to mention on my BMW she refused to let me call the shop about an oil leak until it hemmoraged from complete seal failures on the pan and everything but top and rear seals, I also said to her I thought it had a bad caliper, well we ended up having to replace the caliper, rotor and every brake line because it destroyed it all. My car was a time bomb waiting to go off. We only caught it because it leaked four quarts of oil onto the garage floor during Dorian. 

Can I convince her to sell her car which she hasn't driven in five months, it also now has very low tires and dead battery. Since I haven't left the house my BMW battery which was faulty has yet to be replaced either, not to mention my brothers car was hit by a tire. Naturally we have one functioning car out of four.

639,"So I’ve been with by bf for 3 years this March 28,
We moved to the east coast and on February 28 I left to come out back to Cali for other reasons, I have been here since and we’ve had some rough patches.
Here’s some background,
He was dating some previously and they were together for 5 years, his sister and her would hang out and go to the same college, she cheated and left and his sister is still really good friends with her, his ex has known that me and him were friends long before there relationship. I actually met this bf in high school through someone I use to hang out with, this friend brought some other girl around and she was dating my bf in highschool. He eventually told me back then how he fell in love with me first time he saw me, me and him became friends over time. My friends friend, would cheat on him, the one that was dating him in high school. He was a good guy but was his first
Puppy love and she fucked him over with money and cheating.  So after her, he dated the girl for 5 years and this girl of 5 years was always insecure about me because she thought he was always talking to me but he cut me off when he dated her. I was hurt as a friend back then but I was like well fuck. As long as he’s happy. So like I said. She too cheated and didn’t work out.  So the first year of my relationship I fucked up hard. I was still talking to and old friends that we had a thing but my boyfriend found my messages and all I did send 1 picture of my butt and I also was on a dating site at the time. That was my fuck ups, he forgave me overtime, I am still paying my dues and I snapped out of it after the 3rd time. I really got my act together because I didn’t want to lose him or make him hurt like that, I wanted this and I was willing to fix anything I ruined no matter how much it take so now with 3 years together... I have never or tried to make him feel like there’s someone else but he has this feeling/anxiety that I’m always gonna leave,
This is where things start fucking with me
He sent his a picture to his little sister of his first ex and never told me or sent me anything, I saw his messages with her. I was so annoyed because it’s like really? You hold these fuck ups against me but here you are doing weird shit like this?
They haven’t been together in over 5 years... he tells me he didn’t think it would mean anything.  He was losing it being back home and not seeing me for 3 months and I told him I was coming back the 6th of June and so anyways, a few days ago we got into another huge fight and he ended up suprisingme and showing up to California.. he stayed for a few days and left and how could I be mad... we were good then I noticed that he had some random girls on Ig but when I add any “guy” he overeacts,
When we first started dating, we had the mutual respect of getting rid of a lot of past people and I gone through the list but there was some girl still there before I came around, some girl from elementary and a few other fandoms. He said he doesn’t talk to them so what’s the point of having them keep an eye on you and us but yet he freaks out when I add any guy, especially military.  His blocked list on ig looks like he moved it around. We got into a really big fight and for those reasons and more. There’s certain issues that keep being brought up in this relationship and I will make those points later but so we got into this fight and 72 hours he surprised me in California with a bear and a huge rose bouquet,  he’s so passion when he tells me he loves me, he supports me, he goes to work and works hard and gave me a place and all. He has cried for me and begged me to not leave him.   So how could I not forgive him and hug him? He is begging me and crying and stood out in the heat yesterday waiting for me to walk over and surprise me... so last night where was I just had enough.
He was laying in bed ,he was tired and I saw his phone light up and it was my sister calling him.
I don’t know why, but I looked through his messages because and I clicked into the thread with his
Sister and sure enough... on March 3 he sent his sister a poem or some long story “he found in his email when he was cleaning it out”  that was his ex
This was weeks before our 3rd year mark...
I was livid and woke him up last night and demanded to know, he woke up and act all stupid. I don’t know what your talking, let me see and I showed him and his excuses we’re that was an old email, that he didn’t think it bother me or was that important, so I ask him so why didn’t you fucking send it to me then? Because my sister was close to her? I can’t believe the shit he’s telling me,
I care how? And right before my anniversary, yet he’s telling me he loves me and wants me home and he can’t stnad being away from me.. how am I suppose to feel that you still send your sister shit about your ex’s?   Or that you didn’t exactly tell me, or the fact that I have expressed so many times how I feel about shit like this, dishonesty or anything to do with other females... 

Let me make some points too

His dad, calls him and has him tried to hid money from me and his finances, calls him when he’s on his way from work. I expressed so many times that I’m sick of him giving the dad control over that and always needing him for everything! His dad talks shit about me and never once has my bf stood up for me
He’s been on the phone before and sometimes left
To talk outside or I caught him turning the volume down on his phone, or having secret conversations with his dad telling him to make sure that I don’t have his passwords to his Wells Fargo, the dad has even told bf that his sister was his favorite, while the quarantine. His dad told him he’s not allowed to come
Over and stay at his house! I can’t stand his fucking dad

Now the mom, 
While we were in Cali, living here and all. I use
To tell him he needs to clean his room up and throw up all his shit from the past. In there living room was a huge frame of his ex of 5 years behind the couch, I asked him for awhile
To get fucking rid of it and he procrastinated until I made him. So we threw a bunch of shit away and the mom found out and she literally dug shit up and is holding onto it for him? Who does that shit?? It’s so weird, I expressed and told him so many times I felt like he never backs me up with his parents.
He has told the mom shit but he can’t make her do anything? Yet it’s his own things from his ex... then he told me hasn’t really told her... then he said he tried but can’t force anything on her...  both of his parents can’t go a day or 2 without calling or blowing him up. Both the dad and mom and I expressed that I don’t like that he tells them everything I tell him,
Sometimes problems that were not for him to tell. I told him I’m over him constantly FaceTiming then and calling them to tell them everything, that he got a new truck, that he’s leaving the state for work, what color he shits and all that. It’s like fuck. We are both 25 and 28 and that shit needs to stop 

His sister being good friends with the, has previously told my boyfriend that she saw the ex and was talking to her.
My boyfriend is so afraid of his family, he can’t speak up or back me up. 
I never cheated the way his ex did and yet the sister is such good friends wifh her and I can tell the sister doesn’t like me. She’s a snob that attends a fraternity and anyone that’s not on her level, well you can tell by how she presents her self.

The whole night my bf kept bugging and waking me up saying he’s a fuck up and he’s sorry and he just wouldn’t let me sleep, he was crying and trying to hold me and talk to me and work it out. I broke it off and I’m so hurt... I have to go back the 6tj with him and I’m sure tired of feeling like he always puts his family first, his ex girlfriends. He wants respect but I feel like he doesn’t respect me, then he tells me what about what you did to me and I forgave you? I can’t believe he’s trying to justify his actions by saying I fucked up, yet I’m still paying my time for my
Errors...
This is all over a matter of time, it’s not one time that he’s not respected or never stood up for me.
I told him today he has to get the fuck out of my sight and go home to his damn parents and I never want to see him but I live with him...
Also his sister never calls him,
Never looks for him. They don’t really have a relationship and it’s weird and awkward and distant... but yet my bf calls her and asks how school is, how life is and all meanwhile he drives home from work and I’m never present. Yet he never sent pictures of us to his sister

640,"So I'm a developer and I had to talk to some people in testing dept to understand some issues. Now I joined this company right before the quarantine so I'm not friends with anyone here. I talked to this girl who's kind of cute. 

We had a normal meeting/call and at the end of it she said, you don't have to go through people to discuss something, you can just call me directly. I said ""Cool, thanks"" and ended the call. 10 minutes later, my lonely guy mind starts acting the way it does after talking to any women who talk nicely. And I start feeling like a loser, due to this thought process or whatever. 

10 minutes later she send me her number via slack. And I thought well good I'll just text her on whatsapp so she can have my phone number. But she wasn't on whatsapp‌, so I send her my number on slack and ask, are you not on whatsapp? (Cause here it's super weird if you're not on whatsapp) and she said she has another number for that. And I said cool. So now I feel like I've created an awkward situation.

And now to make it worse, I remembered that she told me that I can test using her account, and I asked her if that's the number I should use. And she said yes. She probably didn't even want me to add that to my contacts. 

Is this a  super awkward situation, or am I overthinking?

641,"I’ve been thinking about going back to school because I could further my career and make more money if I did. 

The industry I work in emphasizes education and I don’t have a good one: I have a 2 year college diploma in the trades. I work way above that pay grade right now, but I’m getting hints from my supervisor that getting a masters degree would be a good thing, possibly needed. 

Fair enough. 

Then covid happens and I see every industry contracting. It feels like an ideal time to go back school. I may naturally be getting more time off work (due to receiving fewer contracts) and I could use the time productively to further my career. 

I may also have a shot at doing my classes online if school closures keep up into the fall. That’s ideal because I can save thousands on rent and travel if I don’t have to get an apartment near school. It’s seems like perfect circumstances for getting this done. 

However, I have this lingering anxiety in the back of my mind that I could risk spending $20000+ on tuition and many thousands more on lost work, then come out to an even worse economy with no jobs. 

By then I’d have very little cash left for a safety net, possibly a bit of debt and be struggling for work along with thousands of others. I could lose my house. That terrifies me. 

The conservative part of me thinks it’s better to not make major purchases right now and hold onto my cash.  However if I do that, I’ll miss this perfect window for going back to school. 

I would also probably never be able to go back to school because I want to start a family soon. I’m in my late 30’s. This is a last ditch widow for going back to school. I can either go to school soonish, or shrug my shoulders, never upgrade and keep working as I have been. 

I need to make a decision this week. For the reasons I mentioned above and because of the application deadline, I can’t take a “wait and see” approach. 

What do you think? Should I do it?",28May2020,1

Came in to throw it away and before i could wash my hands i was having a short conversation with my boyfriend. Mother in law immediately says “omg your not going to wash your hands?! This is why i don’t eat here!” I was so insulted. I looked at her with disgust and told her i was having a conversation on my way to the sink. It’s fine! She smiled with a little giggle. I hope she felt dumb. 

Second time, mother in law comes over and wants to retrieve some food containers she let us borrow. Boyfriend retrieved the items from the bottom cupboard and mother in law asks him to wash it continuing with “just making sure there’s no little ‘tingz’ inside.” Boyfriend says “oh you mean like dust?” And she says “no like roaches”. Boyfriend “wow. Did you hear what my mom said?” I just ignored her monster face.

She rn sleeps in the same room as her brother. And she doesnt have a choice. Her parents dont value her privacy.

* Due to this, recently my gf's brother(24) found her masturbating on her bed while we were doing stuff together. He says that he'll take away her phone if they found out if we talk at night again.
* We dont have any other time to talk except at night because her family monitors all of her activity during the day.
* Both of us dont know what to do. Since its a typical Indian family, she cant talk about anything sex related with either of her parents or her brother.

I say she is ""toxic"" because she always blamed me for the arguements, even if we were both in the wrong, and she liked to spread our private drama. This caused me to have a number of panic attacks everytime we argued.

I go to a military academy. All cadets are split into companies: Alpha, Echo, Delta, Golf, and Fox. 
Now, for the past two years, Fox company has been the company for middle schoolers. ONLY 7 and 8th graders. Some older kids work there as staff. I stayed there one year as an 8th grader (and hated it) then moved to Delta for my 9th grade year.
Later that year the DI for Fox asked me to come back to staff, and I declined, because to me it just seems like babysitting. Also the kids in that company have 0 respect. I also like the Delta DI, and we do lots of stuff as a company.
Then... Quarintine

652,"Not exactly free, but I'll explain. 2 months ago I bought a gaming PC from a company called Lenovo. When it was shipping vis UPS to my house it somehow got lost in the process and I had to end up filing for a lost package claim. Lenovo understood the situation and told me they will be sending me a replacement unit. 

Well, they send the replacement unit and two days later UPS contacted me and said they found my missing package and will be delivering it to my hosue. I immediately called Lenovo and told them UPS found my original package and to cancel the replacement unit. They said okay no problem. I even sent them an email, so I could have something written down for solid proof, explaining how UPS found my original package and to cancle the replacement unit for I don't need it anymore. They emailed back saying no problem and they'll take care of it.

1 month goes by and what do I come home from work to last night?? The replacement unit. Now I have two of the exact same gaming pcs. Obviously Lenovo doesn't even care that much about recovering their replacement unit if it still came to my house.  On the contrary they could be testing me to see if I'll keep it or say something. My moral compass tells me to email them again, which I did, and just return the expensive PC.

Hypothetically speaking, if I never would have said something to Lenovo about me receiving the replacement unit even after I called them and emailed them telling them not to, would I be able to keep the PC without them noticing. I mean its very obvious to me that they completely forgot about my replacement unit and I could just get away with keeping it.

654,"*Tl;Dr at bottom*

I (23M/FtM) used to live in a variety of terrible group homes when I was younger but only one of them was very good to me and changed my life. As such, I'd like to someday move back to that town and give back to others by working there.

But, in comes my delimma: At my time of living there I was not out as transgender yet but I have fully transitioned now. I saw some of the girls in the girls home treating a trans guy who briefly lived there rather poorly. In some ways they were friends with him (he viewed them as such at least) but in other ways they sorta picked on him and made a point of misgendering him. And, while the staff weren't purposely mean they didn't seem to take him seriously and insisted it was the rules that they refer to clients by the name and gender on their paperwork. Still, some of them tried to be supportive and they never restricted him from binding or dressing how he wished though and no one ever took issue with him before when he identified as a lesbian woman. It's not a violent or abusive place for trans people but it is a somewhat unwelcoming and ignorant one. It's a small, Methodist run place in a tiny southern town so sadly ignorance is to be expected.

Because of the treatment I have seen I am worried about going back to work there. Many of the same staff I knew still work there and, even after transitioning, I have a very recognizable face and an uncommon surname. I worry that someone may out me, even non-maliciously. At the same time I worry that I won't be able to relate well to the kids there using my own experience because in keeping my stealth I also wouldn't be able to tell anyone I lived there lest I open myself up to further scrutiny from questions about my time there to people trying to recognize my name and face. I fear that maybe staff and kids won't take me seriously because of it and I'm not very good at standing up for myself or being confrontational, even if I'm being hurt or undermined in some way.

Because of the frequent severe abuse and law breaking that takes place in many group homes working in another one that was bad to me or that I am not familiar with is not an option, unfortunately, as I do not want to subject myself to watching staff beat up or negelect troubled children nor do I want to take part in that.

This is my dream job so I would like to know the best way I should approach and handle things when I inevitably apply and potentially work there. Any advice?

Thanks!

Tl;Dr I want to work at a girls home I used to live it but I have transitioned from female to male since living there 5+ years ago.

655,"I had my eyes opened not too long ago and not in the good way.

A little backstory: I am a student at university and as part of my daily routine, I drive to and from campus. About 3 months or so ago, I was in a car accident on my way to classes. I had some serious injuries, but after a couple weeks in the hospital, I’ve recovered.

Things have returned to “normal” now, but would you believe that all that time while I was in the hospital, not one person checked in on me. Not a visit, not a call, not even a text. None of my friends or even my family cared to wonder where I was all that time. If it wasn’t for the fact that I had to tell my professors that I wouldn’t be in classes for a while, I’m sure no one would have known. In all this time since then, no one I talk to has cared to ask where I was.

It really shouldn’t come as a surprise, if I’m honest. I’ve always known I wasn’t ever a solid person in anyone’s life. My family has always been the type to say that your life and your problems are just that, yours. So I don’t hear much from them. But really, when it comes to everyone else, i’ve always been treated like a juggling monkey. I’m a fine distraction and person to be around when there is nothing else, but once someone or something better comes along, I’m left in the dust. And it’s always been this way, ever since I can remember. I’m always the one to initiate conversations, never had someone text me first, never been invited to outings or events, and clearly never been in a relationship. The only interaction I do get is from those I work with who have an obligation to be around me. Do you know how degrading it is to be treated like a literal npc in real life?

But this period of quarantine has given me time to reflect, and that time in the hospital has really put everything into perspective. I can only think that there has to be some major character flaw about me as a person that I can’t see, and thats why no one bothers to care. With the amount of people i’ve known, I can’t reasonably think that it’s everyone else who has the problem. And I know i’m not the most exciting person to be around, but I mean, nobody? Am I really that useless of a person? I don’t much like my life, wasn’t sure if I wanted to stick around. But I figure i’d ask here for advice, maybe someone might know what to do, I don’t have anyone else to go to.",28May2020,1

When I start a conversation with someone it goes great and goes on for a while. We talk about almost anything from likes to dislikes, hobbies and anything we can talk about, it even goes as far as personal moments where they open up to me which makes me happy that they trust me enough to open up to me and tell me about their personal struggles, personally I cherish those moments because it feels genuine and makes me think they’re genuinely my friends. 

But I’ve noticed that I’m always starting conversations and on top of that I’m keeping it going by asking more question to invoke a response, It feels like I’m the one who always drives the car and steer it and if I stop they won’t try and drive it by themselves… they just leave. 

I even went on to create a “bonding moment” to counter this but I always seem to ask more and get asked less and in the end it didn’t look like a progressive counter.

665,"So, my friend, a POC, is in his senior year of college. He is a pre-med, but has struggled immensely in his courses (due to working multiple jobs, etc). Because of this, his GPA is not all that competitive for medical school.

Recently, within the past year or so, a white female (the year below him) in his major has approached him, requesting that he give her old exams, homework, lab reports and complete her online homework and quizzes for her, in exchange for compensation. He has aided her in plenty of courses, including the dreaded Organic Chemistry, various Biology courses, and (due to COVID-19 and classes being entirely online) is now essentially taking her Physics class for her. She is paying pretty well, so I understand the appeal of her offer.

However, I am super disappointed that a Caucasian individual is going to likely get into medical school based off of a GPA she did not earn, and that my friend, a fellow POC, is not just okay with this notion, but is enabling and contributing to it. 

Think about it: She is not spending any time actually studying/attending lecture, but has a stellar GPA. With this free time, she is taking part in community service and clinical experiences that she will need to make herself an outstanding candidate for medical school. Meanwhile, my friend spends most of his time studying, and when he is not studying, he is working to put himself through school. Even with all of the time he spends studying for his courses, his GPA is not the greatest. After all, he could not afford to pay someone to take his courses for him; therefore, not securing that 4.0. Without any free time, he is also not gaining any clinical experience, nor has he gotten much community service hours under his belt. When you look at my friend and this girl on paper, she seems like the better medical school candidate. 

A small $500 investment on this girl’s part is ensuring that she will one day be earning a ~$350,000 salary.

This reminds me of the Lori Loughlin situation. A rich white woman paid the admissions board to essentially steal some deserving student’s seat in a prestigious school. In my situation, the white girl is obviously Lori Loughlin and my friend is not just the deserving student getting their seat stolen, but he is also the admissions board allowing this corrupt behavior to transpire for a payout.

If that’s the case why don’t we cjill as friends at his house is what I don’t get unless he doesn’t actually see me as a proper friend and just a smoking buddy (he does live with family but he has his own room in a basement with just a bed only tho no chairs or whatsoever) so I can see why it’d be awkward I guess

673,"My boyfriend and I are friends with a couple (the guy in the relationship is my partners step brother) and we are all around the same age (late 20’s) with similar interests. They are go-getters, very into their professional careers (lawyers) and quite intelligent. We are more on the low-income end (students) but make do with what we have. 

We like them, have been hanging out for a few years and they are pretty much family... but recently both my partner and I are starting to despise their center of attention, inconsiderate, and know it all behaviour. 

Just 2 days ago we had them over to our backyard with appropriately spaced out chairs to keep a safe distance while celebrating my birthday over a few beers. They had cancelled the original date of the hang out on my birthday because of unexpected work emails, no big deal. However, when they arrived on the rescheduled day, the girlfriend (Sarah) made it very obvious she didn’t want to be here because she was tired. She brought wine for herself but wanted beer instead, so what does she do? decline my offer of a fresh can, ignore the seating I put out for her, and sits on her boyfriends lap to share his beer out of the same can. The rest of the night consisted of them constantly touching each other and talking about how they are so excited to be our tour guides for all the trails they have picked out for us on our camping trip.

Another example is when my partner and I are driving us all on a road trip and they are in the back telling us what routes to take, what time to leave, what our agenda consists of. If I have a recommendation? The response is to completely ignore it and pretend I didn’t say anything.

This experience, among many like this, has put a bad taste in my mouth. I am supposed to go camping with a couple who are constantly acting more superior than us, are controlling, and I don’t know how to handle it. My boyfriend doesn’t want to create feud with his step brother, and I don’t want to lose them as friends because of the family dynamic. 

They are always “nice” to us and we never argue so sometimes I feel like I’m in the wrong for pointing out these flaws in their personality.

How can I deal with this in a mature way?

TLDR: our couple-friends are controlling, act as though they know everything, and looooove PDA, whereas my partner and I are kind of the complete opposite. But we are tied to them because one of them is a close family relative. How can we handle their behaviour without losing our minds????",28May2020,1

Not sure if it has to do anything with drug use, but I’ve been smoking weed every since the beginning of this year and these feelings kind of just came right after the last time I did. The last time I did was around 2 weeks ago. I have been feeling extremely weird during the day, like people’s voices just are too loud and I’m not really the same. It’s hard to explain but I feel like I’m totally unconcentrated and my mind is racing insanely. My mind races through the craziest most random shit and in my mind I like have mini dreams sort of, like it’s hard to explain. And when this occurs I feel like I need to go to sleep, even if it’s during the day. Like I’m always tired. When I go to sleep at night it gets even worse as I literally cant tell if I sleep or not because my mind is just racing with these things. I also heard someone whisper my name one time around 5 nights ago before I fell asleep and when I woke up.

I do a great job, and have great reviews from customers but  I have been in this hole for years and years and I can’t get out of it. My credit is ruined, I live with a friend, I’m struggling to pay my already low bills, my business is slipping fast despite being in business for years. I can’t get loans, nor did I receive a stimulus check, or any government assistance for my self employed assistance during this COVID pandemic. I feel like I’m always getting the short end of the stick. I try to take this hard times as ‘character building’ or whatnot from God, and that’s pretty much my only positive I take from a lot of stressful situations. Idk what to do. I don’t want to go out and get a 9-5 job because i feel like it will set be back but I’m reality it might help me. Maybe even motivate me more.. I feel like I’ve lost my vision. 

But I’m here for advice to hopefully show me different perspective. When I’m stressed out, I always think “man if I was just dead I wouldn’t have to worry about this anymore” or when Someone says be careful when I’m about to do something I get the thought “yeah, if that killed be I’d be lucky”. I feel guilty for having these thoughts because I try to be thankful for this life that I do live, and thank God for it. There’s people all over this country/earth that would probably be grateful to be put in my position. 

Is there anything you can tell me to keep me from having these negative thoughts so much. I don’t really project my emotions to anyone, and keep it in, so I’m not bringing down anyone around me or want them to worry.

Right after that we started having problems, he would often wake up at a late time and won't even reply to me sometimes. We had a fight about it and soon after that he ghosted me.

After three months, he came back, he told me that he's sorry for what he's done and that he should've told me sooner that he was tired of me getting mad about what happened before. He asked for another chance so I gave him. I could actually see that he changed and I was beginning to believe that he was willing to become better. We would often call each other, he made promises and even made a playlist.

April came and we were fighting again, he would always wake up late like before and would always make me wait for a long time like a whole day. There were times wherein he would play the whole day and not communicate with me at all. That's when I asked him if he still wants this and he told me that he wanted to focus on his self first and that he wasn't ready for a relationship. He still tries to talk to me and I'm confused right now. Up to now I'm still mad at myself because I allowed him to fool me twice and it hurts so much. I don't know what to do right now.",28May2020,1
680,"My neighbour that is diagonal to my backyard has started complaining about my dogs barking persistently. She came to my house the other day and yelled at my dad, threatening to call the city and her lawyer because our ""barking"" dogs are disturbing her dog. My dad told her that it is not our dogs barking for hours on end and that she had no proof. She did end up calling the city to make a complaint against me specifically (she used to be friends with my cousin who lived with me years ago and I think she only knows my name). I got a call from the city this morning informing me that there was a complaint against me and that she had stated that my dogs bark everyday for at least an hour, non-stop.  Ever since then, I've been an anxious mess.

I want to state that my dogs do bark a tad when there are other people in their backyards and sometimes at squirrels. However, we do not tolerate the barking and bring them inside immediately. We also never leave them outside unattended because there are skunks in the area and our one dog has already been sprayed by a skunk during the day. There are also multiple dogs in the neighbourhood that bark but none that have been barking daily for hours. I believe that she has some sort of personal vendetta against me, my family, and my next door neighbour because we complained to the city about a massive garbage pile in her backyard that has attracted a family of skunks and a family of raccoons (the skunk my dog got sprayed by lives in that pile). I'm not really sure what her motivation is for coming after me specifically but it's made me anxious for the past week.

I'm not really looking for advice on the situation but just how to manage my anxiety around it. How do I convince myself that she's full of it and that she can't pursue a case?

Unfortunately, my ex is a really outgoing person and everyone really likes him. I’ve become very hurt after finding out someone I am close with has been talking to him. Sometimes, he will be friendly towards my friends, and I get very upset knowing the horrible things he did to me. It’s very triggering for me. 

Unfortunately, my own brother (M16) loves him. While I was with him, my brother was so proud that I was dating someone like him. I think he really looked up to him, which is unfortunate because he is a very aggressive, abusive, and untrustworthy person. After I broke up with him, my brother was so angry at me. He called me a bitch just for breaking up with him, and he actually texted my ex an apology. His apology went along the lines of “I’m sorry my sister broke up with you, she’s a bitch. You deserve better”

When I started dating my new boyfriend, my brother called me a whore, slut, etc. He started to insult my new boyfriend’s appearance and called him a wimp.

People are telling me this sounds like you are either looking for a long term girlfriend or (If you’re in love and all your time is spent with this person and you guys are happy and harmonious and thinking about kids, why not eventually:) marriage.

So now... almost panic hits me. 

Call it my casual sex lifestyle. (What religious folk would call ‘fornication.’)
but since experiencing so many attractive beautiful sexy partners: 

How can people (and me) be totally 100.0000% happy and satisfied with with your partner’s genitals being the ONLY genitals you will ever see again for your entire lifetime? Having ONLY that sexual experience for your entire lifetime? How is this possible? 
I am weighing the pros and cons of marriage of course before I decide to find a special girl, settle my
Wild ass down and marry and fully truly deeply commit to her, making a list before deciding to really commit to one woman until death do us part here. 

This keeps troubling me about it I guess? If this is the right way and best way and stuff then aren’t we missing out on all the other “flavors” of sexuality of other sexy, different very attractive people?

I mean genitals are slightly different and very similar but, (NSFW SENTENCE:) I’m a man and I enjoy the right ass and just right vagina and boobs so so much, each womans in my experience is very unique and different and special. Almost like her unique soul expression. Her flesh is a divine flower of HER essence, it’s quite beautiful really. Getting poetic, back to the main point: 

By committing to ONE partner, only, you are literally blinding yourself to and I guess “missing out” on every single other attractive other mate’s entire sexual parts and enjoyment of that on earth. For your entire lifetime, basically. 

So like, are we more than cool and truly happy deeply satisfied and content with that? How! and why is that? Truly truly. When an attractive partner, another potential mate walks on by looking amazing, what is going through your head? I just feel like I don’t get to experience her flavor, too, so it’s a fear of loss. 

But I don’t want to just going around being casual hopping from body part to body part being in these “relationships” forever and die, right? I was thrown out in the cold last night and she just used me for my dick and wouldn’t even let me sleep over, I’m sick of being used like this, no love, no care. An endless sea of sexy fuck.

707,"8-year-old sister had asked me whether she was born was because of sex. I honestly answered “yes” because I knew she would find out sooner or later. Also, I don’t have the heart to lie to her. Although I did not delve into the lovemaking details usually reserved for Sex Ed (penis goes into vagina, sperm fertilizes egg, etc), the way she phrased her question was one where you cannot fool her into thinking she was transported by UPS storks.

I was slightly relieved she didn’t press on for what I was taught in Sex Ed, but she has absorbed how pregnancy works, one by a tell-tale sign of missing a period (which she has not completely learned yet). She had gained this knowledge by subscribing to a YouTuber who talked about her pregnancy experience (I’m guessing in vlogs and AMA form).

Having her own phone, she started to do something I only remembered doing first at 15 on my desktop: googling XXX on purpose. I thought she would be searching for the movie XXX: Xander Cage or the late rapper XXXTentacion (autofill gives his profile), she actually typed in XXX as in intent to enter a pornsite. She had clicked on images and had screenfuls of naked sex, with cum dripping out in some, faces of orgasm and pain in others and period sex in one image. Her curiosity ended up in me explaining to her that the cum is “discharge” (which she didn’t probe further into) and that sex is painful, comparing it to the most painful vaccination she remembered. She listened in awe, and I was asked if I had done it before with my SO. No, sis. (context: SO didn’t consent, wanted to keep the V-card until marriage. But watched porn regularly and had friends who slept around)

Since I had gone this far down the rabbit hole, I warned her that sex is by mutual consent ONLY, and she cannot do it until she is grown up (I regret not telling her both partners must be 18), and she must refuse any sexual encounters or I will personally hunt the predator down. I repeatedly emphasized that underage and/or non-consensual sex will get her and/or her partner thrown in jail.

The previous paragraph, yes, were big words for an 8-year-old, so I analogized it to a game of NERF (since she is a NERF enthusiast, and I have a NERF gun at home) - “you must get your friend’s permission, and both you and them must be OK with playing NERF together. If your friend says no, and you shoot them anyway, you’re a bully and will get into trouble. Because your friend already said no.”

Now, she remembers having the talk as the ""NERF talk"". I’m quite shaken by this. I never had “the talk” at home growing up, and I only had Sex Ed, biology, porn, and my friends’ sexual experiences to formulate this. I am concerned with how much exposure she has when she is not with me or my folks. Should I let my dad know about the talk? Is it rude for me to tap her phone (personal property) and tighten Internet control? How do I approach this? Any advice is appreciated.

Also, if this is more appropriate for an asking parent forum do let me know. Thank you.",28May2020,2

I’ll give two examples: my friend (24) accused me of being casually mean, rude, and hurtful and the example she gave was of a time she thinks I called her uncreative.
What happened was she had expressed that she didn’t feel comfortable or creative enough, I don’t remember her exact wording, to GM an RPG and tell a story in that capacity. A few months later she said she wanted to try co-GMing a one-shot and I said something like “but I thought you weren’t creative enough run a game?” I don’t remember my wording, I may have said it that way, I may have not. But the intent behind my words was that she wanted to try something I knew she wasn’t confident about and I wanted to know what gave her the courage because I was proud of her. She held onto that for a while and I didn’t hear anything about how she’d felt when I said that until we had a fight a month or two later. When I heard, I immediately apologized and was horrified that I, as it had been presented to me at the time, had called someone uncreative. I felt awful about it for the rest of the week.

2nd example, I was performing in a formal instrumental concert. I normally wear cargo pants, boots, and a t-shirt and jacket with my hair short or down, so formal concert black with heels and my hair up with a bow is a dramatic appearance change for me. My extended family had come to see me perform and afterwards, my uncle (65) came up to me and said with approval “wow, you clean up good without all that camo shit!” I thanked him for the “compliment” but I was a little offended by the comment. I too didn’t say anything even though I know he would have apologized. I know he wouldn’t wouldn’t have felt bad about it though, just apologized and made some other comment the next time I saw him. And I know he meant well, but again, how much responsibility should one take for their words?


Is there a difference between the two examples? When is it okay to be offended by something where no offense was meant and when is it walking on eggshells around a person? And if all emotions are valid, doesn’t that mean that someone who is very easily offended and takes things personally has every right to get angry over every perceived slight? If I hypothetically admire someone’s clothing and a friend says “hey I didn’t like how you admired their clothing because it made me feel bad about my own” should I take responsibility for hurting their feelings, even if I didn’t intend to? How much does intent matter? Nobody ever wants to intentionally hurt others, but sometimes it happens. How much responsibility should you take? How much do you need to respect someone else’s insecurities?

And on a slightly different topic, what about unsolicited advice? I used to be a bartender and this one server used to come up to me all the time and tell me how I could be doing my job so much better. Am I in the wrong to say “hey, just let me do my job”? And if I do, are they also in the wrong for holding it against me that I don’t want to make use of the “two-bottles-one-hand-pour” that’s definitely faster?

Sorry if this post is kind of a mess, I’m very confused and am trying to make sense of as much as I can, even what it is that I’m trying to figure out. Advice would be helpful!",28May2020,1
709,"Hey, I've been wondering, is there anyone who cheated on someone and never ever told that person what they did? I know this person who has been in a relationship for almost two years now and all of the sudden he had an urge to feel that ""sparkle"" again. He met a girl and the both liked each other but remained friends. He already had a girlfriend so... But something happened - he couldn't stop thinking about that other girl and then when they were together, they kissed etc. He told me he doesn't feel bad about it because he just felt it and knew he'd regret it if he didn't do what he has done. He never told his girlfriend because he says he loves her and he also knows she's the one - the love of his life. What do you think about this and do you have any similar experience?",28May2020,1

my dog passed away yesterday. ive had him since i was a child, he was 13. safe to say im devastated right now

i feel so guilty. i didnt say a good enough goodbye, among other things. all i want is to just die and see him again. ive struggled a lotsith depression and suicide for the last five or six years of my life. its gotten a bit better but now i just cant do anything. i havent washed my hair in forever, i havent been eating properly, i cant exercise as im recovering from surgery (leg surgery, patellar realignment. im maybe 2 or so months after it? which is a lot of time and i can walk again but i cant run, i cant take super long walks, etc. not that id have the energy) and i cant even see my friends. i feel myself falling further and further into despair

ive contemplated drugs, (which is available to me unfortunately), self harm, just anything to feel something other then this awful sadness

i need some sort of purpose, aomething to just keep me going. something to live for. i dont look forward to rhe future, i have a really bad education situation (think neglect) so i dont think theres much for me. im not hopeful towards college or anything. my hobbies arent easy to make work out of without money for supplies, which i dont have. my dad runs a restaurant so we arent exactly rolling in cash so id never ask him for that kind of thing right now

volunteering sounds nice but everythings closed. i cant work at my dads restaurant because theres really just not much for me to do at all? i cant do much kitchen stuff and i cant do front of the house stuff due to really bad anxiety. i consider myself to be a really good baker, but my dad doesnt want me doing any work there anyways. 

for the record im on medication (Effexor) and i am in Therapy, it just feels hopeless. maybe i should get a plant?",28May2020,1

713,"So I, like most college aged people right now, am currently stuck at home with my family because of the pandemic. I had plans to go see my boyfriend, who lives in an amazing small island community in Alaska, in July but because of the pandemic everyone on the island has to quarantine by themselves for 2 weeks before they can join everyone else. (So essentially the whole island is a ""quarantined unit"" meaning they can hangout like normal because you quarantine before and then if you leave you have to quarantine again). This makes my coming in July an issue because thats the height of the fishing season and my boyfriend can't afford to take off for 2 weeks to quarantine with me. (Im staying with him so it would be incredibly hard to quarantine by myself). Anyways the only possible solution I can come up with is so go up there early, before he starts fishing in late June. Even though I'm technically my own adult I'm still in that age where my parents have a lot of influence on my life and long story short my mom does NOT want me to leave in June due to the country reopening (new spike?) and some past mental health problems. I've tried explaining to her that if I stay at home I'll be wasting my summer where as if I go soon not only would I experience a once in a lifetime summer (with glaciers, otters and alaskan mountain views) I also have the opportunity to work a well paying job doing something I love. (I could work in my hometown but it would most likely be a lot less money and theres not much in the way of hiring right now). Anyways, my dad says I should do it because its something I'll regret for the rest of my life if I don't but, my mom clearly has her foot down (parents are divorced).

716,"So I'm getting married June 6th. Hair and makeup trial run was last night at a place that basically specializes in wedding hair and makeup. It looked ok at first and they insisted that they could make my hair look any fuller without extensions. The first hairstyle was a curled half up/down do and was so half-assed. The curls looked like frizzy beach waves. Like I had curled my hair and spent the day at the beach and most of the curl had fallen out. For the updo, she didn't start over...just pinned up the part that was down and called it a night. It was falling out before I got home. I wanted a loose romantic updo... It can be done without it falling out. All I did was drive home. It didn't look how I pictured or like the picture. I told her I didn't want a tight sleek updo... Her excuse was that I basically didn't have enough hair. 

The makeup looked ok at first...not exactly what I was thinking but they say your makeup will look different than how you'd do it because they're doing it so it looks good in pictures. Two hours later my face was an oil slick. The only primer used was on my eyelids so the eyes look good...mostly - the color was off for my skin tone or something. Two hours later the foundation was sliding off my face. Patches were missing below my mouth, on the bottom of my chin, most of the skin above my mouth, my nose, and a little between my eyebrows. I told her I have very oily skin before she ever started. No primer, no setting spray, just foundation and what looked like powdered foundation, which bothered me during times of COVID. She used a blush brush directly on the compact that's been used on who knows how many people and it was too late when I realized. The center of it was gone from use... You could see the metal pan it comes in. Anyways, she used lipsense on my lips. It looked good at first, but after the gloss came off, it was awful. The color was bad for me. The eyebrow color wasn't right either...

This cost $115 without tip. They have a cancellation policy that appointments must be cancelled 14 days prior or you may be charged for the full service. I cannot stomach the idea of paying them this much again to do my wedding look and it being a repeat of this disaster. The trial was done after the 14 day window had passed. How could I have known it was going to be a crap shoot before the trial? 

How can I get out of this?

TL;DR: Getting married next week and the expensive trial run turned out to be a disaster. Don't want to pay for the full service since cancellation policy states I may be forced to pay for the full service if it's within 14 days of appt.",28May2020,1

720,"Before I went to college, I was always around white people, given the neighborhood I grew up in.

After I started college two years ago, I became a lot more open-minded to things. 

Now, I am becoming more and more bothered by my friend group back home. They use it casually everyday ""as a joke"". I let it slide and don't say much, but I really want to communicate how ignorant and *corny it is.*

725,"It is all my fault. I was myself until I run away from my abusive home at 24, only to come back at 25 with my tail between the legs after a year of poverty, totally due to lack of financial literacy.

I panicked that I was not satisfying my parent's sky-high expectations and I was also terrified with the possibility of being LGBT, so I threw myself first in a ""cool"" undergraduate program that went nowhere (it was in another city, impossible without attending) and then I cracked and re-enrolled in a totally toxic religious program that I tried (and got burned by) at 19 that promised (in my mind) all the high brow satisfactions that my parent wanted.

This is when I lost myself. I gave up ALL of my true self, all the things that made me happy to fit there and be with them, and after quitting three years later I had to rebuild: processing the loss, processing the shame of quitting at 30, coming out, getting a degree in something I love, finding a job, running away this time successfully, learning how to live on my salary, finding another job after a layoff, deal with my parent's death. So that bad choice of religious studies burned 10 years of my life that I will never have back, from 27 to 37.

Now I remember what I was, because of the music, and I desperately want to be that person again, not what I have become. I used to have passions for a number of things, and I quit it all. I used to be confident, to have a life, not caring about pleasing people, I was perhaps unhappy and struggling with life at home and expectations, I was way more immature, but I was myself, and I was putting myself out there all the time. I have memories of those years, but for the next ones is only coping and reactions and dealing with things.

727,"I got a decent job in November 2019.  Many things have changed with my personal life and my mental health and I've made the decision to ultimately move back home for a reset, then to a new city after I have recollected myself.

The learning curve for this job was not difficult, but things were taught to me over months of time  because it was not ideal to learn everything at once. My lead and my boss always commend me on how great and competent I am with everything I learn. I am about 90% complete on that list of things to be trained on, but unfortunately I will be leaving in about 2 months. 

I feel awful. Before I was hired, the duties of this 2-3 person job was being juggled by one person (my lead). I know that me leaving means once again he will be swamped with all of the work. Since I have only been here 6 months, and still have a few minor things to learn, of course they are not expecting me to leave. I decided I will give them a months notice as opposed to 2 weeks, even though that is probably not enough time to find a replacement, let alone train them. We are now working from home and this may complicate that process further (And yes I know none of this is my problem).

I suppose I feel guilty because since I've built a rapport with my lead, it seems wrong to leave him in the dust. He's been a gracious teacher showing me everything patiently and thoroughly and he is always and forever open to questions that I have.  I  can't help but think of how difficult I am making things for the team by leaving. I don't want to burn a bridge, as I always like to use my previous jobs as a reference when applying for the next one. I just feel like this will upset them deeply.

So on Saturday, my girlfriend and I finally had sex for the first time in 9 weeks. So, of course, we use a condom. It's all good. Then I need to take a breather, and so I do. However, for whatever reason, my mind remembers that there was semen inside the condom, and I felt a transparent sticky fluid on the outside. Thing is, I did not reach orgasm nor actually ejaculate, so I have no idea if the semen on the inside was real or not. Both of our memories of the whole thing are very foggy and we don't remember much. What I do remember is feeling that fluid I mentioned on the outside, changing the condom immediately and using another brand new one.
There couldn't have been any holes, as far as I know. My girlfriend had them for the past 9 weeks in her drawer, and I gave them to her brand new, and intact. Now, normally her period falls between the 23rd and the 28th (ish). It is now the 28 so, it's very possible she's late. However, I believe that what is happening is that I'm very anxious about it which causes me to have one of those ""when you leave the house and think you left the door unlocked so you go back to check"" type situations.

I have something written out and I would love to know if it sounds appropriate or is offensive in any way. 

“All lives do matter, that much is absolutely true. However, the reason why we advocate for “Black Lives Matter” is not because we think one life is more valuable than another, but rather because there are so many people in our country that still don’t see black people as valuable, loved, or appreciated. No one ever thinks that about white people as a whole. Of course all lives matter, that is exactly why we advocate for black lives matter, too. We want our brothers and sisters of color to feel valuable in our country. We want them to feel equal and appreciated. That is why, because an entire people is still being treated unfairly and as less than others, even today. They have protested peacefully for decades and have seen no change. They face a fear that no human deserves to face based on the color of their skin alone. This is why we fight for “Black Lives Matter,” to remind our brothers and sisters that they are loved and they are not alone.”

Many of my family members are not intentionally racist, but I don’t think they fully understand the situation either. They’ve never had to before.

737,"Buckle up. My father isn't the greatest guy. He had multiple children by multiple different women and had a history of illegal activity by the time he met my mother. Throughout my childhood he has done the following; cheated on my mother numerous times (even with our godmother, teenagers and my brothers gfs mom ) more illegal activity (dealing and my brother suspects pimping), had another child with one of mistresses (no one knew for a year and i had even babysat the baby before we knew), has preacher toxic ideas to me about women, left me for hours after forgetting to pick me up somewhere, made fun of me for cutting myself and him and my mother have fought so bad ive had to go to my grandparents for a few nights. I could literally go on and on. Throughout all of this he has manipulated my mother into thinking they have something ""special"" and that no one else would put up with her because shes depressed. My mother isnt a saint, she has forgotten to pay bills ans flirted with men online but i dont think it anything compared to what my dad has done. He's not the devil, we have had some nice memories of him as kids being a good dad to us and I struggle with how i feel about it but hes a clown and not only has he treated my kom badly he has put my brother and i in sketchy situations and associated with strange people around our family.
Now for the question. When I was a teenager (23 now and a girl if that matters), my dad collaberated with one of his old flings and catfished my mother. He posed as a woman of her age and pretended to be her friend. He says it was because my mom didnt have friends and he wanted her to have them. But thats bullshit because everytime she tried to go out in the real world and be social he wouldnt let her. He wanted to snoop on her, sure he found out that she flirted with some guys online, but thats it, he would convince her not to leave him if she talked about that and he would just manipulate her more. Mom knows about 99% of what my father has done, and I guess if she didnt leave him by now she wont. But im hoping that the next time she has that thought of being independent and getting her own life and people who care about her, she will remember that and it will add more fuel to her fire.

I wouldn't mind if I had to get a little more education to do something but I wouldn't have enouph time to do anythung that required more than a certificate. And since I'm already in college, I would prefer not to have to drop out when I'm only a year away from getting my bachelors, just in order to get certified in something different. But its an option if it needs to be. 

Or any suggestions for other stay at home jobs that wouldn't require too much intelligence (I'm a HARD worker.. but im not very smart, which is somewhat limiting) 

Any advice would be helpful. If at all possible it would be better for me to get to take care of her, rather than a stranger. Nurses and PCAs are life savers and I am so thankful that these individuals do what they do, but I've seen the abuse that can take place as well.",28May2020,1

742,"Hi everyone, 

I (19F) am going through a really tough time. I am from an European country and have been studying abroad in a US university for a year now. I'm a freshman and have attended international schools all my life, so I speak English as if it were my first language. I have kind of had a hard time at my university. It's really large and I'm pretty shy, which means that unfortunately I've only been able to become friends with my roommates and another girl from my country, but I've been doing really well academically.

The problem is my mom said she can't afford my university without selling the house. My mom and my dad are divorced, he's paying for 80% of tuition and she's paying for 20%. I also have no scholarships (which I didn't think I'd need because my mom told me she could afford it), so back in January I applied to two Canadian universities, which are MUCH cheaper, as a transfer student. My transcript for one of the two got lost in the mail for so they cancelled my application, so I only have one application remaining. I haven't been accepted or denied yet, it would be a lot cheaper BUT unfortunately because of coronavirus it has changed to online schooling for next semester. The thing is I can't stay at home any longer. I love my parents but my mom feeds my anxiety like no other human being can, she blows everything out of proportion and goes haywire over the smallest things and criticizes me a lot. She also tells me I shouldn't transfer ""just for her"" but she literally told me she would have to SELL OUR HOUSE if I kept attending the uni I'm studying at so obviously I have to transfer. I may go to grad school so I can't really graduate in 3 years. Also for context my dad doesn't live with us but he is also far from perfect for reasons I won't get into now.

I'm just so frustrated! I'm tired of having to rely on my parents for everything. I was thinking of looking into internships abroad for a semester just so I could do something away from my parents and be able to study in peace, even if just online at the new Canadian university. I could just get a retail job somewhere in the UK so I can get a shitty apartment and put some distance between my mom and I and I could just study and live by myself. I'm really trying to separate myself from my parents but they keep clinging onto me like there's no tomorrow, my mom keeps guilt tripping me for ""leaving her"" all alone back in our country and says the virus was a blessing because I was able to return. BTW my family is kind of homophobic and I'm not straight, which is also a reason why I want to live away from them. I was even considering just dropping out, working for a year and then going to university in Scotland next year (which would be fall 2021) which is pretty cheap so I could possibly afford it on my own.

I realize this post absolutely REEKS of privilege and that I'm really lucky to have been given the chances I've been given, but I really just can't handle this situation anymore. Please feel free to give any advice, even if it's something like get your head out of your ass, I just don't know what to do. 

Thanks a lot and sorry if I ranted, hope everything was clear!",28May2020,1

749,"Up until the last hour I've been feeling great today. Better than in a long time. I was sure something had changed. But the mood is sneaking up on me again. 

After work I went to pick up some medication (an antidepressant for this exact issue) I got home tired and ready to relax. I'd been in a great mood since morning. But after an hour of a TV-show, it start again, like clockwork. An eerie feeling sneaks up, something, everything feels wrong, suddenly I find myself less and less able to engross myself in anything, and I feel restless and stuck inside my own head.

Before I started walking/jogging around during the evenings it got much worse, I felt like I was going crazy. I was really close to admitting myself, as crazy as that sounds. Now I just get that existential dread like feeling that builds up until I walk around outside, or take a run.  

I did just move to a new city. I found a job, and within a few weeks we were sent home. I thought I'd love it. I got a new gaming PC with my first paycheck and felt like a kid the night before Christmas. But I just can't engross myself in games or waste the evenings after work with relaxing with a movies and series like I'd been looking forward to.  

I do think it has something to do with the home office and living in a collective, renting just one room with a bed and computer desk. Is this what stir craziness feels like, what cabin fever feels like? 

Mostly I'm hoping that other have, or maybe do feel like this during the quarantine, which would mean that I'm not about to drown in depression and anxiety again, but that things will improve as they return to normal.

750,"Sorry for the long read, it’s complicated. Context: A couple years ago, After several  years of no contact, I reconnected with a high school sweetheart and we eventually progressed into an long distant intimate relationship, though she’s been reluctant due to a couple factors. She Had just split with her ex of 8 years and a good portion of that was long distance , she’s been caregiving for her mother while trying to make a professional transition, etc. So it’s been hard to put a definite label on it for those reasons. We’ve known each other almost 20 years, met in high school, and While I’ve been committed to this relationship  and have expressed it, she’s been in the fence. We love each other and tell each other often and we’re both amazed at how easy it is to be together but she’s rattled by her conflicts and pulls back every so often. I try to give her space as I understand her reasons to an extent, I don’t see why she feels like she has to try and sort through these issues and life chores, for lack of a better term, alone.

I’ve relocated to our home town due to the Pandemic and am looking to reset here. Her ex, having just finished a masters and likely no job is back here as well.

She recently asked for space, and in the past she’s always been the one to violate it. So I told her we’d need a proper amount of space and that she’d have to keep it if she was serious about it. Thus far, she’s reached out to say she missed me and that she’s having a tough time and I shared that I felt the same, and we told each other that we loved each other.

Around 7:30 Today I was out on a long bike ride that put me near her house and I debated contacting her to see if she’d be willing to see each other briefly before she went to work but I talked myself out of it, but was passing The park near her house when I saw her ex walking her dog. Kind of amusing because the dog recognized me but he didn’t. I love that dog. Anyway. Riding by her house I saw that another car was also in the driveway, which meant that she would have had to make room for it, as she normally parks in the middle. So a conscious effort and not just stopping by to see the dog.


I have to confront about this right? She obviously asked for space and while I didn’t intent to catch anybody I just happened to have really shitty timing and see this guy walking the dog. So do I contact her and ask her to explain or do I continue to give her some space and let her come to me? She’s obviously got a lot on her plate and maybe she’s just trying to clear it. 

She told me last week she was seeing him over the weekend and that’s likely why this sort of boundary was drawn but it’s obviously a bit more than that. 

He lived in that house with her and her mom when they were together before he left town and I don’t know, maybe he doesn’t have anywhere else to stay having just finished school, no job, in the middle of a pandemic. 



tl:dr Despite being asked to give space to my lady, I was riding my bike near her house and spotted her ex walking her dog and presumably his car in her driveway. I didn’t go there to catch anyone, or conduct a stakeout by any means, I was near her house and even talked myself out of contacting her before I saw the dude but I can certainly see how she’d feel like I violated her space.


Do I ask her for an explanation or or continue the radio silence until she’s ready?

Okay so CW 1 is creepy. Like perverted older man creep.

He just makes comments that are vulgar with no tact.  Hes said to me "" there you go thinking again"" in a condescending way.( not cool) last night he told me he jerked off (not in so many words but was implied)  that's some of him.

CW 2 isn't creepy.  We banter great! There's already instances where he's said pervy things but like in a joking way. Lately  he's becoming more forward, looking own my shirt( all he has to do is look down) and he seems to be brushing up against my chest slightly more than usual (I say it like that because they are quite large and in the way).

And I hope you weren’t being rude to me by saying the old generation and referring to me. Because I don’t take that very kindly if it was. It came across as directly to me. Hope that wasn’t what you meant. I am extremely confident in what I know to be true and my experiences verify it. I just don’t brag and talk about many things with others . Just because I’m quiet doesn’t mean I’m dumb and don’t know what’s going on. I really get quite tired of talking to people and sharing valuable information on deaf ears.

My mom has always been a extreme spirituality person it’s like a online cult where you follow uneducated influencers. Kind of like back in the day before the internet you’d go to some property in the middle of nowhere and live there and become a part of a cult but today it’s easier because everything is online just a simple YouTube video click lol she’s the typical no fluoride aloud mom it calcifies your Penial gland ( I’m out the house now I’m 22) I had severe problems from this enamel wise and my sister whose 15 is still stuck at home and saw the dentist for the first time in 10 years and has to have several root canals because my mom used to watch influencers and spiritualists say to use baking soda because it’s natural. Also I had a severe ear infection in 7th or 8th grade and she refused to take me to the hospital because they don’t know as much as her and will try to position me. I woke up every few hours with crystals layed out on me and would pass back out in severe pain. I now have hearing loss haha. I decided to share my hearing loss with her and told her it’s possibly genetic or from like a severe infection or something but I can go deaf. She sent me this nasty comment in response to the 5G video that was educational that I sent her. I told her that a lot of older generations are scared of it but it’s because it’s new and they don’t understand yet but no need to be scared. She sent me this talking about aliens and experiences and basically made a comment about her words falling on deaf ears. Hurt me so bad. Pretty sure she’s a narcissist but also not sure if I should just cut her off for this.

756,"This is probably a dumb post or whatever but I figure Frick it, why not ask?

Basically I've only been in one relationship and it lasted 2 years and a month. We were each other's first everything, quite literally. We dated from when I was 16 and he was 17 and I broke up with him less than a month before my 19th birthday. About a year and a half ago I broke up with him because the last 5-7months of our relationship, he didn't appreciate or prioritize me very much anymore. I communicated my worries/issues with him this entire time and tried to offer solutions. He always said he would change and would barely if at all. I tried to break up about 2 months before I broke up with him for real and he convinced me to stay. We are both Christians but we both were stagnant in our faith. We believed the Bible but that was about it. We didn't prioritize it or do much more than pray and try to be decent people. I came to truly know Christ and give my life over to Christ about 3-4 months before the real break up. See it was getting to know Christ and a lot of conviction that finally got me to actually break uo with my ex. My ex just didn't care much for the faith besides what I mentioned earlier and I'm not gonna try to force anyone to pursue God, that's between them and God you know? I encouraged it and stuff but I never pressured him into anything. So after a few months of him not treating me much better and him not trying to pursue Christ any more than he had been, I broke up with him. He asked me back for prob 2-3 months after we broke up and I kept saying no because I couldn't trust him with my heart anymore. He couldn't stop apologizing and crying and it all seemed so real. He was way more emotional than he was when I first tried to break up with him. Kept swearing he would change but I was too scared to hurt anymore. I was tired of it.

About 7-8 months after our break up I reached out to try to be friends, maybe even more if he had changed. I figured that we both had enough time apart to grow and change and maybe he changed for the better. He basically told me our chapter is over and that it wouldn't be a good idea. That was almost like 9 or 10 months ago and the past 2, almost 3 weeks I suddenly can't get him out of my head. I feel like I need to call and ask to talk to him but ...

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't want to be a crazy ex
2. I think there's probably a 70-80% chance that he would say no a
3. I don't want to push him any farther away anymore than he already is.

It's crazy and I'm not sure what to do. I know the answer is probably just give it time. If we are meant to get back together it'll probably have to be randomly by chance sometime later in life or he will have to reach out to me, but I figured I would ask for advice anyways. I'm not saying we would date because I don't know if he has changed at all, let alone for the better, and if he even is willing to see me, but yeah. I think a big part of me just really wants to talk to him and see who he is now and maybe get some closure I never got ((he literally couldn't tell me why he treated me bad it was like he didnt know somehow or something idk how to describe it))

   The main reason I am hesitant about creating it is because I am only 15 years old. As you all know, people my age can be so driven and we just get too carried away. I want to talk about feminism, equality, love, books, talk about stuff I read...  Also, as you may have noticed, I don’t have perfect orthography or grammar, since English isn’t my first language. But I read a lot in English, and I will be careful. I could also write in French, Spanish or Arabic,(I am from Tunisia, I live in Mexico and I’ve always been in French schools. Y’all should listen to me talking with my brother, it’s a mess of languages) as I speak and write way better in those languages, but the truth is that I don’t think I want to. I have always loved English, and I feel like more people would read my articles if they were written in those languages.
 
      I also am really careful with my school work and homework. I get good grades and put a lot of effort into doing so. I don’t want to be distracted from all that. Do you think it would be too much work? I would have joined the school newspaper, but it would be really hard since my school doesn’t actually have a newspaper.😅

    Finally, I kinda suck with computers, and I have no idea how to create a website. I also don’t think I can invest much money into it. 

      I would love to read any piece of advice you could give me ( I would be grateful for any kind of commentary, whether it’s pro or con this idea)  Thank you so much, an have a great day 😉",28May2020,1
767,"I can only imagine this question has been asked a million times on this sub. However, I'm looking for some advice that may be a little more specific to my circumstances and I'm hoping some members of this community may be able to provide insight. 

I'll start out by saying that I'm a 21 year old woman in college, in a North American country. I was born and raised here so I suspect that, despite being born to a parent from a conservative country (the other is American), my issues don't have anything to do with cultural values or customs. 

From the time I was young I have always had my reservations about relationships and intimacy. When I was in high school, my friends were maturing, having their first boyfriends and what not, while I felt profoundly uncomfortable with any form of physical contact from non-family members. Even the thought of holding hands with a guy made me feel weird, and any time I tried to imagine myself in intimate contact with someone, I'd become nauseous and uneasy. For a long time I believed I was asexual, and this went on for quite a while. I only just recently (in November 2019) sought help from a professional sex therapist who really helped me deal with a number of my issues. I have never experienced any form of abuse, so we identified childhood insecurities that persisted into my adult life as the key source of my discomfort. From the time I was little, I have always been ""the smart one"" compared to my sister, whom people perceived as ""the pretty one"". Obviously this sort of dichotomy is harmful to both of us. My sister is now very academically accomplished and I can't say that I'm ugly. In my head I know I'm an attractive woman, but any time I think about relationships I cannot help but abandon every existing shred of self-confidence I have and immediately think, ""why would anyone want to date me?""

After several months of rigorous therapy (which I believed had worked very well), I put myself out there and tried to seek out positive experiences with men. I met someone on Reddit who happened to go to my university and so we quickly formed a friendship. This guy offered to ""give me some experience for when I found someone who loved me"". At the time it sounded like a great idea because I was desperate not to feel like some unlucky spinster at age 20; in retrospect it has only made me feel disgusting for allowing myself to be treated like a charity case. We ""experimented"" a bit, but I never lost my virginity to him. A few weeks later he broke the news to me very casually that he was seeing multiple other women and began describing their bodies to me in great detail (this made me angry since he was being disgustingly unkind in his assessments). He also said that he'd never be in a relationship with me due to my inexperience (ironic since this guy at the time had only slept with one person, and I guess it was okay for him to ""help me"" with my inexperience as a ""friend""). That's when I decided to break things off. Just after that he posted on a confession subreddit that he was still in love with his ex-girlfriend and a host of other things. Since then I have only felt like shit about myself and I don't know how to go on from here. To be sure, I realize that I voluntarily entered this type of arrangement partially out of self-interest; all I'm saying is that it has clouded my perception of relationships because I just can't see myself being treated as anything but disposable and temporary. 

This recent event has only exacerbated my feelings of unworthiness and in some sense, I feel like it's undone a lot of the hard work I achieved in therapy. It's *much*, much easier said than done to dismiss what happened as ""unlucky"" and a ""one-time thing"" - that's what friends and family have been telling me... That all men aren't like this, that I'll find someone who will treat me with the respect I deserve. In my head I know that very well; it's just that in practice, it's barred me from really putting myself out there, purely out of fear. Dating apps make me feel like a trading card as opposed to a person, and I'm an introvert, so meeting people in person is just as difficult. In theory I know that I'm good-looking and highly accomplished, and I'm confident in what I have to offer. It's just that within the context of dating, all of that basically dissolves and I resort to the sad (and very comfortable) feeling of ""poor, poor me"" and act as if nobody will ever love me.

I want to point out that I'm not after sympathy here. I want genuine advice that can help me re-orient myself within the dating world and get over these fears I have. I am considering going back to therapy. Thank you in advance!",28May2020,1
768,i just saw my moms fucking nudes on my computer. and all of her fuckings sexts. and all of the god damn men. when i found out she was cheating on my dad i already felt horrible because every time i sw him i felt like a huge fucking liar for not telling him. and then i found out that this one rat bastard got her fucking pregnant and she aborted it and i read the texts he sent about how she killed his only chance to be a father like he would have been fucking uncle iroh with that poor kid he probably would have fucking killed or punched it before it could breath. I'm so fucking tired of her thinking that the stuff she does doesn't affect me. that all the times she had screaming matches with the guy who got her pregnant didn't have some sort of affect on me. god i remember one time she started up and all i could do was play Minecraft and cuddle my dog. i remember all of the times i was more of a mother to her then she ever was to me. i remember all the times i had to walk her to her fucking bed because she was too drunk i remember all the times i had to hug her because of all the shit men would be dicks to her i remember all the times she wanted a hug from me because she couldn't help me emotionally and felt bad. i remember all of the times she said she was done with dating. god i am done with her. can someone please tell me how to stop caring about all the shit shes done? can some one please tell me how to stop caring about her sensitive ass? some one has to know how to do that right? I'm so tired of being fucked up by *her* decisions. I'm tired of not being able to sleep because all i can think off is all the times she left me home at night to go off and fuck other men when i was five to now. I'm so tired of her telling me to go to sleep at one am. I'm so tired of  having to feel embaresed to  have her as my mom. I'm so tired of feeling like this. I'm so tired of worrying about her. I'm so tired of thinking about all the shit that's happened to her and I'm so tired of wondering about what has happened that i don't know about. I'm tired of wondering if i have a secret half brother or sister who knows about me but i don't know about them. I'm tired of having to take care of her when shes drunk or high or crying or all at once. I'm tired of having to wait until shes super drunk to ask her about whats going on. I'm tired of her thinking I'm not tired of this. why doesn't she realize that this shit affects more then just her??? is it because her mom beat her as a kid? is it because in comparison this isn't that bad? i mean why did she do this to me? why did she hurt me like this? why do i have to care so much? why do i have to hit myself in the head whenever i think of this? god I'm so fucking tired of being her second priority. or her fifth depending on her poisen of choice. some one please tell me how to stop giving a fuck about her.,28May2020,1

771,"Our upstairs neighbor is stressing me and my girlfriend out. The apartment building we live in unfortunately has a very hollow floor, and apparently the roof of our unit is very thin, so the noise that’s generated from us walking around is loud upstairs (allegedly). We have a dog too that we try like hell to control but there is only so much you can do to prevent a dog from wanting to run around a play from time to time. 

Also we NEVER make any (allegedly) loud noises in the morning or after 9pm.

Anyways, if our upstairs neighbor thinks we’re being “loud” she will stomp on the freaking floor like a 5 year old. I’ve had to report her to the rental company several times but nothing seems to ever come of it. I want to go up there and talk to her but with covid and all + the prospect that this person seems incredibly immature I doubt if it’s even worth it.

It’s stressing us out, we’re walking on eggshells constantly in our own home. Our lease is up soon and we’re definitely going to get out of here, but I just wanted to ask advice on what to do.

777,"Tw: suicide, death

One of my guy friends is casually saying he's going to end his own life. I check up on my friends from time to time and when I checked up on him he still sounded like himself. We talked a bit more but when our conversation went to death that's when he got weird. At first I thought he was paranoid about getting the virus but as we talked more I became sure he's planning to kill himself. He began saying phrases like ""when I figure it out"" or ""only a matter of time."" I was really concerned and asked him about it but his replies would be dismissive like ""I'm tired"" or ""there's no point.""

I know there's a lot of things worrying him right now. He lost his job, got stuck in a different city away from his family because of borders closing, his dad died and his mom is currently sick, possibly due to the virus. I feel so helpless and scared for him and what he's planning to do.

I feel like nothing I can say is going to make this situation better, or even going to ease her pain in the most minuscule manner.

I am comfortable crying in front of her, but something about this loss just feels different somehow...

Within the first two months of us dating he was friends with a woman he works with (not closely, just in the same general  area). He told me they were just friends and he never hooked up with her, never seen her naked, nothing. So a few weeks ago I still didn’t believe what he was saying about their friendship, and needed to know if they were still talking. I would normally never go through someone’s phone but it took me months of being fed up of not knowing to finally look at their messages. Turns out they DIDNT have sex but they had a conversation when he was drunk about her giving him sexual favors and he was engaged in the whole conversation. She also sent him nudes a few times and he would respond with “when did you take this?” This was before we were officially together, but bear in mind I slept at his house every night, moved some of my things in, he had already told me he loved me and introduced me to his family. I freaked out about everything I read, and we talked about it for a while, he apologized and seems to really feel bad. I’ll add that he hasn’t talked to her in three months either.

My problem has nothing to do with my boyfriend, but to do with my family. I currently live with my dad, my brother, and my paternal grandmother. My grandmother is hard to live with (self centered, manipulative, acts like a child, forces us to live in filth because she's a hoarder, etc.) My father recently sold some rental properties that my grandfather left to him, so he has been looking to move out as well, and does not plan on my grandmother moving with him.

I want to move as soon as I can because I feel suffocated, and my grandmother and I have not gotten along since I was 13 and I finally realized the kind of person that she is. This means I most likely would be moving before my father does, meaning I'd be leaving him here to deal with her on his own. He doesn't know how to stand up to her when I am not here and I'm afraid she will pressure him in to taking her with him when he breaks the news (he hasn't told her he plans to move). I don't want to leave him and my brother here with her.

The other part of this is, my father's dog loves me and she's going to miss me so much when I move( and I her). I daresay I'm her second favorite person in the house and I don't want to break her heart (or mine for that matter). Plus, my cat would be going with me and the area I'm planning to move to, most apartments only allow one pet, and he hasn't been an ""only child"" for well over 5 years now. I don't want him to suffer and be lonely in an apartment on his own when my boyfriend and I have to work. 

I know this may seem like a stupid thing to be asking advice on, but is there anyway for me to feel less guilty about moving out? Its the natural part of life, and I'm at a point, where it is probably better for me to do so, but I'm worried about if it is better for my family and my pets around me.",28May2020,1

804,"I was 15 at the time and I was with my mom in a rough neighbourhood. I usually tell her to not go there because it is dangerous and people do usually avoid it here. She makes me go to this neighbourhood and then due to social anxiety, I stayed in the car whilst she went in the shop to buy stuff. Whilst she was in the shop, this is weird guy started circling the car I was in and starting singing and pointed directly at me. He had like a bottle in his hand or something. I was extremely terrified and I ran into the store and told my mom about this and she didn’t even care about how traumatic it was for me and I was in tears. Not even an are you ok or something? She just said ignore him but how is that going to make me forget about it? It took her about 3 seconds just to realise it was me that had came into the store. 

You’d think that she would stop taking me to this neighbourhood which I have ptsd from but she keeps making me go there and then gets angry if I say I don’t want to go or makes arguments.

It's abnormal but honestly, tell me who's going to replace my parents and help me heal the wounds they have left behind?

I don't even feel very close to my other friends. I was once closer to some friends but after being targeted by a close ""friend"" who took advantage of my situation, abused me mentally, gaslighted me and made me do things that worsened my relationships with other friends years ago to the point where they developed into different directions and I'm not even that interested in fixing it with them I have nobody. It's like I'm supposed to just go outside, find some people who I have no backstory with and to somehow become close friends with them. Or join ""my kind"", the psychologically ill people, talk to them and deal with their issues...Guess it might be time for a psychologist. Although they're not going to be my mommy either.

808,"I believe there's a singular truth to life and the way to achieve it for everyone is the same in template. I don't claim to know all of it (yet), but I am certain that what is described as ""eudaimonia"" is only attainable through one path. The words bigot and dogmatist are perhaps incorrect, because I *want* to be convinced of others' opinions or perspectives, but only to update my own view where it might be lacking. If there is nothing they can contribute that is better or proves my world view wrong, I feel obliged to change theirs but it's always taken as me trying to domineer them as opposed to me wanting what I've found to be the best way possible. 

It leads me to one of three conclusions, when I'm unable to convince them,

1. I'm professing the wrong thing
2. I'm professing the right thing, but I don't have the ability to profess it correctly
3. I'm professing the right thing with the right ability, but the person doesn't care for eudaimonia

I feel frustrated by each of the above conclusions, because none of them are easy things to admit. I try my hardest to settle with the first two because the third feels like the worst, but even when verifying with utmost scrutiny and unbiased scientific rigor, and following the best ways I can think of to convince someone (never being condescending, making space for their perspectives and working with them to understand with them) I can't admit the third one to myself, and ""give up"" on the person.

I'm also not just talking the talk, but I try my best to walk it too before I recommend anything to anyone.

I'd like advice on what I should do, how I might change myself, how I might change the perspectives of others, and how I might be patient and/or accept when I can't.",28May2020,1
809,"I feel an obligation to be keeping track of developments in the world. However, the world is literally and figuratively on fire. Everything is fucking terrible. Worldwide pandemic, absolute insanity, and some seriously fucked up shit happening everywhere - here in Canada, a recent report on nursing homes showed people were being left in absolutely disgusting conditions in care homes in Ontario. In the US, the country is currently on fire (once again, literally and figuratively) due to racially charged police killings and the political divide is at a breaking point with left and right leaning individuals ready to start another Civil War of opinion. China has literal death camps against Uyghurs, in addition to atrocities being committed to Hong Kong and insane censorship where doctors trying to get the word out about covid were silenced. I could go on forever about each country in the world doing something just as fucked up as the next, people are suffering and dying everywhere.

So basically, how does one attempt to keep track of world events without becoming depressed and jaded? I feel so helpless. Everybody is trying to fight everybody, and I honestly am stunned looking at social media, some of the things people say about the events on there are completely terrifying. Anybody else here feel this way? Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",28May2020,1
810,"So, I have pretty decent life. Very loving and supportive family that would do anything for me. I have a full time job in my field that pays decently well, I live alone in a nice apartment with my dog and plants. I have my own car and pay for 90% of my living expenses in my own (thanks parents for paying car insurance and phone lol!!). I graduated from the university I wanted to go to in a rather difficult but rewarding field. I workout 5 days a week, I have many friends that love me and that I know I can count on. I have traveled a lot and usually do roadtrips often. I compete for fun in obstacle races and kayak once a month at least because I love it. 

I have “struggled” a bit in life. I’ve been in situations that I’d never wish on anyone. I struggle(d?) with an eating disorder for most of my life (I’m doing great now though!). My dating life is less than ideal, which I know has hit me a lot more (basically dating someone for the past 5 years on and off that, while we love and care about each other a lot, I know they’re in love with someone else, but that’s another story). I hate being alone. I’ve struggled with alcoholism and have abused drugs a few times to help me cope in times I feel like this, but I’m tired of it. 

I feel like I just can’t do life anymore. I can’t concentrate at work and it’s showing a lot. I feel like I might get fired soon because it has been pointed out. Since before the pandemic I’ve been struggling but this feeling just completely broke me now. I think working from home broke me, I just started back up from my office last week and I thought it’d get better. Nope. Usually I can pinpoint what makes me feel like this (usually relationship related issues) but right now, it’s the overwhelming feeling that it’s never going to be okay. I wanted to think it was just my relationship issues again because it started hitting me again once I realized my SO might be talking again with this other person, and the feeling of “I’ll be alone soon again” hit me, but after thinking about it for a bit, it’s just a pile of feelings and things I could very easily take care of, but I just can’t bring myself to. I’m literally sobbing in my office at work as I type this. 

I could easily work and just do my job, but I can’t concentrate. I’m to the point where I’m just losing it throughout the day, I just randomly forget what I’m doing because I get lost in my head. Today driving to work I nearly (I literally had to reverse) ran a red light, because I got lost in my head and I just didn’t see it. 

I could leave my relationship and find someone better, but I’m scared to because I really love this person and I’m tired of losing people I truly love. My friends always tell me to leave her, and they offer me their support and company, but I can’t bring myself to reply to their messages within a few days, to the point I’m so ashamed of waiting so long to have the energy to reply to a “hi” that I just don’t. But they know me so they try again. 

I could go to therapy but every time I try I just can’t make it or just get too overwhelmed and can’t go back a second session. I have had a tooth ache for a week, which has never happened in my life, but I can’t bring myself to make a dentist appointment because I’m scared of what it could be. I’ve been having a lot of unexplainable health issues but I avoid the doctor just because I don’t want to find out what it could be. Not even sure why. 

My biggest fear in life has always been death. Thinking about dying makes me panic. I would never take my own life, I cannot do that to my mom and dad. Or anyone that knows me, I just can’t. But damn I don’t know how to cope with this anymore. I don’t want to drink again and I don’t want drugs either. Being alone always drives me to those things, but I’m at a point where I don’t want to do those things either, because I’m just tired of waking up the next day and repeating it again because that’s all I can do to not feel like this. 

I have read of other people having similar feelings to this in this and other subs, but I want to know about those people that got through similar situations, how they did it? 

I’m so exhausted of existing, and I really wish I could appreciate it because I have such a good life that’s just being wasted right now. Any advice/words of wisdom would be helpful.",28May2020,1

812,"I get that the average height for girls in America is 5'4"". Whatever. It's SO frustrating to constantly have pants ride above my ankles because I'm too tall. I get comments all the time, especially from girls about how tall I am. My family makes jokes about how I'm 5'9"" or 5'10"", they love adding inches everytime because they know this is something I hate about myself.

The pants thing just always gets to me. I HATE shopping for pants. Why are pants so short? I dry them once and a pair I used to like is now ruined. Especially pants meant for work, black professional ones. It's really upsetting. I know this is so small and meaningless and really doesn't matter but I don't think I'll ever get over this part of myself.

814,"So I’ve never in my life looked forward to being famous or having big loads of money to flaunt. But I always knew I was “chosen” for something.

(Hopefully I’m making sense here) Lately, I started getting this “thing” and I can see it. It’s the motivation and drive to do that “chosen” thing. I want to give out money. I want to give out cars. I want to give people opportunities and lavish gifts just because. Like David Dobrik and Mr. Beast. I first realized I wanted this since watching “God’s Plan” music video. I never finished watching it because I started balling and crying and then and there it when I realized I wanted to do this. This is what I want to do for ever.

So this “thing” started coming up more and more since quarantine. I’ve been having relationship issues, so I’ve been spending more time alone and reflecting on what I want. A friend of mine told me I could be experiencing a spiritual awakening but I don’t believe in those things. I didn’t do anything for it. I’m not entrepreneurial or money hungry. Having nice things won’t hurt but I also want to make a random person’s day with a stack of $500. I want to overhear a woman not having enough at the grocery store and offer to pay for the entire purchase.

816,"**Background:** Last year I (29F) was hired onto the creative team for a fairly successful company. I was thrilled, because it was the first time I had a ""real"" job in the field that I had spent my life working towards.

From day one, however, the environment felt off to me. I'm the only woman in the entire creative department, and across the company women are generally in more ""traditional"" roles (eg. secretary), as opposed to positions of power.

Though I am relieved to say that I have never been sexually harassed at work, it wasn't long before my Art Director and his boss, the Creative Director, both began making it very apparent that they had a chip on their shoulder. My input is constantly brushed aside, my intelligence insulted, I'm ignored by both of them on a daily basis. And yet my work is scrutinized far more than my male counterparts'... and often in a public-shaming sort of way during group discussions. I have been sat down and given a talking-to several times for small things; even things that my AD has also done and received no such backlash for. On one occasion both of my directors took me aside separately to lecture me about my ""bad attitude"" after I asked why we were continuing to do work for a client who wasn't paying us. At that time I was explicitly told that it was OK for my male co-worker, who had agreed with me, to voice his opinion, but not me, because they didn't like that I was ""losing my cheerful disposition."" Basically, any time my CD perceives that I might possibly be poking a toe out of line, he scolds me like I'm a bratty child. His demeanor changes visibly when I so much as enter a discussion. And as for my AD... I could talk for hours, but he's an incompetent bro who, on more than one occasion, has shot down my ideas and then gone to his higher-ups and presented the ideas as his own. I've voiced my frustration to HR multiple times and been told that I am not the only one who has complained about these two. But nothing ever changes.  


And it's not just them. Most of the company treats the creative team like shit, and we've been told that we are seen as an expense, rather than an asset. This makes it impossible to request the manpower and technology that we need to actually do our jobs. We are, provably, the most understaffed department in the company, yet our requests for even temp hires are shot down over and over again. Meanwhile, our head of sales just hired his own daughter in the midst of a pandemic.... hmm. And for what it's worth, we were all laid off for a month without warning when COVID started up, and they bungled that in such a way that we lost our accrued PTO and now, two months later, I still haven't seen a cent of unemployment benefits.

All of this to say: my job puts me in a shitty mood every. single. day.

I've been thinking about quitting to return to full-time freelance work, and my partner supports that decision 100%. But, the catch is, I feel SO lucky to even have this job. I've tried for years to get a position at more... artistic agencies, but there's always someone more qualified than me. Nearly all of my friends from art college have experienced this same challenge, so it's not likely I'll get an opportunity like this again any time soon. Aside from working for a bunch of assholes, I really do enjoy the work that I do. And as petty as it sounds - it's the first time a lot of people in my life have taken me seriously and not seen me as some flighty millennial. (Y'all, my mom loves me, but I don't think she was ever proud of me until I landed this gig.)  


**TLDR:** My bosses treat me like an unintelligent, misbehaving teenager, possibly because I'm a woman. They're constantly dumping on me and it makes me miserable. But the older I get, the more it feels like this is my only chance to make a living doing what I've dreamed of. On one hand I feel like I'm being a crybaby, but having been in abusive relationships in the past, I'm worried about letting my self-worth get trampled.

  
So do I walk away from my so-called ""dream job"" or do I grin and bear it? At what point is the disrespect and bullying too much? And if it is indeed time to move on, am I an asshole for even considering leaving them high and dry during a pandemic?",28May2020,1

We are also very close and share secrets with each other.

So here we go. 

I was dating a guy on and off for about 2 years, roughly 4 years ago.   
During this time, we were going to be separated for a while because he had to move to be with his family and I was in school. we decided to make it work long distance (eye roll i know) and he gave me his class ring,  I guess in attempts to be cute but I never knew what to do with it.   
but he told me the story of how hard his mom worked for him to be able to get one. 

He ended up being terrible long distance, would ghost me for days, sometimes WEEKS at a time. but I was young and very dumb and always took him back. 

So we officially broke up, he hated me because he said I was the only one for him, and he couldn't believe I wouldn't take him back blah blah   
But he wouldn't talk to for a while, and I held on to the ring. 

He messaged me a few years ago, and I asked him for address because I wanted to send him the ring. he has 2 kids now, and I figured if anyone should have it, it should be one of them when they grow up.   
But he wouldn't take it. 

He told me if I didn't want any part of him anymore then to throw it in a river, because he gave it to me as a gift so he doesn't want it back.... 

Now I'm engaged, getting ready to buy a home with my new husband, and I still have this stupid ring....

I have no clue what to do with it!   
I feel terrible getting rid of it because his mom worked her butt off to get it to him. But I don't want to move into this new house and take a token from an old relationship. 

TL:DR  
Old boyfriend gave me his class ring that his mom worked really hard to gift him... and refuses to take it back.

Looking back on being a poc in this world, I realize that every single time I suffered from another person’s selfish agenda to hurt or take advantage of me, it reconstructed me. Defined me to be this paranoid, untrusting person who doesn’t take easy to strangers. Even the people in my inner circle have said something meant to demean me, make me feel less than or ugly. 

I’ve seen arguments on the internet about every problem in the book when it comes to my color, how I’m supposed to be treated, how to act and how to keep a low profile. I don’t take part in it unless I am being targeted for conversation, and when I try to speak my own mind and voice my opinion it gets shut down. I can count on my fingers how many have stood up for me, and I have lived a life of abuse and unjust treatment not just from people who don’t look like me, but from my own family. 
  
  After seeing everything on the news..how broken and angry my people are after having witnessed several murders and random acts of racism within the past few months of this year. It hurts so much. Deeply. I feel a deep pain that I cannot physically describe, it hurts my soul to see so many people just broken down by this system that was meant to protect everyone. 
  
Well not everyone is protected. Sometimes it is used against folks, taken advantage of by people who know it’s in place for their benefit and used to instead protect those who have done wrong. 

 I’m not an advocate. I don’t want to protest and that is my own right as a human being, one of the few I have been given to exercise. I do not nor have I ever wanted to put myself or my family in danger. I love my life as hard as it can be to live in it, and I know who I am. I am not a strong person, I have no desire to have my name go down in history for something so mentally challenging and draining as fighting racism. It is an uphill struggle and it’s not just what we see, it goes way deeper and more intricate that our eyes will ever be able to see, when my people fight for their lives, for their children, husbands, wives and family, they are just barely scratching the surface. And even as we see what’s happening out there during a global pandemic there will always be someone who just wants to make it worse, or disprove or correct when we bring light to the subject. There are still some who don’t care because it doesn’t happen to them, or they’ve personally never experienced it..or they’re the reason why or they enforce it. Protect it. 
 
It’s like the hunger games, it’s goes much deeper than just the police. The politicians and our president who wants to be re-elected. I’ll say it again with tears in my eyes I am not a strong person. I cannot handle that level of physical and emotional strain, racism begins when you are born different and you suffer through it quietly. You find other people who feel your pain and suffer together and find solace in that, but being there..having it happen to you is a different thing. It chokes me and gives me this awful feeling, I feel helpless. Powerless. Alone and afraid because I know it can end my life. Everyday I see another example of why I can’t always speak my mind, why it’s dangerous for me to not be obedient and just allow it to happen so it can end faster than it started. Do not talk back, always keep your hands where they are clearly seen, stay calm and just do what you are told. Do not run. Do not say anything that will give someone in power the incentive to shoot or kill you. And if you are killed, you will be forgotten when the people have gotten tired of being angry. 
 
I am old enough to know that I don’t have a fight in me, and I just want peace. I know there are always some folks who will look down on me for being a small weak person and I agree with them, they are fighting and are angry and I will never speak out against them because of how they feel. I love all my brothers and sisters even if they hate me for staying inside, I know how they feel and I will not blame them. 

 I will fully support any who find is necessary and right to protest and I stand behind them. But me being a person who does not look for confrontation, who feels more comfortable hiding and not being seen. I don’t want to be known in history books, frontline news or anything. I just want to see some good being done, for something to finally break through the ice and to see these families smile and laugh again safely at neighborhood parks barbecuing, selling to the public to raise money for their big dreams, having a nice run in the sun without the fear of being shot, and lastly a day without thinking about the how their own country hates them.",28May2020,1
827,"So first off, I'm not depressed. Not at all, I'd say I'm relatively mentally stable.
However, I do have phases of being very irritable, then extremely motivated and happy and then just nothing.

I feel like I have a finite amount of emotions and once they are depleated I need to recharge.
If I have a great day, partying or being friends I will feel empty and blank the next few days.
If I felt really sad about something I will go blank after a while.

It's almost like my brain puts a limit on what I can feel. Strong emotions almost never happen for me and if they do they are uncontrollable and I either go hyper active as fuck or lash out at everyone.

This is probably normal, especially for my age (19, not out of puberty yet since I had a late one)

Is there any way I can regulate my emotions to not be like this?
I'd like to not feel nothing. It's not like I care much personally since I don't really feel anything rn, but I have to keep up with work and this is getting hard to do without motivation.

833,"Hi, i'll give some context, first off all.  


I'm a 17 year-old student from Portugal, to be more specific Madeira (small island in the atlantic ocean). I'm in the 12th grade, via a ""professional course"" (i'm not sure if it exists where some of you live, but it's basically a 3-year course where you learn more specific things and are ready to work right after it's over), in  management informatics. I chose this course because I wasn't interested in the 4 main courses, the ""regular"" courses (arts,  socioeconomic, sciences and technologies - even tho this looks close, it's not what I wanted, nor practical -,  languages ​​and humanities). I was interested in learning how to develop software, websites, games, anything, and this option gave me all, in a practical way.

&amp;#x200B;

Troughtout these last 3 years I learned a lot of things (mostly at home, but it opened me to a whole new world) and I'm really glad I went to this course. The problem is that it's simpler and easier, which wasn't bad, I'll be side by side to the ones who went through ""regular"" courses, who had a toughter journey. There's only one downside: anyone who wants to go to university has to pass the exams (one is needed for university, the other isn't but it's a general discipline, for example if you want to have a  degree in computer engineering you'll need Math - the needed one -, and Portuguese - the general one). Due to the all covid situation, only the needed ones will be done. 

Maths are divided in 3 (this will be important after):   
""A"" Math - Heavily math intensive courses, like socioeconomic, sciences and technologies;  
""B"" Math - A easier math, for less math intensive courses, like arts, languages ​​and humanities;  
Courses Math - A even easier math, but comparable to B Math, which all professional courses have - I'm here. 

In my case, I want to continue this course I'm in, and that would be possible with a degree in computer engineering, but I'd need to pass the math exam, which is ""A"" Math. I like math, it was my favourite subject untill the 9th grade and it's now my 2nd favourite (behind programming), but I didn't learn almost anything of ""A"" Math, so I don't know what to expect. I can try to learn in one month in a half what they learned in 3 years, but it's pretty tought, even tho I'm a quick learner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a good student, I was even the best student from the professional courses of the last 2 years, and probably this year I'll be as well. That's good, but puts a lot of pressure on my shoulders. My family is expecting me to do this without a problem, because I'm a good student and I would, if I had learned the matter that comes in this exam.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really think I'm going to learn much more by going to university and I'm only thinking about it for my future, because I'm afraid I can't get a job in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

There's another option, tho. There's some ""degrees"", called ""superior professional courses"", which are basically the actual continuation of my course, and it doesn't need any exam to enter it. It's a two-year-old course but it's not the same as a degree. It's between my level and a degree. The advantage here is that when I'm finished with the course, I can apply for a degree. The downside is that it's two years more than passing the exam.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really confused about all of this, I have too much stress, because it's my family wanting me to get a degree (and I can't tell them that ""I can't do it""), my teachers adviced me the same, in my internship they told me the same, and even me, I want to go on a degree, but what if I can't make it? I'll disappoint all of those mentioned, even me. The other part of me is just like ""why should I struggle so much just to get in there? I can just 'wait' two years and I'll be there, without all of this stress"". I really don't know what to do in this point.

Another point that my family has is that I'm at home for the last 2 months and haven't done anything about it. I understand them and I should've started studying before, and I hate myself that I didn't, but even then, how am I suppose to learn what they learn in 3 years in 3 months?

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do with all my school situation, if any of you have some advice, please, tell me.   
Thanks!",28May2020,1

So I (16M) recently have been feeling very disappointed in my current high school experience. I’m a rising junior and haven’t had my first kiss, any real or genuine relationship (almost had one recently but she cut things off abruptly), never been to a party, and I lack a true tight group of friends, known to most my age as the “boys”. I’m averagely smart, sorta good looking but not anything amazing, and mildly popular, where I know a lot of people and a lot know me, but this variety doesn’t help much, since I’m just an outside friend to lots of different groups. Most of my closest friends belong to different, closer groups that I don’t completely fit into. 

I just feel like I’m missing my entire high school experience right now and I don’t know what to do about it. Any advice at all?

I also saw them kiss and hug each other goodbye. They think we’re being over the top in our house because we don’t want to go and see them but we’re just following the rules! I know saying something will cause a huge argument and I don’t really want to, as it involves lots of family members!

838,"I work at a healthcare company in Seattle, WA but my job is really more of a tech-type job. I develop online trainings and manage the company's learning management system. I have been working from home every day since mid-March. Much of the company is still continuing to work remote where they can. The head of my department is old fashioned and really dislikes people working remotely. In fact, it took a couple of us in the department to coming forward with concern about our safety and threats to go to HR before she would let us work from home in the first place. 

Now the governer's stay at home order is expiring on June 1st and we are all being forced to come back into the office. Because of my position, they said I can come in 2-3 days a week but I still think that's too much. Most of the department will be in 5 days a week, increasing exposure, and my job is done 100% on a computer! The infection numbers in our state have stagnated for weeks and are not decreasing, and with businesses reopening on the 1st i'm sure we'll see a spike in numbers. My partner and I have been fully quarantining and he is high risk. I don't see the point in increasing exposure for us and for others in the office. They're being really short sighted and rushing something that there's absolutely no need to rush.

When I mentioned my disagreement of the decision to my boss in our 1:1 I was met with a flustered response of ""that's the way things have historically been done in our department"" and when I pressed all I got was ""you work in healthcare"". I was essentially stonewalled.

Now I feel like i'm being put in the extremely frustrating and anxiety producing position of having to fight for something i don't even want (i'm super sick of working from home all the time, too!) so that i can protect myself and my family. It's also notable that I have been completing my job at full capacity and kicking ass, and our department head also required everyone to track and submit a time report when WFH started so there's full accountability. Working from home has had it's struggles foe sure, but i have been doing my job and this is not a performace issue.

So how do i proceed with this? Do I just write an email simply stating I will continue to work remotely until I feel safe? Do i do it in-person (zoom)? Do I not say anything and just keep working remote? Do I go to HR? Am i being unreasonable?

No one else in the department has fought back on it yet that i'm aware of. I spoke to a friend in another department and she was really shocked they were making us come back in.",28May2020,1

842,"I (19 M) had dated with this girl from collage it was the first term of my first year at the university, since things moved really fast, I was of the opinion that it was not something serious and we actually barely knew each other.  I had never dated anyone in my life nor have I ever interacted with someone sexually. It was during the semester that things actually started getting serious and I thought that since I had never attached to someone so strongly, that might be the right and the first time to do it. But she turned out to be someone that I would not want to date with. I do not want to judge anyone but no one wants to date with someone who does not give a f about the relationship and the feelings of the other person.   


So there have been breakups and reconciles but during the reconciles I do not remember feeling happy at all. The problem was that she was okay with following someone she kissed and when I told him that I was not feeling okay with this she said to me that she does not wanna block anyone in her Instagram anymore because for her, that would be childish, but she had gladly blocked her ex-boyfriends in the past when I told her. I decided to talk to her about this and we decided that it would be better for both of us to break up for good. She was quite understanding about many things. So I was thinking that I finally got over with it and moved on.  


A week ago, she started to text me thru WP about the homework that we were given. I was ok with this since what would be wrong with this right? The other day she asked me if I was asleep and she said to me that she regretted not caring as much as I did and for the other things. She told me that she then started understanding what it really means to be in a relationship.  


I cannot be in a relationship with her anymore and I do not want to anyone. But the thing is that It really feels hard for me to get over with it and my friends are telling me that she was the first person that I actually did something with which may in fact be the reason. And I have been feeling like I cannot stand a serious relationship anymore and I recently have decided that I will change my university I do not want to see her anymore but I don't actually hate her either. And I sometimes feel like I can never date someone since it for some reason feels like something impossible.

The bad part of this is, while trying to get my music degree and start a career the stress of everything I had on my plate caused a serious relapse, resulting in my fiancée leaving me, a suicide attempt and several addictions, all of which I successfully overcame.

When we did text or call each other for anything, we would always respond within the same day. Now that college is over and we are both back in the same town, I reached out to catch up... and nothing.

She isn't even sending anything back right now - no excuse, no ""I'm alive"", nothing. I've seen her post on her social media.

i just don’t care about it... and i don’t care that i’ve failed which is weird for me. we get our results in a few months but i’ve definitely failed because i barely typed anything.

i don’t know. i just feel like i should take a year out to work and study my course but just on a casual scale so take an online course and that’s the only way i’ll get into it, rather than forcing myself to complete 3 years of uni when i’m not ready or interested.

i’m one of the youngest in the year so i don’t really care about being older than everyone else when i reapply. i want to go to uni but just want time to figure things out...

Hi, I'm 19 and I'm from Iran.

My whole entire existence is filed with the flames of hatred. I hate everyone(specially women). I hate every thing. I have anger issues. I have OCD too.

No day passes without me fantasizing about killing people. I want to hurt people. I always wish that some day I could be so powerful that I can kill millions of people.

You might not believe it but I have hit my mother twice(Because I hated women). I was hospitalized at mental hospital for three weeks.

I'm suffering from this condition. I'm worried I might some day hurt someone.

please excuse me if my english is bad but please give any hints if you have.

Hi. :) I’m not sure if you are intrigued or humored by my tite but we’re both here for something right? Here it goes!! 

So here is a brief backstory. My girlfriend and I are 27yrs old. We meant online when we were 17. (Before TikTok made it cool lol.) I moved across the country from Maryland to Oregon to be with her at 22. The years that came between I visited her as often as I could.. We decided It would be best if I moved to be with her because she just started her career as a police officer and I wanted to get out of my dead end town.  The plan was for me to find a roommate and we would go from there. Long story short my roommate fell through and I moved in with her and her mom. We didn’t get along at first exactly (both being Leos with strong personalities) she spent a lot of criticizing me. I just wanted to be on my best behavior. I was a guest leaving home for the first time. Flash forward to that wearing off in the course of the 5yrs I’ve lived here, Although comfortable I still feel like a guest. Here is where it gets complicated.. My girlfriends mom has HIV- she’s very healthy and you would never be able to tell, not that it matters or I need to explain.  I just want everyone aware of the situation that I’m asking advice on. Part of me moving here was because I didn’t want to take any time away she had with her mom and the other was wanderlust.  Her mom and I get along very well and she truly has been a mom to me. ( mine is a narcissist) We hang out, discuss new/big ideas and she even taught me how to make “the sauce”. (Yes they’re Italian, and yes I’ve considering this part of the issue lol) Her mom is single and still dating.. In the time I’ve lived here she has dated 4 guys and moved 3 of them in. (Her go to type is a guy who needs saved or fixed) When I first moved in they were renting a 3 bedroom I lived there for 4 months before the first guy, he lasted for a month. The next one came shortly after and lasted 3yrs. At this point we agreed to move to a bigger house. (A 5br w/pool we turned the game room into a 2nd master for her) At the time we moved I didn’t have my driver’s license and I really wasn’t in position to challenge our living situation. I was just happy to be with my girlfriend finally and grateful for both of their support. Eventually her and the guy breakup only after I live through 3yrs of his 3 kids coming every weekend and his mom moving in for a year from Ohio. He was a super cool guy but ultimately he grew tired of her trying to change him and we grew tired of the baggage that came with him.  So at this point in my story the owners of the house we are living in wanted to short sell and gave us a month to buy or move.  We bought. Gven the situation we couldn’t find the space we needed in such short notice. Her mom is a realtor and was able to use the commission of the sale on the purchase ( we wouldn’t have been able to afford it otherwise.)Currently we have owned the house for almost a year and been making some small renovations. Everything we paint, change, or throw out is a three part discussion. If I like red and her mom likes blue it immediately puts my girlfriend in position to make a final choice. It’s just so incredibly frustrating and my feelings just keep getting stronger. I know I need to talk to her but I don’t want to give her a bag of weights with no where to put them. I know it’s a lot to ask of her. For awhile her mom was financially dependent on her which is why I never pushed the issue but she’s very healthy and making decent money with a business she started.  This is honestly the first window I’ve had to entertain the idea of it just being us.. I love her and appreciate her so much but I need my own space beyond our bedroom.

867,"I've spent a large portion of my life getting tortured because I was weak. I would generally try to be open and honest with my ""friends"", but of course they used that as an excuse to fuck with me too. Needless to say, I'm not friends with those people anymore. I explained these issues to a psychiatrist and was told,

""You attract these types of people and bring it on yourself. You're the cause of your problems etc.""

I never did anything to anyone, except be an easy target. Now that I've come to this realization, It seems like torturing easy targets is a normal thing to do. I think if I can learn to get enjoyment from making others suffer, as was done to me for so long, I will be closer to normal. I want to clarify I dont mean literally torturing some dude in a cage like Hannibal Lecter. I mean the stuff that isn't illegal. 

Here are are some critiques, solutions and alternatives I've considered.

Things I've been told:

1. ""You're doing everything right, I just dont like the way you look doing it""
2. ""You make it too easy, people cant help themselves.""
3. ""You just look like that kinda guy""

 I have obviously already tried to be a ""good"" (idk what good means anymore). person.

I have considered not being ""weak"" anymore. However, Idk what kind of ""weak"" I need to work on, I've always tried to make the ""right"" choice instead of the easy one and it's gotten me nowhere. I'm convinced ""weak"" is just a way to say ""not normal"". Nothing happens to those who have fun tourtuing others, they dont get karma or anything else. They usually they end up on top from my experience.

I have considered ""rising-above the filth"" perse. Again, it really gets you nowhere and is a romanticized reality.

Is this some kind of secret knowledge that I only found out cause a shrink told me? For example, I noticed normies (Yes, I know I used the word normie. There's something wrong with me.) will say something in public that he/she doesnt believe. In addition, everyone else will KNOW he/she doesnt believe it. And infact, no one in the group believes it AT ALL. Nonetheless, they will all agree. 

Is this what happened to me? Everyone said to be ""Good"" and to do ""The right thing, not the easy thing"". Everyone agreed, but they all knew it wasnt true, and I guess I missed that meeting or something. Before people start saying, ""theres probably something you're not telling us"", no, there really isnt. Please answer or give advice on the assumption everything I've said is true.  

Anyway, a good portion of well adjusted, people I've met have had fun torturing me. Its obvious that behavior is well respected. So, can someone give me the real answer to this question? Or, can someone teach me how to torture others and enjoy it?

TLDR: Got tortured for being weak. Was told I was making myself an easy target and it was my fault. I want to learn how to enjoy torturing others now so I can be normal. No I was not a peice of shit prior to this.",28May2020,1

However, this treatment is not covered by insurance unless you’re getting it only for Major Depressive Disorder. The total cost of the treatment is about $10,000. 

I am currently unemployed because of the pandemic but I’m trying to see if I have enough saved up to scrape by. I’m very concerned for obvious reasons, but I also know that if I continue with my OCD the way it is, I’m going to be dealing with crippling anxiety and pain everyday. 

I called my insurance company to see what options I have but they said it most likely won’t be covered at all. So I tried also looking online to see if there is any funding/grants available for mental health treatment but I’m having a hard time finding options.

874,"Hey Advice people

This has probably been asked before so feel free to link me to a similar question if that's easier. That said; How do I quit Facebook?

I know how to delete my account and all that, but I want to meaningfully transition away from the platform. I think that it is bad for me mentally, emotionally, and physically. I find myself using it to compulsively become enraged with strangers or to share things that are provocative or self-destructive in a variety of ways.

I don't think that the downsides of Facebook are a secret these days. My only problem is this: Facebook is such a huge part of my life that I'm not even really sure how to walk away from it.

Over the years, I have collected a few friends from around the world with whom my friendship is entirely based on Facebook because that's how we met and how we continue to speak. I also use it as my main avenue for party planning, for getting in touch with friends I haven't seen in a while, for providing Covid-19 information to the people that look to me as an information source, for storing my pictures and memories, it's where I've got all my old poetry and stories saved, it's my go-to boredom killer--you name it. Me and Facebook are super intertwined in a way that I admit is a bit unhealthy.

One thing I have going for me is that I just got Zucc'd. I have a 30 day ban from commenting or posting and this has given me the opportunity to enact quitting--something I've been considering for over a year now. Since I can't post anyway, I might as well use this time to create a transition plan before eventually dumping it and burning it.

As a side effect, I'd like all the edgy comments and stuff I've posted over the years to be gone and burned away so that potential employers or other people investigating me won't have access to things I've said without thinking or in emotional states.

A really good thing is that I can still use Messenger even though I can't post or comment. This means that I can coordinate with my Facebook friends and have them be a part of my transition plan. I don't have to lose them if I play it right.

But I find myself at a loss;

Where will I conveniently store my memories that they're both available to me privately and shareable when desired?

How will I still talk to my Facebook-based friends, who mean a lot to me?

What will I do with the extra time? 

How will I know that I haven't missed any important memories, posts, photos, or life events when I finally delete it all?

My thoughts aren't super lined-up and polished yet. I just recently came to the decision that it's finally time to do something about this.

Any help that people can give me would be great. I would really appreciate it. I think that it will help me be a calmer, wiser, less radicalized, and more pleasant person overall if I am successful.

So As the title explains I'm in love with my best friend.  lets call him Friend for my lack of creativity and ease of reading.  So me and friend like to make gay jokes and we do it constantly.  It was basically the only way we would joke around.  Well I have told him multiple times that I like guys before I think hes forgotten and it would feel way to uncomfortable to tell him again after we've been joking like this for months.  I didn't see it as anything but jokes for months but eventually I started to actually wish for the things we were joking about like being in a relationship.  After I realized that I had feelings for him I felt kinda lost but I was thinking at the time that he might also be gay because most people in our friend group thought he was probably gay.  

I spent a while gathering evidence to either side but then he starting falling don a rabbit hole of relationships with girls that he would ultimately screw up by being stupid.  I always tried to help because its in my nature and when he was in a relationship he always seemed happier.  I should mention that he was and still is depressed.  I would help as best as I could trying as hard as I could to not subconsciously mess it up for him out of jealousy.  After all of this happened I slowly started to realize he likely wasn't gay.  It was then that I decided to just help him with his problems as much as I could because it makes me happy to see him happy.

  So now that leads to where I need help.  Its been crushing me during quarantine that there isn't really any chance at all that he would ever like me back.  The previously mentioned problems with depression haven't helped much.  Iv'e asked my other best friend what to do and he said to just tell him Friend has openly said that My help is the only reason he's alive and that without me he'd be dead.

891,"Im 24, I grew up playing video games and am getting a software degree. Despite this job, I still want to proffesionally stream. I see my job as job security if streaming ever goes. I will work my job, and if i make a living streaming id rather do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the funnest times of my life playing video games were leading 2-3 raid groups at a time, totaling like 100 people, and creating huge pvp scenarios or fighting raid bosses. I see streamers playing my favorite games that i used to play with hundreds of followers and its like, I want to be able to do this to have money come at me irl at ingame for just being me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is like, get a real job, and i will always have the opportunity for one, if streaming doesn't work I will always have one cause of comp sci, and i can make good money.

&amp;#x200B;

But streaming with large guilds and having hundreds of fans seems extremely appealing. However my favorite games I dont want to return to, because I was banned once, Mentally Im not sure why I can't get around to streaming even though i want to? Im not planning on relying it as a source of income rather do it for fun, and maybe make a little money and see what it turns into while i go to school and then work, just like everyone else and if a opportunity arises I will gladly take it.

Mentally I have been seperated from the real world by playing so many video games before, but what im realizing is as much as i want to, alot of people are not constantly surronded by freinds. I may have a mental block because I live with my mom, and she does not allow me to keep the right energy.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, you have clothes on your floor. Ill pick them up but she's just used to being my mom Can't really be mean to her for that, but I have to tell her, i know and I am streaming, but she kind of interrupts the energy of my stream, I want to control what content I give to people, and I feel like living at home i lose control of that.

&amp;#x200B;

When looking at a stream it seems a little bit overwhelming, I'll engage people, thank them for any sort of donation to be polite, but like if i get a ton of messages i just wont be able to respond to them all.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to think of how to provide content, how to control the content I provide and when to do it.

I see most popular streamers as having a likeable personality and being good at a game. I am very good at whatever game i invest time into. I don't know if lately I am just missing the simplicity of playing video games nonstop, or craving the constant attention i would get from everyone while streaming. Quarantine has made me think about alot of things.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I wait until I move out of my parents house to do any sort of streaming, so me and soley me can control the content provided. Also Im hesitant to invest in any mmos heavily as I lost an account that id invested years of time into. Going back to that game, Mentally I feel as if i have no proof of the achievements i got on my other account, so i cannot compare myself to sophisticated players, therefor i have less establishing me as the high end player that I am for any game i invest time into.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you suggest bypassing these mental blocks?

Mentally I'll be working on software for a living, but like what am i actually going to want to do? Thats a job thats everywhere and really the biggest thing is job security, but am i locked into one job? Or do i just have stability so i can provide for myself no matter what, Even if i won't like the job i choose for whatever reason atleast ill always be able to make good money until i find something i do like. Personally i like coding software, but it seems very intimidating to me when i am unfamiliar with the company, their code or way of handling it and what they expect.",28May2020,1
892,"I am his 18 year old sister, he doesn't have reddit and needs advice. I don't know what to tell him. This is gonna be worded from him venting to me for 10 minutes. This situation involves my Brother, his wife, his son (my nephew), and his ex-wife. Sorry if this is confusing, I have no idea how to word this. 

Anyways, his ex wife is terribly manipulative and mean. They both share custody of my nephew, and my brother gets him every other week. Let me get this straight, my nephew loves being around his dad, as far as I know. But recently, he has started to lie to his mom, (my brother's ex wife.) He'll twist things my brother says, to make them seem really awful, and say them back to his mom. My brother feels that maybe he is saying it to get sympathy from them, because his ex wife doesn't treat him well. 

Well, all of this has caused my brother's wife to not trust the kid. She has taken all of the money out of my brother's bank account and threatens to leave him with their newborn son, and not come back. 

My brother obviously doesn't want this, so he thought about only getting his son only on weekends, but he cannot afford the extra child support it will bring. 

He has also thought about taking his son to therapy, but he fears if his son tells his mom about it, she will take him to court. His mom will NEVER agree to send her son to therapy, as she gets enjoyment out of having him cause drama.

He has no idea what to do. On one hand, he loses this new family he has created with his wife and newborn son, on the other, he loses his son and cannot afford his newborn. 

Any suggestions or advice will be directed to him. Thanks to anyone who helps, I'm sorry if this was confusing.",28May2020,1

897,"Two grades back this girl joined my class and she was deemed weird by everyone. Everyone (including myself) would talk about her behind her back and sometimes even talk to her with the intention of embarassing her or whatever. I always felt like it was wrong but I still participated in talking about her behind her back, which I feel awful about. Then last year something really clicked when some people in the class were being mean to her in a way that you can't actually say much about it, because they're not actually saying stuff outright if that makes sense. So anyways, I texted her and I straight up told her ""hey I'm thinking the people in class are really bothering you, so if you want you can sit with me and my friends and we'll be your friends and we can actually get to know each other"". She told me that she had made peace with those people doing what they did and that it didn't really bother her anymore, but she sat with me and my friends during lunch the next day so I'm guessing she appreciated the offer. 

She then sort of became a part of our friend group but she really could be annoying but I think that was mostly because she has autism and can't always filter what she says or does. Later in the school year a teacher made her talk about her being bullied by those classmates mentioned earlier and he did in a really weird and really bad way, so she burst out crying and went to the hallway. Me being her best friend in the class, I went after her and she opened up about some pretty serious stuff that happened when she was younger and how she still suffers from that stuff to this day. I was understanding and I just sat with her and let her talk until she felt like she could join the class again.

Then at the end of the school year, things were pretty stressful in terms of assignments being due and dozens of tests coming up. Me and my friend were working together on a presentation and I had finished my slides and told her that she just needed to put her slides in the powerpoint so we could meet the time mark. She then either missinterpreted that or just straight up ignored it and went to sleep at 9PM the evening before we had the presentation and proceeded to use all my slides, leaving me with the introduction before I could have done anything about it. This sort of thing had already happened a couple more times with her in a really short time and now it really frustrated me, so I texted her a long message about how I had been her friend all year and now she just stabbed me in the back like this and that I found her to have been a bad friend those last couple of weeks. She ignored that message pretty much completely so I then decided that if she wasn't willing to be my friend, that I wouldn't be hers either and I just stopped talking to her except for classwork.

I feel like I could've handled this whole situation better and that I maybe was wrong for sending that text message, because maybe she didn't mean for that to happen and she was probably stressed too so maybe I should've just forgiven her. 

Should I apologize for everything that happened or should I just leave it? If you've been on the other side of my story, would you appreciate an apology a year later, or would it only annoy you or something? I've been thinking about apologizing for a while now but I'm not sure if it's the right move. Any advice related to this would really be appreciated!",28May2020,1

899,"For some reason each time i find a hobby or something im interested, my mind automatically decides that i need to now become a full time devoted passionate career seeking individual in that field. let's take for example programming, i started programming as a hobby and 2 days after that i started looking up positions for programming even though my knowledge is close to none and i have no formal education in it. This may sound relatively dumb and non disruptive but it really ruins everything in regards to hobbies in my life. As a matter of fact i quit programming now since i just gave up on the idea considering i'm not a fan of math and never ever see myself doing a CS degree and virtually impossible to get into the field without a degree or being very very good at programming itself. Another hobby i found was soldering, i started soldering a week and than suddenly again, my mind decided, this it it, this is your passion you need to think about this 24.7 this is your only source of joy and you MUST make a career out of this to fulfill your life. i think this might be because when i was younger i always asked my dad what could make me enjoy life apart than playing WoW and he suggested to find a hobby, a passion something that would make me interested in life rather than leveling up in a video game 12 hours a day.

900,"17F here. I know the title sounds a bit ridiculous, but please bear with me.

I am a pretty healthy person and I only like eating at a certain time, and I usually don't snack in between these times. I eat breakfast at around 8 am, lunch at 12:30 pm, and dinner at around 6 pm. However, sometimes, I just don't have an appetite for having lunch or dinner. I feel like either not eating anything at all, or having something small like a salad. I am not trying to starve myself or anything, I eat. But sometimes, I just don't feel like eating that much. This is rare, but it happens.

I tell my parents this, but they force me to eat anyways. They will yell at me if I don't and it just causes arguments, so I eat, but I feel unwell after. I also tell them that dairy actively contributes to my acne, and I would like to stop eating it entirely, but they force me to have it anyways.

904,"I’ve been in love with a girl for the last 5 years. But although she is my best friend she has rejected me 2/3 times in these 5 years. I have even made a song for her but it was apparently not enough.

I met someone in my class 5 years ago. The first thing I ever said about her to my friends was: “wow, she is gorgeous!” We became best friends and I quickly fell in love with her. I’ve made 3 real attempts but she rejected me 2/3 times.

The first attempt was just me telling her about how I feel.
She wanted to give me a chance because she felt the same way. It lasted 2 months...
We stayed best friends though.

The second attempt was an accident. I told her I was over her but one of my (trustworthy) friends told one of her friends that I was still madly in love with her. I thought she was going to reject me so I friendzoned her myself. (Yes, I’m an idiot.) I later found out she wanted to give me a chance...

The third attempt was just before the pandemic: I wrote her a song and preformed it for her. She was crying but I didn’t make a move. (Yes, I’m once again an idiot.) She said to her friends and me that it was really good and I’m quite sure I should have kissed her. I asked her yesterday if I should have and she said yes... it’s too late now, the moment is over.

I can’t get over her because even now during the pandemic we talk every single day. We call or we just text and normally I see her at school every day. I am not happy although you never notice it. It’s not just an innocent crush, it’s the only time I’ve ever been in love and I literally think about her every day for the last 5 years.

907,"So there's going to be a lot of information here, but I promise all of it is relevant to the main problem. I (M17) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend ""Ax"" (Trans-M18) for just under 2 years now. Recently we moved in with his Nana, and things have been weird to say the least. There's some background information that I think needs to be shared before we really get into the main issue.

\- At some point in the semi-recent past, Ax's Nana has had a miscarriage. She was expecting a boy and has always wanted a son. Second attempt at having a child, she had Ax's mother.

\- Ax was planned for, but his parents ended up getting a divorce. A few years later, his mother was with an abusive boyfriend who caused her to loose custody of Ax.

\- Ax ended up with his Nana. During this period of his life, he was degraded and his interests and methods of self expression were generally sh\*t on constantly. He was negatively compared to his friends at every opportunity, and she manipulated him/the people close to him. She swears up and down she has changed.

\-Ax's Nana got custody by lying to his father, who then gave her full legal guardianship and power of attorney. She claims it was to ""protect Ax from his mothers abusive boyfriend"" which we believe is only half of the story.

**Now to the issue(s) we have been dealing with, that honestly have been making things very very awkward.**

Ever since we moved in she has shown very clear favoritism towards me. She just generally treats me better for seemingly no reason at all. She knows Ax is trans, and even so Ax feels inferior. Nana has always wanted a son, and Ax feels like he just isn't good enough for her because she continues to treat me better. She started cooking for me specifically, and bringing me plates of food. At first I appreciated it, but then I realized that Ax was being almost completely ignored during these interactions. I asked her politely to stop bringing me the food and instead let me come get it because as much as I appreciated it, it was causing tension in my relationship and frankly I don't need to be looked after hand and foot. She made me another plate of food and I explained I'd be up to get it shortly. Not even two minutes go by and she had delivered it to me again. I didn't even get a chance to move as I was busy at the moment, but I can spare a few minutes to help a friend out and wait to eat. I got a bit irritated and nudged a little harder, and she hasn't done it since. We thought that was going to be the worst of our problems, but now she has begun to do other things and slowly showing her true colors. She continues to degrade Ax, his interests, and his methods of self expression while seemingly uplifting me in all the same areas. She constantly mis-genders Ax, saying ""My special girl"" which seriously hurts Ax because Nana claims to be supportive of him being trans, but then she acts completely different. She is twisting Ax's words when talking to other people close to him (Conveying sensitive information that is purely speculation on her part, etc.) and she is controlling aspects of our lives that she should be communicating to us about. For example, I am currently away for school stuff (with this whole quarantine, and moving cities things are difficult) and Nana is also currently away from home. She is returning home within the next few days, but has decided on her own accord that I will be here for another month. This was not part of the original deal, but that's not even the part that has us the most unnerved. On multiple occasions she has said to Ax ""Its like your mom and dad had you just for me."" which leads us to believe that Nana lied to get guardianship over Ax for another reason.

Due to her having a miscarriage and the previous quote, we are under the strong impression that she originally manipulated her way into custody/guardianship over Ax to also try to fill whatever emotional gap or hole was left by her miscarriage and we fear she may still be dealing with that in the wrong ways. Now with me in the picture I feel like I am feeding into that. The blatant favoritism honestly makes me sick, because while her blood grandson is right there she is willing to treat me better for whatever reason. We don't know if she has some serious mental issue, or if there is any way that we can get her to just stop with the favoritism and what not. We feel really trapped, as we don't have anywhere else we can go for at least another year and however long it takes for quarantine to be over and its really starting to bother us. We are greatful that she took us in during a hard time, but we have only grown more uncomfortable as time has passed.

I have bad knees so it hurts to do as much as stand up but at the same time I’m getting fat which is I deteriorating my mental health even more. Every night and some points throughout the day I have dark thoughts and sometimes suicidal thoughts but I have no one to talk to as none of my friends are ever there. I recently also got friendzoned by a girl a girl who played me. Idk what to do",28May2020,1
920,"I'm a structural engineer working in NYC. I've been very happy with my job and my company and never really thought about changing things. I work in a small office where I'm very close with the other employees and my boss trusts me a lot. He always comes to me when he's seeking advice on what to do with clients, managers of other offices, other employees, etc. He probably shares too much with me, but I appreciate the transparency.

At the start of the quarantine we became pretty slow. Since a lot of our clients are also in NYC, they couldn't continue to work and the need for our services has wained. I was contacted by a recruiter about two weeks in, when it still wasn't clear how long things would last, but it was clear that this would be a new normal. Usually I say ""thanks for reaching out but I'm happy with my employer and position. I'll let you know if things change."" This time I was a little nervous and thought maybe I should just see what other options there are in case things really hit our business. Well, a couple months later, I have been interviewing with one of our clients who wants to assemble their own in house engineering team, and it looks like the job is mine if I want it.

It would be a bit of a change from my current position, working for a fabricator instead of a third party firm. I think it would be a great opportunity to learn a new perspective of what I'm currently doing. I would also be a more senior member of the engineering department. This is exciting, but also nerve-wracking because I feel like I still have a lot to learn, and with most of the current engineers at the company being younger, I'd have less resources to lean on. At the same time, I'd have more responsibilities and the room to grow into a manager of the group.

While all of this is going on, I decided to also take the GMAT. Business School has always been in the back of my mind. I like operations and data science and analytics and think I could really advance with some management skills and knowledge. I told myself I wouldn't really think too hard about programs until I got my GMAT results, which I did Monday. I did well enough to probably get into most programs, pending some good essays and recommendations of course, which would require me to tell my manager I'm considering leaving.

Now I'm trying to consider everything and figure out if I'm just bored with the situation, or with the projects I'm working on now, or my career in general. I'm thinking of continuing to take a few online edx or Coursera classes in business analytics and data science to gauge my level of interest. I'm thinking of attempting some of the application essays, especially the ones asking what I see myself doing after graduating or why I want to attend this program to see if there's really that interest there, or if it's just a curiosity.

I guess what I'm asking for is recommendations to help figure out what I should do next.

Tldr: I'm looking to figure out my next career steps - stay at a job that, up until quarantine, I was perfectly happy at; jump to a new job in the same industry but at a different type of company that would help me round out my knowledge and experience; or am I actually bored with my career and pursue an MBA to pivot to the business analytics and data science field?",28May2020,1
921,"I haven't had much of an appetite for the past 2 weeks, and maybe eat one ""full meal"" every day, I've been having nightmares, and I cant stop thinking about the safety and well being of my family. The past 2-3 weeks have brought my mental health down to the lowest its ever been in my life.

Here's a little backstory:

My little sister (12 yrs old) attempted suicide by overdose last fall. I was absolutely devastated, and so so torn because I was stuck in the final stage of MOS school for a military branch. I got back home 2 weeks after the attempt occurred, and she wasn't released from the hospital until 2 weeks after that. 

About 2 1/2 weeks ago, she ran away from home. My parents were in hysterics and my little brother stayed in his room having a panic attack. We didn't hear from her until 4 hours after she left home, and the TL;DR of what she said was ""F\*\*\* you, I hate you all, stop calling me. I'm going to block you."" I had luckily added one of her friends on snapchat a while ago, so I figured out that they were together. I found this out after we filed 3 separate missing persons reports. I tracked them via snapmaps and we got her home safely, although she was extremely reluctant.

A few days after that, she stole vape juice and a knife from me, said she was going to kill herself, then was admitted to the psychiatric hospital again. Current eta is 3 months until release. My parents found 3-4 disposable e-cigs in her room after that and some mystery pills.

That same night, my dad collapsed due to a heart condition that he didn't know he had. His anxiety and heart rate was so high from the situation with my sister that he just collapsed in the middle of the living room. I carried him out to his car and drove him to the ER. He couldn't walk under his own power, could barely hold a cup steady, and couldn't say anything besides ""I'm okay"" in the faintest voice. Once I checked him in at the ER, I waited in that parking lot for 5 hours since visitors aren't allowed. He finally called me at the end of the 5 hours to update me. He has a condition that causes his blood pressure to plummet if he gets incredibly stressed, he is recovered now though from his incident and wearing a heart monitor.

Since all of this happened I have barely been able to get out of my thoughts. I've been stuck seeing the same things, like my sister self harming or attempting suicide. My dad collapsing and being unresponsive. My sister running away. I've also felt so depressed, I barely have any energy or drive. I've gone from eating 2500 calories a day to eating maybe 1000, and I can barely force feed myself without gagging. 

I'm also so worried about the impact this is having on my new girlfriend, as well as my mom and brother. Home is so different, it just feels ""heavy"" being home. And with my girlfriend, we started dating literally a couple of days before my sister ran away, so I went from really happy and outgoing to having a hard time finding the motivation to send a message.

I'm just struggling. If anyone has any advice or resources they can point me to, I would really appreciate it because I need it.

TL;DR Multiple family crises (taking my unresponsive dad to hospital, sister ran away and threatened suicide, now in hospital) have made my overall health plummet. I worry about my entire families health and safety, as well as losing my relationship.",28May2020,1

924,"My cousin is disabled. He is mentally sound, but he is physically handicapped. He’s paralyzed from the waist down. For years my aunt has always shoved the two of us together. He is 17 and I’m in my 20’s. Even when I was a teen he would always “eyeball” me. Like a leering stare at my chest, my legs, and my feet. (Apparently he’s got a foot fetish...) He doesn’t even try to make eye contact. I’ve even gotten to the point that I cover everything up at family meetings. I know he can’t do much. But it’s inappropriate. One time he started talking about wanting to touch my breasts. I left the room and didn’t come back. My family usually leaves him in another room or wheels him over to sit with me. Or makes me go keep him company. It’s always been like this. He has groped me several times while I’ve been told to give him hugs for greetings/goodbyes etc. I told several members of my family about this multiple times. But they continue doing the same thing. Moving him over to me. Or making me sit next to him. I don’t even feel comfortable talking to him. They always defend him. Saying “he’s disabled” which is entirely dismissive and they don’t say anything. They don’t even try to prevent any such going ons. I don’t know what to do.

926,I recently had an acid trip (which I have done several times before) and experienced ego death. The only way I can really describe it is I was shown that we are all tiny specks floating through time and constantly having our energy recycled into new life and that nothing matters and everything we do is to help us ignore the fact that we are truly powerless and have absolutely zero control. The thought of it is just gut wrenching and terrifying to me and I don't know how to deal with it. I think about it every night and can't seem to get it out of my head. The thought of surrendering myself to sleep without knowing that I will wake up in the morning is driving me crazy. Life is just so beautiful and precious and short and it scares the shit out of me that one day I'll never get to experience it again the way I am now.

938,"People have told me not to say this (and they're right), but I ""lost"" a lot of years to undiagnosed depression. In my teens, it was easy to dismiss as hormones but as it dragged into my late 20s, there was clearly something wrong. I went to the world's worst therapist who told me that I was just bored. I tried different things, different jobs, different routines. I packed up my life and moved from the East Coast to the West Coast to see if that would help. When I finally ran out of money and starting feeling suicidal, I got help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, just recently, I'm on the right medication and I feel great! But I'm now at this point where I feel like myself for the first time in 20 years, and it's hard to know who I actually am. I burned through my post-college years in jobs that required the minimum, cause it's all I could manage. I spent most waking hours in bed, mustering the energy maybe once a week for a social event. I didn't grow. I didn't challenge myself. I didn't learn to 'adult'. I didn't date. I didn't do much independently. I fell into huge amounts of debt.

And I know that there's no timeline, and that everyone becomes who they're meant to be at their own pace, but it's hard to think about turning 30 soon and how far behind I feel. I'm still in my new-ish city on the West Coast, absolutely loving it - that wasn't a mistake. But I'm now on the job hunt because my last position went away because of COVID, I'm on the apartment hunt because my current place is about to become unavailable, I want to make new friends here, I want to put myself out there do date for the first time in almost 10 years, I want to develop new hobbies, I want to figure out what I should be doing with my life....and it's so overwhelming. I thought quarantine would help - all this free time to figure it out - but it's not helping. Most of the time, we can shape our decisions based on past experiences, but I feel robbed of that - did I actually dislike that, or was it the depression? Was I actually bad at that, or was it the depression?

I don’t get it. I’ve dated other girls and never felt this way. I feel like my heart is being ripped from my chest when I think about her. I just want to get over it. Things ended in November and I feel like it would be best to just get over it. I haven’t tried to pursue her again, I don’t want to be creepy, since she ended it, and I want to respect her wishes.

940,"So I'm from a very dangerous city and man, if I want to live in a very nice and safe european country I need to change.

I'm a very petite girl and I'm used to do anything to survive, so when someone or something makes me feel unsafe it's like a switch and I start acting like a thug, to scare whoever made me feel unsafe in self defense obviously.

I adopt that typical body language, and I start insulting, I'm not even afraid or embarrased of engaging in verbal fights anymore, every time a creep follows me or touches my ass. It's like Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde dude. I even stabbed a creep under his ribs with my elbow for touching my ass.

And... This is not normal, it is here but not in Europe. I need to change. I'm going to live in a beautiful safe place and I need to get rid of these defense mechanisms, I need to stop being so tense and so aware and paranoid of my surroundings.

Here things like someone walking behind of you for too long (if you turn around and look at them, they usually change their pace or look away to make you understand they're not following you), someone changing clothes in the middle of the street or a car driving next to you at a very slow pace are red flags.

949,"After I graduated with my masters degree, it took me almost a year to be hired for an entry level job in that field. I was way overqualified but looking forward to seeing what the job could turn into. Four years went by and I was promoted a couple of times and was finally doing something close to my “dream” work. 

But - my bosses made my life hell. More responsibility came with more abuse. I was underpaid, overworked, and started to hate the work I once loved. They would all use these terrible manipulation tactics to make the staff work more than they needed to. It was a toxic environment to say the least. I knew I needed to separate myself for my own well being. So I left. 

This was two years ago. I started freelancing (related to my degree) and started dabbling in the food industry, my second passion. I saw a new bakery near me was hiring and I already admired the owners from meeting them a few times, so I went for it. They’re my age and seemed like people I could be great friends with. 

Fast forward to this year and I’m the manager! I absolutely love my job, and I love my staff. Except I’ve come to not love the owners as much as I used to. 

They have too many ideas with no clear path on how to make them come to life. And they do not plan a thing. 

One of them, Christine, is never present, EVER, but is constantly picking on me about extremely minor details and micromanaging me from home, and the other one, Kevin, I can never have a meaningful conversation with because he’s always all over the place. Anytime I ask to have a meeting with him I get no response, or if I do, there’s no follow-through. He functions by the minute. Oh and did I mention Christine and Kevin are married? Once, I mentioned to Kevin that I didn’t agree with the way Christine was approaching an issue we were having with our staff. And he said to me, “Listen, between you and me, I agree with you, but I have to agree with Christine because she’s my wife.” Commence disgustingly dramatic eye roll. 

When Kevin promoted me to manager 8 months ago, he said, “I know your (new) salary is low, but once you prove you’re capable, we will revisit it. I’ll reevaluate in 3 months.” I thought this was a shitty approach but since I didn’t have any food service experience, I just took it for what it was. I’ve tried to nudge a conversation about my pay a couple times since then but nothing formal. I’m not even making $30k/year. I know I don’t have prior experience, but I know that’s low. 

I am constantly picking up the owners’ slack. I am constantly looking for ways to make this business run smoothly. I’ve put so many systems in place since I’ve been here. I am so, so incredibly burnt out and while I do truly love my job and there’s no doubt I’ve made countless positive differences at this place, I don’t think I can do it for these owners anymore. I feel like my time here is up. I feel like all my hard work isn’t paying off and I’m being taken advantage of. They have no idea what they’re doing and working for people like that is really taking a toll. I don’t even know how to talk to them about it without having a blame-fest of a conversation. 

If I leave, I don’t know what to do or where to go. My rent is high as it is and I would love to move but I’m locked into my lease for another year. And I don’t know what kinds of jobs I’d even want to look for - I’m at such a loss and I’ve never felt this way. I don’t even know what I want. And if I stay, I could hope that things get better but I can’t see that happening.

953,"Ok, long story, my friend is always accusing me of ""lying"" when I forget to include details. I know it sounds bad but let me explain. I was helping my mom move some furniture in the house the other day and I was 10 minutes late to call my friend at the time we decided to call. I'm not normally late so I didn't think it was a big deal. I got on the call and told my friend that I was sorry for being late and that I was helping my mom move furniture. I guess she was confused asked me why I was helping my mom and I said that the furniture we ordered finally came in the mail. She then got passive-aggressive and asked me why I was lying about it. I told her that I wasn't lying and that I was helping my mom mover furniture. She got mad at me and said that I should've told her that the shipment came instead of lying.   


This happened many more times where she accused me of lying when I forgot to include details that didn't matter. Another thing I forgot to add was that my friend has previously told me that I talk too much so I've been trying to shorten my stories until a month ago. It just seems like she's never happy so I've been just saying ""I'll be right back"" or ""I Have to go"" without any explanation. She keeps pushing for an explanation so I just say I have to go and hung up. Admittedly, I should've done this from the beginning.  


Yesterday I made a discord account and I gave the password to my friend (there was nothing personal on the account because it was newly made) and I was fine with him doing whatever he pleased on the account. I made it as an alt account for both of us so we could both use it kind of like a throwaway account. We don't use it for anything bad it's just so we can see what our profile looks like to other people (for people who don't understand you can connect other accounts onto your discord account do people can see what game your playing and how long you were playing for)  We decided to add it to a gc because it was more convenient. I told the ""mods"" of the gc that it was an alt account and multiple people shared it. I guess my friend didn't see my message and she called me to ask who it was.   


At this point, I've been asking myself if I even wanted to friends with this girl for a while and I knew she didn't like the person who I made the account with so I just said it was my alt account knowing that she was going to get mad at me for making an account with this friend. She said that I shouldn't lie and I just said what are you talking about. I was lying but I really didn't want to deal with her yelling and throwing a tantrum because I made an account with a person she didn't like. She then said that she knew that I made an account with the guy. Turns out that she traced the IP Address and found out that the guy was using the account. No one that we knew really lived in that area so it was easy to tell that it was him. She then said that she hoped that I took this as a lesson to never lie to her again.   


tl;dr Friend always accusing me of lying, made an alt account with someone my friend didn't like, wasn't comfortable with telling my friend when she asked because she would get mad, told her that it was my alt account and she traced the IP address to my other friend's house and told me that she hoped that this was a lesson to never lie to her again

  
I know I was wrong to lie but I think she just took it too far.  She accuses me of lying if my explanations are too short and get mad at me if explanations are too long.",28May2020,1
954,"Hey, I just have a quick question about motivation/getting things done, so if you know anything that can help me, please keep reading.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am in grade 11 and I'm finishing up the school year. I am also really behind on most of my schoolwork, it is enough that I can definitely get it done by when it is due, (Wednesday next week), but I am having trouble finding the motivation to do so. One thing I thought of doing was not allowing myself screen time or something until I finish, but I don't think that would be positive for my mental health because I'm kind of ""punishing"" it rather than giving it positive feedback. So please let me know if you know any positive ways to reduce stress, or gain motivation. Thanks!",28May2020,1
955,"I had a falling out with an individual nearly 10 years ago in college. We were more party friends than close personal relationship friends. Nonetheless one day she got on me about how much money I should donate to my Alma mater (we were still students) and my drowning in student debt thought it was none of her non student debt self’s business. Not a big blow out but ended the relationship. 

I moved back to my home state, got married, and bought a house. Then she moved across the country to my home state and eventually the city I live in. I recently saw on social that she now lives literally a block from me. It’s a mixed use area and we’re next to a popular street with breweries and restaurants. I will inevitably run into her as she’s constantly posting at the park I walk my dogs in etc. I don’t post my home on social so I don’t know if she knows that I live here. Would you say anything in response to her on social, or pretend that you have no idea she’s across the street and wait until you awkwardly run into each other? Any other options? Coincidentally, my ex followed me to my home state, moved to my city, and now lives right down the street from me with his now wife. I see him more than I’d like, though at this point I have no hard feelings towards either of them. I feel like it may be easier running into them if I just announce that I have lived here and continue to live here than the awkward passing. Not trying to be friends by any means, but happy to be cordial.",28May2020,1

I know it is on google and all, but i kinda do think it is unfair.

I wrote the newspaper and her on twitter, where she blocked me instantly. Apperantly she does all of this very often: she goes on reddit, takes a hot post and pretents she did this all by herself by ""research"".

I saw her lurking on my insta and facebook (they are linked) after she blocked me and i kinda find this creepy.

I am not someone famous, nor do i weird stuff, but i really wanna make her understand, that it is really wrong what she is doing.

958,"I live together with my boyfriend and another couple in a shared apartment. Our relationship with them is superficial and rather tense, because we are all very different in our lifestyles and opinions. We have two separate bathrooms.
My boyfriend once allowed our roommate to use our bathroom, because the other one was occupied. Since then, he‘s been using our bathroom daily - even if he‘s in their room which is all the way in the back next to the other bathroom. 
Now, I know this is a petty thing to complain about, but three people using one bathroom, especially in the morning, just gets stressful after a while. 
Before you start commenting on how we should just „communicate“ with them... no, see, my boyfriend and I are VERY socially awkward people. We do not want to have this conversation with him. Is there any good and subtle way on how we can make him want to stop using our bathroom? We thought about just not cleaning the toilet anymore, but we honestly don’t want to suffer through this lol.

959,"Last night I secretly gave a letter to my parents about me opening up about my mental health as I broke down for what feels like the 100th time this week. I'm still a mess so I'm taking the day off today from school.

The only problem is that I had 3 tests due today. I've been prepared for them for awhile now but because of my breakdown I couldn't attend them today.

My dads been bombarding me with calls even though I told him I want to be alone. He thinks I'm making up my mental health issues just cause of those stupid tests (they're simple and I know I could do them well).

I've tried to reach out to my parents multiple times trying to get them to discuss my mental health with me, and each time they bombard me with their logic and excuses, saying its 'all in my head's

I don't know what to do. If he calls again I'm probably just gonna cry as he tells me I'm making it all up. What do I do.",28May2020,1
960,"First Reddit post ever. Also on mobile so I'll do my best to make it legible. 

My ex threw me out on Monday before I was ready and I'm really worried about his 6-year-old (K) and dog. 

My relationship with him had become emotionally and verbally abusive, and he grabbed my arm during an argument we were having. 

He has called me a b*tch, an addict (for trying to take my cannabis and cigarettes with me when he was kicking me out), lazy, toxic, etc. I fought him back hard and he blames me for all the drama, and I admit I had a problem from the beginning with how he was taking care of K and dog. 

He had already tried to kick me out twice, both times refusing to let me gather any of my things. He said he'd call the police on me if I didn't leave right away and could come for my stuff when he said so. He also told me I wouldn't be allowed to say goodbye to K. 

I had been quietly trying to pack up my stuff and make sure I was able to talk with K before I left to tell her I wasn't leaving because of her. I've been doing almost all of her childcare since the beginning of the school year and we're really close now. He broke up with me before I could do that. 
He yelled at one or both of us every day. On multiple occasions until I fought him down on this, he would yell until she/I cried and then yell at us for crying. 

He bellows at her for normal kid stuff like spilling a drink or sassing back. He expects her to obey him immediately without argument. When she doesn't he blows up at her immediately, and ultimately drags her to her room, either by the arm or by lifting her, and when he does this she yells that he's hurting her and he says ""No I'm not"". When she tries to clean up what she was doing be forces her into her room but later he'll yell at her for leaving a mess on the floor.

He'll say things to her when he's mad like she's annoying or always in the way. He's called her a brat. He also spanks, which I disagree with but isn't illegal here, and is not in control of his emotions when he does it.

He calls himself and ""old school"" parent, but he's 26. I'm 10 years older than him (accidental cougar lol) and have a much different idea of what parenting looks like.
Once when she was punished and in her room already he walked to the back of the house by her room door and yelled across the house to me that we couldn't do something we had planned that day (I forget what) because K was acting like a baby. She started crying harder. 

He also slaps his dog in the face and about the head with his full strength when he's mad at her and keeps her in her kennel for hours at a time when he's annoyed at her. To look at her she seems happy and healthy because she's big enough to take the hits without permanent damage, but she isn't getting a good life with him. Yes, he also yells at her, and I've seen him hit his mom's dog too. 

When I've called him on this behaviour he either denies saying hurtful things at all and attacks my memory, or says that he didn't really hurt anyone and daughter/dog are fine and I am being dramatic and defensive. 

That said, the girl's mom isn't a better choice. She has been involved with MCFD (Canadian cpd) for years after nearly killing her first child. She alleged that her youngest daughter's dad m*** both girls, although the investigation didn't find anything. 

Shortly after I met her for the first time, she gave custody of her kids up for a mental health emergency and sent her youngest daughter to live the alleged molester's mother, the child's grandmother (that's why it matters even though they didn't find anything). 

When she decided the emergency was over and regained visitation, she immediately started taking her children around friends of hers who have been barred from seeing her kids by mcfd, and other friends who are barred from seeing kids in general. She has coached her child to hide information from me and my ex about what they did that day. 

She had gotten her kids to call all of her partners Daddy regardless of their fathers' involvement after a couple of months of dating and the girls have lost a lot of daddies as a result. Under her custody, K didn't see a dentist for the first time until this year when I took her and she had to have a difficult extraction because one of her baby teeth was so rotten.

The latest is that she was at gunpoint in a police hold up for driving an escaped felon around with her 3 year old in the car. Bafflingly, MCFD continues to maintain they have no safety concerns with her, but I literally cannot trust her judgement. 

Last piece of information their whole family that concerns me is that one day, I grabbed a plastic mixing spoon from the drawer and unprompted, K looked up at me and said ""Oh! Mommy hit me with one of those!"" Not seriously, just lightly like you'd see a restaurant and go ""Oh! I forgot that was there!"" 

When I brought it up with her dad he shrugged and said he got hit by spoons as a kid, and when I brought it up with his mom when we were trying to make a list of concerns about his ex, she said the same thing. 

MCFD has completely shit the bed with K's mom and I'm terrified that if I tell them all this they'll either just send her back with her mom or consign her to foster roulette and never check up on her again. 

About the dog I'm worried they'll just show up and see a non-starving, non-injured dog and just leave.

I'm scared I'll make myself the target of two unstable families. I'm scared I'm overreacting and making decisions based on hurt and anger. I've been told I'm not allowed to see her again, and dogs can't talk, so I'll never know the outcome either. 

I asked his mom today now K is doing and he messaged me instead saying she's fine, has said she likes it with just her and dad, hasn't gotten yelled at in 3 days and to stop bothering him and his family. I haven't contacted them since the night we broke up to make sure his mom knew when her next dentist appointment was, and him the same night to tell him to try and find the rest of my stuff. His ex contacted me once.

Is there such a thing as ""old school"" parenting that looks like this and is generally accepted and I just disagree about it being abusive? Should I contact MCFD? SPCA? Is it worth it? Would I just be fucking over K and dog even worse? A lot of what I would tell other people to do sounds hollow right now because this situation is so close and so far away at the same time.",28May2020,1

964,"Long story short,
I'm looking for a place I can use to keep track of my thoughts and attempts at self improvement.

Long story long, here's my thoughts process:

There are three main reasons for this,

First is motivation.
I keep trying to get motivated to improve myself but I always end up postponing it, looking for perfect timing. I'm hoping making my attempts more public will keep me from making as many excuses.

Second reason is putting my thoughts on writing.
I find writing out my thoughts allows me to structure them better and allows me to find errors in them myself. Especially when I'm writing them on the form of an explanation, like I'm doing now.

And third is confirmation.
I usually doubt myself all the time, so if people end up reading what I'm writing and can't convince me I'm doing something wrong, it will give me a sense of security and confidence. If they can point out where I'm wrong to me, on the other hand, that'd be helpful too.",28May2020,1

This is my first time posting on reddit but genuinely wanted advice and to know if I'm overreacting 
8 years ago me and my family moved to our home country and reunited with our family. I see my cousins from my dad's side every weekend with my brother but he traveled and now I see them once a month. He had a better relation with both the male and female cousin where as I was just the sister he brought along
Now recently the female cousins have been going out, without telling me or inviting me and it bothers me. I understand that they do not have to invite me. But there lack of invitation causes doubt within me. Whether I'm boring or annoying or possible not worthy.  Ofcourse I understand that they don't have to tell me it's just that the male cousins exerted effort to include my brother and confided in him with secrets and such yet the female cousins don't do that with me.
I should note that the male cousins are only 3 where as the female cousins are 15 and they're tight knit bunch.

971,"There is this boy, I have been in love with him for almost three years now… he knows that. He is so kind and so caring and I love him so much to the point where I would write poems and songs about him regularly. We are close; we share our problems and help each other out. We talk very often. I am a very hard person to read because I am very indirect when it comes to my emotions. But, he understands what I really want to say and I can read him like a book. We can read each others’ minds through text especially. He has a girlfriend now and he ‘loves her to bits’ and it really shows that he does. =( So, I had to stop expressing my emotions to him because it would be unfair and suspicious for his girlfriend and I do not want to break their relationship because he seems happy and I want him to be happy. We still talk but I hardly get responses from him maybe because he is busy. It breaks my heart to think of him now. I have distracted myself but almost everything reminds me of him. I have played the piano or guitar but those remind me of him. I wrote in my diary but that reminds me of him. I have tried following the advice I give to others but those are not working. Whenever I fall asleep, I dream of him. I think of him a lot. The only thing I can do is let go but I do not want to do that and he sees me as a best/close friend and he does not want me to leave him because I mean a lot to him. But, I also feel like I annoy him when I text him. When I stopped talking to him the way I normally would, he sounded like he was crying and I felt so bad because I love him. I could remain as friends/close friends with him but it would hurt. When I text him, I forget how hurt I am so that is good but then I remember and it sucks really. I have taken breaks but those do not work. It hurts so much but I will forever love him… He only found out a month ago.

Basically I am dissatisfied with a new apartment I just moved into. I did not submit the lease agreement to my landlord (They do not have any signed documents from me, or a signed document with them signature either), but I did pay the full rent of my short term lease ahead of moving in.

There was a lot of undisclosed damages, like water damage on some of the ceilings, air conditioning being weak/not sufficient for hot days, mold in the toilet, broken doorknobs, several lights out, etc.

I am considering two things,

1: Take my money and stuff and just leave since we don't have any signed agreements

2: Based on advice from another property manager, I should tell my landlord I retracted my payment and will withhold rent until the issues are fixed

977,"TL;DR - I'm supposed to start my job on June 1. I called HR and she said she'd get back to me the next day but still hasn't. What should I do? (look for new offers in case this flops etc)

I accepted a job offer for general contracting construction firm (NYC) back in February with a tentative start date of June 1. Construction projects had been stopped due to COVID-19 but are slowly starting back up again. NYC still isn't completely reopen yet but on its way.

I emailed the HR lady in the middle of May since today is the last day of NYC being on ""PAUSE"" and never got a response. I called her on Tuesday and she said she was meeting with the execs to figure out timing and she would get back to me the next day. It's almost 5pm Thursday and I still haven't heard back yet. She said they were only trying to figure out timing which is understandable and that the need for the new hires is definitely still there.

My friend suggested that I should start looking for new offers and use the salary that this company offered as leverage but a lot of GC firms aren't hiring for COVID reasons and I feel like I got a pretty good salary offer for my first full time job, fresh out of college.

I'm thinking of calling her again tomorrow to ask if there are any updates. I know the chance of a later start date is pretty high and I feel like I'm being annoying by constantly asking but I feel like I deserve to get a definitive answer. Is there anything \[else\] I should do?",28May2020,1
978,"I'm sure the last 3 months of quarantine are having an effect, but I feel like I have none of the problems I see lots of people facing. I have a safe place to live, my landlord is kind, I am a programmer happy to work from home, I'm in no danger of being fired, I have plenty of food and friends and am able to pursue all my hobbies, and on top of all that, I have a loving girlfriend who I love very much. If there is an underlying stressor, I haven't found it yet.

Yet despite all of that, I am struggling with anger more and more as I get older. If something triggers me, I will carry a ball of rage in my chest for hours afterward. I am becoming desperate to find a way to let it go. My goal has always been to be a chill person. Kindness comes naturally to me, and I am happiest when I'm relaxing with friends or a personal hobby. I have talked to my closest friends and loved ones about this, and they all basically tell me ""you're a very mellow, pleasant guy....except for when you're not"". I care very much about being careful, considerate, and generous, and it REALLY bugs me when other people are not. My father is the same way, and my sister and I used to joke about how the veins on his head would stand out when he got really mad. I was never abused as a child, and my family is loving.

I see people blatantly violate safety precautions by not wearing any facial covering in stores. I see people carelessly open their car door and dent the car next to them without showing any signs of caring. I see entitled customers complaining loudly to exhausted store workers about things they are not even responsible for. I see entitlement and immaturity and a general unwillingness to make small efforts and sacrifices for the good of others all around me, and it's driving me insane.

Ironically, though, I feel like the ultimate forms of kindness and generosity are those that do not require any in return. I look up so much to people who can be surrounded by foul, selfish behavior, and still project kindness and generosity without faltering. It is like witnessing a strong person who does not bow under a heavy weight. My girlfriend is like this. I have asked her how she manages to face awful people without it affecting her mood, and she laughs and shrugs, and says she does not know. She has always been that way.

i'm 25M and have wanted to become a content creator ( mainly gaming ) since 2011 but always second guessed myself because (1) of having no editing knowledge or experience (2) i grew up in a shitty thirdworld country till adulthood, my family only got internet in 2014, they all use old phones and only watch tv for entertainment except for me who worked during the weekends and school vacations getting paid a max of 25 bucks a day to stay relatively in touch with technology ( smartphone ,data plan etc.. ). when i finally built my ghetto pc in 2015 i thought i was going to start making content immediately but was depressed of how frustrating it is to not know anything about editing despite being fairly decent with a pc it looked like rocket science to me and even more depressed when i tried to upload a video with minor cuts and basic edits and a voiceover with my samsung s3 just to find out it will take me a wopping 87 hours to upload a 15 minute video with my 100kb upload speed. i basically slammed that book of dreams of mine shut and focused on graduating highschool working anything i can find to start editing lessons with no avail. in the end of 2018 i met my wife and moved to europe ( this is already long so i will cut out the rest ) i finally have a decent internet connection and a decent build that i put together when my wife gifted me some parts for my birthday. i'm now working as a logistics worker loading and unloading merchendise by hand getting paid minimum wage and i hate it. my wife gave birth to our first son last night and i feel like i can't provide for him doing what i do especially that i already lost my job because of the covid outbreak..

so i'm here writing this hoping that you guys put me in the right path to learn how to become decent enough that i can start a yt channel or something of that sort. i currently play some online shooter games and my friends always tell me that i'm very funny and half decent at shooter games ( i don't think i am ) but they encouraged me to start making videos any tips or tricks would really help me i tried learning by doing it just ends up being hours of frustration and then unplugging the pc and gonig to bed ... thanks in advance",28May2020,1
985,When you grow up feeling alone and invisible you realize you can connect with people online .I’ve been meeting people online since I was 12 .they made me feel special and pretty and like I mattered .it’s gotten me in a lot of messed up situations . I feel like an addict for attention .people taking a while to text me back not getting a call back upsets me sooo much.if someone doesn’t like me or doesn’t treat me a certain way sends me spiraling.i know I need some help but home circumstances make things complicated.,28May2020,1
986,"let me start this off by saying she is very shy. she never makes the first move. knowing this, let me start on the background. 
we stopped being friends on her birthday, aug. 27th, 2019. today is may 28, 2020. she grew closer to another person and we just fell off. it was messy. in December we tried to work things out and she ghosted me. it was my senior year, and i had to see her everyday. i never said a word but she always ran her mouth so i confronted her. things got messy and she blocked me on everything (we already unfollowed each other by then, but i use to stalk her, as any person might do). 

senior year is over now and she unblocked me recently and put an old picture of us on her instagram. i recently reactivated twitter and she has been liking my retweets, and some she has unliked in a couple days. 
i DMed her on twitter 4 days ago and still haven’t gotten a reply while she’s active on twitter. should I lose all hope? she was the type of bestfriend where you did everything together and felt like you were each other’s other half. i thought she was my platonic soul mate. 
we’ve always had that unspoken bond, so i feel like even if things ended messy and we were so mad , we still love each other. and her friends hate me and don’t want her to be friends with me. 

can someone give me advice? i’m so blinded by my love for her.",28May2020,1

988,"I am in 8th grade so i am looking forward to going to highschool. The thing is in my country there is a nationalised test that every 8th grader takes and then there is made a ranking, with the first student picking their highschool first.

Until literally today i was planning to go to a public school, the best in my city and a top one in the country. However, today a woman called my mother and said that based on my results at some national contests, i could apply to go to their school(private) the best in the country. This school is located aproximatelly 200 km from my home, in the capital.

On the one hand, i want to go because this school has the bedt teachers in the country, the classes would be smaller(20 students vs 30), and the students have a lot more to say about what they want to study, compared to the public school.

On the other hand, my parents couldnt be able to move to the capital so ill have to stay at a dorm. Plus, i will have to leave all of my friends in my home city. Moreover, being a private school, it has a yearly tax of aprox. 3000€ (a big ammount of money for my family)

So what do you say?  Should i go to better private school in the capital or stay eith my friends and family in my home city with the mediocre public school?",28May2020,1
989,"I recognize that I am so fortunate to be in the position I am in, but with that being said I need advice! I have the opportunity to go to Alaska and work as a kayak guide. I went last summer and fell in love. I was supposed to go again this summer, but I was unsure with the recent Covid. 

My dilemma really boils down between going up to Alaska, or staying in my hometown and earning money. This is the last summer I could have the opportunity to go back. 

I am a very broke college student with some money saved up. I could go up to Alaska and be alright, financially, but I’d be loosing about $6,000. I do have some student loans, I am trying to save up for a masters school in a couple of years, and I barely have enough to cover this coming fall semester. Even with all of that, I know I would have a sense of regret if I stay, and I would loose a good relationship with my bosses. 

I can not make a decision to save my life since I am stuck between what I really want to do and what I think is financially responsible. I know if I really want to go back to Alaska, I would make it work, but I want to feel good about my decision. I think some outside perspective would be helpful...",28May2020,1

991,"So me and my ex were on quite good terms, despite me dating another guy just a couple months after our relationship ended, so it could be said i'd left him for the other guy. Recently, we'd been thinking of hooking up, but the other day we were just casually speaking and telling each other stories, and i detailed a hook-up gone wrong that I'd experienced recently. Immediately after it, though he laughed and seemed to act normal, he said that he probably wouldn't be interested in hooking up with me anymore as it would be too much of a blow to his ego to hook up with me knowing I'd been with someone else sexually , but he had not. This is not to say he's 100% pure and innocent, he just didn't do as much as i did. I am still a virgin, as I didn't go through all the way in any of the relationships or hookups I'd had. What he said angered me quite a bit, because while i understand him having the choice to not hook-up with me completely, the fact that it was because I'd somehow dared to experience someone that was not him, and that turned him off and irked his ego is infuriating for me. We haven't been together in over a year, and he's off to university quite soon. Is it wrong on my behalf to feel indignant and angry, or is he in the wrong. I don't want to sound as if I believe he owes me anything, it's just the reason he gave doesn't sit well with me at all, and though i didn't say anything, I haven't spoken to him since then as i was quite creeped out.",28May2020,1

993,"Some background: I am an American citizen and have spent the majority of my life in the US. My dad is white and my mom is Chinese. My parents wanted to make sure I could speak both English and Chinese. Growing up my mom would talk to me in Chinese and my dad would talk to me in English. From ages 0-10 I went to China every summer and spent the whole summer there. I also went to school there for a couple semesters (I was about 7 at the time). During that time my Chinese was pretty much flawless (for a kid) and I sounded like a native. After I turned 11 my mom got a different job and was no longer able to take me to China every summer. I spent 6 years in the US without ever going to China. 

I just wanted to fit in at that point in my life. Unfortunately being in touch with my Chinese roots wasn't exactly cool in middle school (or high school for that matter). So I stopped speaking Chinese altogether. When my mom would speak to me in Chinese I would just respond in English.

When I was 16 I got to go to China for a month. During that time I realized my Chinese was absolutely awful and I couldn't understand everything people were saying to me. I tried to keep up appearances in front of my mom, but it was quite clear that my language skills were not very good. 

Despite that experience when I was 16 my mom is still somehow convinced that I'm amazing at Chinese and could pass for a native. The fact of the matter is, I can only recognize about 100 Chinese characters and can't actually write any of them. I can understand what most people are saying but don't know how to respond. 

Now, with the pandemic going on I am unable to work and due to issues I won't get into I can't apply for unemployment, so my parents are supporting me financially. However, they're not rich and can't infinitely give me money so they've been trying to get me to do online tutoring. They want me to teach English to Chinese kids. Since my mom has connections in China she feels that she could get me plenty of students. The issue is, they want my main selling point to be that I can speak Chinese. They keep telling me that most of the people trying tutor Chinese kids in English aren't bilingual like me, etc. The issue is I AM NOT BILINGUAL. I keep trying to explain this to my parents, but they just keep telling me ""you're underestimating yourself"" or my mom will bring up an example of me speaking perfect Chinese from well over a decade ago when I was like 7. 

Now they want me to make an introduction video in both English and Chinese and I don't even know where to start. I keep trying to explain to them that my Chinese skills are very lacking and I'm not bilingual like they keep saying. They just don't seem to get it and I don't know what to do at this point.",28May2020,1
994,"My wife’s father is almost brain dead. They are asking for her consent to let him pass if an emergency procedure arises since his body is so weak now. Her dad is a great, loving man and my wife is extremely close with him; she has not been taking this well. He is in another country with strict border controls due to covid, so she can’t even go see him immediately. We also have a four month old baby that needs to be considered.

I’m feeling overwhelmed, but I’m mostly worried for my family and my wife. 

Before covid, my business was doing well, but now I’m struggling to keep it open. I’m worried for my wife’s mental health and her ability to be with our kid while I work. I am trying to keep this business alive but I need to be at home to support them too. I’m trying to run the business, do all house duties, support the wife, and take care of the baby. I’m so worried and I know that I don’t have enough energy to keep this up for long. I’m so fucking weak. I wish I was one of those people who function well without much sleep. 

I don’t know what else to do… obviously I will push her to get counselling. I also don't think it's a good idea for her to be alone with the kid while I'm at work. With my mother-in-law out of the country to attend to the dad, my sister suggested that my wife should spend time at her house so she doesn't have to be alone. My sister is a mom with two kids and I think that just being around other people while not having to do anything will be better than her being alone. 

Can anyone else please give me advice on how to support my wife? Anything is appreciated. Post-partum, covid, her father's condition, etc.. I am at a loss in figuring out what more I can do for her. I need to do more for her.

997,"I don't know if I'm overreacting but I need to get this off my chest and need to know for myself on how to act.
So basically I reconciled with a friend of mine after a fight we had at the end of 2019 which led to her blocking me on WhatsApp and not talking until March of this year.

She's fun at parties and to joke around with but she gets quite rude at times. As an example of what I'm talking about, let me elaborate:
I suffer from handwashing OCD, she's aware of that. She had a BBQ on her birthday and I wanted to add some sauce to my plate. Unfortunately the lid had some sauce on it, so I kindly asked her to remove it for me so I wouldn't have to get up and wash my hands afterwards as it's no problem for her to touch it. Her response was an annoyed sigh and calling me ""child"" in front of the guests, which irritated me a bit.

Today I told her about my growing interest in botany and ornithology due to the walks I've been going for with my mother. Instead of at least just giving a short, neutral response she answered ""Oh, how about math?"" (Hinting at my problems I face with mathematics at school)
She also told me that she's gonna laugh at me if my tattoo (which I'll get in August) gets infected, after hinting that she believes I'd be more likely to get an infection.

She generally gives me the vibe of not taking me seriously or considering me a child despite the age difference of only one year. It's just the way she looks at me when I'm being clumsy or forgetful sometimes, it's the way you look at someone you belittle or pity.
I don't know if I'm just imagining things or being paranoid?!
If she wasn't pregnant I probably would've already left but I feel like watching the little one, because I'm worried?",28May2020,1
998,"Hi. 

So my boyfriend and I have been together for four years. It's been okay, we have had our ups and downs. He never talked about this girl, ever. During quarantine she contacted him and a couple of others to do video chat. One of the boys didn't want to, because that was his ex girlfriend and he's in a relationship now. So when I asked about it, my boyfriend rolled his eyes and told me that he was just acting ""gay"". Lovely, right? So he spent 5 hours talking to two girls until 4 a.m. The next week we had a fight (unrelated) and he told me he was going to call his friends (didn't specifiy), so naturally I thought he was going to call his best friend and his girlfriend (a couple we went on many dates with). He promised he was going to call me, but he didn't. And the day after I found out he was talking to those girls until the morning and playing a certain game that had a sexual category in it. So I became pretty pissed off. But the thing is, he doesn't understand why this makes me angry and jealous. He never talked about this girl, she contacts his from nowhere, they video chat for hours and hours and also chat frequently on messenger and make plans to video chat more. We are apart during this time (differente cities) and couldn't see each other because of the virus. So I was feeling pretty lonely...   
When I want to talk about it because it generally upsets me, he becomes pissed off, he rolls his eyes and stops talking to me, ignores me for a while and then I have to call him to sort things out because he is unwilling to and prefers us being mad at each other than talk things through. He tells me that I don't have the right to prohibit him from talking to this girl and that he doesn't care about how I feel and continue. What the fuck should I do? I feel so stupid. 

Sorry for any mistakes, English isn't my first language... 

&amp;#x200B;

\[TL;DR\] My boyfriend started talking to a girl he never mentioned before on video chat (and played a game with sexual innuendos) for hours and hours and gets pissed off at me because I am not happy with the situation.",28May2020,1
999,"Yeah so no one's gonna see this but at least I should try. 
To make a long story short and put you in context:
For the last months I had been in love with my best friend and I'm pretty sure that for some time she was aswell (just a superstition tho, I don't know), time went on and she probably fell in love with my friend (who let's face it, he might be my friend but he can be a total dick and extremely retarded, like making cuts in your hands with scissors for no reason other than look cool). 

So I used the quarantine as a way of reforming myself and just focus on what mattered the most, and well, I moved one... Or so I thought, today some friends hung out and we talked a lot and bla bla bla, and here is when it all turns to shit:

She wouldn't stop talking about how all she did this quarantine is speaking with my friend and how cool he is etc etc, which in first hand I didn't give a fuck because I moved on, but as time went on I started to feel more and more hurt, and I just simply don't know why. 
In my head I have moved on, but I might've not, I feel hurt and I don't know if it's because I love her or because I am jealous ofy friend being actually liked by people, I just don't know. 
I had been almost depressed for months with little to no reason to do things other than seeing her, and I ugh... I just wasted so many opportunities... 

If anyone has gone through something similar I would really appreciate any advice. In a way I want to try again if we can get somewhere, in another way I just want to back up and don't stand in their way and in another way I'm just like ""Well who gives a fuck, I do me, fuck it"".

1001,"TL;DR: I've been going to a Christian school for a pretty long time and now that I'm leaving, I'm not sure how to tell everyone that I'm an atheist.

Okay, so I've been going to the same Christian school ever since Junior Kindergarten and it's a pretty small school with around 500 people even though it is JK to 12. The school is a small, private Christian school so everyone does mostly know each other. All of my closest friends go to this school, and are Christian (I assume). You might think that since I don't explicitly know that my friends are Christian there's a chance that they might not be, but based on my experience, they do seem to take Christianity pretty seriously and most of them do go to church. 

I don't really remember when I came to the conclusion that God isn't real, but it was somewhere in between grades 4 to 6. Despite that, I still decided to join the worship team and start going to church in grade 7. I don't really know why I went myself. I think it's because my friend wanted me to come to her church, and it was hard to refuse. Also, being around only Christians since my schooling began, it was hard to explain why I didn't go to church.

It's hard to describe why I'm not Christian as well. Everyone just seems to say that as long as you accept Christ you'll be saved or something like that, but mentally I can't just believe that there is a God. It's just something that I can't accept without proof. As of now, I am fully convinced that I will be an atheist for the rest of my life, but don't get me wrong. I think that religion is a great thing and it brings many people together. I just personally don't believe.

Now, I'm leaving this school to go to a public one, so the only times me and my friend will meet will be at church. Here, I only refer to her as a friend, but it's hard to put into words how important she is to me, especially since we've been friends now for around 10 years. Her family is Christian and does go to church, and I am fairly sure that she is Christian as well. She isn't the only one that I want to tell. I'll also have to tell the church I've been going to because sooner or later I'll probably be too deep in the community to just leave. 

So now, I feel that my only options will be saying that I have other classes on church days, or I'll have to tell them that I am an atheist. Obviously the easy way out will just be avoiding church, but I really do want to tell my friend that I'm not Christian. This might not really seem like that big of a deal, but whenever I do think about telling everyone, I get really stressed.

Well, thanks for reading.",28May2020,1
1002,"My apologies for strange formatting; I'm on mobile.

I first need to mention that I've felt like this for the past year if not more, and I only just found this subreddit and finally realise that something is up. Thanks for reading; I know that it's long and I'm sorry. Anyhow.

Back when I started my current school in 2017, I was an amazing student. In school books only, I read 1 million words from September-December 2017, along with many more with books from home. It was a great accomplishment, and I was really proud, but that was one thing amongst many. I would always ask for more homework, do it the day it was set, and give it back as soon as I saw that teacher. I'd give it so much effort, always making sure that it was absolutely perfect and I'd get loads of praise for it.

In class, I made tons of notes, always paid attention, never messed around, didn't get a single detention (still haven't, and that's the only thing I'm proud of) and always got high marks in everything I did. It was amazing! I got so much done, always stayed focused, and could read a 300+ page book in 1 day.

I assumed that things would go swimmingly through my entire school life, but I was terribly wrong. I don't know what happened but in August of 2018 I broke down whilst on holiday visiting my grandparents. I had come to terms that I was not heterosexual, though I refused to tell anyone because nobody would support me, and I realised it might do me well of I saw a therapist. The only person who calmed me down and didn't get mad at me was my Grandfather. Everyone else seemed disappointed, and I don't know why because I can't remember anything that I said or did.

Then my Grandfather passed away in November of 2018. Ultimately, we knew it would happen, but I felt completely hollow. I wanted to weep until I couldn't weep no more, but I didn't. I was gone from school for two weeks for the funeral, because we couldn't book a flight any sooner, and yet I still wish that we stayed there for much longer because I felt shattered.

I struggled when I returned to school. I wrote 3 letters to teachers at my school, and I can't remember what I wrote in them, and I refuse to look at them even though they explained all the problems I was having at the time, and it would allow for these teachers to help me get back into my school routine. But I still struggled and I just wanted to cry because I couldn't focus on anything. But I shrugged it of, because everyone expected me to still be perfect, happy and full of joy.

But I couldn't be that. In 2019, it just got worse. I didn't read anymore, until I had to, and I had to do that whilst listening to music and with nothing around me that I could touch or use as a distraction. I no longer could complete homework  on time, and often did it the morning of the day it was due. I was struggling and I couldn't tell anyone about it, because everybody seemed to be doing fine.

In May 2019 I saw a 'therapist' but I didn't tell them how I felt because my mother was there, but I wish I had since my school knew everything I had said anyways after they got a call from them. I weeped that day when I got home; I was so stressed and I could feel the disappointment emitting from my mother.

Now in 2020, I came out to my friends, grew as a person, figured out what I want from life and bow I can do that, but I'm failing at school. I don't read anymore. I still love it, but after 2 minutes I have to re-read everything I read already. Whilst talking in my native language and in English I can't concentrate, I forget everything, I can't listen to more than 1 minute of a three minute song, I constantly get off task, I want to cry all the time but I can't because I just can't because my life could be worse and I just don't have the energy to do things that I used to love, or still love. I love gaming, absolutely, but after half an hour I go do something else and come back to the game after hours of forgetting.

I can't get anything done like this. I'm always sad and feel hollow on most days, and completely forget what I was meant to be doing after a minute. How do I make this stop? 

I'm tired of things being this way...

(Sorry for all the background info, but I feel like it is important to ending this horrible situation that I'm stuck in, which essentially turned me from a positive, talented and very happy person to someone who has become a disappointment to everyone around me almost over night because I'm quite opinionated, sad and just tired of all of this)",28May2020,1

1007,"Obviously this will have to wait post Covid but I'm thinking ahead. So my parents separated many years ago. My mom has only had a few brief, shitty relationships since then. Her last breakup left her in a deep depression that she's just crawled out of and it was compounded by the fact that my dad recently remarried.  She's getting older so that last breakup was felt a little more acutely. Shes a Mexican immigrant and her values are different than mine so my ""you dont need a man"" ""find happiness within yourself first"" pep talk falls on deaf ears.  The thing is, for the most part she meets people at work (already a bad move) but her English isn't the best so when she finds someone that speaks her language and checks a couple of other boxes she tends to jump at it.  And this has led to just plain bad relationships. We don't have the best relationship mostly because of our drastically different values but I really just want her to be happy and start taking her life into her own hands.

Basically they said my job is to go to school and get good grades, and I shouldn’t have to worry about money and work being a distraction. Although I believe that they think they have good intentions, I feel severely stunted in my growth into adulthood, as well as embarrassed. I’m also stressed out over my blank resume. 

I’m a college student now, and I was planning to secretly apply for jobs for the summer, just in retail or food or something simple like that and deal with the fallout with my mother after I get the job and leave the house everyday for work. But then the pandemic hit. The only reason why I haven’t gone through with trying to find a summer job is that my dad is sick/immunocompromised and I feel that it is irresponsible to increase my exposure to the virus and bring it home to my parents. 

I don’t want to seem like I disrespect my dad’s health, but I really need a job and don’t know why I need to convince my parents that work experience is good. I am allowed to get internships related to my major, but I honestly don’t want to work in that field and I want a typical teen summer job. I doubt I will get an internship with no work experience anyway.",28May2020,1
1009,All of this information is all that I know I dont know much more than what I'm saying but my friend is unhappy with everything that is going on at this moment in her life. Quarantine isnt treating her the best because of her family. She has 6 siblings in which most of them do not have the best relationship with her and her step dad will always scream at any of the kids in the house whenever he has a chance. I have heard him scream at my friend over wanting to talk to her mom that is just one of the many times he has yelled at her. I have a gut feeling that he physically hits them or worse but I dont know something just seems off with my friend when she is talking to him or just around him. All of this with her family plus issues with friends makes her cry very often and even cut herself. This made me furious at them but not to long ago one of her friends said she was not cutting deep enough. I sat there and felt so upset and I told her to never listen to him or not to do it again but I know that she will not stop and it makes me feel so powerless that I cant stop her I wish I could just help in anyway that I could but I dont know how to. It's been happening for about 2 months now and I dont know if I can get her to stop. I would also like to add that I am not one of the most social people so I dont really know what to do or who to talk to about this. Thats why I decided to come to reddit to see if anyone could help. Thanks to anyone who can help.,28May2020,1
1011,"I don't know all the details and no one in my family knows that I'm posting this, but I felt that the community of Reddit may have some advice for us. This has been going on for a while, but it escalated this past weekend.  


My family had went without seeing each other for a while due to the pandemic, but that changed when the laws allowed us to get together at my grandparents' house. It was a hot and sunny day, so everyone was by the pool and just hanging out. However, about two hours into it, my uncle's ex showed up to get her kids. There's a reason that they're separated: my uncle drinks and can drink a bit too much at times. I heard that, on a vacation to Mexico, she would hint that he would beat her (he didn't), and recently I also learned that she was badmouthing the family behind our backs in order to make her daughters (they're under kindergarten age) afraid to come over. At every instance she gets, she tries to build a case against my uncle.  


When she came to pick up her kids, she ended up filming my grandmother at the time she was enjoying a beer with the family, saying that she ""influences him (my uncle)"" and my grandmother was caught completely off guard. She implied that she was sending it to her lawyer, said some other things about how we're all beer-brained, and left. I was away from the house when this all went down, and I was shocked when I heard about this.  


Now, my grandmother is worried sick that she won't get to see her granddaughters again because she loves those girls. And that's where I turn to you, great people of Reddit. I'm not the best at writing these sorts of posts (I don't post much), but can anyone offer me some advice?

P.S. I'll probably delete this post in a day or two for privacy reasons (or if advised).",28May2020,1
1012,"Alrighty So recently, a very obnoxious user keeps on harassing me and my friends.

The user has been threatening to murder my friends over the smallest things, and if they don’t comply they threaten suicide.   
They keep saying things like

&amp;#x200B;

’’Im going to kill myself and it’s going to be all your fault! Your families going to hate you!’’

&amp;#x200B;

And other times they threaten me directly saying they are going to take my guts out. An example would be something like

&amp;#x200B;

’’Im going to kill You in your sleep’’  


This has become a very big problem since this user constantly threatens us with murder but we can’t remove them or else they will kill themselves. I’m honestly very concerned. My friends keep telling them to stop. They also keep calling my friend who is part of the LGBT fandom a f\*ggot. Everytime i tell them to stop they say the will mail a picture of them self harming.

1013,"I honestly haven't heard advice from people who aren't in the situation, I would like to hear unbiased advice. 

My best friend and I met in our freshman year of high school, and we formed the type of bond that was inseparable. When we got together everything else in the world melted away and we could talk for hours days months on end. And that's how it went. We became known as the iconic duo, everywhere one would go the other was always there. We of course had time apart, we burned out occasionally and then bounce back like it was nothing. 

Personally I was dealing with finding myself, my gender my sexuality all that jazz and they were very supportive of that especially his family. He support me and love me like crazy and that's a reason why I'm genuinely not sure. 

So to the problem. 
So we'll call him Lass. So in November of last year, I had been in a relationship with a girl. It wasnt what I really wanted but Lass supported me through it and he didnt really talk to her but he was nice to her which made me feel happy because I had never dated in school. It was a very one sided relationship but I tried to hold it out. That's when I met my current partner. And it was an instant click, it was almost like me and Lass but it was filled with a different kind of love and care that I had never gotten. 

I ended up leaving the girl for my current partner, (it was mutual and she supported us) Lass wasnt really supportive of it what so ever. They didnt like my partner they avoided us in the hallways, wouldnt talk when he was around, when partner tried having a conversation or saying hi Lass would ignore them or pretend not to hear them until I would say something. Which upset me heavily because I was always so supportive of Lass's relationships and even the guys he starts talking to I would greet them and have conversations with them. ( I will admit I didnt like a few of them but I have NEVER made any boy they have presented to me feel unwanted in anyway that's a private discussion between me and Lass) For weeks my partner would tell me how they feel Lass wants to eat them alive, about how they hate him so much for no reason, and I agreed that that it wasnt fair. Bringing up to Lass, he never said anything, he said he would just try harder. But with other friends I heard he said ""Its not that I hate him....its that I despise him"". I think that kind of upset me. My partner has treated me so well and they push me to do so much good, it's the first healthy relationship I have ever been in and my own best friend isn't rooting for me.

Next thing. Lass started pushing me away. They had another friend let's call him Line. So Lass and Line would play xbox all the time, which is okay because I was going through a rough living situation so I would get home after walking MILES and all I had the energy to do was shower eat sleep. I would call my partner during the walk and it would help me out a lot. Lass would occasionally call me during the walks and I would hang up my other phone to talk to him and he wanted to play xbox but I was so tired, I lived 3 towns away from my home town and then I had to walk through my hometown to get to my bus stop for a school that's even more towns away and back. It was fucking exhausting mentally and physically. Las would call me to ask to play xbox and I would tell him no because I was tired and he would be all like oh okay. And hang up. Then he would go about telling other people that I spend all my time talking to my partner. Which upset me big time. I was going through a lot for him to be like that. 
Anyway so he replaced me with Line on xbox and in real life. Soon it was him and line at every angle, when we finally got play they were like me and lass, super close and when they talked they would go their own world. Which I mean it's okay, he can make new friends. I fell heavily left out and like my own best friend wasn't mine anymore but what could I do about it. Whenever I was online he would be like I'm playing with line...oh yeah sure later me and line just started a match and I'm like I came back to xbox and now you dont even wanna play with me ouch.

Next reason and final. Is that he keeps telling my life to other people. At first sure it's not a big deal, people gossip. When I first heard about it it was from his step mother, secrets only I've told him and I was stunned when I heard her making a joke about something that was a secret between me and him. Relating my sex life. And I was very very angry at that. I confronted him, his response was ""You were going to tell her anyway she *insert name* you tell her everything""...like? No if I wanted to tell her I would have..and then it happened again with his new boyfriend which may I say I have been respectful and nice forwards something hes never once showed my partner. I was complaining about this guy friend o have in a discord chat and his boyfriend goes ""oh? You mean ____"" and I was. Fucking. Stunned. Like why are you telling people my business! Then two more times. This time with Line and my friend. They both told me my own secrets back to me, things that I have only told lass. And I'm just very hurt by it on so many occasions and my family simply tells me to stop telling him secrets. 

As an outsider, what do you think I should do. At the moment I'm not talking to him due to *another* incident. Lass was never like this, he kept secrets, he was nice and genuine, is it because hes almost an adult and this is how he is? Is it my fault for falling in love with someone he doesnt like?? I just dont know anymore.

1014,"A while ago my sister had asked me to host her baby shower online. I was really happy to accept and make some graphics and online materials that would allow her to still have the experience she wanted while being online. Her and I don’t have the best relationship all of the time, but it’s gotten better the past few years. 
The part that makes me uneasy is that she has invited our biological mother to the event. I do not have a relationship with her and have not seen or spoken to her since I was a small child (roughly 6 years old). My sister has a distant, rocky relationship with her but has always seemed to crave a relationship with this woman. My sister knows I do not have a relationship with our biological mother. 
Unfortunately, she has marked herself as “going.” 
I want to be there for my sister, this seems really important to her. However, I am really uneasy at the thought of seeing and speaking to my biological mother again, something I never planned on doing. I really don’t want to fall into a bad relationship with my sister again over this.",28May2020,1
1015,"Long story short: He had said and done things that hurt me, so I decided that I couldn’t be with him. He never cheated on me or anything, he just did some things that didn’t make me feel very good about myself. I couldn’t continue feeling miserable or not trusting him. He has always told me how much he loves me and wants to be together in the future, but we had an LDR and we didn’t know when we could see each other again. After weeks of going back and forth, I eventually told him I didn’t want to be with him as I felt we were both making each other really unhappy.

I do think he loved me, just that he loved me as much as he could. He really did try hard to be with me. I feel awful and I want to talk to him again since I still feel like he’s my best friend and I know he’s probably hurting. But he hurt me too, even during the very last conversation we had. He told me he feels like I’m purposely hurting him because he hurt me, but I’m not trying to be purposely vengeful.

1017,"So for starters, I'm (M18) and I've been in this relationship for 11 months now, we've been super happy together but I feel this issue is partly because of things that weren't addressed on her end in the past and now it's biting her in the ass and unfortunately also affecting me, and I'm super scared this could mean the end of our relationship because I don't know what I can do to help her in this situation

 So some context on my partner's end, she's super sweet, understanding, she can read how I'm feeling whenever I'm with her, loyal, trustworthy, but unfortunately under all that she has what she would call psycho parents in which can be defined as, they can never be happy that she works hard in school and has good grades(All above an 85%), but whenever she does screw up it always ends up in punishment

So, unfortunately, this has been an issue for a while where shes locked in this cycle where for a couple of weeks everything is fine and well, and then a single mistake or a bad grade just tips the boat, I've tried to hop in to help her with that (Not to mention she does have ADHD), but I've done what I can to comfort her in those situations if I'm present. This has happened a total of about 3 times when I was with her, so maybe based on assumptions maybe I've made a positive impact on her? Unfortunately, I do not know, but I'm just doing what I can to help

As much as I'd love to stay with her, I understand If it does get even worse, I have the right to leave, but I feel my heart still belongs to her. I'd appreciate whoever does reply to analyze both sides, Id really appreciate it.

The only problem is that they occasionally make racist remarks- nothing ultra violent or extreme, but things that are still harmful and racist. 
Up until now, I’ve just responded by saying nothing, or lightly disagreeing.. but all the things about racism and police brutality in the media right now have really made me realise that I should be doing more than that. 

Example of the kind of remarks they make - “The black guys always have the most annoying orders” (there is a black man who comes in regularly and asks for a receipt from the cash register with his order. It is slightly annoying to get receipts from the cash register we have) 
I just replied by saying “not really” and gave an example of a really tiresome white customer we have.

1023,"My ex boyfriend [19M] just moved to my city [19F] and I don’t know how to feel.

Long story short my ex moved to my city. He was a great guy just really really depressed at the time. I was really his only friend. I treated him really shitty and honestly never apologized. But what’s in the past is in the past and I can’t change that. 

Anyway back in February he texted me this long message basically apologizing for being so depressed and not knowing how to handle his emotions. According to him he beat all the demons he was facing. I thanked him, and we caught up a bit. I could tell there was still something there between us, so I pulled away pretty hard. I guess he understood because he stopped messaging me right before Covid.

However during our short weeks of talking he mentioned moving to my city. I asked him why and he said he just liked the area and there was a job opportunity available. 

I kind of forgot about that until today, when I decided to look at his instagram. I guess he moved in and everything. I just feel weird about it, you know? I mean, I can’t help but think It was because of me. 

I don’t know maybe i’m flattering myself, it has been over a year since we were together. And he literally hasn’t even contacted me once since he’s been here.

I should definitely add ive never felt threatened by him. He never did anything bad to me, even during the breakup. The worst thing was him really just begging for me to stay.

1026,"Hello reddit community,

I thought maybe I could get some of your advice/opinion on my situation, because I’ve been reading a lot of wise words of some people.

So basically this lockdown/social distancing has been a real rollercoaster for me (majority of us, let’s be honest) and brought out a lot of dark topics I have been suppressing for a long time (fun times, I know).
 
I have always enjoyed my own company and for some reason always had a feeling to put other people and their needs first. Which has brought me to the stage where I tend not to interact with people too much, because usually I end up concentrating and pleasing them (which sometimes can be tiring). On top of that I have a low self esteem, I think I’m not good enough/my chat is shit/I’m boring (my ex partner used to say that a lot to me, which really got stuck in me). 
I do have friends, but I feel like I can be a burden to them if I start talking about myself and tend to keep myself busy to distract from these thoughts.

Now during this lockdown I felt some sort of relief that okay, we are all in the same boat, not being able to see people. But people keep talking about their zoom parties and surprise surprise - I can’t relate to that.

So now I’ve been debating what kind of person I am. An introvert? An extrovert?
Feeling bad for the way I am? Feeling embarrassed and worthless because I don’t have the same social life other people have?

Do I need to change and put myself out there or do I accept the way I am? Also how would you suggest doing that, because I feel like a total friendless weirdo. where a part of me wants to stay in my comfort bubble being on my own and the other part wants to be normal (social media/pub drinks every night standards). But I don’t have that friends group to do it with, so I tend to be on my own and then I feel bad... and it’s basically a never ending circle. 

I hope this makes some sort of sense, because my head sometimes feels like a bucket of words/feeling and it’s hard to put everything in right places. 
And I hope there would be some nice people who would take their time to read my crap and help me a little.

Thank you!",28May2020,1

Pretty much since junior year when I got a bit used in a relationship (she convinced me to do things I wasnt comfortable with, but promised it for the sake of love... I was a kid then, like 16). So after that I was a bit scarred. I wasnt attracted to anyone whatsoever for until I hit college. Then, I realized when I started thinking, ""Oh, shes cute,"" that I didnt actually KNOW anyone anymore since I began shutting everyone out. I took online school for the past three semesters (my first semester I spent in school, hence my rediscovery of attraction to people), and I've since lost most contact with the outside world. I slave away at a computer most days to get my work done, then I write stories when I have free time. 

Recently, one of my few remaining friends took me out, got me clothes, a haircut, and took me out on a night on the town. I felt amazing and was ready to change my life around. Then the next day we got a stay at home order and everything shut down. I've joined Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Match. I go for runs and bike rides daily.

I hate it and I've told him I'm not having it several times. He's never hit me but he has implied it, and thrown water over me and pushed me away before. How do I deal with this?",28May2020,1

But my mental health hasn't been the best and having social anxiety (for my entire life) makes me super anxious, stressed and even suicidal about this. and I have little to no experience working in a pharmacy so i think it's best to take a gap year and get a job at a pharmacy.

1045," So couple of months ago last year I lost all my friends. It kinda started off as my best friend who I’ve been there for through everything got brainwashed by this other girl we knew who made rumours about me to make me look evil. Later on lead to my best friend believing her and exposing me to one of our other friend (lets call her Susie) we BOTH said shit about. However it’s worse on me since I’m closer to Susie. 
Now this is where my karma starts I guess 
The reason we both used to say shit about Susie was because she was controlling back then. She would get mad Everytime I hung out with my bestfriend. 

We met through her and Susie would exclude her self from plans. However susie changed and I felt guilty realising she was only upset she was losing a close friend who she missed heaps. Instead of me talking to her I continued to gossip about her. Forgetting she was there for me no matter what conflict we had. She still kept me a priority and all I did was become the worse person. The gossiping did stop months before the exposing happened! 

So when my best friend took revenge on me. She made it seem like I did the most which was true. The reason she did this was because this other girl we used to hang out with made rumours about me that made me seem purely evil and criminal minded. This made it hard for me to apologise as it made my other friend Zee believe I was evil. Zee , Susie and I used to be a trio in highschool. Susie didn’t think I was evil but did think I was shit person (which i agree 100%)  anyways I lost Susie , Zee and my best friend that got brain washed. 


Fast forward 2020
My bestfriend calls apologising, crying. Ended up in hospital for cutting. 
Admitted to Susie we BOTH said the stuff. However I find out she told Zee I called her this one particular name which I don’t remember saying! However my bestfriend crying said she sadly remembers! I feel even shittier because this whole time I thought Zee was upset because of what I did to Susie! 

It’s been 4 months since the apology and I’m trying to get in contact with susie and Zee. Me and Zee talked a bit when my best friend when to Hospital. I can’t get through Zee and Susie. I even sent screenshots to my best friend but she keeps claiming she forgot to show them to her but is verbally telling her I called ! Zee thinks it a lie !!
This week my bestfriend also tried to call Zee to convince her to talk to me when I told her not to and to just show her the proof, she didn’t listen and called Zee and told her I’m all sad and miserable. She didn’t realise it made it look like im not trying.  She also sent 2 missed calls to Susie! Zee did get convinced. However later that night Zee and Susie called my bestfriend and told her that they don’t want to hear from me since I haven’t tried! They still haven’t seen the screenshots! 
I’m so confused because it seems like my best friend is adamant about us being friends again but why is she not showing the proof when she’s the only way I can get through them !!",28May2020,1

1051,"Next year is my sophomore year of high school, and I (16F) really want to join my school's Gay-Straight Alliance club. This is something that really matters to me because I have LBGTQ+ friends and I myself am LGBTQ+ (closeted). However, I'm worried about telling my mom. She says that she is supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, but she:

* Doesn't believe in nonbinary genders. I am a demigirl.
* Is kind of dismissive when I tell her about current news regarding the LGBTQ+ community
* Ignores my dad when he uses the f-slur and when I ask him not to use it because it's a slur, excuses his behavior because he's old
* Told me I was too young to decide when I tried to come out a few years ago
* Said she didn't understand why they had to put ""sex"" in cartoons. I had mentioned that a certain ship became canon in the series finale of She-Ra and I was glad they got a happy ending. But then I asked her if it would be different if it were a straight couple and I think it might just be that she doesn't like romance in kids' shows because apparently when she was a kid, cartoons didn't have romance.
* Has said that I can't wear a suit or cut my hair too short because I'm not a lesbian
* Has said that clothes have genders (but apparently that only applies to men, I'm allowed to wear guy's clothes)

She does know that I am supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, believe in nonbinary genders, and am still upset with my dad's use of slurs. I don't think she'd be upset with me and she'd probably let me join, I'm just a little nervous.

Should I tell her that want to join or not? If so, how?

Also, I really want to tell her that some of this bothers me and is homophobic. If I were to explain it, she'd probably understand and change her stance on some of the issues mentioned above or at least try to keep a more open mind. How do I politely do that? Or should I just ignore this for the time being?",28May2020,1
1052,"I have so much to say but I'll try to keep it as short as possible. I just turned 27 years old and I just got offered a job at a police department as a 911 call taker full time. I work part time right now at amazon around 20 to 30 hours a week.

My problem is, I don't really want to be a call taker, now I don't want to work at amazon for the rest of my life either. A little backstory is, My parents had forced me to go to university and I did and I just picked criminal justice as a major and during college I played league of legends and even reached a very high rank, challenger at the time, i was streaming and had gotten a decent amount of viewers on twitch. I had to quit playing league because i failed a class and was going to lose a scholarship.

Fast forward 6 years and I worked jobs in my field that I didn't really like, and I play over watch and stream and I got a high rank in overwatch again and some followers.

I'll get to the point, playing games at a high level and streaming it has always been a passion of mine, i want it more than anything in the world, it's a dream if I could do it as a job.

I have way more time to play and stream if I keep the amazon job, but I'm also getting older and this job offer is a decent opportunity, but I don't really want to be a 911 dispatcher for the rest of my life, can i be a streamer forever? obviously not but I just want it so bad right now it hurts to think I will live a life without giving it an actual run. I just don't know what to do my anxiety has never been higher.

Is following my dreams dumb in this situation? or do i find a balance with the new job and still stream? or stream way more and stay with amazon. I would really appreciate some thoughts.",28May2020,1

So basically my mom said she'd help me, but everytime I ask her if she's free she makes an excuse, which for the past 10 days have been more and more ridiculous. The conversations go something like this:

Me: Mom, since you're free, can I start the passport application?

Mom: Not today, sorry I'm busy (tries to change the subject)

Me: Ok, how about tomorrow at 3:00 since I know you're free then?

Mom: We'll see. So anyways (insert different unrelated subject)

This gets really frustrating because she is free with lots of time, and knows when she will be free, but just keeps saying ""maybe"". And her reasoning is that she's not flat-out saying no, so stringing me along by saying ""we'll see"" is somehow better. She also still keeps trying to change the topic and spew bullshit such as suggesting that I should just spend thousands of pounds on immigrating to a country I am a citizen of. She thinks it is useless when it isn't and frankly I am really irritated now with her strangely strong opposition to it based on nothing but her own belief that the UK isn't good. I'm strongly considering just applying for my British passport myself without any parental consent when I'm 16 later this year, and I told her that 4-5 days ago. At first she thought it wasn't true but then I showed her it was true and she said she would be mad if I did and that I better not do it. I just told her that if she helps me now, then she doesn't have to care about that, but that when I'm 16, it's not her decision to make. I honestly don't know what to do at this point to have her stop stringing me along. I may just ask my dad to help me with it instead but he's more busy than my mom although he is British so he would not really have too many problems with it, but he's a little bit unreliable because he's busy. But the way it looks, unless I find a way to get my mom to stop stringing me along it's either going to have to be my dad that helps me or I have to collect and potentially borrow some documents at 16",28May2020,1

1055,"Hi guys. I am using a throwaway because I know for a fact, that some of the four friends I'm gonna talk about occasionally snoop through my post history. I'm sorry if this is going to be long but I feel like in order for someone to understand my situation I need to be very detailed. 


First I'd like to quickly introduce the three antagonists so you get a better understanding of our dynamic. I'll give them made up names so I can easily refer to them later on.

Mark:
Mark has a past of drug abuse and alcoholism. He is almost 2 years clean and took a full 180 since. He went vegan and became very mindful about his mental health. I think I bonded with him the most because we often share meaningful discussions when the others are not around. I don't see him too often though because he recently started his first job and meeting people on weekdays interrupts his schedule. Because of his past mental health issues structure is very important to him and I respect that a lot.

Dave:
Dave is generally a nice guy. I've shared a lot of laughs with him but he's not the type of guy to truly engage in a meaningful relationship. He rarely opens up but he will sometimes throw his pig in the race if me and Mark talk about something that concerns us. When you play video games with him he shows his darker side though. He first and foremost cares about his own enjoyment of the game and doesn't care if you are struggling or don't understand some of the mechanics. He will even demand ingame items and money from you to further increase his performance and then blame you if you're losing as a group.

Scott:
Scott is the one I take the biggest issue with. We've known each other for over a decade and for this reason the others think we share some sort of special relationship. He had the type of parents that would praise him to heavens for his intelligence and would tell him how smart he was compared to the other kids. This dellusion was further fed by the fact, that we went to a school that was way out of town and was known to harbor many kids that would have rather belonged in special ed. We both got bullied there as we sadly acted superior to the other children and showed very antisocial behaviour. If he got in an argument with me though he knew how to rile the other kids up against me as we were both disliked and you just needed to give them a reason. Nowadays Scott likes to spend his time online telling Americans how bad their country is compared to his. He even creates fake personas to get his point across.


This finally brings me to our current situation. A few weeks ago Mark, Scott and I got in a heated argument over discord. Mark holds Scott in very high esteem because (due to his intelligence complex)  Scott successfully convinced him to have a deep understanding of higher physics which I know he has not. The argument was about whether or not it's okay to say the ""n-word"" in a comedic context. The argument started because I had long grown out of this edgy ""shocking buzzword""-comedy and I often told them that it's just not funny to say the n-word especially if there's no other pun. Of course they came up with the unoriginal  ""putting the nword on a pedestal will just give it more power"". This is the exact same thing a particular youtuber said a few years back and I called them out for it. They responded with laughter and telling me how ridiculous I am for taking such big issue with a simple word. This was the first time in years that Scott convinced someone to make fun of me but it woke this old burning hatred I apparently still have for him. This mixed with disappointment, as I thought Mark was better than that.

Time passed and I swallowed my anger to go on a hiking trip with all three of them. All my other friends live really far away or got drafted for military service so I had to spend time with them, unless I wanted to go insane from isolation.

It all went well and we had lots of fun until Scott started his pseudo-scientific ramblings again. He told us about Schroedingers cat and its meaning to quantum physics or how people on a bus move slightly faster through time as they move faster through space. Unfortunately I got so annoyed by this that I decided to put him on a spot and asked him to explain further. It got apparent that he knows very little about these things and it got a little awkward for him so I decided to release pressure and just laugh it off. We moved on with our conversation and I didn't think anything of it but in retrospective I am 100% sure he took mental note of it. Later on we got on a bus and I said something like ""I sure hope my parents are still alive when I get off this time machine"". Everyone laughed but Scott. I knew him long enough to know the face he made. It's the face of someone with a hurt ego. He made sure not to let anyone notice his resentment because that's how he works.

In the following week there was a disproportionate amount of jokes from him at my expense via discord. At first I didn't think anything of it and just went along as we often make fun of one another. Then it got less and less creative and it became obvious that he just wanted to spite me. By wednesday it degenerated to him just calling me toxic multiple times a day. I assume he tried to convince everyone that I was actually a toxic person or at least get me mad. One time I wrote something like ""the humour in this group is really degenerating"" to which the others took his side and responded with ""Well I thought it was funny"" or something like that. I get that humour is subjective but who thinks it's funny to just call someone toxic over and over again? I figured that bitching about it would just put me in a worse light so I just moved on with my day.

In the evening of the same day we talked on voice chat over discord. Of course Scott once again made jokes exclusively on my expense. The only other person there was Dave who again acted like it was the most hilarious shit ever. This was really weird as he's usually the one who gives Scott shit for his bad humour. Also it seemed like they intentionally supressed a reaction to me trying to be funny. On the 100th occasion of Scott calling me toxic I snapped a little. I asked him what the fuck his problem was to which he acted oblivious. I was and still am 100% sure that he was mad at me but he would just gaslight me as being paranoid as he did many times before over the years. Of course Dave got involved and told me not to be a bad sport about it. I tried to explain what was happening but of course Scott just acted like I was insane. Dave was convinced. I wished them a good night and hung up.

The next day (Thursday this week) I woke up and did a few chores. Afterwards I asked via Whatsapp if anyone was down to play some videogames. Dave answered he would be ready at 5 pm and I was looking forward to it. I even stressed home from the gym to be on time. However, when I went online there was no life sign whatsoever. I hit him up on Whatsapp to ask if he was still coming. No answer. One hour passes. I hit him up again. No answer. I checked the message info and discovered, that he left me on read for about 30 minutes already. Then I realized that they never answered to anything I posted that week. It's like all three are conspiring against me.

Now it's thursday evening and I feel hurt and betrayed. I'm supposed to go on another hike with them on Saturday but I plan to cancel. I intend to cut ties with all of them but I'm not sure if it's right. We spent many years together and I had lots of good times even with Scott but I don't know how many more times I can take this. Scott has tried to turn people against me many times and on some occasions I even received screenshots of DM's as proof. That's why I know for a fact that he is, again, trying to gaslight me, even though I thought we were way past that.

I just noticed how long this thing got lol. I don't think anyone's gonna read the whole thing but it already helped a lot to structure the events in my mind.

If you did read: am I overreacting or would you do the same? Just cutting ties with Scott is nearly impossible as we almost never meet individually. Also it feels like everyone has turned against me.

Tl;dr: Stepped on my friends toe. In response he successfully turned my other friends against me. Now they are all gaslighting me for being paranoid and leave me on read.",28May2020,1
1056,"This is not uncommon, but I have this kindof automatic response to situations where I assume that the other person looks down on me. At least I think its an automatic response. (At this point Im not sure.) All I know for sure is that I am bitter and petty, which I dont like about myself, and im sure everyone around me can tell. 

I cant avoid the thought that the people I see as friends just think of me as immature. I know I do a lot of immature things, and it seems like a burden to the people around me. 

I guess the question I am asking is this. How do I know if I am being immature or If others are just being arrogant assholes? Because I dont know the difference. I feel like if I make an assumption either way, I am wrong. As a result, I feel stuck.",28May2020,1
1057,"Hi,

I've been volunteering as a falconer for almost 2 years and as of now I am 15. I live in England so no licence required to do this (which I think there should be) but that's a whole other thing.

I was taught everything I know by my first boss (I'll call him Dirk) he taught me how to raise birds, how to hold them, how to fly them, their psychology and generally everything I know. About 6 or 7 months into this the falconry started to struggle which I was distraught by as I had grown dependent on this place for happiness. I was going though a rough time and falconry was the only thing that made me happy. Naturally, my parents decided to find somewhere else because I am fortunate enough to have good parents. They found another place only 5 minutes away from us and I spoke to the boss of that place (I'll call him Joe) and he was kind enough to let me volunteer at his place.

Luckily, Dirk's falconry didn't close down, so I ended up going to Dirk's and Joe's place, but now I have an issue.

Joe was made a huge offer, he was asked to run a big falconry by a high paying garden centre. He is incredibly excited about this because not only will he run that falconry, but also the other avian areas of the centre. He still wants to keep his other place because it is right next to where he lives, he uses it as a school alternative for those with mental disabilities and it came with good hunting land. There is also a buzzard's nest there that he protects. He wants me to run the falconry with someone to make sure I am safe because I am a young girl. I really want to take this job because he wants to pay me quite a bit for it and it is exactly what I want to do as a carrier.

To do this I have to leave the other falconry and Dirk, who taught me everything.

At Dirk's falconry, I have made friends, learned everything, gained a passion for falconry and I have owned my 2 first birds there. My current bird is a kestrel called Olaf Van Helsing, who I cannot bare to leave behind. I love it there.

If I don't do this, Joe can't take the offer because he doesn't have anyone else who he trusts enough to take over his original falconry, because apparently some are a bit scared (usually of the goshawks and our rescue bird) and some aren't able to talk about the birds very well.

I know at some point I have to leave one of them and this could be it. I have to talk to Dirk about this on Sunday. I am scared shitless because I'm afraid of him thinking that it's because I'm unhappy at his falconry and that I don't like him. I don't want to think I'm abandoning him, and I am desperate not to abandon my kestrel and so I'm hoping to buy my kestrel off of him.

What should I do? Take Joe's job offer, or stay with Dirk, who taught me everything I've ever learned.",28May2020,1

They are also quick to bring up other culture in the sense that if a friend of hispanic or peruvian race or something is always late they will say it is because of their culture being like that. i don’t think that’s true i think that is individual based like which personality types are more stressed about time not their culture? my sister is always late too. there are plenty of other things like these where they will say something that might be like stereotypical not just ab race but they might say something about like oh that person didn’t grow up with a father they probably have these traits because of it. or things like that. just like generalizations or things they genuinely don’t know it will be offensive. i don’t know how to possibly express how these things aren’t right? they will probably think ‘oh it’s just bc she’s a liberal college student’ or something idk. i just don’t even know how to approach it or like what to say what should i do in these situations?",28May2020,1

I could tell  she felt a  little sad about it, but it's whatever. Anyway I worked  that weekend,  didn't really talk to her much and she asked me if I was  still  interested in seeing eachother. I told her yes I am just busy. I  didn't  talk to her at all that Sunday because I was working a 16 hour  shift.  She texted me asking me if I wanted to do something soon and  then around  9 pm she said she was sorry for whatever she may have done  and that she  doesn't understand. Well, I ignored it and texted her at  about 11:30 pm  that night and told her I was just clocking out and that  I didn't want  to date someone that was going to be like my ex. She was  super upset and  tried to apologize but I didn't care. She said she  felt like I was  ghosting her and that she was being annoying, and I  just ignored it.

Well  I ignored  her for two weeks and then starting snapping her again. I was  flirting,  yes, and after a few days of it she asked if I was interested  in  talking again and I told her I flirt with everyone and it's my   personality. She was sad and said okay, but then went quiet. I panicked   and snapped her and asked if she blocked me and she said no, she was   just confused and a little disappointed. I ended up flirting with her   more and it lead to her coming over my house to hook up. This happened   twice more. I talked to her everyday and she asked me if I wanted to   celebrate her birthday with her. I at first told her yes but then when   the day came, she was super excited to see me and I told her I didn't   know if I would come because I remembered a friend had set up a barbeque   that next day. I told her maybe, because I was super hungover from the   night before. I ended up driving to her apartment and we had a good  time  together. We had sex. I left that morning at 6 am and I could tell  she  was a little upset.

Anyway, I  have  snapchatted her everyday..She's in nursing school like I am and  she is  in the class ahead of mine. She asked how I was doing with  school and I  said I hated it and I haven't attended the past few  lectures, I don't  even know what's going on anymore. She offered to  send me her notes and I  said ""Eh if you want, I may just glance at it.""  She didn't respond  after that.

Well,  I went fishing  with  a girl I've been talking who's hot. I posted a  snapchat story  today and you could not see her but you could hear her  voice. The girl  who was my best friend on snapchat removed me. Why  would she do this,  and what do you think is going on in her head? Is  she jealous?

(Tl;dr:  girl I went  on a date with in March and hooking up with a few tiems  removed me from  snapchat because I had another girl in my snapchat story  today, I want  to know what she may have been thinking.)",28May2020,1
1066,"I’ve had feelings for a friend for awhile now and I don’t know how to tell him. I’m a 22 y/o gay man and I’ve had a crush on a guy for ~3 years. At first it was a small thing, because I just thought he was cute. Also, I thought he was straight but my “gaydar” always said otherwise. My friends wrote it off but I just had a gut feeling. After having classes with him for about a year, we started to hang out and become good friends. At the time, he had a girlfriend but I felt like our relationship was sometimes flirtatious (never inappropriately tho). After he broke up with his girlfriend he asked me to go to a concert with him but I couldn’t. Later that week I saw him on gay tinder and we matched!! Finally, my suspicions were confirmed. I asked to set up a date and he agreed, but after a week things went cold and he unmatched me. We remained close friends, but didn’t talk about the fact that we matched on tinder. Recently, I talked to him about my sexuality because it’s something we never discussed. I found out that he is bi and only recently began accepting his sexuality. Furthermore, his parents are very catholic so he is afraid to come out to them. I asked him if he had a crush on me after he was dating his girlfriend and he said he couldn’t remember. Lately we’ve been having a lot of heart to hearts and sharing personal secrets. He told me about an eating disorder he’s struggled with and how being bi has been difficult and I told him that I do drag. When I told him about the drag he was so supportive and interested. I have a gut feeling that he likes me and sometimes I feel he’s flirtatious, but I cannot tell if I’m just over analyzing. I don’t want to lose my friend of 2 years or have my feelings hurt but I also don’t want to keep this secret. What do I do?",28May2020,1
1067,"Aloha all!
Background: I [34F] live in a unit within a bigger house with my partner [30M]. We live in Hawaii, which is expensive for rent (highest rent to income ratio in the nation) and we have a great deal in a cute place with access to a yard. It's great for many reasons, but we have a few problems with the place. 

The problem: The house nextdoor is similar to ours in that it seems to be divided into multiple units. We have a large fence between us that blocks the view up through 7 feet. There are a group of males [est. ages: 30-45] that have lived there the entire 4 years we have been in our home. They are addicts. They definitely have drugs sold outside their home, often have people pacing around their yard or sleeping in cars in their driveway and use on average 3-4 times a week to the point that the following happens: they will yell obscenities and violent things ""I will f-cking kill you!"" "" Get the f-ck out"" ""shut the f-ck up"" for hours on end. I've heard them talking about awful and violent things they will do to people that cross them. They will blast really loud music that talks about rape and murder. They will play video games and scream and throw things (it sounds like), they will go outside and hit bamboo that hangs over out the fence onto our property and break glass on trees, etc. So much more but I think you get the point. Recently, I have been working from home (I'm fortunate enough to have a job that allows this). These men will yell obscenities and carry on while I'm on serious conference calls with people pretty high up in my job field or when I'm on the phone with clients. I've tried to close windows, etc. but it just isn't enough sometimes to block the noise. I'm also afraid because they must have noticed me home more and sometimes it seems they are yelling these obscenities directly at me while I'm talking on these conferences.

If we report them to police, which I have considered, the neighbors will know it was us who reported them, and I'm afraid things will get worse, and they might really start to target us. I've tried to tell our landlord who just says they will call the landlord of the house nextdoor ""again"" (seems like an ongoing problem). I've expressed my fear to my partner who is not frightened but really annoyed with them. He tells me it's annoying but that he doesn't think it's bad enough for us to move. Well, he isn't home all day. He works and does not come home until 8PM, after most of the neighbors' ranting is done and they are passed out. Without discussing my personal life too much, I have had extensive experience with drug addicts and have made helping people with addiction a part of my livelihood in the past and a good chunk of the field I studied for my MS degree. When drugs take over, violence can happen and the paranoia can make people act on delusions that can really put us in danger, especially if they are starting to target me when I'm home alone. I'm beyond worried and think it's time to move, but please let me know if you think I'm in the wrong here or if you have any advice on how to handle this problem that doesn't involve moving or police. Open to any suggestions RN.

Thx.",28May2020,1

For better understanding I’ll refer to them as “A” and “N”. For a few days now, N has been hanging out with another friend of hers, making A very jealous, claiming she doesn’t give A any attention. N still tries her best to be with her friend AND give A attention but he still isn’t happy. Granted, N has been neglecting him, ignoring him if he texts back too late or starting problems over the little things. Today, A decided to tell N that he feels like they’re acting like just friends, and N overreacts, asking if he’s saying that they are only friends now. A replies by saying that’s not what he meant but if that’s what she wants, then okay.

1071,"I need advice on how to start a money conversation without burning bridges. I am very shy and avoid confrontation at all costs. My husband and I bought a house last year, and not even a week after we closed, my mother-in-law brought up ""his"" student loan debt that she holds, saying that now that he has money, he should be paying this debt off. We ignored the comments at first, but she has started pushing. 

Now, this debt came as a surprise to both of us, since we are still paying off student loans that are in his name, and we thought this was all that he had. We have about 3 years left and have been paying extra each month to get them paid off as fast as possible. 

Turns out, MIL has about $30K in parent plus loans that have been deferred for 10 years. She claims that she has no idea how they got into her name, she never agreed to pay them, and that ""someone"" must have used her social security number to get them. In the same sentence, she admits that while my husband was doing a campus tour, his parents were given a student loan seminar and some paperwork to fill out. She says that since they were for husband's college, he should pay them.

We asked FIL about these loans (they're divorced), and he says he had some too, that they split them in the divorce, with each agreeing to pay them separately. FIL also says that they agreed to help pay for my husband's college, and these were the loans that did that. 

It may be selfish, but I don't want to pay these loans. We have a new home, we budgeted for this home, and just cannot afford an extra payment. We are trying to start a family. We have worked our butts off to pay down debt and get to where we are financially, and this will nuke our plans for the foreseeable future. This payment is not something either of us agreed to, and we didn't even know about it until last year. I would love to sit down and have a conversation about this, but I am afraid I will just cave if confronted. Any advice about how to start a conversation?",28May2020,1
1072,"So last year at our local fair I went on a ride and to understand this you should know I'm afraid of a lot of things, heights being one of them. At the time I didn't realize how high it would go. My friend was on it with me and he had to console through the whole thing. Another thing you should know is that this ride only has lap bars, and I'm a bigger person so when it went up my butt came up out of the seat. My hands were sweaty the entire time and when I finally got off my legs were shaking so much I thought I was just going to roll down the exit ramp. My mom is a constant speeder when driving and before this it didn't bother me. But now I have to hold my fear to myself because I ask her to slow down and she just laughs at me. It only bothers me when we're using back roads though, I'm fine on the freeway. Last night we were coming home from the dog park and we had to take the back roads to get home. She was doing 60 mph at one point and then 55 around a bend that said 40. I was mentally freaking out last night but I didn't say anything. Now a few minutes ago I said something and she replied with making a mockery of my mental freakout. When I say mental freakout I don't mean a meltdown with intensive sobbing just absolute terror and trying to take calming breaths. It didn't really work. She always says that she understands people with mental health and how a lot of people don't but then she just goes and jokes about my newfound terror. I don't know what to do can someone help me please?

1073,"So, i'm a mason. And my lodge is planning to re-open, even with Covid-19. My grandpa is the Master this year and it's his call (Not to get political, but he's the kind of person who views this whole thing as a hoax).

My state has had 300 new cases just today. But he thinks, because a few restaurants have let in small amounts of people, it's ok. ANd that the state is loosening restrictions.

This whole thing is really awful. Most of our members are elderly, and elderly folk are the most susceptible to Covid-19. I'm uninsured and diabetic, which is a double danger for me. But he's trying to force me into going.

Now, this whole thing seems like a, well, a death trap. There's very little space in this building. It's pretty close quarters, so social distancing is out of the question. We also have dinner together, out of the same pot. So, imagine, at least 7 people getting food and filling plates from the same pot, sitting in close quarters. A mask is also not gonna be required, neither are gloves. Since my dad and grandpa both believe it's a big hoax.

1076,"So long story. But it’s too long to explain
So basically my bestfriend got brainwashed by some girl we knew. She made me seem evil and criminal minded. My best friend believed idk how since I’ve always been there for her through anxiety , family problems, cancelling my plans and dates with my boyfriend, brushing off my anxiety as it was “stupid”. 
Anyways she believed it took revenge and exposed me to my friend (susie) we BOTH said shit about (Susie was controlling back then , however I owned up and felt terrible whole different story). However my best friend made it seem like I only did it. This also lead my friend Zee to stop talking to me. 

Fast forward 2020
Bestfriend apologises, crying , went to hospital and I forgave her. She also admitted to Susie we BOTH said instead of making it seem like I did only. 
Me and Zee kinda talked again as well. 
Although I owned up I still had yet to apologise to Susie properly. However I couldn’t get through her. Zee stopped talking to me again which confused me until I found it my bestfriend told her I said this one particular thing about her which I don’t remember !! This whole tome I thought Zee was mad at me for what I did to Susie ! This makes me feel shittier now. Although I don’t remember my bestfriend seemed legit when she said she remembers me saying! I remember there was one thing we BOTH said about Zee but not in a way Zee would get offended. However my best friend denied she said anything about Zee but admitted she did just as much as I did to Susie. 
This is confusing me. I’m trying to own up but it’s making it harder 

I’ve tried to get in contact with Zee but she isn’t getting my calls. I sent my bestfriend screen shots but she apparently forgot to send them for the past 4months ! She’s just verbally telling which makes Zee think I’m lying. This week my best friend wanted to call Zee to talk to me when I told her to just show her the screen shots and that’s it! Otherwise Zee will think I’m not making effort my self. She also gave Susie two missed calls even though Susie kinda cut her off as well. Although Zee got convinced to talk to me later that day Susie called my bestfriend with Zee and said that I’ve made no effort my self to talk to them but used my bestfriend to ask them! 
Even then she didn’t show the screenshots !!!
Zee has now unfollowed me!! I still wanna own up to Susie and Zee !! Especially Susie!! I worked on my self a lot this year but I have yet to seek forgiveness but this whole situation is making it harder! Back then it was hard as well because I was framed to be seen as “evil” even though it was just be being a extremely shit person! 

There’s a whole lot to this but it’s very very long to explain! So hopefully this isn’t too confusing",28May2020,1
1077,"It’s me again. I know I’ve posted on here about my fiancé 2 times before but I need to know that what I’m feeling is validated and I’m not insane.

My fiancé claims that one of her “love languages” is receiving gifts. Honestly I personally think it’s B.S. and that she should be content with me and the things I do for her. I’ve done things for her such as get her flowers, buy her dinners, Starbucks, etc. and she claims that all that is amazing but yet she still has this need to receive things I produce or else she feels under-appreciated and moody. She claims that when I tell her something, there apparently needs to be “action” behind it or else it just appears as pretty words. 

P.S. she also got mad at me last night because I was shocked at how one of her goals was a 10,000 dollar ring and that I said, “Well we need to get ourselves established and be actually able to afford that before we even think about buying it,” in a playful and fun manner thinking she would take it realistically. But nope, she got defensive and moody because she took it as me shooting down a goal of hers, which is in all honesty, kind of materialistic to me since I’m concerned with things such as a life for my children, and a good life for her, and the well being of us as people and not how much fancy things we have as a forefront of my mind. 

How do I approach this in conversation with her? She has been very sheltered her whole life and she has played a victim role to get what she wants until she met me and now that side of her is beginning to clash with normal logic of the real world.

1079,"Please let me know if I didn't properly post this in the right forum, but I figured people who might be familiar with having their stuff stoline would be able to help, since this isn't so much as waiting for my EDD card, but it got stolen. I've made reports to several EDD, Bank of America, and my local policie department. I'm asking a number of people what their opinions on this topic are, I think the more the better at the moment.  


Story: I live in condominium and rent the place out with my boyfriend. There is an HOA and it is gated, but I have come to believe a gated community makes no sense if your shit gets stolen anyway. Back to the point, some weeks ago, I believe mid April, the community mailboxes had been getting vandalized, I can't say the exact day, because I went to get mail every 3-4 days since I trusted the neighborhood's safety (a mistake obviously!). This was a little bit after the big news media outlets let everyone know millions of people applied for unemployment, and also that people were getting mailed stimulus checks, so I can imagine this isn't just happening to my community... most likely, there are lots of thefts happening. At the time I didn't really register it well, but did see photos of the mailboxes completely opened up, the latches broken.. etc. I would still periodically check and see the mailboxes, but finally called at the beginning of May the HOA's manager and she explained to me some people have been trying to break into the mailboxes. They haven't been able to track them down yet, but have spotted 3 people going by at night and have been continuously trying to get into resident mailboxes. By then, the postman has been keeping our mail at the post office. Probably too late.

I can see now that I shouldn't have been so passive and started inquiring about my card 4 weeks in. However, I had the idea that everyone was waiting a really long time for their card to come. My family and friends reassure me that even if someone took my card they would need my social security number and personal info. I looked online for information and did my best to be patient -- especially because it was really hard to contact the EDD office, I was also confused about what my account was showing me, it showed that I had money -- but because I did not have the debit card, I had no idea how to get that money to me. So because of lack of being able to contact an EDD worker, I felt really stuck; I'd never asked for state money before... so ultimately, I was clueless. I waited for my card since April, and finally decided to go online and request for a new card. It was difficult to get in touch with Bank of America lost/stolen/claim's number, so I opted to just have a new card mailed in. 

When I went to go get my mail at the post office, the card finally came in. I was so excited, and right away activated my card as soon as possible, only to find out the machine said I only had a $42 balance. I felt that wasn't right since my claim balance was much higher for several weeks now. I was in my car, so no computer, I called up the Bank of America EDD number and asked the rep what my transaction history was, she told me that my last purchase was on 5/17, the day before I asked for a new card sent. I explained the situation to her, and said no way, this is the first time I got this card, whoever made that purchase wasn't me! So she transferred me to the claim's department to file a report. I waited for 4 hours before I heard anyone make a connection (and of course it was while I was driving to a Bank of America branch). I made a report with them, they said to wait 10 days as they will be conducting an investigation and will give me a conclusion. After that I decided to make an online police report, and also reported fraud on EDD's online form because they won't accept phone calls. 

I got an email back today that my report didn't qualify for an online case and I needed to talk to a police officer. So I decided to call in, and I told everything to the officer, sent her a statement of the card's transaction history, and said I was going to think about if I wanted to put this person or people in jail.

I was asked ***what I wanted the outcome to be to prosecute or file a report--*** *so what I'm asking for advice on whether or not to prosecute or simply document the case report.* I want to know if this is the right step, has anyone gone this far? Suppose they find and catch the person, will I have to find a lawyer -- that is will I have to pay more money to see this through? I'm not exactly in a good financial position to really hire one, ultimately, I just want the money back and to clear my name.

I've never intentionally harmed another person in my life, I'm a huge pacifist, but having your stuff stolen.... sigh... that EDD money was something I really needed -- I've been digging into my savings, it was ideally for our wedding... My boyfriend and I have been trying to save up money to buy a house when all this blows over... but the prospect of settling down has never been further away. I've been looking for a job for a very long time; I just finally got one back in March, and they closed the office right about a week in but I had a call the end of April, they won't be keeping me on. I'm still trying to find work, I guess life just keeps on moving but really all this stolen stuff makes it hard to feel relief. They also managed to UI claims on my behalf, I'm actually unsure of how this happened. I stopped making UI claims after my first 2 weeks, because I was waiting for my card to come. I looked at the transaction history and my EDD account, I \*finally\* understand they posed as me somehow. I have turned on the option to only have my claims filed on my online account. I am quite worried they have a number of my personal addresses such as phone numbers and living places -- there was a purchase of $4.99 for a Google Whitepages, Inc, which meant they either looked me up, or looked up other victims -- can't say for sure.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Is it worth it to purse a prosecution?

TL;DR: Some vandals came and trashed our mailbox, my EDD debit card probably got stolen in the process, and I finally got a new card on May 27th, only to find out someone had used my first card and now I only have $42 in my UI balance claim. I filed a police report on the phone today and they asked me if I wanted to simply file a documentation, or to actually have them find and prosecute the person; I don't know what I should and would like some advice about pursuing prosecution, please.",28May2020,1

1082,"“He that lives upon hope will die fasting” - Benjamin Franklin

The thing I remember most of all was being hungry. Not just like a rumble in your belly type of thing - it felt as though there were some deep bottomless pit inside my body. Like a black hole crammed inside one of Grandma’s china tea cups. Steve had promised mum he’d take me for food straight after school but we’d stopped here first and I didn’t feel like I could remind him without it being awkward.

The lady behind the desk was always nice to me. I think she had children of her own because one time she had a colouring book but no crayons so I used the little blue pens and just did different shades. “We don’t usually have no children in here” she would say, “so you’re very lucky.” Today there was an older man that sometimes sat at the desk instead and he’d look at me the same way you look at a fly in a pint.

Most of them looked at me that way. There weren’t any other kids my age, or any kids at all for that matter, and I knew the regulars would rather I wasn’t there. I never really understood why until I got older and realised most of the men had families of their own, children of their own, and I reminded them of that. They came in here to escape everything, and then they saw me, young and innocent and dumb to it all, and those responsibilities would come flooding back. 

Maybe I reminded them of what they once were, and that made it all the more painful to come to terms with the person they are now. I always got the feeling that nobody wanted to be here, they were all just killing time and distracting each other until things changed. It was like a half-way house for people stuck in lives they didn’t want to be in.

Cigarette smoke filled the air in the centre of the room and never seemed to go away, fat enough that I wondered if I could go right up to it and carve my name into the side of the cloud as though it were the bark of a tree. When I first started coming here I didn’t like how it smelled and used to pull the top of my grey school jumper over my nose. But after a while you don’t notice it.

The right hand wall was full of televisions, all different shapes and sizes. Some of them were newer models that clung flat to the wall, but most were the older models, jutting out at different angles. Every television was either the dogs or the horses, and truth be told I remember it used to really piss me off that they didn’t put some cartoons on or something, for me. There must have been 20-odd TV sets there. I mostly sat and watched them anyway, but to make it more interesting I used to make guesses about who was going to win.

Sometimes I sat in the middle by the tables and drew pictures of my older brother, who I hadn’t seen since he went to live with dad. I used to draw pictures of him a lot because I didn’t want to forget what he looked like. One time I drew a picture of him in art class and I missed out the mole on the side of his head, and I was angry with myself for the longest time. 

I kept glancing at Steve, hoping he’d look at me and remember we were supposed to be getting food straight after school like Mum said. Perhaps he’d win something so then we could go home. It always felt like a gamble with him, either he’d come out of here in the best mood or he’d be so angry that every little thing you did would set him off. One time we were driving back and he told me to stop breathing weird. When I asked him what he meant he slapped me on the legs for talking back to him. Now when we drive home I try and hold my breath for as long as I can, like being underwater.

The only time the mood lifted was when Old George was there. He’d walk in and the place would burst into life; he had a confidence about him that demanded your attention. He’d always dress smartly in bright, bold colours. His blazer and pants were well pressed and fitted him to the inch, and in his left hand he held a polished black cane with a bright steel tip that he didn’t need for walking. I always wanted to tell someone that he reminded me of a peacock, but I couldn’t because mum didn’t know who it was and Steve wasn’t the sort of person that liked jokes. 

From time to time Old George would ask me to kiss his betting slips for luck. I thought it was silly so I’d just hold the paper to my face and pretend to kiss it but not actually do it, and he seemed satisfied with that. One time he landed a big win and gave me a pound, and I couldn’t believe it. I remember squeezing it tightly in my hand, buried deep in my pocket. 

“You’re lucky, you are” Old George would say, ruffling my hair. His voice was low and hard, and would crackle like a campsite fire when he got excited. He called me over to where he was sitting and told me that we should work together - I could sit on his knee and my luck would rub off on him, and he’d give me a pound for every race he won. 

I knew at the time there was something wrong with this, I felt like I was too old to sit on anyone’s knee any more, but there was something about the way he said it that made everything seem so reasonable. There was this calmness about him that you couldn’t help but let yourself get caught up in.

I was too big for Old George’s knee and kept falling off, so his arm slid around me and he gripped me, tight enough to be secure but not so much that it was uncomfortable. His hands were like leather wrapped in sticks. It didn’t take me long to notice that Old George wasn’t the same close up as he was far away. He didn’t smell like I’d expected him to. He had a stale, sweatiness about him that seemed to quietly leak out of him in a constant drip. His clothes, which looked so well put together from a distance, felt cheap to sit on. The fabric of his pants scratched my legs and made them feel itchy. Even the deep red of his shirt had stains and blotches.

Old George rubbed my leg until it was time for the next race, and I closed my eyes and thought about my brother, in as much detail as I could. 

Steve came over, and for a moment I thought he and Old George were going to have an argument, but he was only saying goodbye. He led me out of the shop and for a moment I thought I was the one in trouble, but by the time we got back to his car he hadn’t said anything. I felt my belly twitch.

“Can we go for food now?” I asked him. It was dark outside now and the night had a chill that pinched my skin all over. 

""Tomorrow. It’s too late now, but we’ll go tomorrow, first thing. Promise.""

I could tell he was lying by the way he barely looked at me.",28May2020,1
1083,"Hi, I'm posting this because I don't know what else to do about this.
My family has two senior dogs, both with minor heart problems; but there's this boy who lives around the corner, about 13 years old, and he loves to pass by our house and screech like a dying animal just to upset our dogs. The sound the boy makes is incredibly loud and it literally sounds like some animal is being tortured, and it really disturbs the dogs, making them run, bark and howl non stop for about 10 minutes every time, and the boy passes by the house and screeches about 6 times a day. It's really aggravating because he literally looks at our house when he does it and laughs when he sees the dogs get out of contol.
We've tried to train the dogs to ignore him, close the windows, we've even yelled at the boy; but nothing has worked so far. The dogs get super agitated and angry, even ignoring treats and toys and I'm worried that being so old and with their heart conditions they might get sick or have a seizure. My mom is thinking about going to his house and talking to his parents, because he never screeches when he passes by with them, but I don't know if that would change anything. I am out of ideas but I'm also really frustrated about my dogs being stressed and agitated all the time.
Does anyone know what else we could try? Are we being Karens? Please help!",28May2020,1
1084,"Hello,

I'm a young adult who graduated from college last year. I do not yet have a job. I'm soliciting advice here and there on Reddit about reversing my denouement. 

Basic story:

1. I was a model student in high school and had a perfect reputation. I was running a business, running clubs, doing internships, playing sports, networking, getting great grades and test scores, etc. Everyone expected me to succeed, especially me. I got into over a dozen colleges and attended a top 20 one. I was expecting to work in finance in New York, then start a multinational corporation.
2. When I came to college, everything that could go wrong did. Failing classes, disciplinary issues with the school, social conflicts, squandered internships, chronic lateness, etc. I developed a strong interest in a theoretical subject, which I changed my major to and started a club around. That probably saved me in the midst of everything and allowed me to finish my degree. But my GPA dropped a full point by graduation and I didn't earn too many good references or develop too many positive relationships with professors, despite the fact that I was continuously trying to self-analyze and maintain the same trajectory I was on.
3. Without a job offer and with a string of unexplained failures, after graduation I started trying to compensate for my newfound moral and executive function deficiencies with a variety of unregulated supplements. None of them worked, and I instead acquired a depersonalization/derealization that I wasn't able to get out of until recently. Now somehow it's been almost a year since graduation.
4. I laid out the whole story to a psychiatrist and began talking with him. Eventually, we got into my family history (my mom has schizophrenia) and discussed the minutiae of my phenomenology. He determined that he was almost certain that my schizophrenia genes switched on at age 18 and I entered the prodromal phase, acquiring a psychosis spectrum state comprised of paranoia, slight perceptual alterations, and negative symptoms that didn't meet the criteria for full-blown psychosis. This explanation unified every unexplained factor about my experience and, after considering dozens over the years including that, was sufficient for me. I won't take medication yet but I will keep it in the cabinet and take it if things deteriorate. I've put in place a variety of both personal and interpersonal checks and balances that will help me recognize and respond to delusions and hallucinations if they arise in the future.

Now I'm trying to move forward from here. I still want to make my dreams come true, even though I'm aware some people wouldn't want me around if they knew the deal. I can't live for them. My true dream is to be a professor in this theoretical subject, but if I can't do that I at least want to work at a think tank that's involved with it and later become an author or columnist. If I figure out my finances and secure some status for myself, I can probably be an author or freelance columnist full-time, which will be good if my condition worsens. But until age 30 or so, I don't think I can make a name for myself without embedding myself within credible institutions.

I want to get a master's degree in this subject at the very least, and also hold at least one resume-boosting job. But all my professors know me as the chronically-late person with a rolodex of vague excuses (which I made because I knew something was wrong with me but I couldn't settle on an explanation) and all my former bosses know me as the same. My GPA is not good despite the fact that, though I don't want to be arrogant, I think I have some very good ideas in this subject. I made a blog to share some of them and everyone who reads it gives me glowing feedback. I think I could make some valuable contributions in this area, but my executive and social dysfunction will no doubt hold me back for the rest of my life.

**TLDR:**

I've angered a lot of people so far and I don't have many allies, but I don't know how to explain what happened to admissions committees, future employers, and alienated past contacts without disclosing this condition and stigmatizing myself. What's the explanation I should use, if any? How do I go about rekindling relationships and cleaning up my life?",28May2020,1
1085,"It’s me again. I know I’ve posted on here about my fiancé 2 times before but I need to know that what I’m feeling is validated and I’m not insane.

My fiancé claims that one of her “love languages” is receiving gifts. Honestly I personally think it’s B.S. and that she should be content with me and the things I do for her. I’ve done things for her such as get her flowers, buy her dinners, Starbucks, etc. and she claims that all that is amazing but yet she still has this need to receive things I produce or else she feels under-appreciated and moody. She claims that when I tell her something, there apparently needs to be “action” behind it or else it just appears as pretty words. 

P.S. she also got mad at me last night because I was shocked at how one of her goals was a 10,000 dollar ring and that I said, “Well we need to get ourselves established and be actually able to afford that before we even think about buying it,” in a playful and fun manner thinking she would take it realistically. But nope, she got defensive and moody because she took it as me shooting down a goal of hers, which is in all honesty, kind of materialistic to me since I’m concerned with things such as a life for my children, and a good life for her, and the well being of us as people and not how much fancy things we have as a forefront of my mind. 

Also P.S. 
I told her I was going to try and have a birthday celebration for her with streamers and a cake and such. She comes into the house and I surprise her with the cake but I didn’t get the streamers because all I had in my bank was just enough for me to get lighters, cake, and some candles. She was upset later that night and told me that I forgot the streamers. I get upset, go to the living room, and she was mad that I wouldn’t eat the cake with her. She comes in to give me a hug without even apologizing and I’m not in the mood to hug because of obvious reasons. She still
holds that over my head to this day when we get into conversations about this side of her behavior.

How do I approach all of this in conversation with her? She has been very sheltered her whole life by very narcissistic , passive aggressive helicopter parents and didn’t understand what normal people outside of her family are like until she met me and now that side of her is beginning to clash with normal logic of the real world. 

Anything you guys say is greatly appreciated.",28May2020,1

At the beginning he seemed mature but as time went past he started being really annoying.


He’s always teasing me, making nasty comments or straight up being homophobic (I’m not even gay).
Having a conversation with him is impossible because he can’t go 5 minutes without being a dick.


I can’t quit because I’m planning on moving to another country soon and it’s the only place that is paying good money.


Can’t ghost him or report him because I work with him almost 9hr a day and the boss is his family.

1088,"Hey guys,
I know this might sound like a stupid temporary problem that I shouldn’t be stressing over too much, but I just can’t help it and feel like talking about it. So I just finished high school around a week ago meaning I’m starting college this fall. Anyway, for the majority of this last high school year I was very close to this girl I had met around 2 years ago. She became my closest female friend and one of my best friends. Unfortunately, I started having feelings for her around like 5 months ago and confessed like 2 months ago. She rejected me, but we were both okay we continuing being friends so we did that. Around a month ago she stopped talking to me as much as before and I’ve been initiating every conversation with her. She doesn’t act weird when I talk to her nor does she ignore me, but I’m upset because it seems like she doesn’t care about me anymore. Like before quarantine started she used to call me and text me almost everyday and we were super close. Now, she’s talking to other people more than to me and idk it just seems like I don’t matter to her anymore. And I’m pretty sure it’s not because of the whole rejection thing because she’s been friends in the past with guys that had feelings for her. Anyway, I know this might seem like a stupid problem to any adults or older people here on reddit, but I just really miss her a lot and feel sad because I miss talking to her. I know I probably miss her mostly because I still have feelings for her, but I miss our friendship too.",28May2020,1
1089,"Long Post. I'm looking for tips. I'm looking for a verdict. I'm looking for anything. I feel like I can't trust my own feelings anymore.

I began working in this place back in January of this year. To paint the picture, SMALL SMALL firm. No HR department, no benefits, no contract, no handbook, very informal interview and hiring process...but I was desperate for a job as I was low on $$ and bills starting to stack up. Financially...I was ready to take the first offer.

There was no real training. Training was effectively a talk-a-mile-a-minute speed run of a program I'm unfamiliar with. Invitation to ask questions whenever was always given **but** there are 3 responses to asking questions:

1. You straight up get left on ""read"" for days. If you follow up less than 3 days later, you'll get told to be patient. Or maybe your follow up is ignored as well. Usually the latter.
2. You get scolded. In front of the rest of your co-workers. And very loudly.
3. You get passed around. Usually by the time you get passed to worker C, work C is already referring you back to management. 

A month in, I was starting to get scared of asking questions. Management even told me to ""figure it out yourself"" It was either ""figure it out yourself"" or one of the above 3. 

I was given stern looks and scolded for asking ""big questions"" (it's usually 2-3 sentences long) or too many questions (You get this whether you ask a question daily OR one question every few days. Can't win). Eventually this even came home with me. I flinch or freeze up when asking friends or family simple questions (eg. ""Where's the remote"") because I'm basically anticipating a mental slap. 

2-3 months in I was ready to quit. But at this time, the Coronavirus was already taking down businesses all around. Eventually, all the aunties and uncles started to lose their jobs and it's down to us two (a cousin and me) who have a job. Any complaints or venting is met with anger for being ungrateful for having a job during a time of crisis. It's just. I don't know...if it's really good luck to still have a job if it's so mentally taxing.

Lately, I've been having more and more trouble with work and my job and having more questions than ever. I feel like, because I had no guidance early on, that everything I worked on via ""figure it out yourself!"" has finally come back to bite me. I'm having a lot of trouble keeping up and these last 3 weeks I feel like I'm just WAITING to get fired because I literally look SO incompetent with all my questions. I don't **mean** to appear like I need someone to hold my hand through a project, but I was never given instructions in the first place...I am currently working on a new project with a new system so I guess they aren't firing me anytime soon. Again, the training is barely there. Management ran through it so fast like they didn't need to breath or anything...And...already I was left on read with a small question.

Quarantine ends soon. At this point, without training and mostly guessing my way through procedures, I'm fearing returning to the office. I COULD start looking for a new job, even in this messed up economy, but I feel bad about leaving when they already started training me on something new. After all, if I really was ""just overly sensitive"" and it's not actually a toxic workplace, then I would be leaving a job for a reason that's more my fault than theirs...

**Side Note**: Turnover is about 6-7 people within 3 years? Is this bad? I have worked a relevant (to my career) job post graduating, but it was a no stress and clerk level data entry job. I've worked almost 5-6 years of part-time during schooling. But I've never paid attention to employee turnover so...I'm not sure.

**Side Note 2**: I DO try to work out questions first. I try everything (Google, Youtube, etc.) I try to look at past emails and examples. I pose questions after thinking long and hard about whether or not it's worth asking the question (ie. ""What if I don't ask? What are the consequences of not asking""). I don't just blindly ask questions.

**TLDR**

Small firm, no HR (management is ""HR""), training feels like somewhere between sink or swim and flash training. You are always told to ""ask questions so you don't mess up"" BUT asking questions results in negative reaction (ignored/scolded/passed off to another employee). Lately, it feels like all of the moments where I felt lost, but winged it due to no...help or negative reaction to asking for help, has finally come back to haunt me and now I have a huge pile of questions.

Management terrifies me to the point where I get scared to talk to them about anything. I'm so terrified that I've been dry heaving each workday morning, no fail and like clockwork at 8am, for 3-4 months. I once had a shift where I had 3 panic attacks.

I feel like I'm losing my mind and I'm just sensitive. Every family member has told me I'm too weak, too sensitive, and ""when I was your age MY bosses would \[insert something mean here\] to me."" I can't even complain to anyone anymore because I know they'll say ""You're being sensitive."" Verdict? Tips?!?",28May2020,1

1092,"I tried to look for articles on websites like mumsnet and such but I cannot find anything about separation anxiety that aren’t for very young children.

My 16 year old daughter has what I can best describe as separation anxiety with us (me and my husband- who is her father)

She can’t stay in her room for too long as she gets very antsy and has to come downstairs to check we are still there and still alive.

She even comes into our room sometimes at night to check we haven’t died in our sleep and are still there. 

I haven’t had this with my four prior children and I’m unsure on what to do.

I know she has anxiety but I’m unsure on if this is a result of that or something different or what I can even do to sort this out. A part of me thinks it is due to our age as she is 16 and my husband and I recently turned 60 which she worries about too.

Does anyone know what we can do about this? Or know of other situations like this?

1094,"Hey everyone, so I’m new here and I’ve been needing some advice. My fiancé and I have been together for nearly 7 years. We had a rough start to our relationship. To make my background short, I was in a previous relationship, mentally and physically abusive. This guy gave me and STD along that as well, which I knew we were done for.After he began messaging me and I felt (at the time being weak minded) obligates to message back to keep him at bay( he was legitimately a terrifying person). Mind you I NEVER saw him in person, never engaged in anything physical, as he was my ex. Later this guy blackmails my relationship with my fiancé so without getting the chance to explain everything why he was still messaging me and why I felt the need to reciprocate the messages. He ended things. But came back maybe a couple days later begging to have me back. In which he vaguely explained that he was at a friends and was drinking and was making out with someone and realized he wanted me back the next morning. I told him it was okay and we continued our relationship. Well as of yesterday, this somehow kinda came up again and he revealed that they actually had sex. Which he never disclosed after all these years. I feel like he found out my value once he was with someone else and he easily ran to someone else, blaming the alcohol. I remembered too that I was retested per CDC recommendation after my initial infection,and I had tested positive again. And I’m positive my fiancé had given it to me again.. It makes me feel furious and quite stupid. I’m not sure what to do cause this was 7 years ago, why would it matter now? But this was still in a way amidst our current relationship even though we were technically “split”. It somewhat feels like cheating. What do I do? Are these feeling valid even after all these years?

1095,"Ever since i was 5,i was bullied as an outcast for my anger, and i never really went out anywhere.

1096,"So, here's a story no one asked for: I was at work today when a small female kitty came in after a customer- he said she followed her in. She's a *very* small cat, probably not much older than a year. This just became clearer seeing as she's a bit rough when playing.

Thing is, she came into the shop and wouldn't leave, so we (as in, my uncles and I) had two choices when it came to her. One, leave her on the shop- with the shop's cat, who's quite territorial apparently and had it out for her- or two, I could bring her home at least for the time being. I got my mom's permission and went with the second option.

However, I'm not very clear on how to go from here. So far, the first steps I've taken were to bring her home, try to introduce her to my dog (a playful adult poodle a bit bigger than her) which didn't go so well, since she was still a bit on edge, and she threw her claws out (I'm guessing she was just threatening my dog, hopefully); getting some cat sand and food for at least a couple days until replenishing; applying some anti-flea powder (or whatever it's called) and  brushing the dirt off of her as best as I could, since I don't think it'd be a good idea to give her an actual bath until she's calmed down a bit. 

I think it's clear that I need a bit of help with getting her used to the house, and specially with my dog- at least until the owner pops up. So far, she's calmer now that she's in my room and when I'm around, but I don't like the idea of keeping her locked in here just so she won't get scared by, or even worse hurt, my dog.
 
If it comes down to it, I will of course  give her back to her original owners if they show up- I'll be on the lookout for them as best I can- or in the worst case scenario, find her a new house where she can be at ease.  For now, I could use some advice on how to solve the aformentioned problem (including, but not limited to, how long to wait until giving her a bath) and how to take care of a young cat in general.",28May2020,1
1097,"I'm a grad student working from home for the summer, staying at my boyfriend's. Both, my boyfriend and his roommate, have work during the day. I was home yesterday when I heard knocking on my door (that I didn't respond to in time), followed by knocking on the neighbor's door. When I looked through the peephole, I saw a man breaking into my neighbor's apartment with a crowbar. He had a full set of tools and was wearing gloves. The entire time I was frozen and scared shitless, watching the peephole, hoping he wouldn't try my door next. I did call the cops but he had left with electronics from their apartment by then. I should point out that the neighbors' place had some mail hanging from the door for two weeks now, which makes me think this was a targeted burglary.


My boyfriend and I have bought and installed door armor reinforcements to reinforce the deadbolt plates and the jamb. We also have a security bar that sits under the door handle at an angle that I will be using when I am home alone.

Her fiancé’s mother literally just beat breast cancer and my dad has asthma and diabetes so I cannot get sick for their safety. I’ve been very careful about where I go and who I contact. 

The state opened back up last week and we’ve been at work ever since. I do assembly work with ~10-15 people. We have been sanitizing handles and equipment every day, we wear masks, they take our temperature, we stay 6ft apart and they put up plexiglass barriers between work stations. We got the news today that our receptionist that works on the upper level was exposed to someone that was tested positive for covid-19. I saw her briefly yesterday to hand her something but she is working from home starting today. She also was limiting contact with assembly these last few days and even used a different entrance door.

I told my family the situation and my mom and sister think I need to stay home. My sister was furious that I even decided to finish the work day. She says I need to stay home for her mother-in-law and our dad’s safety. I understand that she’s on edge and this is serious but I think she might be overreacting. My husband has been very anxious and scared for months and me being at work is causing him more anxiety. He even made me shower and wash my clothes after work but he said that it is up to me whether or not I want to go to work.

1102,"To start things off, I've never been the person to collect her thoughts well, always mislooking and misjudging because of how my brain never seems to give me clear links between stuff. When I talk about things for a prolonged period, I lose my sense of direction, and forget what I'm talking about, or talk about unrelated stuff even if my intention is good. Now, to put it in perspective, today while I was having a conversation with my sister and aunt about how most men can be dangerous in the outside world (i was pro and they were against), I was trying to prove my point by telling them that most rapes are by men (which i researched) and one out of three women are sexually harassed in their life (which I also researched). So my point only was that most men are dangerous and I could never excuse those criminal men for harassing women. My aunt and my sister had a different opinion, they thought that only a handful of men do these things and not most men are dangerous (note that I live in a country where women's rights are not that great and harassment is excused a lot, so I do have a point in being angry at how men exploit this issue). My sister (who you can say is like me in her principles and unlike my aunt) sided with my aunt saying that I'm not making sense and that I'm contradicting myself and if I have an issue with men i shouldn't have any male friends (which I do and trust a lot). Here comes the important part, they both attacked me saying that I don't know how to argue and that they won't listen to me become I'm contradictory and not making sense. This really made my blood boil because in my mind this makes perfect sense but I don't know how to get my point across. It makes me so angry that every time I argue with people about anything I'm always the one that's in the wrong although I firmly believe I'm fighting for the right cause. I don't think I've ever gotten into an argument where I wasn't ridiculed or called dumb or narrow minded or short sighted but I know I'm in the right. I do get mad a lot when the person in front of me says something unfair which leads to me being targeted and my opinion being invalidated.

Here's a bunch of arguments I've made in the past month where I was pointed out to be the 'dumb' girl that was getting her opinions from the internet:

* A girl was shot because she converted to Christianity by her father (they thought it was okay but I didn't)
* A person can wear/ believe in whatever they want without being ridiculed
* A person who acknowledges that their religious figure thousands of years ago was a pedophile and thought it was okay to still praise him as a man because child marriage was okay back then and his 9 year old wife was 'probably not traumatized'
* I study a particular course in university which I don't really like but don't want to disappoint my family/ don't have a plan B to switch so I was once again ridiculed while making my point that I don't like my course at all and was being a drama queen and that I should't say I want to switch courses because it's a 'cry for attention'

I know that all these things seem straight forward and you can tell who's right ad who's wrong, but I am ALWAYS ridiculed, everyone takes a stance against me, I am called narrow sighted and dumb. It's driving me insane I seriously can't take this. Every time I voice my opinion it's invalidated and I ALWAYS come out as the wrong person and no one takes any value to what I say. What do I do to change that? My self esteem just gets lower every time and I need a different opinion :(",28May2020,1
1103,"Beforehand, I'm totally aware what I've been doing is incredibly unhealthy. I'm working on it. Partially the reason I'm here asking for advice on this topic. Dealing with a complex home situation and various mental health problems has caused a relapse in some more fun mental disorders. But, I'm also on the fence of going into a hospital right now because I live in the U.S. and my state is filled with red neck idiots who are passing the virus to everybody...

About two months ago or so I relapsed into some disordered eating patterns. I'll either go the entire day on nothing or maybe eat roughly 300-750cals max here and there. I try to stay hydrated, but I don't do a great job of it due to not being able to always afford water. (Our tap water is cloudy, okay? I drink it as little as possible.)

The last couple weeks or so I haven't been able to really consume anything without feeling immediately nauseous where I have to take some sort of medicine to prevent me from puking, or just straight throwing it up. This includes water, gatorade, and 50/50 on fizzy drinks (sometimes they help). This prevents me from eating more than what I do, even when I want to. I feel dizzy often, I have headaches nearly everyday. I haven't had any fainting or blackout spells although I have come really close to it a few times, however I am on a blood pressure medication that is unrelated to blood pressure and this is a side effect. At what point do I need to consider hospitalization for this? Or if anyone might have some suggestions on what I can do to help prevent feeling sickly after eating/drinking? Thank you for any help, I greatly appreciate it.",28May2020,1

1106,"I started seeing a therapist last year for weekly appointments. Before the first appointment, I had asked my insurance if it would be covered, they said yes. At my appointments, I repeatedly checked with my therapist that everything with insurance was going ok. She had some trouble filing at first, but then said everything was ok. I would always do a $10 copay.

Now a couple weeks after my last appointment, I received two giant envelopes in the mail of Explanation of Benefits, all with a ""You May Owe"" line that ranges from $25-50. All total it's around $600. 

What do I do? Contact my therapist and see if I owe her? Contact my (notoriously hard to deal with) insurance provider? Wait until someone contacts me with an actual bill?

1108,"Hello,

I know this is a touchy topic and I want to stress I do not mean to offend and I know my thinking is flawed, but I need help trying to get my mind straight and was wondering how to best process this in a healthy way cause it's not working for me.

I am Asian and my parents are immigrants from another country and don't speak English that well. We don't make much and they work very hard to provide for my family- I never saw them much growing up, but I know it's because they are always working. In December, my dad was working at the cash register and was a victim of a robbery. An African American man came in with a gun and demanded he give him the money in the register and some of the merchandise behind the counter. My dad complied, but afterwards the robber hit him twice in the head with the gun handle and ran. My dad ended up needing stitches in the front and back of his head from where he was hit and fell, and the owner said he provided the video footage to the police after filing the report, but we still have not heard of any updates on whether or not they were still looking for the perpetrator or if he was caught. My dad took time off and decided to quit and we were trying to have him rest until he was ready to work again, but the whole COVID thing happened and it has been a cause of a lot of stress.

I feel apprehensive around black people now. When I pass them and they're talking loud or acting up with each other, I can't help but have the first thought go to picturing/questioning if one of them was the person who hit my dad. I saw the recent footage of the people looting the Target, and my first thought was just becoming so angry at them while then processing that they're feeling upset as well. I know there are trashy people of all races, and there are good people and that I shouldn't judge a whole race based on the actions of a few. I know that they have experienced hardships different from those that I have experienced even if my family has experienced people being rude to us for our accent or skin color as well. I never had this problem before this event and thought that I got along with everyone equally. But after this event I just hate how recently I can't help but think the worst of them or jump to conclusions without knowing them and I want to know if there was any advice people had dealing with something similar. I just feel logically I can reason with myself how my train of thinking is wrong, but emotionally I can't help myself but distrust and be angry at them as a whole.",28May2020,1

However when I think of it I have never done anything with a boy but I kinda want to have experience with that so I know if I actually like boys too but I don’t know if that’s what I want or if I’d actually do it.

I(26F) met a 10 years older guy in my workplace in a small town when we lived. He is a lonely father of teenage girl. At work all his behavior indicaded that he is interested in me but he is kinda shy and we only had a few small talks. I was moving (1 hour away) and on the last day of my work i gave him my email with note that i  like him and want to get to know him better. He is sexualy attracted to me and intriguing because he was persistent in deep eye contact and he seems to be different than other guys. He wrote me back I visited him and he took me to a hike to the woods. We spent great time, we both introverts, artistic souls and have similar interests. We didn’t kissed though i wanted that and i feel he wanted that too. We decide to meet again, he told me that he wanted to invite me to his house but is messy there today, so next time. Unfortunately he doesnt have a car to even meet me halfway. After our meeting he wrote me that he is looking forward to hang out with me again. We decided to contact only through email and he usually answer after 2 days. We are busy at work so it’s working for him and for me too. I answered that we can hang out again on Thursday (one week after 1 meeting) because this is only one his day off. He answered that he would like that but we didn’t set up any hour and place. I wrote him day before but he didn’t answer and Stupid inpatient me decided to drive there anyway. I wanted to meet with my female friend as well to do not waste time there in case he wont check the email. When i was in town i wrote him that i will be in the same place and time like one week ago and if he doesn’t check the email i’m going to meet that girl and will be in town until evening if he wants to hang out. He didn’t showed up and while i was with her he apologized and wrote that sth came  up and he doesn’t know when he finish but he will stay in touch. I was pretty sad but i understand when someone is busy.I probaby was to pushy.  2 days after that i wrote that this it’s fine because we didn’t set up any certain hour and i wanted to meet with my friend anyway. It’s been a week of silence. I don’t know if i did sth wrong and he don’t want to spend time with me anymore or if its push/pull stupid game or if i was too inpatient. I don’t know if i suppose to wait more to do not send double message or just write something. Please tell me what do you think about the situation, my or his behavior.

I told him I wanted a divorce because of this and he admitted that three years ago he cheated on me and he apologized so I decided to give it another try but I just do not want to have sex. For me there has to be love/trust and I just dont feel loved by him and I cant trust him anymore so I find it hard to want to have sex. He wakes me up every morning around 6am to have sex or give him oral. This morning he woke up upset because he had a dream I denied him sex. This made me feel bad so about 30 minutes later I asked if he wanted to have sex before we left to work and he told me he would rather jack off than have sex with me. It really hurt my feelings. I get where hes coming from, of course he wants sex with his wife but I literally have no sex drive due to depression and his treatment to me. Do I try harder? I honestly just wait for it to be over the whole time. I even tell him no sometimes but he has sex with me anyway.

1116,"I had a message from an old friend asking if I had ideas to pitch to a company he has just signed up to as a freelancer. They are a production company looking for show ideas and pay commission if an idea is chosen.

My friend said if any ideas I came up with were chosen he'd share the commission. So I came up with an idea which he sent off with some if his own and the feedback was that my idea was ""by far the favourite"" and my friend asked me to expand on it for them. So I spent a bit of time doing this and sent it over to him to pass on. 

 I said to him it seemed like a fun way to make some potential money and did they have any more positions available. He replied saying ""I've already sent you the brief"" which I took to mean he wished the dynamic to stay this way.

However I decided to send them an email just to ask about what they require and if they are in need of further ideas and putting myself forward as a candidate. The reply was positive and a call has been set up but I haven't told my friend yet. I have this feeling he won't be too happy about it but don't know if that will be the case or not.

I can't figure out if it is immoral to directly pitch my ideas to the company rather than give them to him to pass on as his own. I think it's seems a little pointless to not be able to have my name to the ideas when it could potentially look good for me on a CV or for future prospects. On the other hand I don't want to upset my friend or jepordise our  relationship. If I go ahead with it I am going to tell him but figured I would wait until after the call (as it may be fruitless anyway) and if things were to work out and my ideas were commissioned then I could reversely split the commission with him for alerting me to the opportunity.

So should I continue to talk the company with the idea of working for them myself even though my friend has only just started with them and has asked me to give him ideas or should I just continue to pass on my thoughts and concepts to him to use as his own in the hope I get a split of the commission?

Is it screwing him over or going behind his back if I go ahead with the interview and tell him after if they are wanting me to work with them?",28May2020,1
1117,"So I don't know where to post this because it's kind of a ""risky post"" and the relationship subs are pretty judgmental. If it's not ok for this sub, I understand and I apologize. 

I'm a 28 year old mother and currently separated from my 38 year old husband. Everything has been civil so far as we are just figuring out how to move forward as painlessly as possible for our child. I'm not the most experienced for my age because I married so young so I had no flirting or dating opportunities. 

My best girl friend and I have been getting closer and hanging out more lately (before the pandemic) and I was just recently a bridesmaid in her wedding. My husband did not attend, of course, so I was walked by some random guy. One of the groomsmen was my friend's little brother who is 23 and I've known him since he was a little boy. I had made a lot of new connections that day and added some of the bridesmaids on Facebook and then noticed I had a new request from my friend's brother. We had reconnected a bit during the reception and after some alcohol, we were exchanging some witty humor back and forth, but, nothing flirtatious. He's well aware that I'm married and have a child, not to mention, I naturally assumed he was with the tall, pretty girl who had arrived with him. 

A few days later, I'm with my girl friend again and she's talking about the wedding and pretty oddly...she inserts the fact that her little brother was surprised to see me after so long...then goes on to mention that he's not seeing that girl he showed up with. I found it weird to bring up because I hadn't asked. But, I dismissed it. So, fast forward, a few days into accepting his friend request, he's liking pretty much every single picture of me...like just me or my baby, skipping right over anything involving my husband. My curiosity is sparked. But, nothing else happens. 

A few months go by and I end up needing to clear my head with everything going on and I delete my Facebook. I log back into my old Instagram account and start adding my closest friends so we can stay in touch. I added my girlfriend of course and then her brother popped up as a suggestion so I added him too. He was the first one to follow me back, although he didn't seem very active on the app. Well, over the next few days, I notice he's the first to watch all of my stories, basically the second I upload them and he also liked all my newest posts. No big deal, really, but, it's surprising because he follows like 800 people. Then I get a notification saying he liked a pic from 3 months back...it was a nice picture where I was truly happy and smiling, but, I can't say it was super modest. The notification disappeared as did the like pretty quickly, so I figured it was a slip and he got embarrassed. After a few days though, he ends up re-liking that picture as well as a few other older ones. I decided to do the same and give him a few likes as well. 

Nothing else happens until my birthday a few weeks ago, where I posted a photo of my quarantine solo birthday party. Well, he liked the photo and then messaged me that he hoped I had a great birthday. I replied back and we ended up having a nice, casual conversation about growing gardens and such. Again, nothing flirty happens. A week goes by and I post a picture where I'm dressed up to ""virtually celebrate"" my cousin's graduation. He likes it and then likes a few more older pictures. I did the same and gave him a few more likes.

I'm inexperienced as hell and have no idea how to read this situation. What are the odds that he really likes me ""like that?"" Is he waiting for me to make some sort of move? 

TL;DR: I'm married, but, separated. friend's brother reached out to me online, is liking all my pics and IG ""stalking me"" but not saying much. Does this mean he's interested?",28May2020,1

I suppose I just need someone to listen and offer any miracle advice as to how to stop feeling so hurt and victimised? I hate feeling this way. 
My life has been a bit of a mess, my family has lots of mental illness, my dad was schizophrenic/bipolar my older sister suffers from severe depression and DID. 
My younger sister doesn’t have a mum (she left when she was 6) so I’ve helped my dad raise her. My dad passed away in January due to a stroke and 2 weeks later me and my boyfriend broke up (we were together for 3.5 years and honestly had a great relationship). I myself have been suffering from depression for the past year and it’s ruined my life, I blame it for the break down of my relationship because I just couldn’t do anything anymore and felt like I was ruining my ex’s life. He now hasn’t spoken to me in nearly 4 months. I hate life right now, my mum downsized houses when I moved in with my boyfriend and now I’ve had to come back home and I’m sleeping on a couch because I have no where else to go, my younger sister is sleeping on an air mattress on the floor because she also has nowhere to go (she’s off to uni in September). My issue at the moment is I just feel really shit on in life, my dad was a poor man so I’ve had to find the money for his funeral and there’s £1400 left to pay and the government won’t help because I work full time (I have lots of debt). My 16 year old cat is slowly deteriorating in front of me, I had 4 cats growing up and she’s the last one now, the other 3 passed away last year. I have 4 best friends and they all have rich parents, the last one of my friends has now just got a mortgage with her boyfriend, all 4 of my friends parents have helped them get mortgages. I just feel really left behind in life I’m nearly 25 years old and I’m usually a very positive person but this year has nearly killed me. I just don’t know what to do anymore, one minutes I feel fine and then the next I just don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t know how to fix any of this, I’m currently waiting to go to therapy but there’s a long waiting list. I just feel like this year has been A LOT and I don’t know how to cope with it.

1123,"I mean it’s pretty self-explanatory. One friend I’m much closer to and is pretty bad at texting in general. I hate that whole “YoU CaN MaKe TiMe To TeXt BaCk” shit because it’s dumb, but in recent months we barely text each other at all, and a lot of the time it’s me initiating. We were each others’ first friend in college so we’ve been close for almost three years, and we’ve both shared secrets we don’t really share with other people.

The other friend is more of a “friend”. She can be pretty critical and can give backhanded compliments and I usually feel anxious around her because she shows a lot of qualities with ease that I’ve had a lot of trouble grasping. She’s incredibly talented and knows she is, and I’m getting better at what I do but I’m just too emotional and clumsy to really be on her league to be a close friend. It seems more like she’s my friend because I’ve been friends with her bf for a good while.

She’s really cool and the two of them are great together and I’m happy for them, but part of me just isn’t comfortable with it. Idk if it’s just jealousy that they get to spend time together and the guy never seems to want to talk to me anymore, or if it’s insecurity because they’re both incredibly talented and they seem healthy and I’ve never been able to have a healthy relationship in my life. Honestly it could be anxiety that she may be putting me down behind my back to my friend.

I don’t really know what to do. My sister says it’s normal for couples within a friend group to isolate for a few months and not really talk to anyone, but it still feels like I’m left in the dust, and I hate that I feel this way because I feel like I’m being selfish when I should be happy.

My classmate (19|F) doesn't give a shit about school. She is rich but she has to pass her A-Level exams. If not, her father won't be happy. We are really good friends(I think). I helped her alot to prepare for her A-Level exams.. I spent like two weeks just going out with her everyday to make sure that she can pass these exams. I even helped her cheat in her maths exam.. She went to the toilet and sent me pictures of the exam, I did it for her and sent her the answers. There were time gaps between the exams and during that time she didn't give a shit about me. She would send a message just to make sure that I am going to help her with the next exam. I was happy with it.. I am not religious but I think that life is going to send me someone who helps me when I need help because I did help someone.. someday..
I have depression.. I started to think that she only messages me when she needs me..
Today I was with her preparing her for her biology exam and she posted a picture on instagram while I was with her in her car. I commented on the picture and her boyfriend sent her a text message saying ""how the fuck can you let a refugee comment on your picture?"" .. I was really hurt inside.. I tried to ignore it and laughed about it.. so I told her ""I am gonna comment one more time, what is he gonna do about it?"" She laughed and said ""you are fucking awesome"" and I did it.. I commented one more time. She drove me back home because she had to meet her bf. On the way back home I was trying to repeat what we learnt together and she was ignoring me.. she was texting and driving.. like I wasn't there..
When I came back home, I noticed that she deleted my comments.. I was so fucking hurt..

I don't know what to do.. I don't know if I am being used.. Or am I just being selfish?

1126,"Hello, I don't know how to start these, so I'll just get straight to the point. It is very difficult for me to get a fully erect penis. I can maintain a semi erect penis for a long time, but not fully erect. I recently discovered this about a week ago when I was watching adult films. I couldn't get fully erect even though the previous day before that week I was fully erect. I have been thinking it may be a form of erectile dysfunction  due to the fact that I don't get erect when I see a naked woman or something erotic. Previously when I had watched adult content my penis would get fully erect and I would be excited to be feasting upon the glorious woman before me and also in public when I saw a gorgeous woman my penis would get erect, but now it's very different. I don't often get erect when I see females nor males genitalia and when i watch adult content it usually doesn't invigorate as much as it used too. I'm thinking the main cause for this is because I masturbate too frequently and I am overweight. 
I am going to begin exercising, living healthy and stop masturbating to try and fix the condition. Any tips, advice, schedules To help stay healthy and what to do if im horny or anything like that would help a lot.

The reason I gave the age of 14 was because that was the last time I saw her, since she had to move down South for a new work opportunity that her father got, but we had known each other and probably been best friends ever since our very first day of preschool, since we both lived in the same town, until she moved. I kick myself every time I think about her, and after she moved away we kind of just disappeared from each other's life, unfortunately.

Now, though, four years after she left, I'm still kicking myself for not realizing our potential. I partially forgive myself, because neither of us were really ready for a relationship, despite how young most people get into a relationship, but I still regret never recognizing it. At this point in my life now, I have never been in a relationship, and with regards to a relationship I feel lost. I don't feel lost in general, but I don't know what to do with regards to finding a relationship. In other words, my life is pretty good, I'm working, I'm getting an education, I have a good family, and we can put food onto the table, so it's not like I feel like a loser without a partner nor that I'm desperate nor that I can't be happy on my own, it's just that I want to find someone to share my life, my happiness, my love, and my hobbies/interests with. But I don't know where to look. I don't know how to find a girl who likes the outdoors and loves to do dirty work, and part of that is because neither of those two things are really that social. I live in Connecticut and plan to go to school in Maine, so I think that makes it even harder, because most people would recommend going down South or the Midwest, but neither of those are very practical options, and I'm not looking to uproot my whole entire life, in that sense anyway, in order to find a romantic relationship, unless that proves to be completely necessary, but even then I'd have a hard time unless there was something promising, if that makes sense.

I would love any and all good advice you can give me, so thank you very, very much.

Tl;dr: A few years ago, I (18m) met a girl who was perfect for me, she loved fishing, hunting, trucks, cattle, and construction, but at the time I was 14 and she was 16, and I wasn’t into girls. Now that I'm older, though, how can I find another girl like me?",28May2020,1
1128,"Hello, 

So I’m pretty new to skating. I’ve decided I want a longboard because it seems pretty chill to cruise around but I would also like to do basic tricks. 
I’ve also heard a longboard is great for beginners as they are easier to manage and offer a smoother ride. 

Thing is I’m pretty short - 5’1 - and I’m worried some longboards will be too big to control effectively 
So what size longboard do you recommend I get? 

Thank you",28May2020,1
